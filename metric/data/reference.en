Croatia hopes to become a member of the Alliance in 2009, while also concluding talks with Brussels.
Joining NATO is not expected to present any special difficulties -- Alliance member states are already in the process of ratifying the basic documentation.
Italy did so in 2008, and as of now 15 out of the 26 NATO members have done their part of the job.
The path to EU accession, however, is a thornier one.
Neighbouring Slovenia has put up a roadblock, citing ongoing bilateral disputes -- in particular, the quarrel over Piran Bay.
All candidate nations must complete negotiations on 35 EU policy chapters prior to membership, but Slovenia has blocked opening 11 of them.
EU leaders, such as Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, have gone out of their way to make it clear there is room for Croatia in the bloc, while also making it clear they want the bilateral dispute settled.
The next Croatia-EU Conference will take place at the end of February.
The Czech Republic -- traditionally a close ally of Zagreb -- has taken over the EU presidency.
Croatian officials are positive that their Czech counterparts will make every effort possible to put Croatian membership high on the Union's agenda.

"2009 will show the concrete results of the international position of Croatia, not only through our membership in UN's Security Council, NATO membership and Roadmap for ending the negotiations with the EU by the end of the year but through our commitment to fulfill all the democratic standards, showing that we are ready to implement the standards of the rule of law, social justice and solidarity," Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said in his New Year's speech.
By becoming a NATO and EU member, Croatia will fulfill an historic dream that was set into motion almost two decades ago, he added.
Croatian President Stipe Mesic also spoke about the expectations for 2009, though his tone was markedly gloomier.
"In a time marked by such a serious crisis politics needs to be more serious than ever," he said.
"This means that sundry personal interests and pressures to delay hard but unavoidable reforms in order to win a few votes more at the elections must not be allowed to prevail over the general interest of all our citizens.
Therefore, responsibility must be the word of the year in 2009."
Some companies, including powerful banks and financial institutions, started off the year by warning of job cutbacks.
Croatians in general have a high level of worry about financial instability, unemployment and the possibility of a slump in summer tourism, something which would only compound economic woes.
Shopping malls must remain closed on Sunday, according to a new law. [File]
In his address, Mesic stressed the need to keep in mind the social dimension. "How to respond to the crisis now, after having failed to prepare better for it?
First of all, by not turning a blind eye to it.
Followed by two more ways: we need to defend ourselves from outside shocks while concurrently dealing with all inside sources of crisis.
In a few words, we must seriously and urgently create the conditions for the recovery of industry, production and exports," Mesic said.
The government has already taken one key step to shore up consumer confidence.
A plan by banks to raise interest rates has been squashed, with Sanader warning financial institutions of serious consequences if they go ahead.
Zagrebacka Banka had announced In late December that they would raise their interest rates by between 0.5 and 1.7%.
However, after consultations with the government, the bank scrapped the plan.
The beginning of 2009 also brought some practical changes to the everyday lives of Croatians.
According to the revised Law on Commerce -- which went into effect on January 1st -- all stores must remain closed on Sundays. The exceptions are bakeries, gas stations and smaller shops at major bus and train terminals or airports.
During the tourist summer season, stores will be allowed to open on Sundays again.
The new rule was met with distain from shopkeepers and merchants. They say that the new law will adversely affect the economy at a time when the public should be stimulated to spend more money.

A review of business and economic news from the Balkans since 16 April:
Croatia signed Protocol 7 of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU on 16 April.
Prime Minister Ivo Sanader expressed satisfaction with the outcome, saying that none of the import quotas had been raised and some had been lowered.
Romania's GDP grew by 5.1 per cent during the first quarter of this year, according to preliminary data released by the finance ministry on 19 April.
Exports rose by 25 per cent year-on-year during the first three months, and foreign direct investments also grew significantly.
Bosnia and Herzegovina's Central Bank announced on 19 April that the inflation rate in the country in 2003 stood at 1 per cent -- one of the lowest levels in Europe.
Annual interest rates in BiH reached an average of 10.87 per cent last year, the bank said.
On 19 April, Bulgaria's privatisation agency and Viva Ventures Holding extended the deadline for completing the deal to acquire a 65 per cent stake in the Bulgarian Telecommunications Company.
By mutual agreement, the deadline was extended by 60 days.
The World Bank said it would provide $5m for a project aimed at protecting Lake Shkoder from degradation.
The lake is the largest in the Balkan Peninsula and is situated at the border of Albania and Montenegro.
Republika Srpska's privatisation agency announced that a second tender to sell a majority stake in Banja Luka's brewery has failed.
Although leading international players had initially showed interest in the enterprise, the agency said, no valid bids were submitted as of the 16 April deadline.
Macedonia plans to demand an estimate of its credit rating by international credit agencies, Economy Minister Nikola Popovski announced in London.
He said that Macedonia should not fall behind other former Yugoslav republics, noting that BiH has already received a rating by Moody's, and that assessments of Serbia-Montenegro's rating are under way.
Greek Government to Crack Down on Corruption
A new plan by the minister of internal affairs and public administration calls for harsh penalties and imprisonment of civil employees who violate the government's trust.
By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 05/06/04

In an unprecedented move against corruption, Greek Minister of Internal Affairs and Public Administration Prokopis Pavlopoulos has called for the severe punishment of any civil employee who abuses the government's trust.
In addition to heavy fines, there is the chance of jail time.
The government's goal through this new bill is to crack down on corruption in the public service sector.
In the first phase of the plan, the tax office will conduct computer-assisted investigations into public officials' assets.
Those who are found with properties or wealth that cannot be justified based on their salary will face an inquiry.
Corruption is a major problem with public funds.
For previous governments that have tried to tackle it, it has proved to be like the mythical hydra -- that grows and grows, overtaking everything in its path. With more than 600,000 civil servants, Greeks are tolerant of corruption and have learned to live with it.
On occasion, there is a story in the media about corrupt officials who are immediately forced to resign, but such efforts are few and far between.
In fact, corruption is encouraged to a certain degree due to lax legislation that has decriminalised many cases of accepting bribery.
When the new bill comes in effect, accepting any form of transaction, monetary or otherwise, will be considered a crime.
For public servants who are working under oath, that could mean a life sentence.
This was one of Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis' campaign promises.
The work of several directors will come under special scrutiny.
All positions that control public projects or make purchasing decisions will be the first to be checked for accepting money from businesses in exchange for assigning projects to them.
In the second stage, the government will check the assets of directors responsible for licensing.
This includes anyone from civil engineers responsible for urban development to driving instructors responsible for testing candidates.
Some of the more sensitive services are those of health and taxation.
The Financial Crime Prosecution Unit, which can demand to review the books of any business without advance notice, may uncover more irregularities than those it reports.
With a health system in poor shape by EU standards, some doctors and surgeons in public hospitals are among those who enjoy the benefits of corruption; they ask patients for a fee to jump the queue and receive faster treatment.
According to the European Central Bank, Greece has the highest level of corruption of any country in the EU.
It is estimated that it costs taxpayers 10 billion euros annually, or approximately 900 euros per citizen.
Goran Hadzic Still Evades Justice
War crimes indictee Goran Hadzic fled his home while the war crimes indictment against him was supposedly a secret, known only to the UN tribunal and Serbian authorities.
Amid lingering suspicions he was tipped off by police, the issue is receiving renewed attention.

Goran Hadzic, the former president of a breakaway Serbian entity in Croatia during the war in the former Yugoslavia, still evades justice.
Hadzic was charged with 14 counts of violations of the laws or customs of war by The Hague on 13 July 2004.
In the three days before the indictment was made public on 16 July, Hadzic fled his home in Novi Sad, and remains a fugitive.
Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte has accused Serbian authorities of warning Hadzic that he was about to be arrested.
Rasim Ljajic, head of the Serbia-Montenegro Committee for Co-operation with The Hague Tribunal, says state officials haven't had contact with Hadzic since September 2004.
At that time, Ljajic said, they were in touch with Hadzic's family and there were some indications that Hadzic might surrender, but nothing happened.
Ljajic said contact with the family no longer exists -- and the Serbian government has no information on whether Hadzic remains in the country.
Local media have speculated that he may be hiding out in an Orthodox monastery in Irig in the mountains of Fruska Gora, or in his apartment in Bijela -- near the Montenegrin coastal town of Herceg Novi -- but police there say they have not found him.
According to The Hague indictment, Hadzic was engaged in a joint criminal enterprise with a number of other indictees, including former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj, former chief of Serbian State Security Jovica Stanisic, Red Berets founder Franko Simatovic, former chief of Serbian Public Security Radovan Stojicic, and paramilitary gang leader Zeljko "Arkan" Raznatovic.
Although he isn't among the most famous Hague indictees, the charges against Hadzic are grave.
Thousands of Croat and other non-Serb civilians were murdered, tortured, and beaten in the breakaway Republika Srpska Krajina.
Hadzic allegedly participated in the creation, organisation, financing and direction of the entity's police and defence forces, and is reported to have personally committed some of the crimes.
Amid growing domestic and international pressure to co-operate with The Hague, his whereabouts are again becoming the subject of heated discussion in Serbia.
Erdogan Campaigns for New Political System in Turkey
The government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is pushing for the adoption of a presidential system in Turkey, on the grounds that the existing parliamentary system is inefficient and outdated.
By Fatih Baran for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 03/02/05
Turkey needs to shift to a presidential system to achieve lasting stability, said Justice Minister Cemil Cicek. [AFP]
In the wake of last year's EU progress report on Turkey, the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has reopened a long-standing debate on the country's political structure, calling for the current parliamentary system to be replaced by a US-style presidential system.
Such a change would help bring political stability to Turkey, in turn allowing EU accession targets to be met, Justice Minister Cemil Cicek told lawmakers last month.
According to Erdogan and other leaders of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), the current 75-year-old system amounts to an inefficient and bureaucratic oligarchy that should be scrapped.
The idea is not new.
In 1989, during the presidency of Turgut Ozal, it was discussed but eventually rejected on the grounds that Turkey was not ready for a US-style system.
Critics of the new proposal -- including some AKP deputies -- say Turkey must first strengthen its judicial system.
Without such reforms, they argue, a presidential system would undermine democracy, concentrating too much power in one branch of government and paving the way for authoritarian rule.
The main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) has blasted the plan as an attempt by international groups to shape Turkish politics.
Meanwhile, the head of the Turkish Industrialists' and Businessmen's Association, Omer Sabanci, has said that a presidential system is not suitable for the country, calling on the government to strengthen the existing parliamentary system instead.
The earliest a presidential system could be adopted would be April 2007, when the term of current President Ahmet Necdet Sezer ends.
Erdogan is seen as a possible candidate to replace Sezer, regardless of which system is in place by then.
Meanwhile, Turkey is also considering an EU proposal that the electoral threshold be decreased from 10 per cent to 5 per cent, to increase the number of minorities represented.
During the November 2002 elections, many parties failed to meet the existing threshold.
The AKP won those elections, receiving 35 per cent of the vote and absorbing some of the votes from parties that fell short of the 10 per cent margin.
So far, the government has acknowledged that better representation is needed, but resists lowering the threshold.
"If we keep a parliamentary system, the electoral threshold should be preserved," Cicek said.
"Another formula can be found for representation of political parties, which could not have seats at the parliament," he added, arguing that a lower threshold would divide the parliament and endanger stability.
At least nine parties would likely gain seats under the change, leading to the emergence of coalitions and blocs, analysts say.
Central and East European Leaders Pledge to Aid Roma
Eight Central and East European countries launched a ten-year initiative in Sofia on Wednesday, aimed at ending centuries of isolation and discrimination against their Roma populations.

Leaders of eight Central and East European countries gathered in Sofia on Wednesday (2 February) to launch a ten-year initiative to improve the status of the Roma, the continent's most vulnerable minority.
The former communist states participating in the unprecedented project signed a declaration expressing their commitment to work for the inclusion of Roma in their societies.
"Our governments will work to lift discrimination and overcome unacceptable differences between the Roma and the remaining members of society," the declaration read.
It was signed by prime ministers Simeon Saxe-Coburg of Bulgaria, Ferenc Gyurcsany of Hungary, Ivo Sanader of Croatia, Vlado Buckovski of Macedonia, Vojislav Kostunica of Serbia and deputy prime ministers Pavel Nemec of the Czech Republic, Marco Bela of Romania and Pal Czaky of Slovakia.
The World Bank and the Open Society Institute are the principal sponsors of the initiative, which is supported by other international organisations, including the EU and the UNDP.
"In the context of a united Europe, it is unacceptable to have a large and growing Roma minority which is so much worse off than the majority which itself is shrinking in numbers," World Bank President James Wolfensohn said in Sofia on Wednesday. "It is morally unacceptable, but it is also politically unthinkable in terms of Europe's long-term stability and security."
Between seven million and nine million Roma live on the continent.
Approximately six million live in Central and East Europe.
The group is now one of the largest, poorest, and fastest growing minorities in Europe.
Infant mortality is higher than that among other groups in their countries of residence, while life expectancy is 10 to 15 years shorter.
Roma families have more children, who are often sent to schools for the disabled, if they go to school at all.
Lacking education and skills, they have fewer job opportunities and are often discriminated against by potential employers.
Quoting newly released UNDP data, the BBC reported Wednesday that five times more Roma live below the poverty line than do the majority populations in Bulgaria and Serbia, and three times more in Macedonia and Romania.
Seven out of ten Roma living in Romania do not have access to running water.
In Kosovo, only one in ten Roma aged 12 and above has finished primary school.
The Roma in Macedonia owe in electricity bills more than seven times their monthly earnings.
Under the initiative, each of the participating countries is to implement a national action plan containing measurable benchmarks for improvements that they will have to meet by 2015.
The focus will be on four priority areas -- education, employment, health, and housing.
Provision has also been made for a follow-up framework to monitor progress. A Roma Education Fund has already been created, with initial funding of around $43m.
"If we do nothing, we will see continued disaffection and suffering," Wolfensohn said. "If we succeed … [the initiative] offers an opportunity to turn the tide of history and harness the political will to include the Roma as full citizens in European societies.
Samaras takes the helm at Greece's ND
Voters in the New Democracy leadership contest shunned Dora Bakoyannis in favour of a veteran figure who appealed to the party base.
By Maria Paravantes for Southeast European Times in Athens -- 01/12/09
"I accept the responsibility to take ND into new battles … We all won," Antonis Samaras said after his victory Sunday night (November 29th).
Antonis Samaras, the new leader of Greece's main opposition party, is a former foreign minister who took a tough line while in office.
On Sunday (November 29th), he won the race to become New Democracy's 7th party president, garnering around 50.2% of the first-round ballots.
"The people have spoken, the party base has spoken, the mandate is powerful and indisputable," Samaras said, vowing to safeguard party unity and iron out differences.
His victory over Dora Bakoyannis, the former mayor of Athens and foreign minister in the recently ousted administration of Costas Karamanlis, was decisive.
Once considered a favourite for the party leadership, she managed only a distant second, with 39.5% of the vote.
A third candidate, Thessaloniki prefect Panagiotis Psomiadis, picked up 10.2%.
Bakoyannis congratulated both her rivals following the vote, while again calling on New Democracy to modernise.
"The base of ND chose the party's new leader," she said. "The decision is respected and I would like to thank the hundreds of thousands of supporters who honoured me with their votes.
A new chapter starts today for ND.
The party must move forward, become a modern centre-right party.
We will all be present in this effort."
In an apparent bid for political accord, Socialist Prime Minister George Papandreou met with Samaras on Monday to congratulate him.
"We look to work together on national issues, because problems are pressing and we need dialogue and agreement," Papandreou said after the meeting.
Samaras responded by pledging his commitment to Greece's interests.
"We will work side by side on some issues and opposite each other on others.
Side by side because we serve the same country and its people, on opposite sides because we are different ideologically; that's the opposition's role," he said.
The same day, he met with former Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis, who resigned after the party's October 4th election defeat.
Samaras announced that the next party congress will take place in the spring.
Political analysts say he faces the challenge of regaining the confidence of disenchanted party supporters while trying to tackle infighting within ND.
The Harvard-educated Samaras, 58, has held several ministry posts in prior administrations.
In addition to serving as Greece's top diplomat, he has held the culture and finance portfolios.
Regionally, he is remembered for the hard line Greece took on the Macedonia name dispute during the 1989-1993 administration of Constantine Mitsotakis.
Athens instituted an economic embargo on its neighbour and mounted a campaign to prevent it from joining international institutions.
His uncompromising views prompted Samaras to walk out on the party, in a move that eventually spurred the collapse of the government. He created his own breakaway conservative party, Political Spring, in 1993, but it was short-lived. He rejoined ND's ranks in 2004.
New Democracy's leadership vote Sunday was, for the first time, an open one.
Non-party members were able to cast their vote after entering their names on the party register.
A record 770,683 showed up at the 1,584 polls set up throughout the country.
Expatriate Greeks living in eight EU countries also had the chance to vote at one of the 64 stations abroad.
About 1.5m euros went to the party coffers, as each voter had to pay a two euro fee to participate in the ballot.
Serbian parliament ratifies Vojvodina statute
Despite opposition, parliament ratified the statute of Serbia's northern province of Vojvodina.

More than a year after its adoption by the government, parliament approved the Vojvodina statute on Monday (November 30th).
The delay in ratification was due to objections both from members of the ruling coalition and the opposition, who felt the statute violated the constitution and gave too much authority to the northern Serbia province.
Out of 163 parliament members who were present during the vote, 138 voted in favour of the bill, according to Serbian state news agency Tanjug.
The opposition's main objections were that the statute designated the biggest town in Vojvodina -- Novi Sad -- as the capital, and that it allowed the province to open its representative offices abroad, close agreements with other regions and form its own Academy of Sciences and Arts.
After the adoption of the Socialists' amendments last month, Vojvodina is defined by the statute as an autonomous province and an inseparable part of Serbia.
The amendments also stipulate that Vojvodina can open representative offices in European regions and in Brussels, with consent from the Serbian government, and Novi Sad is no longer defined as the capital, but as the chief administrative centre.
Despite the changes, the opposition remains dissatisfied.
Former Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica of the Democratic Party of Serbia says the fact that the statute still contained the provision on a referendum on the territory of Vojvodina is dangerous for Serbia's integrity.
The party plans to seek the Constitutional Court's opinion on the matter.
Other authorities waved off such concerns.
Vojvodina Assembly Speaker Sandor Egeresi says the ruling coalition demonstrated political maturity by passing the statute, adding that it is only the beginning of decentralisation and regionalisation in Serbia.
Head of the Vojvodina administration and Democratic Party Vice-President Bojan Pajtic dismissed accusations that the new statute is separatist.
"Vojvodina will now have more autonomy, but still less than other regions in Europe," Pajtic said during the debate.
Socialist Party leader and Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Ivica Dacic said that amendments to the statute "are the greatest defeat of autonomy advocates after two decades", as "their concept of Vojvodina as a republic" had failed.
He added that Serbia would never let Vojvodina step out of its territory.
EU announces end of visas for Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia
Visa-free travel to Western Europe is close at hand and just in time for the holidays.

Citizens of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia will be able to travel to most of Europe without visas as of December 19th, EU interior ministers decided during a meeting in Brussels on Monday (November 30th).
Hailing the move, EU officials said it marked an important step in the three countries' European integration bids.
"Today's decision reflects the clear European perspective of the Western Balkan countries and is the result of the hard work of the countries concerned to meet the requirements for visa liberalisation," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Monday.
By simplifying mobility for Macedonian, Montenegrin and Serbian citizens, the 27-nation bloc will "further foster the contacts between the Union and these countries and open a new era in our co-operation", European Commission (EC) Vice-President Jacques Barrot said.
Swedish Migration and Asylum Policy Minister Tobias Billstrom, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency and who chaired Monday's meeting, called it a "historic" decision.
Macedonian, Montenegrin and Serbian citizens wishing to celebrate Christmas with friends and relatives living in Schengen area countries will be able to do so now without visas, he noted.
They only need a biometric passport to travel to any of the 28 countries in the Schengen area -- all EU member states, except Britain and Ireland, plus non-EU members Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.
The duration of their stay must not exceed 90 days within a six-month period, otherwise they will still need to have a visa.
Those planning to work during a short stay would also have to obtain visas and work permits.
Monday's decision does not apply to residents of Kosovo even if they hold a Serbian biometric passport, as their country has not been recognised by all EU nations yet and was not included in the visa liberalisation dialogue the EC opened with the Western Balkan nations last year.
"This is a practical and clear step towards European integration," Serbian President Boris Tadic said at a joint press conference with Barrot and Rehn in Brussels. "Visa abolishment is not part of EU membership negotiations, but there can be no membership in the EU without visa liberalisation."
Hailing the news as a confirmation of Skopje's efforts to meet the visa liberalisation requirements, Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said his country had "reason to celebrate and this day will be written in Macedonian history for sure".
Turkish Cypriots dismantle roadblock in divided Nicosia
After being closed for more than 40 years, the most famous shopping street in Nicosia could reopen for Christmas following a move by the Turkish Cypriots on Thursday to remove a roadblock on their side of the divided city.
Greek Cypriots said they were ready to follow suit.
(The Times - 25/11/05; Reuters, AP, Financial Mirror, AFP, Journal of Turkish Weekly - 24/11/05)

One of the key symbols of division in Cyprus is likely to disappear before the end of this year, after Turkish Cypriots began tearing down a roadblock on their side of the split city of Nicosia on Thursday (24 November).
The roadblock on Ledra Street has existed for more than 40 years now.
A checkpoint was first built in 1958 during a campaign against British rule.
Three years after Cyprus became independent in 1960, violence between the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot communities led to the closure of Ledra Street.
The barrier was then fortified into a two-storey high wall in 1974, after Turkey invaded the island's north in response to a Greek Cypriot coup.
Since then, the medieval Venetian city of Nicosia -- as the rest of the country -- has remained partitioned along ethnic lines.
A 180km long, UN-patrolled "Green Line" divides the island into a Turkish Cypriot north and a Greek Cypriot south.
"We want to reunite our country," Semavi Asik, deputy mayor of the Turkish Cypriot part of Nicosia, told the AP on Thursday. "This country is big enough for Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots."
The latest international effort to reunite Cyprus ended in failure in April 2004, when Greek Cypriots overwhelmingly rejected a plan for a settlement proposed by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan.
Although the majority of Turkish Cypriots voted in favour of the deal, only the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot part of the Mediterranean island joint the EU on 1 May last year.
For more than three decades, the contacts between the two communities were severely restricted.
In 2003, however, the Turkish Cypriots opened four crossing points, allowing thousands of people to cross from one side into the other every day.
The latest move is expected to boost local commerce as the place returns to life with the likely opening of new shops and restaurants, decades after they disappeared from the area.
Business leaders from both sides of the divide have been urging their respective authorities to open up the street.
"The plans are all ready," Asik said. "It will bring economic benefits for both sides within the walled city."
"It's a welcome sign of hope when there is very little or any optimism warranted on the political front," Reuters quoted a local diplomat as saying on the Turkish Cypriot move.
Greek Cypriots also hailed the surprise move, suggesting they were keen to follow suit.
"This is a welcome approach if they are opening their side," Nicosia's Greek Cypriot Mayor Michalakis Zampelas said.
"We are waiting from the green light from the UN, who have some doubts concerning security," he added, referring to the possible existence of boobytraps and mines planted back in 1974.
But he stressed that if the Turkish Cypriots open the street "we are ready to open too".
In an unrelated development, the Turkish Cypriot government agreed Tuesday to pass a law aimed at accelerating the settlement of property disputes with Greek Cypriots.
Once adopted by parliament, the legislation would allow Greek Cypriots to demand not only compensation or exchange, but also the return of property seized over the past decades, if it is not currently being used, or if its return would not pose a threat to public order.
Business Roundup
A review of business and economic news from the Balkans since 10 October.
(Various sources -- 03/10/03 - 10/17/03)
A review of business and economic news from the Balkans since 10 October:
Visits to Bulgaria by foreign tourists during the first nine months of 2003 increased by almost 17 per cent compared to the same period a year ago.
Preliminary data shows that revenue between January and July amounted to almost 789m euros.
Serbia's jobless rate stood at 34.7 per cent in August, slightly lower than July's 34.8 per cent.
It represents an increase however from 32.3 per cent recorded in August 2002.
The European Agency for Reconstruction is to extend a 12.5m-euro loan to help assist local governments in Serbia.
Fifteen municipalities will take advantage of the programme.
The IMF completed talks with Turkish officials under the 6th review of the country's stand-by agreement with the Fund.
Economy Minister Ali Babacan said the parties have reached informal agreement on all issues.
The IMF board approved the final quarterly performance review and the disbursement of the final 141m euro tranche under the 385m euro stand-by arrangement for Romania on 15 October.
The agreement, initially projected to end in April 2003, had to be extended because of the Romanian side's failure to privatise a local bank.
An IMF mission is expected to arrive in Bucharest at the end of October for talks on a further programme.
Croatian Motorways Company and a group of international banks -- Deutsche Bank's Singapore Branch, Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi and Mizuho Corporate Bank -- signed an agreement on a 250m-euro syndicated loan for the construction of the Zagreb-Split highway. The loan has a 13-year maturity, a three-year grace period and 3.5 per cent interest.
Greek businessmen have reportedly bought a 53 per cent stake of the Skopje-based furniture maker Treska for 1.58m euros.
The transaction was carried out via the Macedonian Stock Exchange.
A lawyer for the firm, Georgi Dimitrov, declined to reveal the name of the buyer for the time being.
Representatives of the UK-Indian company Ispat met with cabinet members of the two Bosnia and Herzegovina entities to discuss possible investments in the country's steel industry.
Ispat expressed interest in forming partnership agreements with the Zenica steelworks, the Ljubija coalmine, the Lukavac coke works, and the limestone mine in Doboj.
According to Dnevnik daily, US businessmen of Macedonian origin are close to finalising a deal for the purchase of a 54 per cent stake in Ineks-Drim Hotels, a joint stock company which owns the Drim and Beograd hotels in Struga.
The shares are currently in the hands of company employees, who reportedly have agreed to sell them for 3.4m euros.
The Romanian economy: What to watch for in 2006
Romania faces a number of pressing challenges this year.
As market conditions approach those of the EU, local firms face stiffer competition.
That in turn has led to smaller growth in industrial output and GDP.
The economy has also been affected by last year's heavy rainfall and floods, as well as the rise in energy prices.
The international climate, meanwhile, is one of uncertainty, with economic stagnation in Europe and the rise of the Asian economies driving a shift towards protectionism.
Romania's political and business leaders thus have much to contend with as they seek to make good on the country's EU commitments and guide it towards its expected entry into the bloc.
By Daniel Daianu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest – 23/01/06
The more domestic market conditions match those across the EU, the harder it is for numerous local companies to comply with the new terms of competition.
Forecasting Romania's economic performance in 2006 is a risky business.
However, we can say with certainty that the outlook depends on a number of specific issues.
Among them is the ability of the domestic economy to adapt to changing conditions.
Industrial output grew considerably less in 2005 than in the previous year.
For the first nine months, the increase was a mere 2 per cent, while GDP for the entire year will likely not exceed 4 per cent.
These unimpressive figures are partly attributable to the heavy rainfalls and floods that affected much of the country.
At the same time, Romanian industry -- and certain sectors in particular -- were hit by the severe appreciation of the domestic currency, the rise in energy tariffs, subsidy cuts and fiercer competition.
In general, the more domestic market conditions match those across the EU, the harder it is for numerous local companies to comply with the new terms of competition.
This is reflected in smaller growth of output and GDP.
How will domestic companies fare in the period to come?
Or, to put it differently, has industrial output reached a bottom, or will downward adjustment, with its related painful costs, continue for a while?
The economy was affected by last year's heavy rainfall and floods. [AFP]
If the bottom has not yet been reached, we may see worsening numbers in the months to come.
If the bottom has been reached, the rate of growth in industrial output may rise in 2006, although signs are not likely until the second quarter.
A speedier absorption of shocks would help GDP growth to recover as well.
A better harvest would assist such a recovery considerably -- this year’s harvest fell an abysmal 12 per cent compared to 2004.
However, too much optimism is not warranted, considering that productivity gains were relatively unimpressive in 2005.
The trade deficit has continued to grow rapidly, and the current account deficit may have exceeded 9 per cent of GDP in 2005.
Given that GDP and industrial output growth have slowed significantly, a question is calling out for an answer: are such external deficits sustainable?
In fact, there are several aspects related to the rise in external deficits which require clarification.
The unimpressive productivity gains of the economy this year seem to confirm the qualms I expressed, in an article a couple of years ago, regarding a major competitiveness challenge.
The economy must somehow cope with a sharp exchange rate appreciation resulting from heavy money inflows from Romanians who work abroad and other capital inflows which are attracted by Romania’s prospects of joining the EU (the so-called "Dutch disease").
Some would argue that the external deficits are not worrisome, given the "normal" growth of bank credit and the presence of foreign capital in the banking industry, which presumably translates into reliable long-term credit lines.
But such arguments have limits.
In the real economy there is no one-way street; painful corrections are inevitable once deficits exceed certain thresholds.
Were such a correction to happen, it would involve a severe depreciation of the exchange rate that could rekindle inflation.
The real test of the new monetary policy regime of the National Bank, namely inflation targeting, will come this year. [NBR]
As for the new monetary policy regime of the National Bank (NBR), namely inflation targeting, the real test will come this year.
The final four months of 2005, during which inflation targeting has been practiced, are not conclusive at all and it would have probably been better to postpone its introduction for a while.
The test will be highly demanding since conditions are peculiar: Almost half of the money supply escapes the NBR’s control (because transactions are euro and dollar denominated); interest rate differentials are still high; and the boom of bank credit and capital account liberalisation has eroded the NBR's ability to control money supply.
The 5 per cent inflation target for 2006 is overambitious; 6 per cent to 6.5 per cent would be more reasonable, considering the rise in gas tariffs and the underlying inflationary expectations.
Last year's target was missed by a large margin -- inflation would have likely have been 8.7 per cent to 8.8 per cent in 2005 as against the 6 per cent initial target, prior to the introduction of the flat tax.
Though the public budget envisages a deficit of 0.5 per cent for 2006, some of its underlying premises are questionable -- specifically, those relating to GDP growth and inflation.
A budget rectification would have to consider a revision of these premises. Budget execution must be tight next year.
At the same time, the financing of infrastructure projects has to be increased.
And special attention has to be given to raising the capacity to absorb EU funds.
An adequate management of the key issues has the potential to enhance Romania's investment grade.
The international environment, meanwhile, is under the spell of major uncertainties, which are rooted in global imbalances and the economic impact of various geopolitical conflicts.
Economic stagnation in Europe and elsewhere, as well as the rise of China and other Asian economies, prompts countries to resort to protectionism as a means of defending domestic markets (The gridlocked Doha trade round speaks for itself).
The price of basic commodities and oil will continue to be impacted by the rise of Asian economies.
These circumstances will have an influence on the Romanian economy, though it depends greatly on EU markets.
Last, but not least, Romania has to make good on its commitments to the EU; the better we do, the better our chances of getting into the Union.
Romania's political and business leaders have the responsibility of better defining national interests better, and in concrete terms.
The EU has its specific supranational interests; but it is also a constellation of national interests which often conflict.
This reality poses numerous challenges to national decision-making processes.
Failure to meet those challenges, however, could carry the price of a delayed membership in the EU, thanks to the safeguard clause. The stakes in 2006 are high.

The Economic Chamber of Macedonia hosted a conference of chambers of commerce from Southeast Europe last month in Ohrid.
The conference theme -- "Faster towards the EU" -- allowed participants from ten countries, ranging from Slovenia to Turkey, to exchange experiences and discuss options for a faster track to EU accession.
Addressing the participants, Deputy Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Stavreski gave a brief account of efforts to fulfil his country's commitments under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), including promotion of a constructive dialogue among the country's ethnic communities, judicial reform, police reform, a crackdown on corruption and strengthening of administrative capacity.
"I am convinced that [Macedonia], Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia and Albania all have ample capacity and are ready to shoulder their responsibilities as future members of the EU, together with the current ones," Stavreski said.
Bulgaria's Lubomir Christoff opened the discussion by suggesting the path to accession and to quality implementation of reforms under the SAA matters as much as the accession itself.
Strengthening institutions, upgrading the infrastructure and preparing for the free movement of goods, capital and people served to enhance the competitiveness of his country's economy, he said.
Chairmen and chamber-of-commerce representatives shared their experiences and challenges in preparing for EU accession.
Romanian Ambassador to Macedonia Adrian Constantinescu reviewed his country's path to the EU in 2007.
He reiterated the willingness and the readiness of his country to assist the Western Balkan countries aspiring to join the Union.
Stopanska Banka CEO Gligor Bishev quoted the latest World Bank report on doing business, noting it listed several countries in the region -- including Albania and Macedonia -- among the ten fastest reformers in the world.
He considered this status evidence of the political will in the region to prepare for EU accession as quickly as possible.
The conference also provided networking opportunities for business leaders in the region.
The Macedonian organisers expressed hopes of turning this conference into a regular event.

Pristina's mayor: open to change
Isa Mustafa, mayor of the Kosovo capital, talks to SETimes about the Democratic League of Kosovo and what the party should do now.
By Linda Karadaku for Southeast European Times in Pristina -- 28/10/10

Since exiting the government, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) has been undergoing changes and seeing some interparty sparring.
Before snap elections are held in the country, the party will vote in its own chairman.
Though he has yet to formally enter the race for the top party post, Pristina Mayor Isa Mustafa has been garnering support.
In this exclusive interview with SETimes correspondent Linda Karadaku, Mustafa discusses his possible candidacy and the LDK's well being.
SETimes: Will you announce your candidacy for LDK chairman?
Isa Mustafa: I think that it would be good to have the candidacies for the LDK chairman chosen on the basis of an internal agreement.
Obviously it would be in my interest, Sejdiu's interest and the interests all those who claim to want to become LDK chairman, to listen to the will of the membership of the LDK.
I have not had any conversation with those that have emerged to support my candidacy and request Sejdiu's resignation.
I have no connection with public shows of support.
SETimes: What do you think about the LDK leaving the ruling coalition?
Mustafa: I think the time was not right.
The right time was earlier, when the PDK took the unilateral decision to break the coalition, or at the time of very big affairs when EULEX intervened.
I [don't know] why, after the election date was set, the coalition break-up was announced.
I have not been part of this decision; I am not a member of the presidency.
I had no information.
I do not have any explanation, even from those who participated.
SETimes: Was the coalition between the LDK and the PDK functional?
Mustafa: It was not functional at all.
It was functional only in the first phase of the declaration of independence and the adoption of symbols of Kosovo, but it did not work later.
SETimes: What is your opinion about the national elections?
When should they be held?
Mustafa: I would suggest keeping them on February 13th.
I think this [can be agreed upon by the government and the opposition].
An agreement should also be reached on processing some laws in the interim -- the law on the budget, PTK privatisation, the law on elections and some laws deriving from the Ahtisaari package.
I think that agreement can be reached.
SETimes: What kind of a future Kosovo government do you expect?
Mustafa: We will have a government that is totally unstable, which will have a short mandate, because we are doing it through early elections.
SETimes: If you run for party chairman and win, what would you change in the party?
Mustafa: I think the LDK should be much more open to new comings in the party, to young people, the young generation that seems missing from the party.
It should be much more open to new initiatives and ideas -- [losing the] mindset that the LDK should be guided only by those who have experience.
It should be done to provide the party with a sufficient basis of staff and knowledge to govern Kosovo in a different way.
It's not about a new discovery in the sense of the government, but in the sense of implementation of rule of law, fighting corruption and coming out with economic programmes to combat poverty and unemployment.

An "ultimatum" on Albanian election reform
Does Edi Rama's latest proposal herald an end to Albania's political woes, or the start of new quarreling?

Political life in Albania has been mired in an impasse since the June 2009 elections.
The opposition Socialists and their allies want ballot boxes re-opened; the ruling coalition disagrees, and the resulting standoff has held up the legislative process.
EU officials have regularly warned that Albania's EU prospects are being harmed.
Now there are signals that the two sides may be inching towards a solution, though whether anything concrete comes of it remains to be seen, and the tone of discussions remains combative.
Edi Rama, leader of the Socialists, made a surprise decision last week to attend a meeting called by Prime Minister Sali Berisha to discuss the crisis.
He brought with him what he described as an "ultimatum".
It calls for setting up a commission to investigate problems with the election, such as an alleged lack of policing.
Rama said the opposition is committed to implementing a July 8th resolution by the European Parliament, which "deplores the political crisis" in Albania and "strongly urges all political sides to assume their responsibilities".
Specific steps called for in the resolution include conducting dialogue on a new electoral law to ensure transparency in future polls, and setting up a parliamentary committee of inquiry to investigate the June 2009 vote.
If the ruling and opposition parties can't find a solution to the impasse, they should look to outside mediation, the EP said.
Berisha told Rama he would study his proposal.
He affirmed his government's readiness to implement the EP resolution, and said the opposition would be invited to formulate amendments designed to make the electoral process more secure.
The amendments would then be submitted to the OSCE and the Venice Commission, Berisha said, adding that he wants EP members to help with the reforms.
The prime minister also said the government will secure additional budget funds to address issues such as buying new ballot boxes for the 2011 local elections, and will not burn the old ones.
The Socialists, who have been staging parliamentary boycotts and public demonstrations, say they will call these off for the time being while the government considers their demands.
Spartak Ngjela, a Rama ally, told a local station Top Channel that the offer extends to November 8th or 9th.
Writing in Gazeta Shqip, analyst Andrea Stefani said the opposition has no reason right now to show weakness.
"Even the European Parliament in its resolution, makes clear that the investigation of election materials is seen as a precondition of electoral reform," she wrote in her column.
Slovenia's Pahor visits Kosovo

Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor was in Pristina on Monday (March 8th) to meet with his Kosovo counterpart, Hashim Thaci.
Topping their agenda was the upcoming Brdo summit of EU and regional leaders.
In a statement echoing US President John F. Kennedy's inaugural speech, Pahor said "This is a case where the region's countries can present what they can offer to the European Union, not only what European Union can do for them."
The conference -- set for March 20th at the Brdo castle in the Upper Carniola region of Kranj -- has been overshadowed by friction between Serbia and Kosovo over whether the Pristina delegation will be seated as representing an independent state.
Pahor stressed that there are two weeks left to smooth over "technical" problems for a successful conference and said most are more important than the relationship between Serbia and Kosovo.
"President Tadic [of Serbia] and [Kosovo] Prime Minister Thaci are not the only problem we have," said Pahor. "We would like to have a special statement on the European perspective of the Western Balkans.
Who can [prepare such a document] better than us?
We can do this job."
Thaci said that Kosovo will be present at the conference and meet its commitments to further regional co-operation "but also for the Euro-Atlantic perspective", reiterating that NATO and EU membership are top priorities for Kosovo.
Neither official took questions from reporters.

Several churches in Romania's Bucovina County that are considered historical monuments or monuments of art will undergo restoration work this year.
The Romanian Ministry of Culture has allocated more than 750m euros for the restoration of historical monuments in the county in 2004.
The Macedonian short film "Bugs", written and directed by Igor Ivanov-Izi, was among 16 world films nominated for the Berlin Film Festival's Golden and Silver Bear awards in the category of Best Film.
More than 1,500 films competed for the nominations.
An exhibition of jewels from the 55 OSCE member states and the 10 Partners for Co-operation from the Mediterranean region and Asia opened at the National Gallery for Foreign Art in Sofia.
The cultural event, called Valuable Links, was designed to build a bridge between the 2003 Dutch Chairmanship of the OSCE and the Bulgarian Chairmanship in 2004.
An opinion poll conducted in the UK and published on 7 January found that more than 80 per cent of British citizens favour the return of the Parthenon marbles to Greece.
The support has increased dramatically since a poll three years ago, when 50 per cent of respondents said they supported the return.
Director and scriptwriter Dusan Kovacevic's film "The Professional" will represent Serbia-Montenegro at the film festivals in Palm Springs and Los Angeles.
The European Film Academy has already nominated the movie for Best Screenplay.
Belgrade surprised by ICJ decision
Tumultuous changes in Serbian politics and in the region may be in the making.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 23/07/10

The International Court of Justice's (ICJ) advisory opinion on Kosovo's independence has sent shock waves through the political scene, with opposition parties urging President Boris Tadic and his allies to resign.
The calls stem from the leaders' earlier predictions that a debate on Kosovo's independence at The Hague would result in a victory for Serbia.
In their initial reaction Thursday (July 22nd), they acknowledged that the ICJ's decision was "difficult for Serbia" but would not make Belgrade give up the political fight for Kosovo.
"It is clear that the court did not state its opinion on the right to secession; rather it decided to debate only the technical contents of the declaration of independence," Tadic said in his address to the public, noting that the political struggle will continue at the UN General Assembly this fall.
He added that Serbia would do all it can to keep the peace in the former province, while working to prevent more countries from recognising Kosovo.
"The struggle for a compromise solution will be a long and arduous one, but we will not withdraw from it," Tadic said.
The government called an emergency session Friday to discuss strategy.
It has already announced plans to send special envoys to 50 countries in order to press Belgrade's case.
Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) leader and former Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica characterised the ICJ ruling as "extremely unfavourable for Serbia's state interests".
The DSS has criticised the way the Serbian government formulated the question it put to the ICJ, saying it failed to consult parliament adequately.
The Liberal Democrats, which are not part of the ruling coalition but often back the government, are demanding an urgent formulation of a new Kosovo policy.
Kosovo Serb representatives reacted with anger.
Northern Kosovo Serb leader Milan Ivanovic called the country's diplomacy "a fiasco" and said Tadic's policy had pushed Serbia into a cul-de-sac, down a road that dead-ends.
Speaking to SETimes, University of Belgrade political science professor Predrag Simic noted that the court ruling is not binding, but does carry moral weight.
"The ICJ decision knocked one of the strongest arguments from Belgrade's hands," he said.
The decision will influence countries that have not yet recognised Kosovo's independence and will put added international pressure on Belgrade to reach an agreement with Pristina, he said.
He also warned that the court's opinion could have an impact on secessionist movements worldwide.
Ian Bancroft, founder of the organisation Transconflict, which deals with conflicts in the Balkans, told SETimes he had not expected such a clearly presented opinion by the court and that it could influence future events in the Balkans.
"Within Kosovo itself, Kosovo Serbs in the north may now consider it legitimate to unilaterally declare their own independence.
Within the region itself, Republika Srpska will invariably seize upon the sentence that the 'declaration of independence did not violate general international law', if not to pursue independence itself, [then] to strengthen its hand in the forthcoming constitutional reform talks," Bancroft said.
Sanader: Croatia to be among first to recognise Montenegro
Welcoming the outcome of the Montenegro independence referendum, Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said on Thursday that Zagreb would be among the first to recognise the republic as a sovereign state.

"Whatever the citizens of Montenegro have decided in their referendum, Croatia will accept, once all official conditions have been met," said Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader. [Getty Images]
Croatia will be among the first to recognise Montenegro as a sovereign state, Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said on Thursday (25 May), four days after the majority of Montenegrin voters said "yes" to independence.
"Whatever the citizens of Montenegro have decided in their referendum, Croatia will accept, once all official conditions have been met," Sanader said. "Croatia will be among the first states -- together with the EU -- to recognise Montenegro as an independent state."
The process of dissolving the loose union between Serbia and Montenegro should be be carried out in line with democratic standards, Sanader said, adding that his country is ready to play an active role in building political stability in the region.
According to official preliminary results, 55.5 per cent of those who participated in Sunday's poll voted in favour of independence, while 44.5 per cent supported preservation of the state union with Serbia.
A record 86.49 per cent of eligible voters cast their ballots.
The final results will only be announced after the legal deadline for complaints expires.
Montenegro's opposition, pro-union bloc has so far lodged 241 complaints and has called for a rerun of the vote in dozens of polling stations.
According to the OSCE, which deployed more than 360 international election monitors across Montenegro, the referendum was "genuine and transparent" and was generally conducted in line with international standards.
The vote affirmed Montenegro as a mature, stable, democratic and Europe-oriented society, the Croatian government said.
Zagreb also noted the "exceptionally positive and constructive part" the EU played in preparations.
The United States and the EU have both applauded Montenegro for the peaceful conduct of the referendum.
Welcoming the vote as a "legitimate" decision, the EU said on Monday it would start building closer ties with the Adriatic republic of some 650,000 people once the official final results are confirmed.
Other former Yugoslav republics and countries in the Balkans have also congratulated Montenegro on its independence.
"I have no doubts that Montenegro's independence will provide a positive contribution to the regional stability, prosperity and European future of the Balkans," Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski said in a telephone conversation with his Montenegrin counterpart, Filip Vujanovic.
Serbian minister calls for tolerance in Kosovo
Serbian Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic expressed Belgrade's readiness to help returnees, but he faces criticism from some residents.

While the diplomatic standoff continues, a slight barrier may have been moved when Serbian Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic visited northern Kosovo on Sunday (August 8th).
Presenting a different stance than he had done previously, Bogdanovic stressed the need for co-existence between Serbs and Albanians.
He said that Belgrade is prepared to start a dialogue with Albanians, and called on Serbs to reconcile with their Albanian neighbours.
"We are ready for compromise, dialogue on issues of status, and all technical issues related to the life and welfare of citizens," said Bogdanovic, who was in Kosovo to commemorate the anniversary of Serbs' return to the western municipality of Istog.
While visiting the village of Osojan, Bogdanovic promised funds from Serbia, and said he sees mutual compromise as the basis for resolving interethnic issues.
Many returnees, however, told him that they have had enough of Belgrade's manipulations and asked him not to politicise security issues.
"You're asking what the Serbian government could do for us?
We do not want [the maximum], but the Serbian government offers us no minimum," said one Kosovo Serb who met with Bogdanovic.
Bogdanovic said he is familiar with the problems of Serb returnees in the village, and expressed the government's readiness to help.
"We have lived here four months and nobody from the Serbian government has visited us until now; nobody is interested in how I live, [not] even the president I voted for," one resident said.
The minister unveiled details of a project designed for the agricultural sector and a Serbian government investment worth 93,000 euros to improve the lives of residents in the area.
The visit coincided with an interview given by Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic on Sunday.
Belgrade is ready for dialogue with Pristina institutions, Jeremic told CNN, but Serbia will not accept Kosovo's secession.
"The only thing we say 'no' to is the unilateral proclamation of separation," Jeremic said.
Serbia is defending its constitutional, political and democratic rights, as well as avoiding a dangerous precedent, he added.
EU considers speeding up Turkish accession talks

An EU delegation, headed by the 27-nation bloc's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, held talks with senior Turkish officials in Istanbul on Tuesday (July 13th), focusing on Ankara's bid to join the Union, as well as a range of regional and international issues.
The main objective of the meeting "is to reaffirm the EU's commitment to Turkey and explore ways how the EU and Turkey can enhance co-operation in the region", the Union said in a statement Monday.
Ashton, accompanied by EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele, met with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and Ankara's chief negotiator with the Union, Egemen Bagis.
The discussions were held under a new political dialogue process, envisioning ministerial-level meetings between the two sides twice a year.
"There should be a zero doubt policy about our commitment," Fuele said at a joint news conference after the talks. "We have a very clear mandate from member states.
We will be looking at ways we can speed up the accession process."
Turkey began its entry talks with the Union in October 2005, but the process has been moving at a snail's pace, largely due to its sluggish reform progress and its refusal to allow vessels and planes of EU member Cyprus to enter its ports and airports.
Another reason is the objections raised by several of the bloc's heavyweights, insisting that the predominantly Muslim country should eventually be offered some sort of a "privileged partnership", rather than full-fledged membership.
Turkey has so far closed only one and opened another 13 of all 35 negotiating chapters that candidates must complete before joining.
Eight of the remaining 21 to go have been frozen since late 2006 over Turkey's failure to normalise trade ties with Cyprus.
The EU statement Monday quoted Fuele as expressing hope that "more chapters could be opened this year", provided Turkey fulfills the conditions for this.
Fuele also called on Ankara to focus on implementing required reforms.
"The [European] Commission will continue to support Turkey in carrying out these reforms," he said.
Following Tuesday's talks, Fuele and Ashton voiced support for a package of constitutional amendments proposed recently by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government, which will be put to a national referendum on September 12th.
According to the EU officials, the changes are in line with the bloc's requirements and a step in the right direction, in view of the country's membership bid.
In addition, Ashton said she welcomed Ankara's growing role in regional and international matters, describing Turkey as an "important partner" for the 27-nation bloc, especially in the area of foreign policy.
"Trust and friendship are the marks of the relationship between Turkey and the EU," she said, noting that both share the goals of peace and prosperity.
Davutoglu said his country wants to extend its co-operation with the bloc on important developments that could affect both sides.
"We share such a vast geography, ranging from Afghanistan to the Mediterranean," the AFP quoted him as saying. "Turkey is following an active policy and gives the utmost importance to conducting these policies in co-operation with the EU."
Another issue discussed on Tuesday was the recent increase in violent attacks by members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organisation by both the EU and the United States.
Bagis had indicated ahead of the talks that his country would seek the Union's support in efforts to deal with the separatist group.
Davutoglu said on Tuesday that the PKK poses a serious threat not only to his country, but the EU as well.
Ashton agreed on the need for joint efforts in fighting terrorist organisations.
"We should eradicate the organisations that use the EU to get funds and finance training activities," she said.
US, Turkey provide assistance during BiH floods
After flooding and landslides caused extensive damage throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina, two countries are extending a helping hand.

In the wake of last month's severe flooding in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), the United States and Turkey are offering aid for the thousands who remain displaced.
"We received great help from USAID, which was the first to offer assistance, in the amount of 40,000 euros," said Red Cross Secretary Namik Hodzic.
On July 7th, Turkey's Foreign Ministry and General Staff, together with the Red Crescent organisation, released a joint statement saying that ten tonnes of aid had been sent to Sarajevo, including beds and food packs.
BiH's Civil Defence and the Red Cross are monitoring the situation and assisting residents.
According to Hodzic, food packages, sleeping bags, blankets and hygiene kits bought with the money were immediately distributed to those in need.
Staff at the US Embassy in Sarajevo told SETimes that Ambassador Charles English wants to ensure that help for displaced people is available as soon as possible.
The flooding, deemed the worst the country has seen, occured in late June.
The Federation of BiH's (FBiH) Tuzla canton was hit the hardest.
"A large number of houses are flooded and we had to evacuate the population to collective centres or [direct them] to their relatives' houses [elsewhere]," Tuzla Canton Civil Defence Director Zdenko Tadic told SETimes.
He said mudslides also affected the infrastructure, complicating the situation on the ground.
"Roads were damaged and some parts of the water-supply network were completely destroyed," he explained.
In Maglaj, 41 families were forced to evacuate their homes after a landslide.
The FBiH government allocated 2,500 euros per family for lodging.
Maglaj municipality officials want to build a residential facility to accommodate those whose homes are no longer habitable.
Officials estimate thousands of hectares of farm land were affected by the floods.
Because nearly 60% of the land is destroyed, consumers are bracing for higher prices on the smaller amount of crops this autumn.
According to unoffical assessments, property damage in Tuzla will top 15m euros.
After the deadline for a final cost assessment passes, the damaged regions can ask for state assistance.
However, there will not be enough money to remedy all damage, and farmers whose crops are almost completely ruined are particularly anxious.
"I make my living from agriculture and that is all I have, but after these rains I am left with nothing," vegetable producer Muhamed Hasic of Zivinci told SETimes.
Hasic said his crops are devastated and his house is flooded.
"The cantonal authorities came to assess the damage and promised assistance.
I am not quite an optimist when it comes to assistance, because a farmer can never get a return from the state on money he invested, but I hope," he said.
Greek Government Sets Objectives
Two weeks after being elected to government, New Democracy presented its four-year plan.
The focus is on the immediate tasks of hosting the Summer Olympics and resolving the Cyprus problem.

After about 15 days in office, New Democracy (ND) ministers presented their four-year plan to parliament in a session that lasted three days.
Starting with public administration, Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis said his government would change the procurement laws to give more opportunity to lower bidders, rather than allowing public officials to use complex formulas to rule in favour of preferred suppliers.
He also said that ND would found a new authority for controlling public contracts and overseeing the successful completion of projects.
Boosting the national economy is one of this government's main objectives, Karamanlis said, pledging 5 per cent growth each year and a 50 per cent drop in unemployment by 2008.
To achieve these goals, corporate tax rates will be reduced to between 20 per cent and 25 per cent, depending on the type of business.
A new set of protective measures will apply to farmers, who will benefit from tax-free fuel and the reduction of the Value Added Tax from 18 per cent to 8 per cent on agricultural equipment, the prime minister said.
Karamanlis said his government would adopt an open and honest policy regarding the Olympics, to keep people informed about how projects are progressing.
In case of a snag in the timetable, alternative paths would be followed -- for example, Deputy Culture Minister Fani Palli-Petralia's move to cancel construction of a roof over the main swimming venue, due to delays.
With the country now at an important crossroads both in terms of relations with Turkey and resolving the Cyprus issue, the new government has indicated it will follow the same foreign policy stance as its predecessor.
Karamanlis also announced plans to reduce the length of military service to six months, rather than a year.
More generally, the defence budget will be reduced, in favour of an education and culture budget that will be increased to 5 per cent of GDP.
Karamanlis pledged to boost health care in Greece through the rapid creation of hospitals and medical centres around the country; patients would be allowed to select their own family doctor.
Addressing the issue of public safety, Karamanlis said that police officers would now have to go through a University of Police Studies, rather than simply receiving academy-level training.
The objectives were well received by the majority of parliament members.
Opposition party leader George Papandreou sought more specific information about how the government plans to acquire the necessary funds, but he agreed to give support.
Turkish relief workers extend helping hand to Libyans
As Turkey's leaders negotiate a course through the Libyan crisis, private charities are helping smooth their way.
But do some groups harbour an ideological agenda?

"So where can I learn Turkish?" says Juma, a 22-year-old Libyan man, to the smiling nurse who is treating his injury.
He is one of 12 Libyans -- a mixture of rebels and demonstrators -- who have been brought to Turkey to help relieve pressure on the overcrowded hospital in Benghazi.
A gunshot wound to the neck from the early days of the uprising has severed the nerves to his arm.
"They say it could take a year to recover, so I'll need to know the language," he cheerfully explains.
Their wards at Istanbul's Avicenna Hospital are draped with Turkish flags, the tricolour of the Libyan rebels, and the banner of IHH, the Turkish Islamic charity that brought them here.
"I'm very proud of what IHH has done," said Mejdi, another patient.
"I feel real solidarity with Turkey."
The charity says it plans to bring 70 more injured Libyans to Istanbul, and has launched a Libya disaster relief campaign.
"Our teams were the first international NGO to distribute aid in Benghazi," claimed Murat Bayraktar, IHH emergency aid coordinator.
The charity got to the city on 22 February, five days after the start of the uprising and four days before the arrival of the Red Cross.
Its speedy involvement comes as Turkey's leaders are trying to shoulder their NATO responsibilities whilst not losing and hearts and minds of the Arab street.
This week Ankara announced it will be taking over the running of Benghazi airport to distribute humanitarian aid, and has already sent medical aid to the city.
It is also positioning itself as a potential mediator, keeping channels open with both Gaddafi and the rebels.
"The Libya case is particularly difficult for Turkey, because an aggressive coalition with the West will be criticized by the Arab public," said Gokhan Bacik, a professor of International Relations at Istanbul's Fatih University.
"On the other hand if Turkey keeps silent then it will get the reputation as a country that invests when times are good, but is nowhere to be seen in a crisis."
In this delicate balancing act, private charities are another manifestation of Turkey's growing cultural and economic soft power.
According to Bacik, they are in the process of expanding and learning to operate in the difficult and diverse environments of the Middle East.
"Compared to some Western charitable organizations Turkey has advantages, particularly in terms of being a Muslim country," he said.
But the case of IHH is more problematic, he points out.
In May last year it was catapulted from relative obscurity to the centre of international politics for its part in organizing the ill-fated Freedom Flotilla that tried to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza.
Its own boat, the Mavi Marmara, was boarded and fired on by Israeli soldiers, who killed nine people, including IHH activists.
During the political fallout of the raid, the charity faced accusations that it had provoked the attack.
It has steadfastly denied this, but Bacik believes that its bloody entanglement with geopolitics has offered a cautionary example to other Turkish charities.
"IHH has become a symbol of charity twinned with ideology, and many other Turkish charities now do not want to follow that."
In the authoritarian environments of the Middle East, organisations that bring ideological baggage with them are sometimes not welcome, he added.
The charity is now at pains to point out that it does not have an ideological agenda, flagging up its work in disaster zones in non-Muslim countries, including Japan and Haiti.
But none of this matters much at Avicenna Hospital, where the wounded Benghazi rebels are getting a first-hand taste of one of the qualities on which Turkey most prides itself: its hospitality.
"Even ordinary people from the streets are coming in to see us," said Mejdi. "They're just offering to help, asking if there's anything they can do -- it's amazing."
A night at the museum -- in Belgrade
Galleries and museums in Serbia open their doors for a variety of nocturnal adventures.

On May 15th, nearly half a million people in Serbia tried a different kind of nightlife.
Instead of hitting cafes and clubs, they went to the museum.
More than 100 museums and galleries across the country were open that night, featuring unusual exhibitions, magic shows and other activities.
Museum Night has been held annually for five years.
In Belgrade alone, visitors could circulate among 68 cultural institutions with a ticket costing 2.5 euros.
"With a total number of 450,000 people who visited, Museum Night has become a very important cultural event," spokesperson Marija Randjelovic told journalists at a press conference.
"In the past five years, we were always afraid that people might not be interested in taking a walk into the museums or galleries, but luckily, each and every year we are pleasantly surprised to see that there are more and more visitors."
Interest has burgeoned since the event was first held. In 2005, it drew 20,000 people in Belgrade.
Museum Night is the brainchild of art history experts Mladen Petrovic and Ana Jovanovic.
They were inspired by similar events held in other countries.
"The idea was born in Berlin in 1997 with the first museum night, and it's now held in 125 cities all over the world," Petrovic said.
The lines for the most popular exhibitions were hours long.
The varied programmes and distances between the exhibition venues required good organisation.
"I could include that night in my CV," quipped Jovana, a Belgrade medical student. "I discovered my managerial skills during Museum Night."
One exhibition, dubbed "Between Magic and Chemistry", attracted several thousand visitors.
Science was entertaining rather than excruciating.
Visitors discovered that chemical experiments can create amazing colours, which come straight from a dream.
Even the most complicated experiments seemed easy to the youngest visitors.
The exhibit was hosted by the chemistry department at Belgrade University.
"Liquid nitrogen can ossify a flower and turn it into a mineral," preschool-aged Milos explained to SETimes. "The flower becomes brittle and can be broken into small pieces."
The public's curiosity was an additional incentive for chemistry department students, who were "magicians" for the night, complete with big hats and wands.
"I'm glad that people are interested in science.
I do not find it hard to explain one thing 100 times," chemistry student Milica told SETimes.
The newly-opened Museum of Science also attracted a big crowd.
A "time machine" took participants back to the era of the first record players, and then onward again through technological history.
An exhibit on photographic techniques, featuring cameras dating from the 19th century, drew considerable interest, as did one on computer technology.
Visitors used to today's computers -- some of which can fit in the palm of a hand -- were surprised to see machines that took up a whole room.
Also popular was the Belgrade Ethnographic Museum's exhibition "Tell me how you play and I'll tell you who you are." It gave visitors the chance to re-experience their favourite childhood games.
"I enjoyed being a child again," said Belgrade lawyer Petar, 55.
Washington Urges Kosovo to Focus on Standards
Senior US State Department officials have told Kosovo's prime minister that the province's leadership should focus on achieving internationally endorsed democratic standards rather than Kosovo's future status.
(VOA, The Washington Times, RFE/RL, Radio B92 - 05/02/04)
Kosovo should focus on achieving UN approved standards, particularly those involving multi-ethnicity, rather than on the issue of the province's future status, US officials have told Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi.
Rexhepi arrived in Washington to attend Thursday's (5 February) annual National Prayer Breakfast. On Wednesday, he met with Secretary of State Colin Powell and Undersecretary of State Marc Grossman.
In December, the UN Security Council approved a document, presented by UNMIK chief Harri Holkeri, setting out the standards Kosovo must meet for talks on its final status to begin.
The standards -- including democratic institutions and the rule of law, freedom of movement, refugee returns, the economy, and dialogue -- aim to ensure the establishment of democracy in Kosovo.
The international community has made it clear that it will decide whether the province is ready for talks on its future status after a review of the progress in the targets' implementation by mid-2005.
"We stressed the importance of implementing the internationally endorsed standards and co-operating with the UNMIK to achieve that goal," US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said during a press briefing Thursday.
He said Washington continues to support UNMIK's and Holkeri's efforts "to bring about a multiethnic, democratic society in Kosovo, as defined by UN Security Council Resolution 1244".
Boucher stressed that the US administration has not yet taken a position on the outcome of status discussions.
Rexhepi has not been enthusiastic about dialogue with Belgrade.
At a gathering Thursday at the US Institute of Peace, he said the results of recent elections in Serbia did not make him optimistic about progress in this area.
He maintains that the only area in which Serbs and ethnic Albanians co-operated well was organised crime.
"It is one example, unfortunately, of how to co-operate. Sometimes Kosovo is only for transit.
Sometimes it is a final destination, because mainly the final destination of organised crime, drugs, and trafficking in human beings, is west Europe."
Also Thursday, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan indicated that changes to Kosovo's Constitution are possible, if two conditions are met.
Firstly, two-thirds of the parliament must approve the changes and, secondly, they must comply with UN Security Council Resolution 1244.
Annan's comments came during a discussion of the UN report on Kosovo.

The Croatian Privatisation Fund announced a new tender for the sale of an 80.2% stake in the local aluminium plant TLM on November 27th.
The minimum price is set at 6m euros.
The future owner must also invest an extra 92m euros in the next three years and retain the 1,400 employees in the first two years after the takeover.
The deadline for submitting bids is December 12th.
The World Bank has extended to Romania a $180m loan for support of the transport sector. The credit, which has a 17-year maturity and a 5-year grace period, will be used to finance an infrastructure maintenance programme for roads and railways.
Kosovo's consumer price growth fell from 2% year-on-year in September to 0.4% year-on-year in October.
The decline was attributed to a slowdown of food price growth and lower transportation costs.

Alarm in Turkey over violence against Christians
A spate of recent attacks has highlighted the threat religious minorities face, mostly from marginal ultranationalist groups.
By Ayhan Simsek for Southeast European Times -- 29/01/08

Adriano Franchini, a 65-year old Catholic priest, had just celebrated Sunday Mass at Izmir's St. Anthony Church when a teenager approached him, expressing an interest in converting to Christianity.
As the priest spoke with him, the young man -- actually a fervent nationalist -- flew into a rage and stabbed him in the stomach.
Franchini survived.
But three Protestant missionaries targeted in an attack earlier in the year were less fortunate.
They were tortured for hours before being killed by a group of young men in the eastern city of Malatya. In 2006, another Catholic priest -- Andrea Santoro -- was shot to death by a 16-year-old while kneeling in prayer.
Christians in Turkey face hostility not only from Islamic extremists, but also from ultranationalists who see their presence as a threat to national security.
Popular TV serials such as "The Valley of the Wolves" portray missionaries as agents in a plot by global powers to undermine Islam and the Turkish nation.
It was a TV show that reportedly inspired Franchini's assailant.
The wave of attacks -- and particularly the murders in Malatya -- has have shocked many Turks.
A majority Muslim but secular country, Turkey prides itself on religious tolerance.
The government and nearly all political groups strongly condemned the brutal death of the missionaries.
For critics, however, the violence is a sign that Turkey falls well short of EU standards for religious freedom.
Brussels has long complained that the country fails to fully protect non-Muslim minorities.
According to a lawyer representing the families of the slain missionaries, one of the killers had contacts with the local police.
Turkey's interior ministry has since launched an investigation.
The lawyer, Mehmet Ali Kocak, also complained that the indictment listed everyone in Turkey's Protestant community, giving detailed information about them.
That made the whole group a target, he argued, adding that authorities seemed more interested in highlighting Christian missionary activities than in exposing the real culprits behind the murders.
Another lawyer representing the victims' families, Orhan Kemal Cengiz, charged that local press in Malatya had carried out an anti-missionary campaign, which may have helped fuel the attack.
The missionaries included two Turkish citizens -- Necati Aydın and Ugur Yuksel – as well as a German national, Tilmann Geske.
Geske's wife, Suzanne, does not blame Turks in general for the extremism that took her husband's life.
She says she loves Malatya and wants to continue living there with her children.
"After this murder, people in the neighbourhood came to our house to pay their respects.
The imam of the house visited us to offer his condolences.
I have faith in Turkey's secular system and justice," Geske says.
Zafer Uskul, head of parliament's Human Rights Committee, has participated in the two trials related to the Malatya case, the second of which began on January 14th.
"Turkey is a secular state," Uskul said. "One of the essential necessities of state secularism is to guarantee the freedom of religion.
The state has to have an equal distance from all belief systems.
However, these people were killed because of their beliefs.
This is unacceptable."
Albanian Holidaymakers Flock to Summer Book Fair
Albanian vacationers who like to enjoy a good book at the beach had many titles to choose from, thanks to a regional book fair that toured several popular destinations.

During the summer season, tourists in Albania head for the beaches on the Adriatic and Ionian coast in order to swim, soak up the sun and relax with a good book.
This year, thanks to a regional book fair that toured a number of popular destinations, vacationers in search of summertime reading had thousands of titles to choose from.
Organised by the Association of Albanian Publishers (AAP), the fair toured the coastal cities of Ulcinj in Montenegro and Struga in Macedonia before moving to Albania, where it made stops in two locations: Saranda and Vlora.
Nearly 60 publishers from Albania, Kosovo and Macedonia participated, offering new releases for Albanian-language readers across the region.
During its stop in Ulcinj, Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic and his Albanian counterpart, Alfred Moisiu, paid a visit to the fair.
They used the occasion to praise relations between their two countries, describing the fair as a sign of ever-improving ties.
"We support the initiative as a good way to bring closer the cultures of two neighbouring countries.
This initiative comes in the framework of other political engagements.
Albania and Montenegro have to intensify the co-operation [between their] two cultures," the two heads of state said.
According to AAP president Fatmir Toci, the goal of the book fair is to "improve and enrich the atmosphere of tourism".
Each summer, the resorts are flooded not only with local tourists, but also by expatriates returning home to spend time with relatives and friends."We make a 'spiritual offering' for Albanian immigrants who are back on holidays during this summer season and fill the lack of Albanian literature in the Western countries where they live," Toci said.
The fair has received support from regional government authorities, local libraries and universities of the hosting cities.
Held in conjunction with the fair are other literature-related events, such as discussions with authors or promotional events launching new releases.
Macedonia to Amend Campaign Funding Provisions
As part of the country's efforts to combat corruption, Macedonia's election laws are being amended to provide for greater scrutiny of campaign financing.

"We cannot overlook the fact that in only a month, political parties in Macedonia spend dozens million euros," said Zoran Jacev of Transparency Macedonia. [File]
The Macedonian government has decided to amend its laws on elections, in accordance with a recommendation made by OSCE/ODIHIR with regard to the fight against corruption.
The most important changes concern the funding of political parties during campaigns.
Parliament is expected to adopt the legislation by the end of the year, in advance of the general election planned for 2006.
Under the amendments, parties will be obliged to maintain public accounts and release financial statements declaring their sources of funding along with the total amounts of money raised and spent.
That information will then be listed on an Internet site set up by the National Election Commission (NEC).
Donations from anonymous sources will be prohibited and the time limits for opening giro accounts for a campaign will be reduced.
In a provision seen as especially significant, parties that use resources gained through illegal activities risk having their candidate lists annulled.
Intensified proposed audits and inspections of the inflow and outflow of money to and from parties are of great importance in view of hampering corruption, experts believe.
"We cannot overlook the fact that in only a month political parties in Macedonia spend dozens of millions of euros," said Zoran Jacev of Transparency Macedonia. "No party has come out publicly to announce its campaign budget let alone reveal the origin of their money."
The amendments are intended to change that.
Within 48 hours of candidate list confirmation (that is, at least 35 days before a vote takes place), parties will have to open their giro accounts and submit them to the NEC, which will then release the information on the Internet.
Failure to comply with the deadline will mean the party must withdraw from the election in question.
Besides being available on the NEC's Internet site, the financial information declared by parties will have to be submitted to parliament, as well as to the National Audit Office within 30 days after verification of the mandates won in an election.
Under its operational programme for 2005, meanwhile, the National Auditor is expected for the first time to audit the accounts of the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia, VMRO-DPMNE, the Democratic Union for Integration and the Democratic Party of Albanians.
The auditor will inspect these parties' overall financial and material operation for the past year.
Particular attention will be paid to the campaign for the 2004 presidential election.
The groups which funded last year's referendum on territorial organisation are also set to come under scrutiny.
Prominent Turkish Novelist Charged Over Comments
Prominent Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk could face a prison sentence of up to three years if convicted on charges of "public denigration of Turkish identity" brought against him Wednesday.
(The Washington Post, Independent, RIA Novosti - 01/09/05; AP, Reuters - 31/08/05; RFE/RL -- 14/04/05 - 26/04/05; The New Yorker - 30/08/04)
Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk will be tried in December for controversial remarks about the massacres of Armenians and Kurds. [AFP]
A prominent Turkish novelist, who nine years ago described prisons in his country as "hell", now faces the prospect of jail time for speaking his mind.
On Wednesday (31 August), an Istanbul prosecutor charged Orhan Pamuk with insulting his country's national character over comments he made about the mass killings of Armenians and Kurds.
"Thirty thousand Kurds and 1 million Armenians were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares to talk about it," Pamuk was said in an interview published by the Swiss newspaper Tages Anzeiger on 6 February.
Turkey denies allegations that genocide was conducted against Armenians in 1915.
It insists that the estimates of the dead have been exaggerated, arguing also that people from all ethnic communities died in the turmoil of civil war as the Ottoman Empire collapsed, eventually giving way to the Turkish Republic in 1923.
Pamuk's comments concerning Kurds, meanwhile, refer to a decades-long conflict between separatist rebels and government forces, beginning in 1984.
Although the writer did not refer to the killings as "genocide," his remarks angered nationalists and politicians, prompting death threats as well as accusations of treason published in some Turkish newspapers.
In March, a senior official in Turkey's Isparta Province ordered the seizure and destruction of copies of his books.
Nearly seven months after Pamuk's interview with the Swiss paper, the public prosecutor in Istanbul's Sisli district decided that his remarks violated the country's penal code and indicted him on charges of "public denigration of Turkish identity".
The writer, whose trial is due to begin 16 December, could face a prison sentence of between six months and three years.
Turkey revised its penal code this year in a bid to bring it in line with international standards and to meet the EU requirements for membership.
But writers' and journalists' organisations view the changes as insufficient.
According to the Washington Post, Turkish law allows authorities to imprison people for differing with the government's line on issues of "fundamental national interest", including the 1915 killings.
Pamuk was "just trying to point out that first you have to face it -- a tragedy or a dispute or a problem, at least," Tugrul Pasaoglu, the writer's publisher and an editor at Iletisim publishing house in Istanbul, said Wednesday. "If you don't talk about it, then you can't find a solution."
Pamuk, 53, is one of Turkey's most famous novelists in at least a generation.
His literary career began with the publishing of "Cevdet Bey and His Sons" in 1982.
Since then he has written "The White Castle," "The Black Book" and "My Name Is Red".
In May, he was shortlisted for the BBC Four Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction for "Istanbul," his personal memoir of growing up in Turkey's biggest and busiest city.
In an article published by The New Yorker in August last year, John Updike said Pamuk qualifies as Turkey's "most likely candidate for the Nobel Prize".
The long list of prizes Pamuk has won for his novels include the 2003 Impac Dublin Literary Award for ''My Name Is Red'' and the prestigious peace prize of the Association of German Publishers and Booksellers, which he received earlier this year.
Serbia's Djokovic nets first grand slam tournament win

Novak Djokovic beat Frenchman Jo-Wilfred Tsonga in the Australian Open final Sunday (January 27th), becoming the first Serbian to win a grand slam tournament.
During the match, the streets of Belgrade and other Serbian cities were nearly deserted: cafes were packed with people watching the action.
Fans at the match held banners reading "Novak 4 president".
Djokovic beat Tsonga, 3-1 (4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 7-6).
However, tennis connoisseurs were even more impressed by Djokovic's play during the two-week tournament in Melbourne.
On his path to the title, Djokovic lost just one set -- in the final.
In the semifinal, he defeated the number one ranked player in the world, Switzerland's Roger Federer.
Djokovic was born in Belgrade on May 22nd 1987 and started playing tennis at four, despite his father's wish for him to play soccer.
He is currently ranked 3rd on the ATP list, was a finalist at the 2007 US Open and a semi-finalist at Roland Garros and Wimbledon in 2007, and has won eight titles.
Former tennis champion Mats Wilander of Sweden says that "the sky is the limit" for the young Serb, "because he is constantly improving".
"Djokovic's time is coming," Wilander said, warning that Federer and number two player Rafael Nadal may face a challenge to their rankings.
Djokovic was overjoyed with the victory, which netted him a large number of points towards his ATP ranking, as well as around $1.2m.
"This is something special … You spend two weeks here with all of the world's best players.
Then you end up as the champion -- the one man who won the tournament.
I cannot even comprehend what I have achieved during the past two weeks," Djokovic said.
He thanked his family and all those who stood by him for their support.
At every match, he was followed by his parents and two younger brothers wearing white sweatshirts, each emblazoned with one letter of his nickname – NOLE.
Djokovic said he wants to savor this win.
"I will take it slowly.
I am not going to think about achieving even higher goals.
I am in no hurry, you know.
I want to enjoy this success and celebrate it with the people who are important to me.
We will see what I will do after that."
Tsonga, who soared from 38th to 18th place on the ATP list after the Australian Open, congratulated Djokovic.
"See you next year," he said.
Djokovic's success was the pinnacle in a series of achievements by Serbian tennis players in Melbourne.
Nenad Zimonjic won the title in the mixed doubles category.
Ana Ivanovic advanced to the women's final and is now the second-ranked female player in the world.
Jelena Jankovic also made it to the semi-final and Janko Tipsarevic gave Federer a hard time, finally losing in the fifth set.
EU leaders announce new eurozone rescue deal
EU leaders announced on Thursday a new plan to contain the debt crisis in the euro area, after private banks and investors agreed to write off 50% of Greek debt from their books.

The leaders of the 27 EU nations agreed on a new package of measures aimed at containing the eurozone's lingering crisis after difficult overnight talks that ended on Thursday (October 27th).
The deal, which calmed global markets and was welcomed by international officials, was reached after private banks and investors agreed to take a 50% loss on their Greek holdings.
That would reduce the Balkan nation's total debt burden to 120% of GDP by 2020, down from 160% of GDP today.
The plan -- agreed upon after more than eight hours of closely watched marathon talks -- also includes a new 130 billion-euro bailout from the EU and the IMF for Greece to replace the 109 billion-euro one agreed to in July.
The package also includes a bank recapitalisation plan approved earlier, under which European banks will be required to keep a minimum capital buffer of 9%, forcing them to find an additional 106 billion euros by June 2012.
"The overarching goal of the exercise is to foster confidence in the European banking sector," EU President Herman Van Rompuy said at a news conference after the summit in Brussels.
The plan they agreed on also envisions increasing the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the eurozone's rescue fund, to at least 1 trillion euros, to prevent the debt crisis from spreading across the 17-nation club of EU nations using the euro.
"The package that we have agreed on tonight, a comprehensive package, confirms that Europe will do what it takes to safeguard financial stability," European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso said at the news conference Thursday morning.
Welcoming the deal, World Bank President Robert Zoellick praised the EU leaders and urged them to implement the measures, whose details are to be worked out by the end of this year.
"I'm hopeful that this first important step will lay the foundation for a broader approach that will focus on helping the world economy resume growth, overcome joblessness, and support innovations so we can get the world economy back on track," he said.
While reluctant to make any comments on specific elements of the plan in the absence of any details, Georgi Stoev, head of Industry Watch, a Sofia-based consulting company, said the new measures imply that new euros will be printed.
"This will push up inflation and reduce Bulgarians' purchasing powers," he told SETimes.
The new bailout for Greece will see the current arrangement of EC, IMF and European Central Bank auditors visiting the country every three months to review its progress in meeting the terms of the first bailout replaced by a "monitoring capacity on the ground".
Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou also hailed Thursday's agreement, pledging further domestic efforts.
"After the battle we have won, which is of huge importance for the country ... we will continue to work intensively so that Greece becomes productive," the AFP quoted him as saying on Thursday.
Romania's King Michael: trust democracy
King Michael I's historic moment was also a call for a mature and responsible political class.

The Romanian parliament buzzed with excitement on Tuesday (October 25th), when King Michael I of Romania delivered his first speech before the lawmakers in 64 years.
The main hall of sessions swarmed with MPs, rare for a legislature known for low rates of attendance.
The balconies were brimming with monarchists, in anticipation of the king's speech.
"The last 20 years have brought democracy, liberties and a beginning of prosperity.
Romania has evolved much over this period," the king said
Praising the role of the parliament in post-communist Romania, he warned "politics is a double-edge sword."
"It guarantees democracy and liberties if it is carried out with respect for laws and institutions.
But politics can bring harm to citizens, if it is applied to the scorn of law, personalising power and ignoring the primary role of state institutions," Michael I underlined.
He called on lawmakers to "trust democracy, the role of institutions and their rules" and rule not only by the laws, but also "by ethics and a sense of duty".
"Tomorrow's world cannot exist without morale, faith and memory.
Cynicism, narrow interest and cowardice should not take hold of our lives," the king said.
He called for development throughout the country by expanding infrastructure, a sector in which Romania lags significantly.
"Highways, modern ports and airports are part of our strength as an independent state," he stressed.
"It is only within our power to make this country stable, prosperous and admired in the whole world," he added. "I don't see today's Romania as a heritage from our parents, but as a country we borrowed from our children," King Michael concluded.
Historians assessed the significance of the moment and decrypted the message behind the speech itself.
"The king's speech was of historic character," Iulian Pruteanu-Isacescu, a historian and author of various articles on the royal dynasty in Romania, told SETimes.
"No word was uttered randomly in a speech that touched upon the fundamental ideals of an imaginary and ideal Romania: respect for the past, love for the country, morale, faith memory, identity and dignity.
His speech divides two worlds: a Romania of landmarks, still unaccomplished, and a Romania devoid of content, a country still at the gates of the East where nothing is done at ease," Pruteanu-Isacescu said.
The speech struck a sensitive chord with many Romanians.
"I associate the idea of kingdom with stability, rigour and rule of law," Ioan Grigore, a pensioner, told SETimes.
"I was young when he was deposed, but I remember he ruled over a society with entirely different values from the one we live in today … I have the feeling this is what Romania needs these days."
King Michael was forced out of Romania in 1948 when then pro-Soviet Prime Minister Petru Groza threatened him into abdicating the throne.
Earlier this year, President Traian Basescu accused King Michael of betraying the national interest by leaving the country in the hands of the communists.
Kosovo-Serbia free movement agreement faces rocky road
Starting Tuesday, citizens of Kosovo and Serbia should be able to drive across the common border, largely hassle-free, courtesy of a new accord.

Kosovo and Serbia are scheduled to implement part of a free movement of people agreement on November 1st.
The deal was hammered out over the summer during EU-mediated negotiations held in Brussels.
The head of Kosovo's team in those talks, Edita Tahiri, says that based on the agreement illegal car plates should be replaced with RKS or KS bearing plates -- designating post-independence Kosovo and UNMIK run Kosovo, respectively.
"We have extended the validity to car plates reading KS, [grandfathering] cars with those plates," Tahiri told SETimes.
However, Tahiri's Serbian counterpart in the Brussels talks, Borko Stefanovic, tells SETimes that cars bearing RKS plates will not be allowed to enter Serbia.
Implementing the rest of the agreement by the November 20th target may be more challenging as it includes the delicate issues of ID cards, driver's licenses and car insurance.
Stefanovic says that if Kosovo authorities attempt to confiscate identity cards deemed unacceptable, there will be repercussions.
"This time we have something that we have not had [before], and that is reciprocity.
Now, if Albanians take ID cards from Serbs in Kosovo it is possible for Serbian powers to take ID cards from Albanians when they are in Serbia."
"The Serb side is putting up obstacles," says Tahiri. "Instead of being led by the concept of allowing free movement, the Serb side creates complicated logistics which we have refused, and the EU has refused them as well."
She explains that those showing ID cards would also have to produce a piece of paper valid for entering and leaving both countries.
But the content of the paper is problematic.
"The Serb side insists on elements that do not comply with European principles; they want more data and unacceptable complications," Tahiri said.
Dren Zeka, Tahiri's chief political adviser, elaborates: "When asked to prove who an individual is, ID and the entry/exit proof letter are shown together.
The entry/exit proof letter will not contain a photograph, and the language on [it] will be procedural only.
In case it is lost, the individual must go to the nearest police station to get a receipt, [confirming] that he/she lost the entry/exit proof letter."
Tahiri explains that the model is based on other countries that have prickly relations with neighbours, such as Greece and Macedonia.
Kosovo analyst Belul Beqaj is sceptical, telling SETimes that the agreements struck in Brussels "cannot be implemented … without juridical guarantees".
The only agreement actually implemented at this point is the one on trade, involving the customs stamps.
The other three -- on free movement, the cadastral files and the mutual recognition of the university diplomas -- are pending.
November 20th is the target date because the EU Council of Ministers is to decide on enlargement in mid-December.
Political analyst Bogdana Koljevic, editor of the magazine New Serbian Political Thought, predicts "the consequences of implementing the agreement on free movement will be, above all, bad for the Serbs in Kosovo, because there is no balance."
"Kosovo Albanians will be able to move freely on the territory of Serbia, and the Serbs -- with the Serbian documents -- will not have that kind of freedom of movement.
These agreements were signed far more in favour of the Albanian side than the Serbian side."
Small Turkish village thinks big with wind power
To boost its domestic energy production, Turkey plans to invest in alternative energy.
One village is ahead of the curve.

Akbiyik, a small village in western Turkey, began looking into alternative energy methods three years ago after the government cut off the pump used to bring water to the fields and residents' homes, due to unpaid electricity bills.
The 365 residents of Akbiyik refused to pay their bills for the pump due to economic reasons and spite for the local government.
After the incident, village Mayor Mustafa Cicek proposed the idea of building a windmill to produce energy.
"The village had a small mill 200 years ago and I thought we could build a new mill to produce energy for the water pump," Cicek explained to SETimes.
He took his idea to the Bursa administration which was excited.
"They liked the idea so much," he said.
With the help of the Bursa administration and Ankara based energy company Soyut Construction and Engineering, the village began building the windmill in July 2008.
Villagers volunteered to help build the mill and the government and Soyut loaned the machines and equipment to set it up.
The windmill, which produces 50kWt of energy, cost 210,000 TL to build.
The state gave the village 140,000 TL and the residents of Akbiyik paid the rest.
After finishing the construction, the villagers had to wait two years before they could get permission to connect the windmill to the state electrical grid.
"We had to wait for the laws to change.
The old law stated that we cannot connect the windmill to the state power lines but officials in Ankara told us to wait, that they are changing the laws," Cicek said.
Turkey, a country that suffers from a massive current account deficit partly fed by the need for imported energy, is looking into ways to produce more energy on its own soil.
In what the local media calls "the biggest project in the history of the Republic", Turkey is currently developing its first locally produced wind turbine.
The project is called the National Wind Energy System project, and the turbine will start operating next year.
Akbiyik residents won't have to wait that long for their windmill to begun producing energy.
According to Cicek, the turbine will start operating any day now.
Villagers estimate that they will save 200-300TL annually per person because of the windmill.
According to former Mayor Ahmet Alp, some of the surrounding villages have shown interest in building their own windmills.
"One guy came from Iznik [30 minutes from Akbiyik] to check out the turbine," he told SETimes.
In the 1970s, Akbiyik was the second largest village in Yenisehir, but it now is among the smallest in the region.
Many young people have gone to Bursa for studies and work, and around 65% of the villagers are elderly.
The residents are hopeful that the windmill will attract more young people to Akbiyik.
"My 31-year-old son was planning to move out of the village but he decided to stay because of the windmill," claims Cicek.
In the next few years, Akbiyik is planning to replace the current windmill with a larger one.
"We want to build a bigger windmill so we can sell energy to other villages in the region," Cicek said.
Turkey, Armenia take steps to end row
Longtime foes Turkey and Armenia will begin consultations on two protocols.

Neighbours Turkey and Armenia made a step towards ending their almost century-old enmity Monday (August 31st) as they agreed to launch talks aimed at normalising ties.
The decision was announced in a joint statement by the Turkish and Armenian foreign ministries following months of bilateral discussions mediated by Switzerland.
The consultations would be completed within six weeks, after which the protocols would be signed and submitted for ratification to the Turkish and Armenian parliaments, according to the announcement.
"Both sides will make their best efforts for the timely progression of the ratification, in line with their constitutional and legal procedures," said a joint statement mediated by Switzerland.
While Turkey was among the first countries to recognise Armenia's independence in 1991, the two have not established diplomatic ties.
Their common border has been sealed since 1993, when Ankara closed it in protest of the former Soviet republic's backing of ethnic Armenian separatists in Azerbaijan's breakaway mountain region of Nagorno-Karabakh.
But the most divisive issue between the two nations stems from the massacre of up to 1.5 million Armenians between 1915 and 1917 in Turkey.
Armenians maintain that the mass killings were aimed at driving their kin out of eastern Turkey and constituted an act of genocide, a view supported by many Western historians and politicians, but staunchly rejected by Ankara.
While acknowledging that thousands of Armenians did indeed perish in the wane of the Ottoman empire, Turkey insists that the number of victims is exaggerated and attributes the killings to the turbulent times of World War I.
Armenian President Serge Sarkisian told the BBC Russian Service in an interview published Monday that a solution to the dispute over the killings nearly a century ago would not be a precondition for normalising ties between the two countries.
"It's important that historical justice be restored.
It's important that our nations are able to establish normal relations.
Finally, it's important that this is not repeated in the future," he stressed. "But we do not regard a recognition of genocide as a preliminary condition for establishing relations."
The US Department of State welcomed Monday's announcement.
"We urge Armenia and Turkey to proceed expeditiously, according to the agreed framework," State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said in a statement. "We remain ready to work closely with both governments in support of normalisation, a historic process that will contribute to peace, security and stability throughout the region."
The two countries began mending ties after Turkish President Abdullah Gul's unprecedented visit to Yerevan last September, when he and Sarkisian sat side by side during a World Cup qualifier match between their national football teams.
Sarkisian is scheduled to visit Turkey on October 14th, which will coincide with the return leg of the World Cup qualifier match between the two countries.
The Armenian president has suggested, however, that he might decide against travelling to Ankara if there is no tangible progress regarding the reopening of the common border.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu has suggested that a decision on the border issue is still not in the cards.
"A longer process is required for that," the AP quoted him as saying, in remarks broadcast by Turkey's NTV television Monday.
Turkish soap opera attracts regional audience
The magic in Onur's eyes ...
Turkey has hooked fans across Southeastern Europe with the must see hit on television, "Binbir Gece".
By Natasa Radic for Southeast European Times in Zagreb -- 20/12/10
Turkish soap opera "Binbir Gece" (1,001 Nights) has attracted fans all over Southeast Europe. [TMC]
When it first appeared on Kanal D in Turkey in 2006, "Binbir Gece" both scandalised and enthralled audiences with its main plotline in which an architect, Sehrazat Evliyaoglu, reluctantly agrees to sleep with her boss, Onur Aksal, in exchange for the money she needs to afford a bone marrow transplant for her young, desperately ill son.
Over time, romance blooms between the pair.
"We'd never seen this kind of serial before. It was a big question for every girl: would you accept this kind of offer?" said Banu Kilic, 32, a businesswoman from Istanbul who is a devoted fan of the show.
What makes it so exciting and realistic is the fact that it avoids unbelievable plot twists, in which "the main character learns that he is his own mother", notes one contributor to a "Binbir Gece" fan forum.
Although the series ended last year, the drama continued off-screen after a real-life romance blossomed between the leading couple, Halit Ergenc and Berguzar Korel.
Shortly after Ergenc divorced in 2009, the couple married and had a son.
Reruns remain a ratings hit, and the show has sparked significant interest in visiting Turkey, especially locations where "Binbir Gece" was shot.
Visitors specifically request guides who can provide inside scoop on the show and cast.
The protagonist, Onur (Ergenc), has attracted the most attention.
Despite his indecent proposal, legions of women view him as the ideal man.
"This guy has all these good qualities which are admired and demanded by every woman: being rich, romantic and in love so much with a woman. This was a good series for women," Nursel Onar, 34, an employment manager, says.
Onur's blue eyes hold a sort of fascination for Croatian women, too.
RTL broadcasts the soap opera every night.
When the actor visited Zagreb last month, fans greeted him like a superstar.
He's all over the tabloids, and even the more serious mainstream media are covering Onur-mania.
The show's lead actors filmed a TV commercial in Zagreb for the supermarket chain Konzum and were guests of the company for a few days, attracting crowds everywhere.
Onur-mania is a regional phenomenon. [Fanpop.com]
How pervasive is this popularity?
A Zagreb real estate ad last month gushed that an apartment for sale "looks almost exactly like Onur's".
In Serbia, soap operas have had a faithful audience since the 1990s.
Until just recently, 1,001 Nights, aired on weekdays in primetime on Prva Srpska TV and reigned supreme.
Its run ended on December 10th.
After broadcasting the final episode, Korel and Ergenc were guests in the TV studio, where audience members waved banners and had a chance to meet them.
When the Turkish stars took a stroll in downtown Belgrade, fans were surprised and delighted.
Certain travel agencies, determined to cash in on the show's popularity, are offering trips to Turkey dubbed Down Shahrazad's paths.
On Prva Srpska's website, viewers seem to have a real connection with the programme.
"Beautiful Onur.
The show is great!
I hope Onur will finally find happiness," writes a woman named Ivana.
Author Zoran Kesic hosts of one of the most popular talk shows in Serbia, "The Closing Time Republic", which airs on the same channel as 1,001 Nights did. "People get into soaps because they deal with simple, everyday topics and problems that everyone can understand.
People are attracted to tales of heartache, deception and betrayal," Kesic tells SETimes.
He doesn't watch soaps, since, as he puts it, they do not meet his criteria for quality TV programming. He has no problem, however, with those who do spend their time with Onur and the others.
There are plenty of people who fit that bill in Greece.
The centuries-old animosity between the Greeks and the Turks takes a backseat when it comes to soaps: "Binbir Gece" and a second Turkish show, "Kismet", both air in primetime on the private TV channel ANT1.
It is most popular among the 40-65 demographic.
Athens housewife Eva says she watches "Binbir Gece" because the show portrays customs -- such as respect shown by children towards elders and between husband and wife -- that once existed in Greece.

Dimitris, a 64-year-old retired Greek-American, watches Kismet because it reminds him of Greece in the early '70s ... "and there's plenty of action".
When asked why they don't watch US soaps, his wife Joanne said it's primarily because the show portrays a reality that's closer to "our culture". "It means something to us," she explains.
Georgia, a 50-year-old civil servant, never misses an episode. "It's so great to be able to see places I visited when I went to Turkey.
It's so nostalgic to think that I too once walked through those very streets," she says. "It's like being there."
But there are those who see the other side of the coin.
"It's total propaganda," says 43-year-old Marios, the CFO of a major shipping company.
"The comprehensive scenario of the series breaks the decades long stereotypes about Turkey as a country of Islamic orientation, and the position of a woman as uneducated, conservative and completely dependant from the male partner/companion/master, whether it was her husband or father or brother. That was not done accidentally," Sejn Husejnefendic, who works in the communications department at the Faculty of Philosophy in Sarajevo says.
"The beautifully 'packaged', perfumed, designer clothed and gender/age/culture adjusted elements promoted Turkey in the region more than the official diplomacy."
In neighbouring Montenegro, since TV Vijesti ago began broadcasting "Binbir Gece" a few months ago, the streets are virtually deserted for 45 minutes each evening.
It appeals to a broad spectrum there as well, women and men alike.
Journalist Igor Pejovic says he loves the show mainly because it is set in Istanbul. "That is a city that I always wanted to visit," he said. He also suggests the series dispels some preconceived notions about Turkey.
The series -- at least briefly -- meant booming business for translators.
In early September, Turkish textbooks were delayed because the industry was busy cashing in on the demand for Onur in all languages.
"You could not find any Turkish translators; they were all engaged in translations of the Turkish series," said journalist Vesna Kukanova.

Kosovo village's widows and orphans still struggling
A small Kosovo village is still enduring the consequences of a horrible massacre during the 1990s conflict.
Local widows and orphans make ends meet with just 130 euros per month, and hold hope that a conviction will ultimately lead to some degree of justice.

Krusha e Vogel, a small village near Prizren, close to the Albanian border, has a population of 700 -- including 82 widows and 145 orphans. On March 26th 1999, Serbian forces rounded up 70% of the village men, 114 in total, and executed them.
They burned the bodies; authorities have recovered and identified only 23 of them to date.
Around 2,000 people remain missing since the conflict -- and the 91 males from Krusha e Vogel are among them.
Six Albanian males from Krusha e Vogel survived the massacre and managed to escape.
One of the survivors, Qamil Shehu, lost his two sons, three brothers and seven nephews.
He saw them dying after being shot with machine guns.
Two of the survivors from Krusha e Vogel testified before the International Tribunal on the War Crimes in the former Yugoslavia in The Hague against former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
Today, Krusha e Vogel is a typical Kosovo village where widows, their children and orphans compose the majority of the population.
With 70% of the male population dead or missing, women must support their families and raise their children.
They grow tomatoes, potatoes and peppers and sell their produce at the Prizren market.
Most families depend on social assistance, which was recently increased from 45 euros a month to 130 euros a month.
Agron Limani, 41, an electrical engineer, is writing a book on the events during the conflict in Krusha e Vogel to publicise the needs of the widows and orphans.
Limani says that life in his village is difficult.
People can afford to buy only the basics: flour, cheese, tea, milk and macaroni.
"It happens quite frequently that we remain without any money," says Limani. Recently, a local company sent milk to the children of Krusha e Vogel, but, as Limani points out, "What would really help ... is some type of small business that would offer jobs".
"The war wiped out most of the men and left women and children in poverty," says Limani, who is filling pages with testimonies of one of the worst massacres in Kosovo.

In 2006, the Kosovo National Assembly passed a law allocating special funds to aid veterans and civilian victims of the war.
The payments began on March 1st 2008.
In July 2007, the government started drafting a law on behalf of families of missing persons.
Local and international institutions, representatives of the families and associations for missing persons' relatives are helping draft the law.
The draft foresees an increase in financial assistance, the right to know and a right to information.
It also includes the right of relatives to mark gravesites and memorials as a tribute to the missing.
The families tried hard to make authorities prosecute the murderers.
The Institute for War and Peace Reporting (IWPR) reported that the village's bereaved families wanted legal action against 54 Serbs and two Roma they named responsible for their relatives' abduction in late March 1999.
Encouraged by a network of local NGOs, they submitted their case, the first of its kind in Kosovo, to the public prosecutor at the Pristina district court.
IWPR also quoted Belgrade-based Humanitarian Law Centre lawyer Teki Bokshi as saying that "until now justice has been sought only for those who died during the war in Kosovo, but it is not fair for the missing to be deprived of justice just because they don't have a body to prove the crime -- massive hostage-taking is a crime too."
The families of the missing and their supporters believe the hope of conviction will ultimately lead to some degree of justice and at the very least discourage Kosovo Serbs implicated in the crime from returning to the region, IWPR said.
War crimes files still need review.
The new European mission in Kosovo will have to take care of them with its judges and prosecutors.
This will be one of the most difficult tasks, one neglected for almost ten years now.
But what families of the missing men of Krusha e Vogel want above all is a clear sign the killers will not be able to escape unpunished forever.
"Justice has not been done yet," Limani says.
Macedonia's Ivanov upbeat on future
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, says his country is willing to seek compromise on the name issue, but any solution must be an honourable one.

Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who took office in May, has several pressing issues on his agenda.
They include finding a solution to the longstanding Greece-Macedonia name dispute, gaining a start date for EU membership negotiations, and implementing visa-free travel.
The president is also seeking to close the gap between ethnic communities in Macedonia.
In an exclusive interview with SETimes contributor Goran Trajkov, he discusses his plans and policies.
SETimes: After becoming president, you began advocating a "reasonable compromise" with Greece on the name issue.
What is a reasonable compromise?
Would you support changing Macedonia's name?
Gjorge Ivanov: Macedonia is well-known for being a country that employs compromises and peaceful solutions in all its policies, including its foreign policy.
Therefore, Macedonia, its leaders and citizens, remain committed to the strategies of dialogue and compromise that will bring friendship, co-operation and prosperity for us, our neighbours and the whole region.
We have shown a clear political will because Macedonia wants to put this problem behind us.
The mediator, our partners and allies in EU and NATO, as well as many Greek leaders, know that an unprincipled compromise will not bring any good to any of our countries.
This is because a dishonoured and offended nation cannot be a real ally or friend.
Therefore, it is simply "reasonable" that all future solutions and compromises should bear in mind the need not to offend or disregard the identity and dignity of our citizens.
Only these kinds of compromises -- that cherish the traditions, values and identity of the citizens -- can be considered by the political leadership of the country.
SETimes: What is Macedonia's role in regional co-operation?
Ivanov Macedonia was and remains a crucial factor for the stability and security in the Balkan region.
We conceive that with our policies of constant increasing of the co-operation with all our neighbours and with our active role in the regional initiatives, our country is becoming stronger and more prosperous, and it supports the security and development of the whole region.
Ivanov strives to bridge the gap between Macedonia's ethnic communities. [Tomislav Georgiev/SETimes]
SETimes: Since Macedonia already has the status of being an EU candidate country, do you expect a date soon for starting negotiations?
Ivanov Macedonia, its leaders, all relevant political factors and the entire society are strongly dedicated to the process of euro-integration.
Our country has shown great political will in this process and our society is constantly reforming and has reached highest European standards in many areas.
It is more than clear that Macedonia has both strong political will and determination, and the needed institutional capacity to go through this process successfully.
SETimes: Recently, the European Commission gave Macedonia the green light for visa liberalisation.
What kind of impact do you expect this decision to have?
Ivanov The visa liberalisation process would be a great impetus for the European way of life and the spirit of every Macedonian citizen.
It would open wide the doors of cultural, education and business co-operation of our citizens with the citizens, businesses and institutions from around the continent.
And this is crucial for the further Europeanisation of our society.
The modernisation of our society in different sectors, the functional market economy and even the prospects for attracting [foreign direct investment] in the country have increased with this new development.
I strongly believe that this is a big step in the process of achieving fast and sustainable development of our society and its integration in the EU.
SETimes: You recently visited Croatia, which is already in the process of EU accession negotiations.
What were the main talking points with Croatian President Stipe Mesic?

Ivanov My official visit to Croatia was very productive and friendly.
Macedonia and Croatia have traditionally friendly relations and went together through many processes in the region.
Our countries share a dedication to regional co-operation and full Euro-Atlantic integration.
We went to Croatia with a large business delegation in order promote the possibilities for economic co-operation.
I think that the friendly relations between the two countries will be strengthened even further through the strong ties of our business communities.
SETimes: How do you plan to bridge ethnic divisions in Macedonian society?
Ivanov The multicultural character of our society is a European and Macedonian value.
Even more, the mechanisms for protection of the ethnic, religious and cultural identity of the citizens and communities which are integrated in the Macedonian Constitution are a courageous solution, and a bright example for any modern society.
The Ohrid Agreement has provided a strong framework for the unity of the country and our citizens, and has strengthened further the cohesion of the Macedonian society.
During my presidency, [through] all my initiatives, projects and activities, I am making efforts to promote the confidence and co-operation between different communities, as well as among citizens coming from different ethnic and religious backgrounds.
I will always emphasize to all our political leaders, but also all other relevant stakeholders in our society, that they have to promote these values of our nation, because they represent the authentic identity and real strength of the Macedonian society.

Serbian Parliament Debates Declaration on War Crimes
Serbian lawmakers are in the process of drafting a collective condemnation of all war crimes committed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia.

Serbian lawmakers are in the process of drafting a collective condemnation of all war crimes committed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia.
An outline is scheduled to be completed Tuesday (14 June), allowing the declaration to be discussed at extraordinary parliamentary sessions later this week.
However, the parties are still at odds over the exact contents of the declaration.
President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party insists that it contain text specifically condemning the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.
Others argue that war crimes committed against Serbs also be mentioned, according to Radio B92.
During a meeting last week, party representatives had agreed on a declaration that "condemns every crime committed during wars in former Yugoslavia and requests all competent bodies and services in the Republic of Serbia to urgently and efficiently investigate and bring to justice all individuals believed to have committed war crimes on the basis of grounded suspicion".
Crimes against civilians, "such as those committed in Srebrenica and Bratunac", should not only be commemorated at anniversaries, because a "crime is a crime forever and it must not be forgotten … The Serbian Parliament expects that parliaments of all countries in the region condemn war crimes committed during wars in former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia," the draft reads.
According to Serbian Parliament Speaker Predrag Markovic, the goal is "to get the highest state officials to condemn war crimes, and to change the climate in which individuals are talking about crimes".
"I believe now we're close to achieving it," Markovic added.
Slobodan Vucetic, the president of Serbian Constitutional Court, says the declaration is a political act and won't have any actual legal influence on the Serbian judicial system, or any concrete effect on the work of investigative panels.
Nevertheless, he says, it would provide a "strong political and moral message".
Response to the debate is mixed.
Some NGOs and activists say the text falls short of what is needed.
Speaking Saturday during a conference on the Srebrenica massacre, Humanitarian Law Centre Director Natasa Kandic characterised the draft as "mild", adding that it demonstrates that institutions still aren't ready to face the past.
Law professor Vojin Dimitrijevic, meanwhile, criticises the parliamentary initiative as "late".
Such a declaration should have been adopted five years ago, he says.
Parliament's move follows the broadcast on Serbian television of video footage showing the execution of six Bosnian Muslims from Srebenica.
On Tuesday, Croatian police announced they have detained a man believed to be among the Scorpions paramilitary unit members seen in the video.
The Serbian government has also arrested several ex-Scorpions members in connection with the killings.
EU Sends Mixed Signals on Enlargement
EU leaders, meeting for a key summit in Brussels on Thursday, will not discuss further expansion of the Union.
Instead, the declaration they will adopt Friday is expected to only briefly refer to decisions taken at previous meetings.
(AFP, International Herald Tribune, The Guardian, The Independent, Sofia News Agency - 14/06/05; AP, Reuters, AFP, BBC, VOA, The Guardian, EUobserver, EurActiv, EUpolitix, FT, HINA, Sofia News Agency - 13/06/05)

In a break from previous practice, EU leaders are not expected to discuss the further expansion of the Union at their two-day summit, opening in Brussels on Thursday (16 June).
Diplomatic sources suggested Monday that the final declaration of the high-level meeting this week would only briefly reiterate the EU's commitment to previous decisions on the issue.
The meeting in Brussels will be the first gathering of leaders of the 25 member nations since the recent French and Dutch "no" votes on the EU constitutional treaty.
The rejections were described as largely reflecting voters' discontent with national governments.
However, public concern over the Union's fast-track expansion was also cited as a factor.
Enlargement had initially been included in the provisional agenda of the Brussels summit.
Fearing that expansion is becoming less and less popular among some member states, however, EU foreign ministers decided in Luxembourg on Monday that an extended discussion should be avoided.
Because skipping the topic altogether could be viewed as a negative signal both by prospective member states and financial markets, the ministers decided that a generic clause about enlargement should be included in the declaration.
"The European Council recalls furthermore its conclusions of 16 December - 17 December on enlargement and underlines the need to implement them in full," Reuters quoted the draft as saying.
In December, the EU leaders set 3 October as the starting date for Turkey's accession talks, making it conditional on implementation of economic and political reform commitments, as well as on a protocol extending a customs agreement with the Union to cover its ten new member states, including Cyprus.
During Monday's meeting, the EU foreign ministers approved the text of the protocol and have reportedly sent it to Ankara.
Turkey is now expected to sign the document within weeks, thus meeting all the conditions set by Brussels for the start of its entry talks.
The progress of another candidate country, Croatia, hinges on full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
On Monday, the EU ministers pledged to revisit the issue of Croatia's membership talks at a meeting on 18 July.
They also urged Zagreb to make further efforts to implement its action plan aimed at resolving the case of fugitive war crimes indictee Ante Gotovina.
Croatia has "made progress which may lead to full co-operation", Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn, whose country currently holds the EU presidency, told reporters.
Bulgaria and Romania are viewed as the candidate countries most immediately concerned by the recent "no" votes to the EU constitution.
The two countries signed their accession treaties in April and are scheduled to join the Union on 1 January 2007.
In recent days, however, there have been calls for the postponement of their entry.
In an interview with the German newspaper Bild on Sunday, EU External Affairs Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner suggested that the process of enlargement should slow down.
"We need to give our citizens time to breathe," said the commissioner. "We must fulfil what we have said, but my idea is to reduce the speed of enlargement."
Speaking to the German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung, however, European Commission Vice President Guenter Verheugen said Bulgaria and Romania's EU membership remain among the Union's priorities.
Verheugen, who until last year was the EU's commissioner for enlargement, stressed that the process should continue despite the referenda results, warning that stability in Southeast Europe depends on it.
UN Begins Reviewing Implementation of Standards in Kosovo
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's special envoy Kai Eide has arrived in Kosovo on a mission to evaluate the level of implementation of democratic standards.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade – 14/06/05

With the arrival of Kai Eide, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's special envoy, in Pristina on Monday (13 June), the process of evaluating the implementation of democratic standards in Kosovo has been launched.
The internationally set standards are a prerequisite for the start of talks on the province's final status.
In late May, the Security Council made the decision to approve starting the review, with most members of the Council concluding that the time is right for a more detailed report on the implementation of standards.
Eide is expected to complete his report on the situation in Kosovo in about two months.
He and his team will also put together a report on the development of political processes in Kosovo, focusing on relations between ethnic communities and the process of decentralisation.
A positive report would clear the way for initiating the resolution of Kosovo's final status, probably in late September.
"The implementation of standards is just one component and I will also carry out a wider evaluation of the state of things in Kosovo, as requested by [Annan]," Eide said in Pristina. "I will travel around Kosovo to see different regions and to listen to people, so that I can get the best possible picture of what is happening on the field," the Norwegian diplomat added.
After visiting Pristina and talking with Albanian leaders and UNMIK representatives, Eide will travel to Belgrade on Wednesday to meet with top Serbian officials.
Also on Monday, EU ministers meeting in Luxembourg adopted a document defining the Union's future role in Kosovo.
It emphasises that the province's future status must be based on multiethnicity, the protection of minorities and monuments of culture, and an efficient fight against organised crime.
There is to be "no division" of the territory or joining with another country, the document adds.
The Union has announced that it will appoint its own envoy for Kosovo, who will co-operate with other diplomats handling the issue.
"We need co-operation from Pristina and Belgrade.
When we talk about standards, we talk about minorities' rights in different ways.
That is why these issues will be under the EU's watchful eye," said EU security chief Javier Solana.
Kosovo has been under UN protection since June 1999, when NATO forced former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw his army and police from the province, following a three-month bombing campaign.
UN report shows big differences in happiness in region
Cyprus is the happiest country in Southeast Europe, according to a recent UN-commissioned survey, listing Bulgaria among the ten unhappiest nations in the world.

Cyprus and Greece are the happiest countries in Southeast Europe, according to the first-ever World Happiness Report, published by the Earth Institute of Columbia University in New York on April 2nd.
The survey, covering 156 states across the globe, was commissioned for a high-level UN conference on happiness held in New York on the same day.
"GNP has long been the yardstick by which economies and politicians have been measured.
Yet it fails to take into account the social and environmental costs of so-called progress," UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the meeting.
The conference was called and hosted by the government of Bhutan, where the idea of using happiness as a measurement of national prosperity and good governance was born in 1972.
Eventually, the tiny Himalayan kingdom adopted the goal of Gross National Happiness (GNH) rather than GNP.
According to Jeffrey Sachs, the director of the Earth Institute, who co-edited the World Happiness Report with Richard Layard of the London School of Economics and John Helliwell of Canada's University of British Columbia, gains in GNP cannot alone promote happiness.
The United States, which was placed 11th in the world in the report, "has had a three time increase of GNP per capita since 1960, but the happiness needle hasn't budged," Sachs said at the UN meeting.
"Other countries have pursued other policies and achieved much greater gains of happiness, even at much lower levels of per capita income."
Compiled on the basis of various national and international surveys from 2005 through mid-2011, Cyprus emerged as the highest-ranking country in Southeast Europe again, placing 35th in the world.
Crisis-hit Greece, which stood on the brink of default for months on end last year, was ranked the 42nd happiest nation, well ahead of the other 11 countries in the region.
"It may be that they [the authors] have used data from 2008 and 2009, at the latest, thus it may be dated, in other words, pre-crisis, probably," Dr Maria Simosi, a lecturer in organisational theory and product and systems design at the University of the Aegean, told SETimes.
"However, Greeks may continue to score high if the social cohesion [parametre] remains high, in comparison to other similar countries undergoing an economic crisis."
Unemployment, which causes as much unhappiness as bereavement or separation, according to the UN report, has been rising in Greece since the crisis began, and currently stands at 21%.
Asked to comment on the country's good standing in the global table, Helliwell said that the rankings "are based on average scores for 2007 to early 2011, and are not likely to reflect current events."
"We hope in a subsequent report to start to show and account for changes over time," he told SETimes.
Of the other 11 regional countries, Croatia was ranked 56th, ahead of Kosovo (68th), Moldova (75th) and Turkey (78th).
Romania was placed 80th in the world, while Montenegro (86th), Albania (88th) and Bosnia and Herzegovina (99th) were the only other countries from the region to make it among the top 100.
Serbia and Macedonia took the 118th and 127th slots, respectively, while Bulgaria (147th) emerged as the 10th unhappiest country in the world, ahead of eight African countries and Haiti, which was hit by a devastating earthquake in 2010.
Assistant Professor Zaharina Savova, a Sofia-based clinical psychologist and psychotherapist, was not surprised by Bulgaria's poor ranking.
People feel happy when they are able to achieve their goals, be they material, spiritual or social, she said, noting that whatever people do with their lives, it should be in harmony with their inner nature.
"Bulgarians tend to always complain and to notice mainly the negative sides of things, and we rarely praise or encourage each other," Savova told SETimes. "Therefore, when one lives in an environment dominated by repudiation and discontent, one is affected by that negative energy in the air and can hardly feel happy.
We are afraid to rejoice at being happy, so we are unable to fully enjoy that feeling."
The study ranked Denmark, Finland, Norway and the Netherlands as the happiest countries in the world with life evaluations averaging 7.6 on a 0-to-10 scale.
Togo was named as the unhappiest of all 156 surveyed nations, behind Benin, the Central African Republic and Sierra Leone.
The average score of the four sub-Saharan countries was 3.4.
"Happier countries tend to be richer countries," the report said, noting that incomes in the top four nations are 40 times higher than those in the bottom four.
However, more important for happiness are factors such as having friends to count on, sense of freedom to make life choices, healthy life expectancy and absence of corruption, it added.

Adriatic Group advances regional security co-operation
Regional defense leaders pledged a joint approach to Euro-Atlantic integration and to addressing common security challenges.

The efforts by the Adriatic Group to advance regional security co-operation and its members' decision to jointly approach NATO membership ahead of the Alliance's summit next month is a step forward, according to analysts.
The defence ministers from the Adriatic Group -- Albania, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Kosovo -- signed a declaration during their congress in Skopje last month asking NATO to clearly state at the upcoming meeting in Chicago that it is committed to its "open door" membership policy.
"NATO is the best guarantor of regional security.
The regional countries are working jointly to [advance] the defence concepts and not be discouraged by the bureaucratic procedures," said Montenegro's defence minister, Milica Pejanovic Djurisic.
Analyst Pande Lazarevski of the Pavel Shatev Institute told SETimes that the declaration also shows the regional countries are ready to join the Alliance, not only on individual basis but also as a regional group.
"The declared readiness to enter and build the collective defense system jointly is an important step forward in the accession process," Lazarevski said.
He explained it is equally important that NATO members Croatia and Albania pledge to provide continued support to aspiring members Macedonia, Montenegro and BiH.
"Croatia and Albania still participate in the Adriatic Group, more out of political solidarity, though they also benefit from it in a wider sense," Lazarevski added.
Retired Colonel Petar Shkrbina, a military-security analyst, told SETimes that the Skopje conference was also intended to prepare the ground for Kosovo's and BiH's NATO candidacy.
This, he said, explained Serbia's absence at the gathering.
"The US secretary of state announced that Kosovo should become a NATO member candidate.
The plan should materialise fairly soon.
Agim Cheku was present in Skopje in his capacity as Kosovo defense minister," Shkrbina said.
"As for BiH's candidacy, it will be problematic because of the status of Republika Srpska," he said.
At the conference, Cheku pledged "Kosovo is ready to help build regional security and stability and it is time to join the charter," and, importantly, expressed regret at Serbia's absence.
In light of the security vacuum created by Greece blocking Macedonia's NATO accession, the group pledged support for Macedonia as part of the declaration, asking the Alliance to grant membership "as soon as possible."
Macedonia President Gjorge Ivanov requested that NATO re-examine its 2008 Bucharest summit decision -- when it deferred to Greek demands.
"Macedonia meets all membership requirements and NATO countries should take into account the ICJ verdict, which found Greece in violation of international law blocking Macedonia's Alliance entry," Ivanov said.
He expressed hope that Greece will respect its responsibilities from the 1995 interim agreement with Macedonia.
"That is a most reasonable solution.
The interim agreement stipulates Macedonia can become a member of international organisations under the UN provisional reference 'the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia'.
Greece had agreed with this decision," Tony Deskoski, an international law professor at the Ss Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje, told SETimes.
The group also said that steps need to be taken to implement a multinational air defence.
It called for joint regional projects like the forming of regional medical teams, networking all training centres and expanding co-operation in the natural disasters arena.
"This is a clear determination to apply NATO's smart defence concept to use collectively the existing regional defense capabilities, which will at least reduce the regional security risks and threats," Dimitar Mirchev, a former ambassador and a professor at Ss Cyril and Methodious University, told SETimes.
Forming a regional council similar to Scandinavia's Nordic Council to develop energy, infrastructure, transportation, food and environmental projects to advance the defence concepts should be the next step, said Macedonia's former Foreign Affairs Minister Srdjan Kerim.
The model is applicable because not all Balkan countries can participate in different projects thereby offering away out of bi-lateral disputes which have stifled progress.
Croatia's elections, final countdown for HDZ?
Can Croatia's ruling party find its way out of recent scandals and win Sunday's elections by playing the nationalist card?

Two major political groups, the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), and the parties grouped in the Kukuriku coalition -- the Croatian Social Democratic Party (SDP), Croatian People's Party (HNS), Istrian Democratic Assembly (IDS) and the Croatian Party of Pensioners (HSU) -- will battle it out Sunday (December 4th).
According to the latest polls, Kukuriku has a significant advantage over HDZ, which remains mired in the throes of corruption scandals.
Hrvoje Sadaric, the Croatian State Election Commission (DIP) spokesman, told SETimes that the Commission received reports on campaign financing and will report on any irregularities.
"During the election campaign, current data showed a decline in irregularity complaints compared to the previous parliamentary elections held in 2007.
This parliamentary election marked the first time the law on financing political activities and election campaigns was applied and greatly raised the level of electoral transparency," Sadaric said, adding that around 4,000 registered observers will monitor the election.
Commentators and experts viewed the campaign as dull, saying that party platforms and programmes are largely the same as in the last campaign.
Boris Pavelic, a Zagreb-based journalist at the daily Novi List, told SETimes that HDZ's re-election campaign was pointless.
"It seems like HDZ cannot offer anything after all the scandals b
efalling it. Kukuriku coalition, however, has a huge advantage, perhaps because it doesn't have to address specific issues [like scandals]," Pavelic noted.
HDZ, he pointed out, mainly emphasised national identity, while the coalition leaders sought to defuse tensions and conflicting rhetoric.
Zdravko Petek, a political science professor in Zagreb, described the campaign as "horribly boring" and said parties did nothing to encourage people to vote.
"We covered campaign research in previous years; I can say that political parties in Croatia do not differ by policy, only by ideology.
For example, the difference is whether a party is closer to the Catholic Church or not.
Nobody mentions how to fix the health system, education and other social issues far more important than ideology," Petek told SETimes.
He added that the campaign offered nothing new, and stressed it is already clear that Croatia will have a different government after the December 4th elections.
Party officials from the Kukuriku coalition are expecting good results, in light of public frustration with the current government.
Dusko Kisberi, spokesman for the Istrian Democratic Assembly (IDS), told SETimes, "A number of people, who elected the current government, are unlikely to vote [now], which may explain slightly higher voter abstinence, compared to ... elections in 2007."
The ruling HDZ, however, continues to play the "nationalist card" in attracting voters, and polls suggest that the diaspora will predominantly vote for the party.
"HDZ has its traditional electorate in Bosnia and I'm sure that this election will be a success.
However, it is possible that turnout could be lower because of the reduced number of polling stations.
But in the end, there will be no problem for HDZ in Bosnia," Ivo Miro Jovic, one of the Mostar-based HDZ diaspora candidates, told SETimes, adding that nearly 300,000 BiH Croats, who hold Croatian citizenship, are expected to vote.
While HDZ is taking full credit for Croatia's EU accession prospects, nearly 40% of citizens still oppose joining the EU.
Zagreb resident Stevan Tripunovic told SETimes that he will vote, but predicts that once the country joins the EU, the politicians will not talk to citizens the same way anymore.
"It's like you're the last one to enter the amphitheatre for an exam.
Everybody, the students and the professors are scanning you. I think that we will feel that way when we enter [the EU]," Tripunovic added.
Nadica Narancic, a Zagreb pensioner, told SETimes that she will not vote because she has "better things to do" on Sunday.
"It's my right not to vote.
Every government will be the same.
Regardless of who is elected, my pension will not get a raise.
I can't wait for this election story to finish, so they can stop bombing us with their splendid ideas and proposals," said Narancic.
Thaci looks to US for support in continuing dialogue
Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci told officials in Washington that the Western Balkans still needs the strong focus and presence of the US and the EU.

Analysts in Kosovo believe that Prime Minister Hashim Thaci's visit to the US last week was an important step to keep the US involved in helping to smooth tensions with Serbia, and to maintain Kosovo's EU integration track.
Thaci visited Washington to discuss Kosovo's role in the Balkans.
He met on Wednesday (April 4th) with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and on Thursday with US Vice President Joe Biden.
Thaci asked for the continuation of the US role not only in Kosovo, but in the whole Western Balkans.
"Prime Minister Thaci asked Vice President Biden that the US continue to play this decisive role and remain promoters of the integration processes for Kosovo to the Euro-Atlantic structures," the prime minister's office said in a statement.
In a statement, the White House said Biden reiterated US support for Kosovo's sovereignty, and congratulated Thaci on the progress in dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade.
"The United States strongly supports the dialogue and looks forward to the full implementation of agreements reached between Kosovo and Serbia, which will benefit the people of both countries."
After meeting with Clinton, Thaci said all countries in the region share the same goal and the same vision for the European integration and NATO membership.
"But to make that happen, we still need the strong focus and presence of the United States of America and EU, not only in Kosovo but also in the rest of the Western Balkans," he added.
Kosovo and Serbia recently agreed to a compromise that allows Kosovo to represent itself in regional talks by calling itself "Kosovo*" – the footnote indicates: "This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSC 1244 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo declaration of independence."
The agreement was initially hailed as a breakthrough that also allowed Serbia to gain EU candidate status, but representatives of both countries, within days, walked out of meetings over disagreements about how Kosovo was being identified.
Serbia has also announced presidential, parliamentary and local elections for May 6th, which it says will include Kosovo.
Pristina has threatened to stop the vote in its borders, by force if needed.
Ilir Ibrahimi, vice president and chief operating officer of the American University in Kosovo, said the US continues its interest in preserving Kosovo's territorial integrity.
"I think the issue of the north that should be solved from the Kosovo side, with the help of the international friends, and by ensuring the Serb citizens of the north all the rights foreseen in the constitution of the Republic of Kosovo," Ibrahimi told SETimes.
Ramadan Ilazi, co-founded of Kosovo "Fol" (Speak Up) Movement, said Kosovo politicians have always been sceptical of EU foreign policy, especially on its role as a mediator in the relations between Kosovo and Serbia.
"That's why Kosovo had insisted on a US role in the latest negotiations.
The visit is about confirming the US support for Kosovo, the support for the agreements reached in the dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade and to encourage Thaci to continue this process," Ilazi told SETimes.
Ilazi said that situation in northern Kosovo is unstable and a new modus vivendi should be found, "which should be a process that leads to the incorporation of the parallel system in the North in the general system of the state of Kosovo as it has been done with the municipalities of Gracanica and Shtime."
International criminal court hopes to continue legacy
The ICTY continues to find and prosecute war crimes indictees.
SETimes talked with spokeswoman Nerma Jelacic.
By Tzvetina Borisova for Southeast European Times -- 02/12/11
ICTY spokeswoman Nerma Jelacic. [Nerma Jelacic]
Since its establishment in 1993, the UN International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has been working to bring to justice those responsible for war crimes committed during the Balkans conflicts in the 1990s.
SETimes discussed the tribunal's past challenges and continued legacy with spokeswoman and war crimes victim Nerma Jelacic.
SETimes: The ICTY is tasked with bringing to justice the conflict's war criminals and to bring justice to their victims.
What has been the biggest challenge in this endeavour?
Nerma Jelacic: The tribunal has faced numerous challenges from the very onset of its existence.
It was the first tribunal of its kind, set up in the midst of the conflict at a time when local courts would have been incapable of investigating and prosecuting crimes themselves.
As such, it faced the daunting task of setting itself up from scratch: from its rules and procedures, the manner in which to conduct investigations and secure state co-operation in obtaining evidence and in apprehending the accused, to the management of court documents, the running of a detention unit and the protection of witnesses.
The challenge of dealing with complex cases arose as soon as the first cases started … necessitating a fine balance between the right of the accused to a fair trial and the need to ensure the trials were conducted in as efficient a manner as possible.
This challenge increased with the adoption of the completion strategy in 2003, which required the tribunal to speed up proceedings in such a way that it did not, in any way, affect their fairness.
The tribunal's mandate exceeds simple prosecution to include activities outside the courtroom that contribute to peace and stability. In 1999, the tribunal established the Outreach Programme, the very first communications programme of its kind in the history of international justice, with the goal of bringing the work of the tribunal closer to the people of the region.
Now it is the tribunal's legacy that poses one of its greatest challenges.
For the tribunal to successfully fulfil its mandate, it is absolutely crucial that it ensures its legacy keeps resonating long after it has closed its doors.
SETimes: How do judges at the ICTY manage to stay unbiased, considering the emotional impact of most cases?
Jelacic: It is the judges' duty to remain impartial and abide by the strictest standards of the rule of law.
All judges at the tribunal are highly professional and experienced.
It is solely on the basis of the evidence presented in court that judges render their judgments.
SETimes: If you could name one case that has left the biggest mark in the ICTY's work, or has been a turning point, what would it be?
Jelacic: It is impossible to point out any one case in particular.
All cases have played a crucial role in providing an opportunity for victims to step forward and testify and in doing so, bring them a sense of relief and justice.
And all have played an important role in developing international criminal and humanitarian law.
SETimes: When do you expect the ICTY to complete its tasks and eventually close?
Jelacic: The tribunal is still guiding its work in accordance with the last Completion Strategy Report, which was submitted by the President to the UN Security Council last spring.
The next report will be made later this year and the tribunal is taking all necessary measures to complete its remaining work by no later than end of December 2014.
All cases for which appeals will be filed after July 2013 will be dealt with by the Residual Mechanism, which will start functioning next year for the ICTR (International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda) and in 2013 for ICTY.
In the second part of this interview, Jelacic talks about the ICTY's activities aimed to prepare local courts in the Western Balkans to deal efficiently with war crimes cases.
EU urges pragmatism in Kosovo-Serbia talks
Serbian officials claim KFOR is trying to derail Serbia's EU membership candidacy despite the fact the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue resumed and President Boris Tadic called for the removal of barricades in northern Kosovo.
By Linda Karadaku and Ivana Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Pristina and Belgrade -- 02/12/11

At its meeting Thursday (December 1st) on the security situation in Kosovo, NATO welcomed Serbian President Boris Tadic's call to Kosovo Serbs to remove road barricades in the north.
"This proposal could greatly assist to reduce the tensions.
However, KFOR would like to see that positive proposal have a real impact on the ground," KFOR commander Erhard Drews said.
NATO urged both Kosovo and Serbia to exercise restraint, co-operate fully with all international actors to ensure freedom of movement right away, and continue the EU-facilitated dialogue.
EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said she is in direct contact with Tadic and has requested that the barricades are removed and he work to influence those who provoke violence.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule met in Brussels with Kosovo EU Integration Minister Vlora Citaku, and told her the Union will continue to support Kosovo regarding visa liberalisation, participation in EU programmes and concluding a trade agreement.
"I also underlined the importance of Kosovo launching a comprehensive agenda for the north," Fule said.
He encouraged Kosovo, ahead of the General Affairs Council meeting on Monday, to continue the positive engagement in dialogue with Belgrade.
"Progress in the dialogue will help to bring both Pristina and Belgrade closer to the EU and help them fulfill their European prospects.
Both sides should be pragmatic, creative and flexible during the discussions, in the interest of the citizens of both Kosovo and Serbia and the region at large."
Serbia's Ministry for Kosovo State Secretary Oliver Ivanovic told SETimes that KFOR is forcing conflict in order to derail Serbia's EU membership candidacy scheduled for review on December 9th.
Despite Tadic's last statements that "Serbian interests today are not defended at barricades, though they may have been needed last July when Pristina initiated the unilateral action to capture the crossings," -- Kosovo Serbs remain distrustful.
"We have not as a final goal permanently remaining at the barricades, but also do not have an answer what will happen with Jarinje and Brnjak if they are removed.
We are afraid of [Kosovo special police] ROSU's arriving because it would mean termination of all relations with Serbia.
But, if our country leaves us to ourselves, it should tell us that.
It is not all right when President Tadic repeats that 7.5 million Serbs can not suffer because of us, hundreds of people, and because 'Europe has no alternative'," Zvecan Mayor Dragisa Malovic told SETimes.
Malovic explained that Kosovo Serbs need Serbia's support as they have no other country but Serbia.
"This is a constitutional issue and the president should deal with it, and mayors are here to be with the people and prevent disorder," he said.
Political philosopher and editor of the New Serbian Political Thought magazine Bogdana Koljevic told SETimes that Serbia's incoherent and inconsistent position has had a negative effect.
"Everything we saw in recent months ... is a changing attitude so we can not be absolutely sure what is Serbia's and what has changed, and it is obvious something has changed.
There is not doubt any longer the barricades and all that the Serbs in northern Kosovo enjoyed is not linked to Serbia's EU candidacy.
Even if there was willingness to keep [Serbia's] Kosovo and EU policies together, realising it has proved impossible."
Koljevic is adamant there should be no pressure on Kosovo Serbs to decide what to do next, because their attitude and their opinions must be taken into account.
Malovic said all negotiations and agreements by chief negotiator Borislav Stefanovic have damaged the Kosovo Serbs as they are now forced to drive cars with Kosovo license plates and address court authority that has nothing [to do] with Serbia.
Most of all, he said, they are afraid an agreement will be reached for Kosovo customs officers to be placed at the Jarinje and Brnjak crossings, though Stefanovic denies this is a possibility.
The Serbian government formed an Office for Professional and Operational Tasks that will assist Stefanovic and his team in administrative and technical matters and in furtherance of the agreements.
Serbian Renewal Movement MP Aleksandar Jugovic told SETimes the Serbs in northern Kosovo accept proposals from Serbia with difficulty and that achieving dialogue for them is most important.
"The barricades were totally unnecessary; they are against the interests of the Serbs from Kosovo and against the interests of Serbia.
The Serbs should withdraw from the barricades under the influence of common sense, because if KFOR uses the powers it received from the Kumanovo Agreement it would be disastrous for the Serbs in northern Kosovo, south of Ibar and for entire Serbia.
The barricades must be removed," Jugovic said.
Tadic urges Kosovo Serbs to take down barricades
Has Belgrade made a major policy turn ahead of an expected decision on candidate status?
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 02/12/11
The barricades do not help the defense of Serbian national interests in Kosovo and Metohija," Serbian President Boris Tadic said. [Reuters]
Just over a week before Serbia's candidacy review in the EU, Serbian President Boris Tadic urged Kosovo Serbs and KFOR to cool down tensions and avoid casualties surrounding the barricades local Serbs erected in late July to oppose the deployment of Kosovo customs officers at the border crossings to Serbia.
On Tuesday (November 29th), Tadic also called on KFOR to stop removing the barricades, saying that the operation carried risks, jeopardized the lives of citizens and did not contribute to the resolution of the situation in Kosovo's north.
"The barricades do not help the defense of Serbian national interests in Kosovo and Metohija; on the contrary, they jeopardize them.
The blockade must be abolished and transport and communication must be ensured, with the continuation of the fight for Serb rights," Tadic said.
At a meeting of the EU foreign ministers on Thursday, High EU Representative for Foreign Policy and Security Catherine Ashton backed Tadic's call.
"I am very concerned about violence in the north, I am very concerned that you will both be able to make progress towards Europe," Ashton said.
Political representatives of the Serbs from northern Kosovo, however, received Tadic's call with restraint.
Kosovo Mitrovica Mayor Krstimir Pantic told SETimes that Tadic's call "came as an unpleasant surprise to me, as well as to the other Serbs in northern Kosovo, who have been at the barricades for four months now. "
Pantic also said the representatives of the municipalities in northern Kosovo could not decide on their own whether the barricades would be removed -- they must consult with the deputies in their municipalities.
Milos Z., a citizen of Kosovska Mitrovica, tells SETimes he does not understand why Tadic has only just now called for the removal of the barricades. "
We have been at the barricades for four months.
Why hasn't he urged us to move from the barricades sooner, if he feels that way?
Why didn't he remove us after the clashes with KFOR on September 27th?" he asked.
Milos thinks this was done under pressure from the EU over Serbia's potential membership candidacy, which will be decided at the EU summit on December 9th.
"It's not fair to sacrifice us for the candidacy. We've been fighting to live in the state of Serbia for 12 years and we are now very affected by Tadic's position," he said.
Certain analysts also believe this is a big turn in Tadic's Kosovo policy.
"Tadic's call is a last throw of the dice ahead of the December 9th deadline that will determine whether or not Serbia secures candidate status," Ian Bancroft, co-founder of the organisation TransConflict, which deals with the resolving of conflicts in the Balkans, told SETimes.
"It is a U-turn that is designed to appease those European countries -- particularly Germany -- who have repeatedly called on Belgrade to do more to, in their view, 'tame' the north," he said.
"The problem for Tadic is that Europe has asked him to deliver more then he is capable of delivering, particularly when it concerns the so-called 'parallel institutions' in the north.
This latest attempt to placate the EU is unlikely to be sufficient, and will resonate badly with an electorate increasingly perceiving the EU's conditions on Kosovo as akin to blackmail," Bancroft said.
However, Kosovo Compromise project director Aleksandar Mitic says Tadic's call is no surprise, because it is a continuation of the "self-destructive policy" that makes moves under pressure.
"By calling for the removal of the barricades, Tadic has 'played it safe' -- on the one hand, he wanted to absolve himself of responsibility for any sort of violence, while on the other hand showing Berlin he has done everything in his power, but wields no influence over the Serbs in northern Kosovo," he said.
According to him, it is possible that Tadic's call will be enough for Serbia to obtain candidate status this month, but that status is not particularly important without the setting of a date for the beginning of negotiations with the EU.
"However, the Kosovo Serbs do not trust Tadic and will continue, one way or another, to obstruct any establishment of Pristina's authority in northern Kosovo," Mitic said.
Turkish opposition tries to make a mark on foreign policy
Foreign policy, long a non-issue in elections, is increasingly important to voters.
By Alakbar Raufoglu for Southeast European Times -- 28/04/11

Since the rise of the governing Justice and Development Party (AKP) in 2002, opposition parties have not figured prominently in the development of Turkey's ambitious foreign policy agenda.
However, the political shake-up of the Republican People's Party (CHP) over the past year may change this trend.
In late March, five heavyweights from the main opposition CHP -- deputy chairmen Osman Koruturk, Gulsun Bilgehan, Umut Oran, Faik Oztrak and adviser to chairman Faruk Logoglu -- visited Washington to introduce the party's new foreign policy platform ahead of the June 12th election.
"We have been welcomed with extraordinary interest at the top level," Logoglu, former ambassador to the US, told SETimes after a series of talks with congressional and State Department officials.
"Our foreign policy platform that we introduced to the American partners is based on principles of faithfulness and transparency," he said, adding the AKP's diplomacy lacks realism and effectiveness.
Koruturk, son of Turkey's sixth President Fathi Koruturk, believes that while the opposition has been out of power, the AKP radically changed Turkey's image on the international stage.
"Today we have been asked unexpected questions about constraints on [everything] from human rights freedoms to Turkey's regional position in its neighbourhood," he told SETimes, adding that instead of maintaining a consistent foreign policy, the AKP uses diplomacy for its domestic political interests.
"For instance," he argues, "many in the West believe Turkey is not displaying the exact leadership role expected from it concerning the social movements in the Middle East, while the AKP tries to take advantage of this and get the votes of the [religious] believers in the country."
Logoglu is mainly concerned about Turkey's relationship with the West. "We have seen that the most striking opinion about Turkey was the perception that the country's democracy was going backwards," he says.
AKP deputy leader Salih Kapusuz defends his party's policies, telling SETimes, "These are all the opinions of the opposition; we have our own truth which is accepted by the whole world as Turkey's official position.
We keep no secrets from our people or international partners -- we do tell the truth in Washington, in the East, or in the heart of Turkey."
Concerning US-Turkish relations, Kapusuz says, "Our countries are partners, but is doesn't mean that we should support Washington's mistakes."
Yusuf Tekin, a political scientist at the Ankara based think-tank the Institute of Strategic Thinking, says as in every election campaign, all parties focus on foreign policy in their platforms, but this is the first time that -- due to the Middle East uprisings -- people are more interested in Eastern politics than Western.
"The AKP understands that very well," he told SETimes. "Therefore it doesn't try to get support from the West at the moment."
"But with the CHP the situation is different," Tekin adds, arguing that as a party underpinned by secular policy, the main opposition seeks support from the West.
"Turkish people witness that the country's international point of view is gaining more authority, and it plays an important role in international relations," Kapusuz insists.
"The results of AKP politics will be shown at the June 12th elections."
The AKP is expected to win again, while the CHP will remain the main opposition party.
Bulgarian Ruling Party Starts Election Campaign
Bulgaria's ruling party has launched its campaign for the 25 June parliamentary elections, hoping to win a second mandate.
Recent polls, however, suggest it may face an uphill battle.
(bTV, Vsekiden.com - 27/03/05; BTA, Sofia News Agency - 23/03/05)

With polls showing it faces an uphill battle, Bulgaria's ruling National Movement for Simeon II (NMS) launched its election campaign on Wednesday (23 March), saying that boosting voter participation would be a top priority.
A survey conducted by the Alpha agency in early March showed the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) leads with 23 per cent of voter support, while the NMS was trailing with 11 per cent.
Recent polls also suggest that a quarter of registered voters do not plan to vote in the parliamentary elections on 25 June, while another 20 per cent are undecided about which party or coalition to support.
The June vote will usher in the next government, which is expected to lead the country towards its entry into the EU, scheduled for January 2007.
If it is not active and strong enough, said NMS election campaign chief Lydia Shuleva, potential problems could arise in meeting that goal.
It is important to understand what people want to change, Shuleva said, adding that law and order, and social and economic security are areas in which the public wants to see improvements.
"We wouldn't want to give promises, but to define people's problems and suggest projects for their solution," the Bulgarian News Agency (BTA) quoted the former deputy prime minister and minister of economy as saying as the campaign got under way.
As for the party's programme and lists of candidates for the 240-seat parliament, Shuleva said both would be tabled for discussion at a session of the NMS governing council in a week or so.
The party's nominees for MPs, she added, would be people with proven loyalty to the NMS ideas, experts and people enjoying the respect of others in their professional field.
In an interview with bTV, she voiced confidence that many of those who supported the NMS in the 2001 elections would vote for it again.
Her party would lead a positive campaign, she said, acknowledging that the BSP poses its biggest challenge.
The NMS, according to Shuleva, is open to all types of coalition talks, though no specific decisions have been taken yet in this respect.
Serbia off its game in first World Cup match
After the letdown of Sunday's loss to Ghana, Serbian coach Radomir Antic is promising a new approach.

Serbia's national team lost to Ghana 0-1 Sunday (June 13th) in its first World Cup game in Group D, making progress to the tournament's second round significantly more difficult.
"The guys promised us that they will play their hearts out on the field, but most of the time we saw a bunch of frightened faces without a clear idea how to attack. Ghana didn't play that much better but they played strong and held their position," disappointed fan Nebojsa Kilibarda told SETimes.
Coach Radomir Antic's tactics may have sounded good in theory -- to beat Ghana through fast counterattacks by relying on wing players -- but in Pretoria, the team experienced a different reality.
Serbian midfielders tried unsuccessfully to score through long passes to the strikers, while Ghana challenged the Serbs through counterattacks.
Wingmen Milos Krasic and Nenad Milijas struggled to control the ball in the face of a formidable Ghanean defence, and could not create a single significant opportunity in the first 20 minutes.
Ghana's defenders left Serbian strikers Nikola Zigic and Marko Pantelic with little to no room for maneuvre.
Zigic, who is 202cm tall, was effectively taken out of action, while his colleague Pantelic received the ball on only a few occasions.
Only after Zigic was replaced with striker Danko Lazovic in the 69th minute did the Serbian offence start to find its rhythm.
Meanwhile, Serbia's defenders fended off Ghana's wing attacks.
With the match seemingly at an impasse, errors and penalties finally made the difference.
Aleksander Lukovic picked up a yellow card for a sliding tackle in the 54th minute, and 20 minutes later was ejected for grabbing his opponent.
Down a player, the Serbian side picked up the pace.
But the wind was taken out of their sails in the 83rd minute, when Zravko Kuzmanovic used his hand to deflect a Ghanaian pass inside the Serbian box.
That gave Ghana a penalty kick and Asamoah Gyan clinched the deal, putting Ghana ahead 1-0 with minutes to go.
A devastated Kuzmanovic publicly apologised for making a foolish mistake.
Serbia now has an uphill battle ahead if it wants to get out of Group D. On Friday, the team plays heavily favoured Germany -- which showed off its explosive power on Sunday, dispatching Australia 4-0.
Antic tried a positive tack, saying the Ghana match "is already behind us" and that the team is getting ready to face Germany.
He explained the loss is "forcing us to adopt a different attitude, because in the remaining matches we have to get points".
"I promise that nothing is over," Antic said.
Squabble on Greek team the prelude to defeat?
An uninspiring and agitated Greek national team flubs its opening match against the Republic of Korea.

"Not only was the grapevine broken, but the donkey ate it," is a timeless Greek adage.
It perfectly fits the mood of the Greek national football team after its 2-0 World Cup loss to the Republic of Korea on Saturday (June 12th).
Greece's high-priced players were listless as the match started, apparently due to a major falling-out at the hotel two hours before the match began, when German skipper Otto Rehhagel announced the starting line-up.
According to reports, some Greek players openly vented their displeasure at his choices, with towering Liverpool FC defender Sotiris Kyrgiakos mistaking "some type of object" for a football he needed to kick away after being told he wouldn't start.
Only after the highly disciplined Koreans scored a second goal against them did the team finally seem galvanised into action.
It was too little, too late.
An all-offensive rush in the match's last 20 minutes couldn't undo what had come before.
The lack of camaraderie on the field was all too visible. In the 28th minute, goalkeeper Alexandros Tzorvas had to intervene to cool off defender and fellow Panathinaikos teammate Loukas Vyntras, beside himself over a serious mistake by co-defender Avraam Papadopoulos.
Papadopoulos plays for Olympiakos Piraeus, Panathinaikos's bitter cross-town rival.
The 2010 World Cup will probably witness the last games that Rehhagel will coach from the Greek bench, as his contract expires afterwards. The 72-year-old coach is credited as the architect of Greece's miraculous 2004 victory in the European championship, but many see his tenure as having come full circle.
The sour mood continued after the match, with team captain Giorgos Karagounis, a former Inter Milan midfielder who returned to Panathinaikos to end his career, declaring that he is "embittered from his substitution".
"I don't want to talk now," he added, raising speculation that he will have much to say after the tournament.
For the superstitious, the matchup with Korea was lost even before the New Zealand referee blew the opening whistle, as the team's commemorative photo minutes before match time was a spectacular disaster.
The starting 11 players reportedly assembled at the wrong spot on the field, with those standing in the second row brilliantly illuminated by the afternoon sun, while those crouching in the front row were in the shade.
Photographers' pleas to reshoot the starting lineup at another spot fell on deaf ears, with the result being completely unusable.
That turned out to be all too accurate an omen for a match in which all five forwards on the Greek roster saw playing time, yet couldn't produce a single goal.
Hello, South Africa!
All eyes are on South Africa this month for the World Cup.

Day one, June 8th
At last!
After a long time guessing about what is awaiting us in South Africa, the first experiences are under way.
And maybe because I tried to prepare myself for the worst, I'm pretty satisfied with what I have seen so far.
Didn't expect to see South Africa repeat the high level of organisation that Germany brought to the last World Cup.
And I'm positive it won't happen.
There is a slight doubt as to whether everything is still ready for the tournament and it's three days before kick-off.
But the atmosphere, totally different culture and all those smiling people around me make me believe this will be an unforgettable story to tell.
Or am I just an absolute optimist?
Day two, June 9th
The World Cup is here.
Everything stopped at noon, and all the hosts came out on the street to dance and celebrate football.
It was loud, it was different, it was fun.
For the first time, we had the chance to visit the hotel where the Serbian team is staying.
Sunnyside Park looks quite well from the outside.
Players say that the inside is even better.
We have to believe them because we were not allowed to go inside.
Security measures.
Numerous armed people were in front of the hotel. They had automatic rifles and shotguns.
There were two security checks.
Also, four policemen from Serbia.
It leaves the impression of being a safe place.
Day three, June 10th
Everything was all about the World Cup concert in Soweto with stars like Shakira, Alicia Keys and Black Eyed Peas.
Unfortunately, I was unable to attend it.
My purpose here is to write about the Serbia national team, so I had no option but to watch the event from the bar in our hotel.
Many local people were around me.
Maybe it was just my impression, but you could see joy in their eyes.
Hope that they are going to some higher level.
They were friendly, without exception.
Coming to us to chit-chat.
Day four, June 11th
Hello South Africa!!!
The time has come.
Ke Nako, as our hosts say.
The hotel staff awoke us at 7am with a song.
It was a very nice way to say good day.
Later, we went to the opening ceremony at the Soccer City.
Police were visible.
Military also.
But I had the impression that stewards were still a bit confused and that if you had the intention you could smuggle practically anything into the stands.
Military jets flew over the stadium in Johannesburg to announce the beginning of the ceremony; shortly after the noise was deafening.
The world had the opportunity to feel African culture.
Surprisingly, the stadium was not even close to full.
One of the reasons was the problem with traffic.
Attendance improved after the opening ceremony as the match between South Africa and Mexico approached.
It was thrilling.
The game was exciting, but the stands were breathtaking.
It was clear that the people of South Africa were not only happy, they were proud.
In those few hours, Africa was, maybe for the first time in history, the centre of the world.
Of course, there are some downsides to being here.
If you think that anyone will come and help you repair your internet connection during the South Africa game you're mistaken.
Volunteers tried, but they are "just" volunteers.
The guys from the internet provider didn't want to hear about our problems.
And then there's the headache from the vuvuzelas (the multi-coloured plastic trumpets).
It's nice to witness something different, but personally, I prefer the traditional way of cheering with songs and flags.
Problems were even bigger at the Serbian base camp, where journalists and team officials had a big fuss.
They didn't let us talk with the players outside the press conference.
And the press conference was televised live on our national public service RTS.
We didn't fly 8,000km and our companies didn't pay a lot of money so we could attend only what everybody could see from Belgrade.
It was not pleasant.
But, the situation calmed after we had a conversation with our captain, Dejan Stankovic.
Don't mix us up -- we just have the same name :)
Day six, June 13th
From euphoria to complete disappointment.
That was Serbia's first match day.
Fans from all around the world provided a colourful build-up for the Serbia vs Ghana match.
Especially exotic were members of the Zulu tribe whose unusual moves and delirium were a complete surprise to all of us from Europe.
It was incident-free.
Everybody came to the Loftus Versfeld stadium with a sporting spirit.
Posing together for pictures, dancing, waving flags, wearing ridiculous stuff.
The game was, at least for the Serbs, a complete disaster.
The lack of any idea, the obvious fear in the players.
And then stupid mistakes.
A red card, and a penalty.
The majority of the stands were delighted with the 1-0 Ghana win.
As expected, the African team was the loved one.
To be honest, it hurts.
Maybe because of that, vuvuzelas are really starting to annoy me.
And the internet, of course.
In the stands, I was again one of the few whose cable was out of order.
And the reaction from our hosts was ... well, there wasn't any.
I really hope things will get better for us.
And I hope I'll have the chance to see some more of Johannesburg, because so far I've mostly seen it from the bus.
Business Roundup
A review of business and economic news from the Balkans since 23 April.

Bosnian workers wave union flags in front of the government building in Sarajevo on Thursday (29 April) as they demand the Bosnian Muslim-Croat Federation government resign over recently adopted bankruptcy laws.
Trade unions claim the laws would result in thousands of layoffs and that the government lacks the funds to help those affected. The protest ended peacefully. [AFP]
A review of business and economic news from the Balkans since 23 April:
Turkey's currency, the lira, depreciated sharply this week, reportedly because of a large number of foreigners closing their positions in the currency. The lira depreciated by 2.6 per cent day-to-day on 27 April and by another 1 per cent day-to-day on 28 April.
The Croatian government reported that the trade deficit for the first quarter of 2004 jumped to 1.8m euros, compared to 1.5m euros for the same period last year.
Croatia's trade deficit in 2003 was 6.69 billion euros or 23.5 per cent of GDP.
Serbian Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic said Serbia will obtain $120m in loans from the World Bank this year.
The government and the World Bank are discussing a new three-year Country Assistance Strategy, which would be drafted in May and -- if approved by Bank directors -- adopted in the autumn.
Republika Srpska's state statistics institute reported that industrial production in the entity increased by 11 per cent year-on-year between January and March of this year.
The output growth was mainly due to an upward trend in the mining, extracting and processing industries.
The IMF and the Albanian government reached an agreement on a nine-month economic programme to be implemented in 2004 and 2005.
The programme is aimed at boosting socioeconomic development and reducing poverty.
The World Bank and the Albanian government signed an agreement allocating $4.87m for an integrated water and ecosystem management project.
It envisions improvements to municipal waste water systems in the central and northern coastal cities of Durres and Lezha, and in the southern coastal city of Saranda.
Sofia has applied for 60m euros in EU funding for a sewage and infrastructure project, according to Mayor Stefan Sofianski.
He said the city also plans to apply for 61m euros to fund a project to improve infrastructure in its southern neighbourhoods.
Albania's Energy Ministry announced that the EBRD will secure 40m euros for the first phase of a project to build a new thermoelectric power plant near the southern city of Vlora. The project is expected to cost 100m euros. The European Investment Bank will provide partial funding as well.
The Veles-based company Glendory Estate, which won the tender for the establishment of the free trade zone Bunardjik in Macedonia, said it would invest 1.5m euros during the first 12 months of the project.
Glendory Estate will operate the zone for 50 years, with a possible contract extension of 25 years.
Military Scandal Endangers Serbia-Montenegro State Union
Montenegrin officials threatened to vacate the state union's institutions due to pressure Serbian Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic has put on Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic.
The officials say that Marovic is mostly responsible for a controversial military procurement deal.
By Jelena Tusup for Southeast European Times in Belgrade – 20/09/05
"I have not felt comfortable in this post for a long time and it has been getting more difficult by the day," he said. "If you need a victim for the sake of good relations between Serbia and Montenegro, I agree to it," said Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic. [AFP]
Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic called for an emergency meeting of the state's top leaders on Monday (19 September), to ease tensions caused by a military procurement scandal that has been public for weeks.
Serbian Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic, who officials say is responsible for bringing the controversial deal to public attention, has pointed fingers at Marovic, infuriating Montenegrin officials.
Marovic, a Montenegrin, has hinted that he may resign.
"I have not felt comfortable in this post for a long time and it has been getting more difficult by the day," he said. "If you need a victim for the sake of good relations between Serbia and Montenegro, I agree to it."
The 300m-euro deal -- made with a private company -- included orders for items such as 500 pilots' jackets for an air force of 75 pilots, and 69,000 flak jackets and 74,000 helmets for a military force of about 28,000 soldiers, prompting allegations of corruption.
The company's owner, Mile Dragic, was arrested Monday for allegedly bribing unidentified defence ministry officials, while three ranking army officers were charged with receiving the bribes, Belgrade's B92 reported.
On Thursday, Montenegrin officials threatened that they would vacate the institutions of the Serbia-Montenegro state union in Belgrade and retire to Podgorica.
Belgrade media reported on Friday that the head of Marovic's office, Vule Tomasevic, warned the pullout would occur unless an impartial international institution resolves the scandal.
If Montenegro follows through, this would block the state union from functioning, since the president and some ministers are from Montenegro, and the state union's assembly cannot make decisions without the voting majority from Montenegro.
On Sunday, Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic repeated the threat, accusing the Serbian government of "conducting violence towards institutions of the state union, trying to control the state-union's authority".
The Serbian government dismissed the allegations, saying that "only the state prosecutor can solve the military procurement case", and called for all to avoid political argument.
Djukanovic also accused Serbian politicians of using the scandal to proclaim Serbian independence before the referendum on the state-union, planned for next year.
Dinkic's G17 Plus Party is has been advocating Serbian independence since 2003.
On 10 October, Serbia-Montenegro is to sign the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, which would be another step closer to European integration.
Belgrade law professor Stevan Lilic told SE Times that the scandal could seriously damage that process, and could have a detrimental effect on Serbia, because "Serbia has more problems than Montenegro to solve, including the co-operation with The Hague tribunal, resolving Kosovo's status and judiciary corruption."
IMF lowers global growth forecast
The Turkish economy will expand by 6.6% this year, while that of neighbouring Greece will shrink by 5%, according to the IMF's new World Economic Outlook.
(IMF, Reuters, Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, AP, AFP, BBC, Dnevnik.bg - 20/09/11)
The IMF cut its global growth forecast for 2011 and 2012 on Tuesday (September 20th). [Reuters]
The IMF cut its global growth forecast for 2011 and 2012 on Tuesday (September 20th), saying that the economic recovery has become much more uncertain than anticipated earlier this year.
"The global economy is in a dangerous new phase," the Washington-based international financial institution said in its latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) report. "Global activity has weakened and become more uneven, confidence has fallen sharply recently, and downside risks are growing."
In June, the Fund said that it expected the world economy to grow by 4.3% in 2011 and by 4.5% in 2012.
On Tuesday, it lowered its forecasts to 4% for both years, down from 5% in 2010.
The global economy is affected by the influence of two adverse developments -- a much slower recovery in the advanced economies this year and a large increase in fiscal and financial uncertainty, especially in recent months.
The combination and interactions of these two negative factors make things even worse, the IMF said in its new report.
"Strong policies are urgently needed to improve the outlook and to reduce the risks," IMF Chief Economist Olivier Blanchard warned at the presentation of the new WEO report on Tuesday. "Only if governments move decisively on fiscal policy, financial repairs, and external rebalancing, can we hope for stronger and more robust recovery."
But, if Western leaders fail to take swift action, there is a real risk of a return to recession, the Fund stressed.
[IMF]
The new report cut the growth forecasts for the Eurozone to 1.6% in 2011 and 1.1% in 2012, down from its June projections of 2% and 1.7%, respectively.
Two of the countries in the common currency area -- Greece and Portugal -- will experience negative growth.
The Greek economy is expected to shrink 5% this year and 2% in the next, while the Portuguese will contract by 2.2% in 2011 and 1.8% in 2012.
Voicing concern about the lingering debt crisis in the Eurozone, the IMF urged policy makers in the 17 member states to take the necessary steps.
They "must swiftly ratify the commitments made at the July summit, and in the meantime, the European Central Bank must continue to intervene strongly to maintain orderly conditions in sovereign debt markets," the IMF said. "Leaders must stand by their commitments to do whatever it takes to preserve trust in national policies and the euro."
Senior IMF economist Jorg Decressin said on Tuesday that Greece's debt problems were "eminently manageable".
Criticising speculation about the Balkan nation's possible exit from the Eurozone, he also slammed any talk that the area could break up as a "crazy proposition".
According to Fund experts, the Turkish economy will expand by 6.6% this year, posting the highest growth among 14 Central and Eastern European economies, but will fare worse next year, when it is expected to see a real GDP growth of 2.2%.
Croatia is the country within this group that is expected to expand the least this year, with its growth rate projected at 0.8%.
The IMF cautioned, however that its new projections "rest on a number of assumptions: that European policymakers will be able to contain the euro area crisis to the so-called periphery countries, that US policymakers strike a judicious balance between support for the economy and medium-term fiscal consolidation, and that ups and downs in global financial markets don't get worse".
If they are not met, "global growth will be much lower," it warned.
Basketball players return to Macedonia as heroes
The Macedonian national basketball team became the new sensation at the European championship in Lithuania.

Over 50,000 exhilarated fans gathered in Skopje's Macedonia Square on Monday (September 19th) to welcome the national basketball team back from the EuroBasket championship in Lithuania.
Five thousand fans waited for the players to arrive at the Alexander the Great Airport from where they were then transported to the square aboard a roofless double-decker bus.
"After losing to Russia [for the bronze medal] we felt heartache, but today, when we see the welcome you prepared, we do not need a medal because you are our medal," coach Marin Dokuzovski said.
Now among the top four in Europe, the Macedonian team has become an international sensation and the talk of media ranging from the New York Times to Croatia's Sportnet.
With six wins over formidable opponents such as Croatia, Greece and Lithuania, the Macedonians also gave basketball powerhouses such as Russia and champion Spain a run for their money.
Macedonian basketball legend Blagoja Georgievski spoke with SETimes about the team and the sport.
SETimes: What were the expectations of the Macedonian team in Lithuania?
Blagoja Georgievski: Before the tournament nobody believed in our abilities, and our preliminary results gave no promise of something special.
But as the championship progressed, the team became more compact and dedicated to defence -- the main quality of our playing in this league.
So from one victory to another, the team began to build confidence, first with Croatia, then Slovenia, Greece, Lithuania.
The staff and players' motto obviously was to follow the principles of unity and collectivity and play good defence.
We did not win a medal but [in effect] we won gold, given the team's success.
SETimes: Without a famous coach or NBA players like those of other teams, how do you explain the result?
Georgievski: Such a team must rely on something else and that is collectivity, team play and good defence.
So, the excellent result is due to many reasons, but above all the players' collectivity as well as leaving their hearts on the floor.
Let me not forget the presence of Lester "Bo" MacCalebb, the fantastic player who came from the Italian team Montepaski and give his best in this tournament.
I would also add rebounding, the aggressiveness, the stolen balls -- they all marked our team's games.
All of our players at the end of the tournament were listed in the groups of most caught balls, best scorer, and three-point percentage.
Every European and world expert present in Lithuania commented on our playing, especially the team defence.
Our coach, Marin Dokuzovski, has rich experience and probably his entire capacity was shown through these players.
He builds strong authority among them and the success came by itself.
SETimes: What was crucial to building such a strong team?
Georgievski: The participation at the EuroBasket in Poland two years ago.
Reaching ninth place then was enough to signal a potential and one that should be worked on; obviously they did work on [shaping] the game and on the team's defence.
We came to this success through little money, and if more is invested, then we can expect a medal in the future.
SETimes: What does this success mean for the players and opportunities to play in famous European clubs?
Georgievski: The value of all of our players increased in Lithuania and they became a target of many managers.
They were the topic of conversation in Lithuania.
I speak about Antic, the Stojanovski brothers and coach Martin Dokuzovski.
This is very important for the future because it is different when players who perform in the competitive European leagues will comprise our national team.
It will contribute to our team being much stronger and having greater quality players.
SETimes: Will the interest in basketball increase in Macedonia?
Georgievski: This situation reminds me of 1970, when our then Yugoslav team became the world champion.
There was no neighbourhood, school or yard where basketball was not played.
People spoke only about basketball.
At this moment, Macedonia opens the doors to the European and world basketball.
At home, it opens the door to all children.
I am sure this success will attract many to train.
It opens the prospective for Macedonia worldwide.
We are now potential candidates for the Olympics in London and will play directly in the next European Championships in Ljubljana in 2013.
SETimes: Can you compare basketball in former Yugoslavia to its successor states?
Georgievski: Yugoslav basketball was world-class.
Always and everywhere we won medals.
There were more quality individual players.
Basketball [here] is not at that level now, but today it is team play.
Spain plays with five NBA players on its team.
Macedonia doesn't have one such player, but still in the first half it led by one point.
We can conclude that basketball in Europe is going forward through team playing.
Bulgaria Prevents Smuggling of Nuclear Metal
Bulgaria thwarted the smuggling of 3.4kg of hafnium -- a dual-use rare metal, which scientists say can be used to make powerful explosives or "dirty bombs", the country's service for fighting organised crime said Monday.
(Radio Netherlands - 20/09/05; AP, Reuters, BBC, BNN, Sofia News Agency, Mediapool, Dnevnik, Vseki Den, Bulgarian Interior Ministry Web Site - 19/09/05; Washington Post - 28/03/04)
"The substance was transported as a metal, and in this condition it is not radioactive and is not dangerous," police said in a statement. [House.gov]
Bulgarian authorities have arrested four men caught in an apparent attempt to smuggle into Romania 3.4kg of the rare metal hafnium, a substance of possible dual use, which is on Bulgarian and international lists of goods banned for export or import.
The men -- three Romanians and a Bulgarian -- were detained at the border check point in the northern city of Ruse as they were trying to cross over into Romania by car via the Danube Bridge, which links the two countries.
"The substance was transported as a metal, and in this condition it is not radioactive and is not dangerous," Bulgaria's National Service for Organised Crime Fighting (NSOCF) said in a statement on Monday (19 September).
The operation was conducted on Saturday, NSOCF Chief General Valentin Petrov said, describing it as one of great importance for Bulgaria's national security.
Hafnium's properties are influenced considerably by the impurities of zirconium present.
Of all the elements, zirconium and hafnium are two of the most difficult to separate.
Given its good absorption cross section for thermal neutrons, excellent mechanical properties and extremely high corrosion resistance, hafnium is used for nuclear reactor control rods.
It is available in many forms, including foil, sponge and powder.
Finely divided hafnium is pyrophoric and can ignite spontaneously in air.
Hafnium is also used in gas-filled and incandescent lamps, as an efficient getter for scavenging oxygen and nitrogen, and in plasma cutting because of its ability to shed electrons into air.
In recent years, it has been put into the development of newer nuclear weapons.
Scientists say can be used to make powerful explosives or "dirty bombs".
According to a Washington Post report in March of last year, a 31-gram piece of the hafnium-178 isomer stores enough energy to boil 120 tonnes of water.
One tankful of it could fuel a car on a trip around Earth 520 times, while one gram of the material would have up to 50,000 times the explosive power of a gram of TNT.
Bulgaria does not have the required equipment for the production of hafnium, Petrov said, explaining that it was the first time that the rare metal was found in the country.
An investigation is under way, but it is still unclear where the substance originated.
"The investigation of such cases usually shows that deals with atypical substances are made by criminals, whose goal is to profit from their transfer and sale," said Petrov, suggesting that an international criminal gang could be behind the attempt to smuggle the hafnium.
Kosovo's human rights problems persist
Officials agree that a range of human rights issues must be thoroughly addressed.
By Linda Karadaku and Muharrem Nitaj for Southeast European Times in Pristina – 24/05/11

The 2010 US State Department Human Rights report on Kosovo notes problems and abuses, including government interference in security and the judiciary, lengthy pretrial detentions, a lack of judicial process and intimidation of the media by public officials and individuals.
Kosovo officials pledge to address the problems outlined in the report.
"We take the US State Department Human Rights report seriously, especially the fight against corruption, as well as [judicial] independence, media freedom, and the rights of women, children and the disabled," Qendrim Gashi, adviser to President Atifete Jahjaga, told SETimes.
The report also cites incidents of violence against members of religious communities and damage to religious properties, limited progress in returning internally displaced persons to their homes, and government corruption, including in the police force and judiciary.
Other problems relate to violence and discrimination against women, human trafficking -- especially sex trafficking of girls and women -- along with societal violence, abuse, and discrimination against minority communities, those with disabilities, abuse and discrimination based on sexual orientation, and child labour.
Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi welcomed the report, calling it "realistic and in accordance with the existing situation".
"This report ranks Kosovo along with other Western Balkans countries as a transit country for narcotics trafficking, positively evaluating efforts by Kosovo police in the fight against narcotics trafficking ... emphasising the need to increase Kosovo police investigations," Rexhepi told SETimes.
His ministry intends to review the national strategy on narcotics, focusing on demand for drugs, drug use prevention, and treatment for drug users.
"Fighting organised crime generally and narcotics specifically requires close international and regional co-operation.
In this regard, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Kosovo police are important partners in various projects.
The ministry remains dedicated to implementing all objectives and activities in the prevention and fight against narcotics trafficking," Rexhepi told SETimes.
Agron Bajrami, analyst and editor-in-chief of the daily Koha Ditore, says international reports continuously identify problems related to the function of the state and its institutions, and respect for human rights.
"The biggest problems result from a governing shortage and lack of efficient institutions.
Corruption, rule of law, respect for human rights, media and freedom of expression are just some of Kosovo's overall problems.
Addressing shortages and problems successfully is impossible without a basic change in the mindset of governance and a reform of the institutional and political structure," Bajrami told SETimes.
Sixth EXIT festival held in Serbia
For four days, the otherwise tranquil Petrovaradin fortress was home to bands, DJs, and more than 100,000 sleep-deprived young people.

The "State of EXIT" -- the youngest and smallest nation in the Balkans -- opened its gates to more than 100,000 young people for the sixth time Thursday (6 July).
For four days, the city of Novi Sad and the otherwise tranquil Petrovaradin fortress were living a completely different life, one of bands, DJs, youth and no sleep.
With 600 artists and more than 35,000 visitors on opening night, it is clear that after six years the festival has managed not only to sustain a high level of interest but to become one of the biggest parties in Europe.
It has something for everyone, including headliners like Franz Ferdinand, Morrissey, Cult, the Pet Shop Boys, Billy Idol and HIM, not to mention world-famous DJs like Dave Clarke, Jeff Mills and Derrick May.
The two biggest stages, Main Stage and Dance Arena, were crowded until the sun rose above the Danube.
Dedicated fans also took up positions on the Metal Hammer, Blues and Reggae, and Fusion stages.
The latter, hosting mainly performers from the Balkans, was the third most popular.
There, former Yugoslav connections were stronger than they are outside the festival.
In general, the most popular singers and bands were from Croatia, and the most visited and successful ones were Darko Rundek, Let 3 and Massimo Savic.
At daylight, the fun continued around the famous EXIT camp and the nearby riverbank.
Armed with tonnes of water, bathing suits and sunglasses, people danced around the beach stage all day long.
When they got tired, they looked for shelter in the shade of large trees and slept on the ground.
At night, it was back to Petrovaradin for more fun, music and friendship.
Foreigners who came to the festival say they were thrilled with the relaxed and friendly approach of Serbian young people.
Though the exact figures are not yet available, early impressions suggest there were many Britons (more than 2,000), Germans and Dutch, as well as visitors from remote places such as Australia.
But at EXIT, it's not about being a foreigner or a Serb.
This is a "state" with no boundaries.
Certainly the festival is known for its social context.
It is an NGO-friendly event and welcomes organisations that promote the "Exit philosophy" and issues such as anti-racism, anti-xenophobia, the push for visa-free travel, and free movement of peoples.
This year, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn paid a visit, gaining a chance to see what many consider "Serbia's most beautiful side".
Serbs, meanwhile, got a chance to see Rehn's more easygoing side.
He played in a football match at the EXIT camp, and lost to the home team, 3-0.
In addition to Rehn, Serbian President Boris Tadic, Novi Sad Mayor Maja Gojkovic and Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic were on hand.
Of the featured bands, one of the most popular was Franz Ferdinand.
They ruled the fortress on the first night, with more than 20,000 fans cheering their every move.
The band is named for the Austrian prince who was shot in Sarajevo in 1914 by Gavrilo Princip, sparking World War I.
Among the many anecdotes from this year's festival, one of the most memorable concerns the legendary Smiths ex-singer, Morrissey, who blanked out on some of his own lyrics during his show on the second day.
The crowd, though, hadn't forgotten them.
"Finally someone knows the words of my songs!" Morrissey shouted.
"The EXIT audience is for real!"
Science and Technology: Gates Foundation to computerise Romanian libraries

The Gates Foundation has announced plans to computerise Romania's public libraries, providing free access to computers and the internet for all Romanians.
The country's Culture Ministry has held talks with the foundation and presented a map of the Romanian library system, in preparation for a feasibility study.
The project is part of the foundation's Global Libraries initiative.
Croatian scientist Maja Paunovic and her German and US colleagues have calculated the date when Neanderthals diverged from modern human beings.
The calculations are a milestone in efforts to decode the complete genome of Neanderthals, the extinct hominids whose existence was discovered 150 years ago with a fossil find in a German quarry.
Paunovic is part of a team led by Svante Paabo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.
Comparing human, Neanderthal and chimpanzee DNA, the team found that the divergence took place about 516,000 years ago.
A regional scientific gathering on protection of the Adriatic Sea and its natural resources took place at the Institute for Biology in Kotor, Montenegro, from November 18th-21st.
The meeting drew experts from Albania, Italy and Montenegro.
Concrete proposals will be reviewed at a meeting next year in Teramo, Italy.
Serbia's Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) celebrated its 165th anniversary on November 19th.
At a formal ceremony, Minister for Science and Environment Protection Aleksandar Popovic said that SANU is a key Serbian institution and that allocating it sufficient budget funds for science and research is a government priority.
SANA admitted 13 new members, raising the total number of academicians to 151.
UNICEF and the Japanese government organised an international seminar in Tirana on bird flu, focusing on communication during health emergencies and appropriate measures to minimise pandemic outbreaks.
Carrie Auer, UNICEF representative in Albania, said the event -- which took place on November 20th -- was the first of six such seminars to be held in Central and Eastern Europe.
The Bulgarian Education Ministry will provide 437m euros from EU structural funds for education and science in 2007-2013.
The ministry will organise information days in 15 towns, where it will present financing opportunities under the programme titled "Development of Human Resources".
Schools, universities, municipalities and NGOs will be able to apply for financing.
The project is expected to focus on the introduction of new IT to increase the quality and accessibility of education.

Study: Turks cooling towards West
Disenchantment with both the EU and the United States has been rising in Turkey.
But the trend is reversible if the right steps are taken, says an expert at the German Marshall Fund.
By Ayhan Simsek for Southeast European Times -- 02/10/07

Turks have cooled significantly towards the United States and the Europe, and there is a rising sense of alienation from the West, according to a recently published survey by the German Marshall Fund (GMF), a US-based public policy institution.
The study -- Transatlantic Trends 2007 -- revealed a continuing decline in Turkish support for EU membership and growing criticism of both US and EU global leadership.
Warmth towards the United States dropped from 20 degrees in 2006 to 11 in 2007 on a 100 point "thermometer scale".
Young Turks aged 18-24 continued to show slightly warmer feelings than the national average towards both the United States (15 degrees) and the EU (28 degrees).
"The last couple of years were particularly difficult for Turkey due to major problems in foreign policy, with the instability in neighbouring Iraq, rising attacks by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the partial suspension of accession talks with the EU," said a senior Turkey expert at the Fund, Ian Lesser. "I still believe that this is a reversible trend.
With relevant steps by Washington and Brussels, that is possible," he added.
One of the most important steps is to take Turkey as a serious counterpart, he said, citing the importance of the country's EU perspective.
"Turkish people give very much importance to their concerns being seriously addressed by the Americans and Europeans.
Washington and Brussels should more strongly underline Turkey's importance as an international actor," Lesser said.
Although 40% of respondents still view EU membership as positive, support has been declining steadily.
The figure is 14% lower than last year and 33% than in 2004.
Turkey's talks with the EU, meanwhile, have been hampered by disagreements over Cyprus and other issues, and some members of the bloc -- particularly French President Nicolas Sarkozy -- have voiced open opposition to Turkish membership.
According to the GMF survey, Turkish support for NATO has also continued to decline.
Only 35% of those surveyed agreed that NATO is essential for their country's security, compared to 44% last year and 53% in 2004.
Analysts said this is part of a mainstream trend among NATO member countries, reflecting a confusion and lack of awareness in public opinion on the new role of the alliance against new security challenges.
Ties with the United States have been complicated by Turkish frustration over PKK terrorists operating out of Iraq.
A majority of Turks believe their concerns are not being adequately addressed.
Many also accuse European countries of giving support to the PKK.
The survey also found a rise in negative attitudes towards non-Western political actors in the region.
Positive sentiment towards neighbouring Iran dropped to 30 degrees on the thermometer from 43 last year.
Turkish respondents also harbor "cool" feelings towards Russia (21 degrees) and China (28 degrees) on the 100 point-scale.
Acting BiH prime minister urged to do his job
The top international envoy in Bosnia and Herzegovina criticised Nikola Spiric for failing to perform his duties as acting chairman of the country's central government.

High Representative Miroslav Lajcak urged acting Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Prime Minister Nikola Spiric on Tuesday (November 20th) to continue performing the duties his current mandate entails, so that the work of BIH institutions is not stalled.
Lajcak "expects all the institutions of BIH to continue to function" and wants Spiric to convene a cabinet session as soon as possible, a representative from his office told reporters.
The BiH Council of Ministers has not met since October 16th.
A number of critical bills must be endorsed by the central government before being submitted to parliament for approval, said the representative, Eldar Subasic.
It is also up to the government to endorse the release of funds needed for the December 9th presidential elections in Republika Srpska.
Spiric tendered his resignation on November 1st to protest Lajcak's decision to impose reforms aimed at streamlining the decision-making process in state institutions, including the central government.
The BiH tripartite presidency accepted his resignation on November 12th and launched talks on choosing a candidate for his post.
In the meantime, Spiric remains acting prime minister until a new cabinet is appointed.
"He still has the responsibility to provide for the functioning of the Council of Ministers," Lajcak's office said.
"Mr. Spiric should turn up for work and do his job," a statement from the office quoted the international envoy as saying. "Even if he disagrees with my decisions he is still democratically accountable to the people of BiH for the running of the country, until a replacement is elected.
A chair of the council of ministers who resigns, doesn't show up for work, and who then complains that the international community is running the country and ignoring him, is not only failing to do his job, but he is also betraying the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina!"
Lajcak has also warned that he will impose the measures described in his decision of October 19th, if politicians in BiH fail to implement them by December 1st.
Speaking during a visit to the Czech Republic, Spiric sought to downplay the current political crisis.
"I am an optimist," the DPA quoted him as saying. "Once people in the country will understand that (the lack of) dialogue is the essential problem ... the crisis in the country will pass."
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana sounded less optimistic Monday, voicing concern about the "deterioration of the political climate" in BiH following Spiric's resignation.
The situation in BiH was also discussed by the 27-nation bloc's foreign ministers during their meeting Monday in Brussels.
Expressing their full support for Lajcak, the EU member states' top diplomats urged politicians in BiH to "fully respect and quickly implement" the measures the High Representative put forward

The Serbian government has reacted angrily to a new report that claims children and adults with special needs are being abused in Serbia's social care institutions, with Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica describing the allegations as "malicious".
"Accusations that torture is used as treatment for children, and that these are camps for children and not social care institutions, are particularly malicious," the prime minister said.
He added that a special commission would be formed to report on the real conditions in institutions tasked with caring for people with special needs.
Mental Disability Rights International (MDRI), a US-based NGO, unveiled its report on November 14th following a four-year investigation.
The study describes -- and documents with images -- harsh conditions in six Serbian institutions.
Children are being restrained in their beds, denied adequate medical care, forced to use their beds as toilets and go without heat during winter, MDRI said.
"Filthy conditions, contagious diseases, lack of medical care and rehabilitation, and a failure to provide oversight renders placement in a Serbian institution life-threatening," the report said. "MDRI investigators found children and adults with disabilities tied to beds or never allowed to leave a crib -- some for years at a time."
While the government deserves credit for acknowledging the problem, lack of funding, poor community support and inadequate legislation have hampered efforts to reform the system, the report said.
"These are Serbia's most vulnerable citizens.
Thousands confined to institutions are subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment and abuse.
Children and adults tied down and restrained over a lifetime is dangerous and painful treatment tantamount to torture -- clear violations of the European Convention on Human Rights," said attorney Eric Rosenthal, executive director of MDRI and an expert on human rights law, in a press release.
"We call on the government of Serbia to stop these abuses immediately and to respect the human rights of all people with disabilities," he said.
Kostunica, however, accused MDRI of engaging in a smear campaign timed to coincide with the status talks on Kosovo.
"The Serbian government will counter such dark propaganda by using all democratic and legal means available," he added.
Serbian Labour and Social Policy Minister Rasim Ljajic, meanwhile, said that while the report had a political undertone, it also included justified criticism.
But he faulted MDRI for suggesting that improving conditions for the disabled should be a condition for future Serbian membership in the EU.
"It is unusual that this report was unveiled in the international media before being handed to us, and presented at a news conference before being presented to authorised state institutions," Ljajic said.
For Health Minister Tomica Milosavljevic, the report was simply "political abuse".
"If a person or organisation first goes public and says that they have been researching a problem in a country for four years, without having any contacts with that country's official institutions, then that does not seem compassionate, but more like political abuse," Milosavljevic said.
Nevertheless, government representatives have pledged to improve the situation in institutions for people with special needs.
A national plan for a mental health care strategy has been adopted, and a bill on the protection of rights of people with mental disorders is now being prepared.
The government has also announced it has invested 12m euros in the renovation of psychiatric hospitals and plans to build new institutions.
PACE calls for stepped-up witness protection
Days after endorsing Dick Marty's report on alleged organ trafficking in Kosovo and Albania, PACE has adopted three resolutions relating to the Balkans.

Witness protection varies greatly across the Balkans and countries in the region should act to make it more reliable, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) said in a resolution adopted on Wednesday (January 26th).
It was one of three that relate to the region.
Monaco's Jean-Charles Gardetto said witness testimony is crucial to the process of uncovering the truth and achieving reconciliation.
But in many cases, he said, witnesses have felt hesitant to come forward because they face the threat of retaliation.
"In Croatia, [there have been] disclosures of the identity of protected witnesses; in Bosnia and Herzegovina witnesses have been threatened and intimidated, and in Kosovo, witnesses have been assassinated," Gardetto told the council.
Just days ago, PACE members endorsed a controversial report by Council of Europe rapporteur Dick Marty on alleged organ harvesting during and after the Kosovo conflict, and many agree that testimony from witnesses will play a crucial role in establishing whether those allegations have any basis.
"The legitimacy of this investigation will finally and only be secured by the urgent establishing of effective witness protection programmes," Serbian President Boris Tadic said.
Serbian Minister for Kosovo and Metohija Goran Bogdanovic said the investigation into the Marty allegations will require the protection of witnesses in Kosovo, since the CoE rapporteur said he had put together the report mainly based on statements by Albanian witnesses.
Milos Aligrudic, a member of the parliamentary delegation to Strasbourg, said PACE's support for the Marty report had brought "a sort of moral satisfaction" to the victims' families.
"Now Serbia must do everything to ensure an investigation is conducted and the culprits punished for the crimes Marty is talking about," Aligrudic said.
The two other resolutions adopted on Wednesday deal with reconciliation and dialogue between ex-Yugoslavia countries, and with the obligation of Council of Europe member countries to co-operate in the prosecution of war crimes.
The affected countries should make the issues of missing persons and refugees a priority, PACE said, in order to aid the reconciliation process.
Members also called on BiH to take "urgent steps to respect its commitments as a member of the Council of Europe and undertake comprehensive key reforms, including constitutional reforms".
The resolution on war crimes prosecution co-operation states that "impunity must be fought resolutely co-operation between all states is essential."

Working for no pay in Croatia
As local businesses struggle, having a job doesn't always guarantee one's salary will come on time -- or at all.

Marija Terzic knows what it's like to work without getting paid. The 48-year-old former textile factory employee endured months of late paychecks -- and sometimes no paychecks -- after the company ran into financial problems and eventually went bankrupt.
"We should have left when we did not get paid the first time, which was over a year ago, but we kept thinking ' these are rough times, we should give some credit to the management'.
It made no difference," she said. "After getting late payments for two to three months, I decided it was time to leave.
It was really humiliating."
Terzic, who now works for a small privately-owned farm, said she will not be seeking employment at a larger corporation again.
"It's just ruthless," she said.
Similar stories abound in Croatia, where the faltering economy has delivered a hard blow to many businesses.
According to data from the state employment agency, around 70,000 Croatians are currently working for no paycheck.
Some are just happy to have a job, even if the salary comes later rather than sooner.
With unemployment at its highest level since April 2005, hundreds of thousands of Croatians are scrambling to find ways to pay the bills and keep food on the table.
December data records the number of jobless at 319,845, out of a total population of 4.4 million.
Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor's administration insists that it is tackling the problem and that the steps it has taken will bear fruit.
Officials say that, despite the high figures, unemployment has already started to level off, with the rate around 20% lower than in 2009.
"The government will do its best and our measures will lead to creation of new jobs," Economy Minister Djuro Popijac told local media.
President Ivo Josipovic is less sanguine.
High unemployment remains a "worrying problem that indicates the government's recovery programme did not yield results," he told a recent gathering of leading business sector representatives.
"It is serious and dangerous, not only for the Croatian economy but for the entire society, and we need to find a solution."
Waiting in line at the Zagreb's unemployment agency, Zdravko Juric, 53, is looking to catch a glimpse of a possible job opening.
He says he feels somewhat ashamed as he searches through ads on the agency's window.
Juric worked in construction before the financial crisis hit.
As a family breadwinner, he was supporting his wife and a high school-age daughter and son.
He has some savings, he says, but needs to find a job soon.
"It's not like I get to choose, you know.
Whatever I can get is fine.
I feel healthy and energetic, but for the employers I'm in a risky group. Who'll give a job to a 50-something worker?" he says.
His wife found a second job and the kids will not ask for pocket money until the family is back on its feet.
"Well, I can always collect plastic bottles and recycle them for some small money," says Juric bleakly.
Suzana, 35, agrees that people in older age brackets struggle to find opportunities. "It's much more difficult for those over 50 years of age.
I don't think there is much hope for them," she told SETimes.
Still, she said, integration with the rest of Europe could provide a boost to employment overall.
"I hope it will get better when we enter the EU," she said.
"Maybe then it will be easier to find a job, if not in Croatia than elsewhere, in other member countries."
Euroscepticism in Croatia seen as barrier
EU lawmakers say Croatia’s biggest challenge may be "selling" the benefits of membership to the public.
(Emg.rs, The Sofia Echo - 27/01/11; European Parliament, Croatian Times, Radio.net - 26/01/11; Euobserver - 26/11/10; Balkan Chronicle - 18/11/10)
Croatia could complete EU membership negotiations within months, according to the European Parliament's resolution adopted on Wednesday (January 26th). [European Commission]
The European Parliament's (EP) Foreign Affairs Committee adopted a draft resolution on Wednesday (January 27th) saying Croatia can conclude its EU membership talks by the end of June, but voicing concern about the reigning euroscepticism in the country.
The document, drafted by Austrian MEP Hannes Swoboda, the assembly's rapporteur for Croatia, was approved in a 62-2 vote, with three abstentions.
It praised Croatia for its "substantial" reform progress, citing changes to the constitution and the judiciary as examples.
Noting also Zagreb's closer co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), the document stressed however that it has yet to provide some important military documents requested by The Hague-based court.
"Negotiations with Croatia can be completed in the first half of 2011 provided that the necessary reforms continue to be pursued resolutely," MEPs said.
They listed public administration reform and the fight against corruption among areas in which the country needs to take further action within the next five months to be able to wrap up talks with Brussels.
Corruption "seems to have been widespread in Croatia and remains a serious overall problem", an EP statement quoted the draft resolution as reading.
It acknowledged the authorities' efforts to deal with the problem by taking steps to prosecute a former prime minister, other senior government officials and heads of state-owned enterprises suspected of involvement in graft.
However, few corruption cases have gone to court and most are still stuck in the investigative stage.
Stressing the need for transparent and fair trials, MEPs also urged Croatian authorities to ensure that corruption investigations will remain free of political interference.
They also called for further progress in the area of refugee returns in the coming months.
While public hostility towards returning Serbs has eased, Croatia must step up its efforts to help returnees acquire permanent resident status, address their housing problems and improve their social integration.
MEPs also called on Zagreb to show full co-operation with the ICTY, a key condition for Balkan countries hoping to join the EU.
The process of restructuring and privatising Croatia's ailing shipyards must also be sped up, if the country wants to close the negotiating chapter on competition on time, they stressed.
But the biggest challenge Croatia faces in becoming the EU's 28th member is "selling" the benefits of accession to its citizens, according to MEPs.
The latest Eurobarometer survey showed that only 25% of Croats believe that EU membership would be a "good thing" for the country, while nearly a third of respondents viewed it as a "bad thing" and 38% as "neither good nor bad".
Given that a referendum on EU membership will have to be held before Croatia joins, MEPS urged authorities and civil society to mobilise and make citizens "feel the European project is theirs as well".
In that Eurobarometer poll, 43% of respondents indicated they would vote against EU entry, while 38% said they would support it.
One Year After Djindjic Assassination, Case Remains Unresolved
Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic was assassinated exactly one year ago.
Despite many arrests, important details of the case are still unclear.

One year after the assassination of Zoran Djindjic, Serbia's first prime minister after the ouster of Slobodan Milosevic, it remains unclear who was involved in his murder.
Djindjic was gunned down on 12 March 2003, just outside the Serbian government building, where he was headed for a meeting with then-Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh.
The deadly shots were allegedly fired by Zvezdan Jovanovic, a member of the Serbian secret police special operations unit.
Although Jovanovic confessed to the killing, saying he shot Djindjic to prevent the disbanding of his unit and the extradition of some of its commanders to the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague, he later said police coerced his confession.
He has chosen to defend himself at his trial through silence.
The murder trial started on 28 December 2003, but defence lawyers effectively obstructed the proceedings.
The special operations unit, members of which took part in the conflicts in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo, was disbanded after Djindjic's murder.
Serbian courts have charged some of its members with involvement in assassination plots against political opponents of former Yugoslav President Milosevic.
Topping the list of individuals charged with the murder of Djindjic is unit commander Milorad Lukovic, also known as Legija.
He managed to flee Serbia after the assassination and remains at large.
Investigations into the murder uncovered the direct involvement of the Zemun criminal clan, considered the best-organised criminal group in the Balkans.
It was broken up during the state of emergency that followed Djindjic's murder.
Despite many arrests in connection with the case, former Serbian Police Minister Dusan Mihajlovic says it remains unresolved because authorities still do not know who ordered and financed the crime.
The failure to arrest Legija and the killing of two Zemun clan leaders, Dusan Spasojevic and Mile Lukovic, have presented obstacles.
The two slain crime figures are believed to have been familiar with all the details of the assassination.
Djindjic family lawyer Rajko Danilovic, meanwhile, thinks that the prime minister's assassination was the work of a large conspiracy that could include elements from Milosevic's secret police, criminals and all those in Serbia who opposed democracy and co-operation with the UN tribunal.
Djindjic played a crucial role in bringing down the Milosevic regime.
He was a pro-western politician who enjoyed the respect of the international community.
His Democratic Party is marking the anniversary of his murder with a large memorial service in Belgrade.
Pressure Grows as Cyprus Reunification Vote Nears
With the date for twin referenda on the UN peace plan for Cyprus rapidly approaching, international attention is focused on the outcome.

UN Secretary General Kofi Annan told Cypriots in a televised address on Wednesday (21 April) that the UN-sponsored plan for reuniting the island is the only foreseeable route to peace.
"There is no magic way of accommodating the maximum demands of one side while at the same time accommodating the maximum demands of the other.
This is it," he said.
Turkish and Greek Cypriots will head to the polls on Saturday (24 April) to vote in twin referenda on the plan's adoption.
Polls indicate that the Greek Cypriot community is leaning towards rejecting the plan, while Turkish Cypriots are expected to give it the thumbs-up.
On Monday, Greek Cypriot EU Harmonisation Co-ordinator Takis Hadjidemetriou resigned over Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos' negative stance on the UN plan.
Hadjidemetriou said that on the home front, a popular platform of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots had been created on which the plan could support itself.
"Due to my positive stance, I had to choose between keeping silent and taking a public stance.
I took my public responsibility and the consequences they entail," he said. "A settlement and EU accession offers an historic opportunity in Cyprus and a new start."
Meanwhile, the Turkish government has said that if the peace plan is not approved, the de facto recognition of the northern part of Cyprus as an independent country is quite possible.
A long-standing embargo against the northern part of Cyprus could be lifted.
The EU has said it would take steps to prevent the isolation and economic deprivation of Turkish Cypriots.
International attention is now focused on the outcome of the referenda.
The EU and the United States have both expressed their readiness to assist the two communities in settling the issue.
US President George W. Bush has called for reaching an agreement that would create a stable environment in the Eastern Mediterranean.
The European Commission, meanwhile, has said it wants to see a positive result in the referenda, allowing a unified Cyprus to enter the Union on 1 May.
The Ahtisaari plan -- what's inside?
The diplomatic battle over Martti Ahtissaari's plan for Kosovo has overshadowed the actual specifics, writes the University of Toronto's Robert Austin.
By looking at the details, Kosovo Albanians would see they have serious obligations to undertake, while Kosovo Serbs would see potential gains for their community.
By Robert C. Austin for Southeast European Times – 21/05/07

As the diplomatic tug-of-war over former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari's blueprint for Kosovo continues, relatively little attention has been paid to the actual contents of the document.
In Kosovo and elsewhere, the focus tends to be on the front-end of the proposal -- the part where Kosovo is granted the right to a flag, anthem and, most importantly, the right to conclude international agreements and the right to seek membership in international institutions.
Less is said about the truly monumental tasks involved in making the Ahtisaari package a reality on-the-ground.
It is doubtful that most people on the street, whether in Pristina or North Mitrovica, have a clear idea of what would come after "independence day".
Ahtisaari's proposal is first and foremost a document designed to make Kosovo a multiethnic society. This means that the non-Albanian communities have been granted substantial powers.
With more than 90% of Kosovo made up of Albanians, the minority Serb, Roma, Ashkali, Gorani, Egyptian, Turk and Bosniak communities are given tremendous influence in all sectors.
In brief, Ahtisaari has designed an asymmetric state.
One can certainly imagine that in the new Kosovo minority parties will be able to play critical roles in the formation of both governments and government policy.
It is also worth noting that Ahtisaari's proposals for community rights did not come out of the blue.
They were already in the Kosovo Albanian side's negotiation package for the direct talks in Vienna.
As a first step, Kosovo will have to adopt a constitution that will include many aspects of the Ahtisaari package.
A constitutional commission must be formed that includes 21 members, three of whom will come from the Serb community and three from other non-majority communities.
Upon approval of the constitution by the existing Assembly in Kosovo, new elections must be held within nine months.
Kosovo Albanians have committed themselves to significant obligations under the proposed plan. [Getty Images]
The new electoral system borrows much of what was already there, but there are some important changes.
There are still 120 seats based on proportional representation.
The big difference here is that the party lists will be open -- until now they have been closed, much to the dissatisfaction of many citizens.
Twenty seats have been set aside for non-Albanian communities -- ten for the Serb community and ten for other communities.
For the first two electoral mandates these are required minimums.
Any seats gained in the elections are in addition to the reserved seats.
The new assembly rules also include various qualified majority voting rules.
Certain legal changes would require not only a majority in the Assembly but also a majority of Assembly members who represent non-majority communities.
In essence, any major alterations require everyone's assent.
The new cabinet must include a Serb minister and a minister from another non-majority community.
The same rule applies for deputy ministers as well.
If the cabinet has more than 12 members, than the non-majority communities get an additional minister and deputy minister.
Any future changes to the constitution require approval from two-thirds of assembly members as well as two-thirds of the members who represent non-majority communities.
The same rules apply to the justice system.
Kosovo's Supreme Court must have at least 15% of judges representing non-majority communities.
Outside of national level institutions, the communities are again granted wide powers at the local level.
Full access to schooling in any official language of Kosovo (Albanian and Serbian), and free use of national symbols, language and alphabet are guaranteed.
Where non-majority communities form at least 10% of the population, the post of vice-president of the Municipal Assembly goes to a representative of non-majority communities.
As is the case with the Ohrid Framework Agreement, Kosovo's public service at all levels must reflect the multiethnic nature of Kosovo society.
The most crucial area, however, is decentralisation.
This is potentially the biggest hurdle for the Albanian majority, as the Ahtisaari package creates a fairly decentralised state with a number of new municipalities designed to accommodate Serb demands.
For example, North Mitrovica gets control over higher education and health care.
The same holds true for other Serb-dominated municipalities.
Schools that teach in the Serbian language are free to use books developed by appropriate ministries in Serbia.
A strong international community presence is envisaged, although many aspects of this have yet to be worked out.
As in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the plan grants sweeping powers to the International Civilian Representative (ICR) who also acts as the EU's special representative.
The ICR's powers are easy to interpret: he/she is the final authority on the implementation of the package.
It is the ICR that makes the difference between independence and supervised independence.
A strong international presence in Kosovo is expected for the near future. [UNMIK]
Ahtisaari's proposal does more than create a quasi-independent Kosovo.
He offered a framework for another stage in Kosovo's evolution.
This stage seems set to last for a protracted period, in the hope that by the time true independence does come, things in the region might make this type of solution more palatable.
Under renewed and potentially more stringent supervision, Kosovo's communities must now prove that they can sustain a multiethnic state.
Much depends on the Albanian majority's political will and enthusiasm for remaining committed to Ahtisaari's vision.
But it is also up to the non-Albanian communities to make the most of the powers granted them.
Should they fail to do so, the blame could not be placed on the Albanians.
Reactions to the plan so far suggest that both sides should spend more energy looking at the specifics -- as the saying goes, the devil is in the details.
Kosovo's media is now focused entirely on the endgame and the diplomatic showdown with Serbia and Russia.
There is little talk on how to move forward afterwards.
At the same time, the Serb community in Kosovo has the opportunity to consider how the Ahtisaari proposal can be used to their advantage.
Anyone who suggests that Kosovo is set to become simply another Albanian state in the Balkans has not read the fine print.
A public outreach campaign, especially by the Albanian authorities in Kosovo, would help the public understand just what is expected when it comes to the implementation phase.
By accepting the package, the Albanian majority has undertaken a sweeping set of obligations that will be expensive, challenging and not altogether pleasing.
Political will and an informed population will be critical if Kosovo is to move ahead.

Albania to Provide Shelter for Victims of Trafficking
Trafficking remains a serious problem in Albania, considered both a source and a transit country.
A new shelter being established by the government aims to provide protection and assistance to victims.
By Ardi Pulaj for Southeast European Times in Tirana -- 22/09/03
Victims of human trafficking will be able to find protection and assistance at a new anti-trafficking centre in Tirana.
The centre is to be maintained by the ministries of social affairs and public order, in co-operation with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).
The three institutions recently signed an agreement defining their areas of responsibility.
Women and girls who have been forced into prostitution in Albania or repatriated from other countries will be able to stay at the centre for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Its two buildings will have the capacity to house up to 100 people.
While offering care and services, the centre will also work to reunite trafficking victims with their families or return them to their countries of origin.
Also envisioned are public campaigns to raise awareness of the problem of human trafficking.
IOM's Albania branch recently organised a media campaign, including a song and video clip, to make people conscious of the risks and suffering.
IOM also provides assistance to victims.
Albania is considered both a source and transit country for trafficked women and children.
Parliament has enacted a national anti-trafficking strategy, leading to the creation of special units in police districts around the country.
An internationally supported anti-trafficking centre was established in Vlora, in the south, though it is still not operational.
In a report published last year, the US State Department said Albania was taking the first essential steps in fighting trafficking, though it remains a critical issue.
According to the OSCE, one problem is that very few victims are willing to testify, as there is currently no mechanism for protecting witnesses in Albania.
The OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights is funding a Victims Assistance Team, which is being implemented in close co-operation with the IOM and the ministry of public order.
Since October 2002, the OSCE says, women who have been repatriated to Albania -- usually because of immigration infractions in their destination countries -- have been eligible for legal advice and assistance.
According to the United States, during 2001 at least 700,000 men, women, and children world-wide were bought, sold, or otherwise held against their will in slave-like conditions.
Balkans become hostage to Russo-Ukrainian standoff
Most of the Balkan countries are feeling the brunt of the natural-gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine, which has cost them access to new supplies.
(Various sources -- 06/01/09 - 08/01/09)
Bulgaria, Hungary, Austria, Germany, Poland, Romania, the Czech Republic and Turkey are seeing shortages of natural gas, since Russia's Gazprom supplies most of their imports. [Getty Images]
The heads of Russia's Gazprom and Ukraine's Naftogaz met in Moscow Thursday (January 8th) to discuss solutions to a dispute over gas prices and transit fees, which has hit EU and Balkan countries in one of the coldest winters in decades.
Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller and his Naftogaz counterpart, Oleh Dubyna, held their first face-to-face talks since the start of the crisis on January 1st, when Russia cut off gas shipments to Ukraine. Moscow and Kiev blame each other for the shutdown.
Russia provides 25% of Europe's total gas supplies, delivering about 80% of that fraction through pipelines that cross Ukraine.
Bulgaria, which depends on Russia for 96% of its gas, was one of the EU nations worst hit by the immediate loss of supply on Tuesday.
Millions of Bulgarians felt the impact of that move almost immediately, as radiators in centrally heated buildings across the country went cold before sunset and utilities scrambled to find alternative fuels.
Dozens of schools and kindergartens closed down Wednesday as temperatures indoors fell below the legal minimum.
Some hospitals said they might have to treat only patients requiring emergency care.
The employers' organisation in the EU's poorest member said businesses were losing about 250m euros a day.
Neochim, one of Bulgaria's leading fertiliser producers, said it escaped a major explosion Tuesday when it had to shut down its facilities on a hasty emergency basis.
Macedonia, Greece and Turkey are also coping with shortages.
The last two are slightly less dependent on Russian natural gas and have alternative supply routes, but Macedonia -- like Bulgaria -- relies almost completely on Russian gas.
Two of Macedonia's biggest factories reportedly had to cease production after the Orthodox Christmas on Wednesday.
Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Croatia, Serbia and Romania also reported a total cutoff of Russian deliveries, affecting them to varying degrees.
Among them, BiH is in the worst shape and fears "disaster", since Russia supplies nearly all its gas.
Bosnians rushed to buy electric heaters in freezing weather Wednesday, while two major smelters had to close down nearly completely.
Croatia reportedly has enough reserves to last around three weeks, in large part because it produces nearly half of the natural gas it needs.
Serbia, though, relies on Russian supplies for about 87% of its gas needs.
Srbijagas says its stockpile of gas could last about ten days.
Romania supplies around 65% of its own needs.
The government assured Romanians that gas and heat should both be adequate and "that industry might be affected only if temperatures dropped to under an average of -15C".
CEOs Miller and Dubyna will attend an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Thursday to address the crisis.
Accusing the two countries of holding the EU's gas supply "hostage" Wednesday, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso called for an immediate resumption of supplies.
Serbia plans bigger education investment
Most schools in Serbia were built between the two world wars, and have seen no improvements since then.
The government is promising more funds to tackle the problem.

Serbia's dilapidated schools may finally receive an upgrade if authorities make good on plans to pump more money into the education system.
Education Minister Zarko Obradovic says he wants to increase investment in education to 6% of GDP by the end of his term, in 2012.
"Investing in education equals investing in the future.
Only if we increase budget funds for education will we accelerate Serbia's development and create better living conditions for all citizens," Obradovic said.
Data from the Serbian president's office show the majority of the 1,851 elementary and high schools in the country were built between the two world wars.
They have seen no modernisation or renovation since.
One in four schools is over 60 years old, and the equipment is around 42 years old on average.
There is no heating in 25% of the schools, while just 30% have a library.
More than half of all Serbian schools do not meet the legal norms for gyms and their equipment, according to the youth and sports ministry.
Currently, the percentage of the budget that Serbia devotes to education is one of the lowest in Europe. The 2008 budget envisioned spending 3.6% of the overall GDP on education.
That amount will fall to 3% in 2009 because the global economic crisis forced cutbacks in all areas of the budget.
In comparison, Bosnia and Herzegovina invests 3.8% of its GDP in education, while Croatia spends about 5%.
But there is good news, too.
Academics and working conditions have been gradually improving.
By mid-2009, all of the schools in the country will have internet access under a contract signed last month by the education ministry and Telekom Srbija.
"High-speed internet will increase and accelerate the exchange of information in education and raise information literacy to a higher level," Obradovic said after the signing.
Statistics show that 41% of Serbian households have a computer and 33% have internet access.
About 52% of the population use a computer, two million of whom access the internet on a regular basis.
Obradovic also signed an agreement late last month with French Ambassador to Belgrade Jean-Francois Terral on providing French language classes in Serbian schools.
French as a first foreign language is currently taught in 50 primary schools and as a second foreign language in 600 schools.
Archaeological discovery opens window to Illyrians
The discovery of an Illyrian trading post gives insight into the ancient peoples of the Balkan Peninsula.
(Various sources)

After several weeks of intense digging, an archaeological team from the University of Oslo reported a find last month that could change the written history of Illyrians for a period of their existence.
An Illyrian trading post in the border area between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) throws light on an unknown aspect of the life of these ancient people of the Balkan Peninsula.
The head of the archaeological team who discovered the traces of the trading post was Associate Professor Marina Prusac.
"Our discovery is important for understanding cultural identities in the Balkans in ancient times," she said.
The discovery -- the first of its kind -- consists of the ruins of a settlement and the remains of a harbour that probably functioned as a trading post.
Archaeologists found many sunken boats fully laden with wine pitchers, or amphorae, which date to the 1st century BC.
The many pieces of pottery found indicate this was a major trading post.
Desilo, where the team did its excavations, is 20km from the coast on an alluvial plain by the Neretva River.
"Desilo is situated at the innermost point of a quiet bay where it was natural to transfer goods to smaller boats, so the place is perfect for an inner trading harbour.
We knew that if we found a harbour it would represent a rare example of a meeting point in this impenetrable landscape," Prusac told ScienceDaily.
The Illyrians were Indo-European tribesmen who appeared in the western part of the Balkan Peninsula about 1,000 BC -- a period that coincides with the end of the Bronze Age and the beginning of the Iron Age.
They inhabited much of the area for the next millennium.
At its height, ancient Illyria encompassed the Adriatic coastline and mountainous interior of the western Balkans -- today's Albania, Slovenia, Dalmatia, Croatia, BiH, Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia -- including, at one point, the region of Molossa (Epirus) in northwest Greece.
The Illyrians fell to Roman conquest during the 1st century BC.
Illyrian territories later became provinces of the Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire.
The Norwegian team's discovery and its interpretation highlight the ancient trade connections between Romans and Illyrians and show the Illyrians were not only warriors and pirates, as described by some historians, but also a people developing their economy and trade.
With the dating of the amphorae, scientists found indications the boats sank over a nearly century-long span -- demonstrating they were not pirate vessels attacked by Romans.
Archaeologist Adam Lindhagen, who specialises in Roman amphorae and who took part in the expedition, says this is the most important find thus far from the Illyrian era.
Montenegro poised for independence after referendum
Results from Sunday's referendum in Montenegro show the independence movement narrowly passing the 55 per cent threshold.
That clears the way for the republic to break from its union with Serbia and become an independent state for the first time since 1918.

Montenegrins have voted to leave the state union with Serbia, ending the final remnant of the former Yugoslavia, according to official results Monday (22 May).
In an EU-supervised referendum held the day before, the pro-independence bloc narrowly surpassed the required 55 per cent threshold.
"For the independence of Montenegro, 55.4 per cent voted in favour and 44.6 were against," said Frantishek Lipka, the Slovak diplomat who is heading the Montenegrin Referendum Commission, at a press conference Monday morning.
Although approximately 5 per cent of the votes remained to be counted, the outcome was unlikely to be affected, he said.
Final results will be announced at 1900 local time.
Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, the leader of the pro-independence camp, declared victory Sunday night as estimates showed his side in the lead.
"Tonight, with the majority decision by the citizens of Montenegro, the independence of the country has been renewed ...This is the most important event in Montenegro's recent history," Djukanovic said as supporters celebrated in Podgorica, setting off fireworks and waving the red-and-gold flag of the Montenegrin monarchy.
The head of the pro-union bloc, Predrag Bulatovic, reluctantly conceded defeat Monday.
Newspapers in Belgrade carried headlines announcing the split, but Serbia has said it will wait for the final tally before making an official response.
However, a statement carried in the official Tanjug news agency said the federal army and the Serbian Defence Ministry would "respect the political decision in agreement with the two leaderships".
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, meanwhile, congratulated the Montenegrin people for the "successful organisation of the referendum".
"We are still waiting for the report of ODIHR/OSCE but it seems that the process was orderly and we want to congratulate everybody for that.
Close to 87 per cent turnout confirmed the legitimacy of the process," he said at a press conference Monday in Brussels.
The referendum outcome paves the way for negotiations between Belgrade and Podgorica on their future relations and the division of joint property.
According to the Serbia-Montenegro Constitutional Charter, Serbia is to inherit the state union's position in all international institutions.
However, ambiguity now exists concerning the status of Kosovo, which was termed part of the state union by UN Security Council Resolution 1244.
Montenegro will have to request admission into international institutions.
Djukanovic has said that he hopes Montenegro will join the UN by September.
It is also not clear when the two states will continue their journey towards the EU, interrupted because of Belgrade's failure to arrest and extradite a top war crimes indictee, Ratko Mladic.
The European Commission will probably need a new mandate for talks with the two states, say analysts, but the results achieved so far will most likely be taken into account for both.
Serbia and Montenegro have been holding twin-track negotiations with the EU on economic issues.
Despite Sunday's vote, Serbia and Montenegro will remain united for a few weeks longer in the arena of soccer.
Players from both republics will compose one team at the upcoming World Cup in Germany.
Mjaft! launches project for monitoring Albanian lawmakers
A civic organisation in Albania is keeping the public up to date on parliamentary activities by means of a Web site.

The civic movement Mjaft! has launched a Web site where the Albanian public can discuss the importance of being active and informed citizens in the decision-making process, and can also pose questions to members of parliament.
The Web site started as a source of information about the candidates and political parties that participated in the 3 July 2005 parliamentary elections.
It has featured information about the political programmes of the main parties, campaign promises by the candidates, their backgrounds and CVs, and their sources of campaign funding.
The site now details the work of MPs in the Albanian Assembly.
According to the group, it covers all MPs and is split into three main categories: biographic information, finances and parliamentary activity.
"After every plenary session, a report is published on the Web site for the public and the media," Mjaft! says.
Mjaft! says the main aim of this project is to close the gap between the transition period and the realisation of true democracy, by raising the awareness and educating citizens about how the Assembly works.
It also aims to improve the image of parliament by raising the level of public participation in the decision-making process.
Mjaft! -- Albanian for Enough! -- originated as a grassroots movement among volunteers.
It seeks to raise awareness of the many political and social problems facing the country, including inadequate health and education services, blood feuds, trafficking and organised crime, poverty and unemployment, discrimination against women and disadvantaged groups, corruption in public administration, environmental degradation and obstacles to EU integration.
"In Albania, there is a lack of open and frank public debate on political, economic and social problems.
These are basic issues of an open and free society that have remained persistently unaddressed for over a decade since the fall of communism.
The time is certainly ripe, if not late, for Albanian society to undergo drastic change in its attempts to move beyond a 'crisis mentality'," said Erjon Veliaj, director of the movement.
Bulgarian president calls for stronger efforts against crime, corruption
Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov urged his country's government and politicians Sunday to fight harder against organised crime and corruption, so that Bulgaria may enter the EU in January 2007 as planned.
(BNN - 22/05/06; Sofia News Agency, Mediapool, Dnevnik.bg, Official Web Site of the Bulgarian President - 21/05/06)
"Here our steps seem more hesitant compared to that of Romania," Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov said, referring to prosecutions against more than a dozen senior politicians, under way in Bucharest. [Getty Images]
Bulgaria must take urgent steps to address issues that could impede its January 2007 entry into the EU, President Georgi Parvanov said on Sunday (21 May), stressing the need for stronger action in the fight against crime and corruption.
Speaking to reporters in the Black Sea resort city of Varna, Parvanov said that the European Commission's (EC) monitoring report released on 16 May showed that Bulgaria was still insufficiently prepared for EU membership.
It has four more months to deal with lingering problems before the EC issues its next crucial assessment of the country's readiness to join the Union on 1 January 2007 as planned.
Last week's report listed six areas of serious concern that Bulgaria must urgently address.
During the next four months Sofia must show "clearer evidence of results in investigating and prosecuting organised crime networks", "more effective and efficient implementation of laws for the fight against fraud and corruption" and "intensified enforcement of anti-money laundering provisions".
Bulgaria must also strengthen financial control for the future use of structural and cohesion funds and boost administration in agriculture.
If the country fails to deal with those problems, it could see its EU entry delayed until January 2008.
Although these are only six out of the 145 fields monitored by the EU, failure in achieving the required results in any of the "red flag" areas could impede Bulgaria's timely accession, Parvanov said.
Bulgaria can fulfil the tasks it faces in the fight against money laundering, the president said, calling for the urgent adoption of two bills already submitted to parliament -- namely, the law on measures against money laundering and a new Penal Code.
As concerns the fight against corruption, Parvanov reiterated his proposal for the establishment of an independent service on combating corruption, stressing that old methods cannot yield qualitative results.
The proposed body should have guaranteed independence from the institutions subject to its control, he said.
Bulgaria must show in the next four months is that there is no one in the executive, legislative or judicial power that is above the law, the president said, calling for changes in legislation regulating the activities of political parties.
Urging politicians and government officials to make public their incomes and assets, Parvanov said he would reveal his and his family's holdings Monday.
"I hope that this would set an example for other politicians to do so too," he said.
Turkey Optimistic About Upcoming EU Summit
Just two days before Friday's EU summit, the European Parliament issued a report recommending the launch of talks.
Last week, lawmakers in Turkey approved a new criminal procedures code designed to bring the country's human rights standards further into line with those of the EU.

EU foreign ministers will gather in Friday (17 December) for a summit that is expected to result in a long-awaited decision on launching accession negotiations with Turkey.
Arriving in Brussels Wednesday, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan -- buoyed by a new European Parliament (EP) report recommending the start of talks -- was confident about the outcome.
"We are hopeful," Erdogan told reporters, describing the EP's recommendation as "very meaningful".
The report cites Turkey's progress in meeting the political criteria for membership, though it also cautions that problems remain in areas such as minority rights, religious freedom, the role of the army, the Cyprus issue and bilateral relations with Armenia.
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso told France-2 television on Wednesday that Turkey has made great efforts to join and that its membership in the Union would be "would be very positive for Europe".
"I believe this is the moment," Barroso said.
Aiming to further boost human rights standards, the Turkish Parliament last week passed a new Code of Criminal Procedures Law (CMUK).
In an effort to bring its laws into line with those of the EU, Turkey has adopted a series of bills in recent years covering everything from the death penalty to minority broadcasting rights
The CMUK -- considered an essential part of Turkey’s EU harmonisation drive -- is intended to put an end to cases of torture and ill-treatment.
Police forces, which have enjoyed wide-ranging authority for decades, will now have to observe a number of regulations, including limits on the amount of time prisoners can be held in custody.
The new law also clarifies the frequently abused concept of "state secrets", stipulating that it cannot be used to keep information related to crimes from reaching the courts.
However, information that could have serious repercussions for the country's defence, constitutional order, foreign relations and security can still be classified in this way.
It also allows the summoning of witnesses to court via telephone, e-mail or fax, and provides for placing witnesses in organised crime cases under state protection.
Under the new CMUK, prosecutors and judges will be able to order DNA and blood samples from suspects, but the procedure will have to be supervised by a doctor.
Female suspects and convicts will be treated by female doctors.
While the government has presented the new legislation as a step forward in harmonisation with the EU, some reformists within Turkey have objected to a provision which they see as a concealed step backwards.
The CMUK establishes a new set of criminal courts which critics say are equivalent to the now-abolished State Security Courts.
Albania and Serbia-Montenegro Intensify Economic Co-operation
During the first half of 2004, the amount of exports between Albania and Serbia-Montenegro has doubled compared to the same period last year.
Business is providing a major impetus for rebuilding ties between the two Western Balkan countries.

Recent months have seen a significant boost in economic ties between Albania and Serbia-Montenegro.
According to official data, during the first half of 2004 Albanian exports to Serbia-Montenegro amounted to $2.3m, while Serbia-Montenegro exported $13m in goods to Albania.
These figures are twice what they were last year.
According to Albania officials, a Free Trade Agreement between the countries – signed at the end of 2003 -- has been a key factor driving the increase.
Serbia-Montenegro now follows Bulgaria as the top country that Albania exports to.
The business communities in Albania and Serbia-Montenegro are considered vital for rebuilding ties between two countries, which re-established diplomatic relations in March 2001.
Since then, government officials have made a number of reciprocal visits to discuss bilateral co-operation.
Former Prime Minister Ilir Meta paid a historic visit to Belgrade in 2002, the first by an Albanian prime minister since 1946.
While the political relations between Tirana and Belgrade have improved during the past five years, the major impetus for renewed co-operation has come from business.
In the past, Albania's presence in the Serbia-Montenegro market was mainly limited to bitum and furniture.
Serbia's main exports to Albania were wood, olives, wheat, biscuits and cookies.
The ever-improving relations between the two countries' business communities were showcased during Klik Expo Group, an international fair held in Tirana at the end of November.
Nearly fifteen Serbian companies attended the fair.
Products on display included food, construction materials and clothing.
Nevanka Velinov, the head of the Belgrade-based Kvadra Group, led the Serbian delegation.
"Both countries can co-operate in different fields, not only in food, but also in construction.
I do not see any obstacle for increasing the business activity among two countries in different fields with a mutual interest," Velinov said.
Zoran Jovanovic, a diplomat at the Serbia-Montenegro Embassy in Tirana, said that economic ties between the countries have been strengthened in the past six months.
Serbia is also present in Albania with its official airline JAT Airlines.
Both countries -- like neighbouring Croatia and Macedonia -- aspire to become members of the EU and NATO.
Fostering co-operation and bilateral ties is seen as strengthening regional relations, providing additional momentum towards achieving the shared goal of Euro-Atlantic accession.
A split in Sandzak
Riots and a call for international monitors highlight tensions within the Bosniak community in Serbia's western Sandzak region.

The Bosniak National Council, led by Mufti Muamer Zukorlic, has urged the EU to send international monitors to Sandzak, claiming that "religious and ethnic rights" are being violated.
Monday's (September 6th) call by the council is the latest escalation in an ongoing political struggle within Sandzak's Bosniak community.
Politics there has traditionally been dominated by two parties: Rasim Ljajic's Sandzak Democratic Party (SDP) and Sulejman Ugljanin's Party of Democratic Action (SDA).
Although both Ljajic and Ugljanin are cabinet ministers, their parties are at bitter odds and the quarrel has even erupted into physical clashes.
After the election for the Bosniak National Council, a non-political body, a third political force has taken shape.
Zukorlic, who heads the Islamic Community, has announced he will support the formation of a new party that will strive to protect Bosniak rights.
Zukorlic accuses Ljajic and Ugljanin of neglecting the interests of the people for the sake of their ministerial posts.
The two officials respond that radicalising the situation will only harm Bosniak interests and push Sandzak into economic and political isolation.
On September 4th, clashes broke out in Novi Pazar over construction of a kindergarten on a property that the Islamic Community claims belongs to it.
The municipal administration, which also includes Bosniaks, says it is municipal land.
Four police officers were injured by flying rocks as riots broke out.
After the incident, the Islamic Community in Serbia called for hastening Sandzak autonomy, and urged residents to demonstrate solidarity via "civil disobedience to the regime and pro-regime political parties". It accused Belgrade of discriminating against Bosniaks and backing the parties headed by Ljajic and Ugljanin.
Meanwhile, Mufti Zukorlic invited Belgrade authorities to launch a dialogue in order to preserve peace and stability.
An official of Ljajic's party, Meho Omerovic, dismissed the idea of foreign monitors in Sandzak.
"International monitors in Sandzak would not see any real problems and discrimination against Muslims, but rather the desire for power on the part of Mufti Muamer Zukorlic and the Islamic Community in Serbia," he told SETimes.
The Serbian government has not taken an official stand on the monitors, but Interior Minister Ivica Dacic says that all "open issues in Sandzak should be resolved through talks".
"The police are not here to solve religious and political problems; that is someone else's job," he added.
Ian Bancroft, founder of the Transconflict organisation, told SETimes that the Sandzak issue should be resolved primarily through agreement within the Bosniak community.
"Sandzak is almost unique in the Balkans because the primary conflict is not interethnic, but intraethnic," Bancroft said.
"Zukorlic's attempts to fuse religion and politics -- as epitomised by the recent elections to the Bosniak national minority council -- pose a challenge to the stability of the region."
"In trying to shift the contours of a political space that has traditionally been dominated by the SDA and SDP, Zukorlic has made ever more vocal and divisive appeals to religious faith and symbolism," he said.
According to Bancroft, minor clashes can still be expected in Sandzak. "However, the situation ... does not parallel with Kosovo because, first, the stance and approach of Zukorlic is opposed by many Bosniaks and, second, because the Serbian government will not clampdown as Zukorlic invariably hopes," he said.
"Instead, the Serbian government -- supported by the international community, particularly the OSCE -- must work to promote civic political platforms, inter-religious dialogue and economic development," Bancroft said.
Joint Serbia-Montenegro police teams boost security
The two countries address the increasingly borderless crime that may target tourists during the summer season.

Serbian and Montenegrin police agreed to jointly patrol the Montenegro coast during the upcoming tourist season, as well as to form teams to fight organised crime in the latest example of regional police collaboration.
"We want to show the public that police co-operation between the two countries is essential [to preventing crime]," Serbia's Police Chief Milorad Veljovic said.
Montenegro police's spokesperson Radomir Radunovic told SETimes that freedom of movement and criminals who do not see borders as a deterrent necessitate such an approach.
"It involves the exchange of police experience, professional training for the members of the two police [forces] and assistance with investigations," Radunovic said.
Podgorica tourist agency Liky Turs owner Zeljko Likovic is among the many tourism workers who welcomed the police agreement to collaborate.
"It is very important that our visitors feel safe in Montenegro.
I will not say Montenegro is unsafe, but this move is important for the purpose of prevention so that people have someone to turn to for help if necessary," Likovic told SETimes.
Liky Turs booked more than 2,000 tourists from Serbia last year and Likovic expects an even greater number of Serbian vacationers this year.
Belgrade resident Dragan Samolov, 43, said his family vacations every year in the Montenegrin town of Kotor and has never had any security-related problem.
"Throughout all these years, I have seen young people, whose blood is a bit hotter than ours, older people, occasionally fight.
This is not a big deal; it happens everywhere," Samolov told SETimes.
Samolov explained that some lately carry concealed guns and the police would do well to address the issue.
"Still, visiting Montenegro for two decades, I have not seen any fight involving arms."
Officials say the agreement builds on the lasting co-operation between Serbian and Montenegrin police forces.
Radunovic added that Montenegro is open to co-operating in a similar manner with other regional police forces.
Joint police work is not new to the Croatian police, which have implemented the Safe Tourist Season project together with police forces from Slovenia, Hungary, Austria, the Czech Republic and Germany.
Hungarians constitute the largest number of visiting officers to Croatia because a large number of Hungarian tourists vacation regularly on the Croatian coast.
Forty Hungarian officers patrolled the Croatia coast with their Croatian colleagues last summer.
Bosnia and Herzegovina border police have also jointly worked with their Croatian counterparts.
They typically patrol along the Sava River, which constitutes a border between the two countries.
Similarly, Kosovo police have been co-operating with the Albanian police for two years, jointly enforcing road safety during the summer season in Albania, where many Kosovo Albanians vacation.
Banja Luka Security and Protection Faculty Professor Predrag Ceranic told SETimes that joint police work is an excellent form of co-operation, given that criminals are adapting and reorganising regionally to outsmart the police.
"The criminals co-operate with their counterparts from neighbouring countries so it is essential that the police co-operate as well [to be able to counter them].
This will become a trend in the region and it will definitely be harder work for the criminals in such conditions," Ceranic said.
Veljovic suggested that police forces continue the trend in the region and beyond.
"We want the police co-operation between Serbia and Montenegro to be used as an example for the entire region and perhaps in Europe as a whole."
Macedonia beginning accession dialogue with the EU
The EU will launch high-level dialogue to help Macedonia keep the pace of institutional reforms and enable it to remain on the EU integration path, in spite of Greece's objections.

Macedonia will begin preliminary high-level talks with the EU, which are designed to reduce the length of formal negotiations that the nation would have should it be given a date for accession discussions.
EC President Jose Manuel Barroso and Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule agreed to the March 15th discussions with Macedonia's leadership last year in Ohrid.
The EU delegation's office in Skopje said the dialogue aims to maintain the course of institutional reforms in order to bring Macedonia closer to the EU.
"That is why Commissioner Fule is launching the dialogue with Prime Minister (Nikola) Gruevski -- to focus on key reform challenges," EU spokesperson Konstantin Jovanovski told SETimes.
Jovanovski said talks will focus on reforming Macedonia's public administration, strengthening the rule of law, protecting the media's freedom of expression, improving the election process and developing the market economy.
"Macedonia now receives a higher(-level) treatment and is one step ahead, despite being blocked by Greece," Gruevski said.
Macedonia has been waiting three years to obtain an EU membership negotiation date.
Greece blocked a planned invitation for Macedonia to join NATO in 2008, and in 2009 blocked EU accession talks over a lengthy name dispute.
Macedonia, which was admitted to the UN under the name "Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia," says changing its name would deny its national identity.
More than 100 nations recognise it as "Republic of Macedonia."
Under the terms of the dialogue mechanism, EU and Macedonian leaders will meet twice a year, but the dialogue will go on throughout the year.
A progress report will be published in October.
"Given that bilateral disputes have slowed down or stalled EU accession, this dialogue is an impetus for similar mechanisms to be undertaken elsewhere," Centre for Political Research analyst Vladimir Bozhinovski told SETimes.
Having dialogue on the highest level is no substitute for beginning formal membership negotiations, according to Macedonian Deputy Prime Minister for European Issues Teuta Arifi.
"The dialogue is the EU's pro-active answer [in response to] the activities we have undertaken since the latest EC progress report," Arifi said.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov said however, the ICJ verdict in favour of Macedonia and the 1996 Macedonia-Greece interim accord provide a framework for Macedonia to continue the EU integration process.
Ivanov impressed this stance upon high EU officials -- Richard Hewitt, Eduard Kukan, Lojze Peterle -- during their meeting late last month.
"We should have this process in parallel with our discussions with Greece to find a solution to the name issue," Ivanov's foreign affairs adviser, Darko Kostadinovski, told SETimes.
Some analysts say dialogue mechanisms can overcome existing regional bilateral disputes and ease the candidates' EU accession.
"In 1981, the European Parliament gave a negative decision for Greece's EU membership, but because of political pressure, the country was admitted," Bozhinovski said.
The other regional countries that aspire for EU membership have not yet announced EU accession negotiations, but analysts say bilateral disputes will be an issue in the process.
Belgrade and Pristina reached an agreement last month regarding Kosovo's regional representation, which Brussels received very positively and provided Serbia with EU membership candidate status.
Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) will submit a membership application to the EU in July.
The issues BiH faces are reforms-related but also related to relations with Serbia and Croatia regarding Republika Srpska and the position of Croats in BiH.
China warms up to Greek wines
China will be drinking Greek wines thanks to a multimillion-euro, ten-year trade deal signed earlier this year.

The VAENI-Naoussa winemaking co-operative, consisting of 220 local winegrowers, has signed the biggest-ever wine export deal with a leading company in China.
VAENI is now reaping the benefits of concerted efforts after winning over the Chinese market thanks to its dynamic promotional initiative last year, which included sending over a "test" batch of 250,000 bottles.
"What's important is to locate the source and arouse the interest.
Now it's all about seeing things through the right way," VAENI President George Fountoulis told SETimes.
The Naoussa region in Macedonia, Greece, is one of the country's leading wine producing territories, famous for its "xinomavro" variety.
VAENI accounts for approximately 50% of Naoussa's total wine production, producing three million bottles a year and exporting to 27 countries.
"The Chinese prefer red wines.
The 'xinomavro' variety is unique and this creates great potential," explained Fountoulis, adding that it is vital Greek wine producers become more extrovert if they are to break into other markets.
He revealed the company is already in negotiations with the Indian market.
A bottle of VAENI wine now sells for between 2 and 14 euros in China. The company has also set it sights on exporting other Greek products, including olive oil.
Ever since the 2004 Olympic Games, China has expressed keen interest in traditional Greek products.
China's Prime Minister Wen Jiabao gave Greek wine his stamp of approval on his last official visit to Greece.
Wen drank a Domaine Tselepos wine, opening the door for Greek exports.
Months later, viticulturist Yiannis Tselepos, the owner of Domaine Tselepos, inked an 840,000-euro deal and in 2011 saw off 45,000 10-euro bottles to Asia.
In the meantime, another Greek born into a winemaking family, Mihalis Boutaris, went as far as to move to China, and in collaboration with local producer Mogao, set up the Sunshine Valley Winery in the Gansu Province, western China.
He, too, agrees that moving outside Greek borders is of utmost importance.
"Naturally every actual trading transaction or investment adds on to the trend of a more extrovert Greece, especially towards China," Boutaris, who is Sunshine Valley's chairman, told SETimes.
"Our vision is to make Greek production live up to the expectations, pave the wave for other Greek products, and make Chinese consumers enjoy Greek wines," he added.
A new appellation system set up in the early 1980s, combined with higher standards set by the EU, has seen the quality of Greek wines improve and winemakers turning their sights to international markets.
According to a 2011 report by Dimitris Thomopoulos, of the Beijing-based Greek Liaison Office of Economic and Commercial Affairs, China's wine market is among the fastest growing with imports increasing by 30% in the last five years -- due in great part to stronger buying power and to the fact that wine is becoming a symbol of status.
Serbian dinar continues its downward trend
Since the beginning of the year, Serbia's national currency has declined steadily in relation to the euro and other foreign currency.
By Ivana Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 12/03/12

The Serbian dinar (RSD) has reached a historic low against the euro.
In 2002, when the German mark was replaced, a euro was valued at 60 dinars. On March 12th, the exchange rate was 110.63 RSD.
The dinar has steadily been weakening in the last decade, but its depreciation dramatically increased in recent years.
The RSD continued to weaken in the last two months, despite numerous interventions by the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) through foreign exchange placements.
In a statement, the bank said weakening of the dinar this year was caused by an unexpected increase in energy imports.
Changes in the dinar value have multiple effects on the domestic economy, which mainly depends on import or export-oriented enterprises.
While euro strengthening corresponds to export entrepreneurs, that in turn hurts importers.
Mile Dragic, the director and owner of a company manufacturing military and police equipment that exports to more than 30 countries, including the US, says manufacturers that rely on imported components are most at risk by the weakened dinar.
"Public companies negotiate prices only in dinars without possible corrections.
In our example, from the contract date until the day of collection, more than six months can go by, and because prices are fixed in dinars, in case of inflation we lose exact amount as the inflation, so we do not have enough to cover simple reproduction," Dragic told SETimes.
Dragic, who employs more than 350 workers, is also worried about the effect on individual employees because the weakening of the exchange rate reduces general purchasing power.
Slobodan Aleksic, 56, a Vranje stove factory worker, provides a good example.
"It is difficult to handle pressures because I'm alone in the family [with] a safe job.
My wife lost hers because the factory she worked for closed down, and our daughter works in a small private company which is not stable at all.
The worse thing is that we took a loan in euros and bought a car for her.
My salary is not linked to currency, nor is my daughter's," Aleksic told SETimes.
In order to prevent serious consequences of dinar variations, the NBS is trying to promote the use of the dinar, and reduce the use of other currencies.
One possible measure to reduce the depreciation of the domestic currency is raising the NBS benchmark interest rate, said Dejan Jovovic, a Serbian Chamber of Commerce adviser.
"When the benchmark interest rate is increased, loans automatically become more expensive, the money supply is reduced, and when the money supply is reduced then the word is about the lack of dinars and it, automatically, leads to dinar strengthening," Jovovic told SETimes.
OIC adopts resolution on Kosovo
The OIC unanimously adopted a resolution that praises Kosovo's progress in strengthening democracy, peace and stability in the region.

The foreign ministers of the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) voiced their support for an independent Kosovo at their 36th Ministerial Summit on Monday (May 25th) in Damascus, Syria.
They praised "progress made towards strengthening democracy", in a resolution adopted at the summit.
The Albanian Foreign Ministry drafted the document, and Saudi Arabia put it on the table.
Albanian Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha described the OIC resolution as a great success for Kosovo, and for Albanian diplomacy.
According to Basha, the resolution was unanimously adopted by all 57 members.
"This is a very important resolution for Kosovo and I am sure that very soon Kosovo will be accepted by many OIC member states," said Basha.
The resolution states that, since unilaterally declaring independence in February 2008, the country has made progress in building democratic institutions, modernising its constitution and contributing to regional stability.
It calls on OIC members and the international community to support the former Serbian province and its economy.
Although the resolution does not recognise Kosovo's independence, it leaves the option open for members.
Furthermore, it notes the accelerated UNMIK reconfiguration, the deployment of EULEX throughout Kosovo -- in compliance with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon's guidelines -- and Kosovo's institutional and legal framework.
According to the resolution, Ban will submit a report at the next OIC summit.
Serbia lobbied against the resolution, to no avail.
But with the support of Syria, Egypt and other Russian-influenced countries, the OIC stopped short of recognising Kosovo's independence.
Undaunted, Kosovo Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni welcomed the resolution, and emphasised its importance.
On Tuesday, President Fatmir Sejdiu called the resolution a step in the right direction.
"We expect new recognitions and we also express the readiness of Kosovo's institutions to co-operate with all of these countries," he said.
Turkish novelist on trial for "insulting religion"
Turkish writer Nedim Gursel, on trial over his latest book, hoped for an acquittal Tuesday.
Instead, the court decided to adjourn the trial until next month.

Turkish writer Nedim Gursel, who is being tried on charges of inciting racial and religious hatred in his latest novel, rejected the accusations in an Istanbul court Tuesday (May 26th).
His book on the birth of Islam in the 6th century, "The Daughters of Allah", was published in Turkey last year.
Ali Emre Bukagili, a civil engineer, filed a lawsuit against the author, insisting that his depiction of the Prophet Muhammad, his wives and the Koran, was insulting to Muslims.
"This is a novel, and it is not possible for novels to commit crimes," Gursel, who fled Turkey during a military coup about 30 years ago and is now a naturalised French citizen, said in court Tuesday. "I reject the accusation of having made fun of religion."
The writer had hoped to see the charges dropped, but the hearing, which lasted less than an hour, was adjourned until June 26th.
If convicted, Gursel could face a sentence of at least six months.
Prosecutors say there is no evidence to support Bukagili's claim and no justification to put the writer on trial.
But the court rejected that decision based on the engineer's separate complaints about the book's first and second editions.
The two separate cases were merged at Tuesday's hearing.
"The Daughters of Allah", which raises questions about faith and violence in Islam, is a work of fiction that was not meant to offend anyone, Gursel said, stressing that he respects all religious creeds.
"The book has been out for a year," he told Reuters in a telephone interview. "It has reached 30,000 people -- where is the hatred it has incited?
Where is the anger?"
Still hoping for an acquittal, he was disturbed by the Turkish Religious Affairs Directorate's decision to intervene in the case by conducting a report on his book.
It was "worrying", he said, that a panel tasked with overseeing the activities of mosques and the teaching of theology has chosen to overstep its powers and accuse him.
Furthermore, it is the job of literary critics to criticise books, not religious institutions, he said.
"It is sad that a writer can be tried with such a mentality," Turkish BIA news agency quoted Gursel as saying.
Although Turkey has lifted some restrictions on freedom of expression in recent years, Gursel is just the latest among scores of Turkish writers and intellectuals to be put on trial.
Orhan Pamuk, winner of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Literature, for example, was tried on charges of "insulting Turkishness" over his comments to a Swiss magazine several years ago that his country was responsible for the deaths of 30,000 Kurds and 1,000,000 Armenians.
"I thought those times were over," Gursel told the DPA, commenting on censorship in Turkey.
Turkey's Erdogan visits Germany, EU headquarters
BERLIN, Germany -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in Germany on Sunday (February 27th), where he attended a meeting with about 10,000 Turkish immigrants in Dusseldorf.
Addressing them, Erdogan expressed concern about growing racism in Germany, urging both Germans and Turkish to respect each other.
On Monday, Erdogan meets with Chancellor Angela Merkel, opening the Cebit Computer Trade Fair in Hannover.
On Tuesday, Erdogan travels on to Brussels for talks with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and EU President Herman van Rompuy.
This will be Erdogan's first visit to EU headquarters since June 2009. (Hurriyet, Zaman - 27/02/11)
New Romanian interior minister selected
Although the Social Democrats' choice caught many by surprise, its leaders insist Liviu Dragnea is the man for the job.

Liviu Dragnea, deputy head of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), has been tapped as Romania's new interior minister.
The PSD's executive committee unanimously approved his nomination Monday (January 19th).
The choice of Dragnea caught many by surprise.
Media reports had predicted that Dan Nica, deputy prime minister and interim interior minister, would be the one taking the portfolio.
Furthermore, Dragnea purportedly fell out of favour with President Traian Basescu after quitting the latter's Democratic Liberal Party and joining the PSD.
The head of state has to give the final approval for any designated minister.
In a now-notorious incident, the president called Dragnea a "terrorist" following a meeting with him in March 2007.
PSD leader Mircea Geoana, however, says he discussed the nomination with Basescu and Prime Minister Emil Boc prior to selecting Dragnea.
He said Basescu received the PSD's proposal "correctly and institutionally", indicating he does not want to undermine the newly formed ruling coalition.
Dragnea "has all the qualities and all the correct instincts for this important position.
He is a champion of decentralisation," Geoana said. "His presence will be a guarantee that this ample process of Romania's democratisation will continue in a sustained rhythm."
There was no abstention, no objection," said honorary PSD President Ion Iliescu.
He added that Dragnea's experience as three-time head of the Teleorman County Council would prove "very useful" at the interior ministry.
The nomination strengthens the principle that interior ministers should come from the civilian and not the military sector, Iliescu said.
Dragnea has said his main objectives will be to improve public safety, including in schools, and to decentralise and reform the administration.
Although he will have to give up his county council seat, he will continue to supervise the PSD branches in Giurgiu and Calarasi counties.
Former Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu, who heads the opposition National Liberal Party (PNL), greeted the choice with scepticism, saying it shows the PSD is suffering from an acute lack of personnel.
Dragnea reportedly underwent investigation by the National Anti-Corruption Department in a case concerning the absorption of EU funds, but the department later closed the file.
He left the Democratic Party, which later became the PDL, in 2000 and joined the PSD. In 2005, he won promotion to deputy party president.
He replaces Gabriel Oprea, whose own party forced him to resign over his controversial selection of Virgil Ardelean to head the country's intelligence services.
Rail Line to Reconnect Former Yugoslav Republics
In a move seen as highly significant for regional economic development, Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia have agreed to launch a direct cargo train service among their capitals.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade – 21/09/04

The heads of the Serbian, Slovenian and Croatian railroads signed an agreement last month in Belgrade to introduce a direct cargo train, Sava Ekspres, which will run once a week among Belgrade, Zagreb and Ljubljana.
The first phase in a larger project to connect European railways with Istanbul, the planned rail service has been hailed as having tremendous potential to improve economic co-operation in the region.
According to Slovenian officials, the train is "one of the most important steps in the establishing of a European rail network in cargo traffic". It will depart from Ljubljana for Belgrade on Wednesdays and return to Ljubljana on Thursdays -- a round-trip journey of 14 hours.
Slovenia and Croatia are among the countries taking an active part in the privatisation of Serbian companies, and the cargo train is expected to transport large quantities of goods.
In the past year, total exports from Slovenia to Serbia have increased 75 per cent, while imports from Serbia to Slovenia have risen by 395 per cent.
Representatives of the three railroads project that more than a million tonnes of goods will be transported on the line by the end of this year. In 2005, Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia expect traffic of around 1.5 million tonnes of goods by rail.
The head of the ZTP Beograd railway, Milenko Sarancic, announced that the new train would start running on 1 October.
Two other cargo trains may be introduced six months later, he added.
Croatian railroad Director Tomislav Mlinaric said the deal is of great importance and will boost his country's use of railroads.
Slovenian railroad Director Blaz Miklasic, meanwhile, said the introduction of daily cargo trains could be on the agenda of talks next year.
EBRD Confirms Additional Financial Support for Albania
The EBRD is helping to fund a major thermo-central power plant project in southern Albania, considered vital to preventing power shortages.
Bank president Jean Lemierre was in Tirana earlier this month, pledging to aid the country's development.

During a visit to Tirana in early September, EBRD President Jean Lemierre confirmed that the institution he heads is interested in development projects in Albania.
In particular, the bank will grant funds in April 2005 for the construction of a new thermo-central facility in the southern city of Vlora.
"We look forward to the construction of the thermo-central plant, which will solve Albania’s problem of power cuts in the southern part of the country," Lemierre said.
Work on the project -- considered one of the most important in Albania's power sector over the last 20 years -- is expected to start in early 2005 and to be completed within two years.
The EBRD has been one of the main financial contributors to thermo-central construction in Albania.
Nearly 120m euros are being provided by three international financial institutions -- the EBRD, the World Bank and the European Bank of Investments -- and the Albanian government.
Authorities in Tirana regard the EBRD's involvement as vital.
Lemierre met with President Alfred Moisiu and Prime Minister Fatos Nano, who urged the EBRD to assist local authorities with the privatisation process of Albtelekom, the country's main landline telephony company.
The EBRD "would contribute to realise a successful privatisation process of Albania's strategic sector," Lemierre told journalists afterwards.
In the meantime, the bank disbursed 200m euros for the continuation of its investments in Albania until 2005.
According to official data, EBRD contributions so far have been concentrated on encouraging the private sector -- especially small and medium-size enterprises -- through investments and direct assistance.
The bank also plans investments in infrastructure, airports, tourism and decentralisation of local government.
Between January 2002 and December 2003 alone, the EBRD provided nearly 88.2m euros for four projects.
Romania Hopes for EU Recognition as Functioning Market Economy
Existence of a functioning market economy is one of the key requirements an EU candidate country must meet to finalise its accession talks.
Romania hopes an upcoming EU report will conclude it has fulfilled that criterion.
(Wall Street Journal, Rompres, Mediafax, European Commission Delegation in Romania - 20/09/04; SEEurope - 16/09/04; EurActiv - 03/09/04)
Romanian President Ion Iliescu said Monday (20 September) that his country would complete its accession talks with the EU by the end of the year, enabling it to join the Union in 2007. [AFP]
Romania's chief negotiator with the EU, Vasile Puscas, voiced hope Monday (20 September) that an upcoming European Commission (EC) report would grant it recognition as a functioning market economy -- a key requirement the country must meet to finalise its accession talks with the Union.
"We hope that in the country report to be issued on 6 October, Romania will be deemed a functioning market economy with the mention that, if reforms continue, it would have the full capacity of functioning within the conditions of the EU internal market upon the date of its EU entry," Puscas said in a press statement.
Romania, which has so far closed 25 of the 31 negotiating chapters, wants to complete its membership talks with Brussels by the end of this year before joining the EU in 2007, with Bulgaria.
In a press statement also released Monday, the head of the EC Delegation in Romania, Jonathan Scheele, said the upcoming report would focus on functional market economy status, one of two economic sub-criteria for membership.
Compliance with the second -- the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union -- would only be required by 2007, he added.
Bulgaria was recognised as a functioning market economy in 2002, with the EC report saying it "should be able to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union in the medium term, provided that it continues implementing its reform programme to remove remaining difficulties".
Bulgaria wrapped up its talks with the Union earlier this year.
In its regular report on Romania last year, the EC called for vigorous and sustained implementation of structural reforms and said the country could be "considered as a functioning market economy once the good progress made has continued decisively".
While praising Romania for the reforms achieved so far, the EC said prudent fiscal and wage policies and a continued reduction in the quasi-fiscal deficit were needed.
It also urged the country to advance its expenditure reform, improve tax compliance, liquidate loss-making enterprises, address the continued accumulation of arrears in the budget and energy sector, and establish natural gas prices that accurately reflect short and long-term costs.
Speaking before members of the European Parliament's foreign affairs committee at the end of August, EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen said it would not be a "disaster" if Romania were unable to complete its talks by late December.
"We would still have a year left to ensure that Romania can join by 1 January 2007," Verheugen said.
On Monday, however, Romanian President Ion Iliescu expressed his determination that the country would complete the accession talks by year's end.
He stressed Romania's efforts to implement reforms in the last two years, as well as incentives offered to foreign investors.
The president acknowledged that the government has two months of hard work ahead to persuade the European Commission to wrap up negotiations.
Will Developmental Economics Stage A Comeback?
Free prices and competition are essential for proper resource allocation. [SE Times] Economist and former Romanian Minister of Finance Daniel Daianu emphasises the importance of good institutions and proper structures for public and corporate governance.
These, he argues, condition the overall performance of the economy.
By Daniel Daianu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest - 20/10/03
The basic rules of the economic game which underlie the sound functioning of economies can hardly be questioned.
Free prices and competition are essential for proper resource allocation; there is a need for clearly defined and protected property rights in order to foster entrepreneurship and commercial transactions; hard budget constraints need to operate ubiquitously in order to have financial stability; over the longer term low budget deficits are better than large ones; money printing is bad for monetary stability.
At the same time, however, intellectual bigotry and doctrinal fundamentalism are detrimental to good policymaking, which needs to be pragmatic and not skewed towards vested interests.
With a new millenium now under way, the jury is still out on several central issues which have divided economists over the decades.
This ambiguity should trigger a more candid debate among policymakers and government advisers.
Let me single out some of the central issues which concern the situation of the developing world, in particular:
Although free trade is deemed desirable by most economists, the existence of large asymmetries and dynamic effects provide a rationale for developing countries to seek some protection; some distinguish between free and fair trade.
As Dani Rodrik put it, free trade is not always conducive to economic growth.
The failure of the recent trade talks in Cancun is a stark reminder of this reality, which relates to the discrepancy between what rich countries preach and what they practice (the case of agriculture subsidies is notorious).
Free capital flows have been revealed to be quite threatening for emerging markets.
The IMF no longer recommends the opening of the capital account, as it used to a decade ago, unless proper regulatory and institutional prerequisites exist.
There is renewed interest in market co-ordination failures and an acknowledgment that a rationale exists for public intervention in the economy in this respect.
The proliferation of financial and currency crises, as well as gross irregularities in the functioning of other markets (energy trading, for example), make a compelling case for strengthening regulatory frameworks and law enforcement by the state (some would say that a "market-oriented regulatory state" gets an increasing profile).
The role of government in providing public goods is undeniable.
In addition, some would argue that fostering industrial and technological development is also part of the government's role.
The EU's Eurika programme, as well as a series of defence programmes in the United States, can be described as examples of industrial policy.
Fiscal neutralism, if taken to the extreme, can be deceptive in a world of large asymmetries.
There are numerous examples of advanced and emerging economies which use fiscal devices cleverly, in order to promote national economic goals; such devices can be used in order to foster domestic savings.
Who is accountable for the provision of public goods in the world economy?
Do major economies have a moral and operational responsibility in this respect, including the co-ordination of various policies in order to avert bad equilibria in the world economy?
While underscoring the pre-eminence of markets in resource allocation and rewarding of entrepreneurship, economists continue to debate the economic role of governments.
This debate has been fueled by theoretical insights brought about by the "New Theories" (as Robert Gilpin refers to them): the theory of multiple equilibria, which posits the possibility of persistent bad equilibria; the theory of endogenous growth, which undermines some of the basic constructs of neoclassical economics (such as "the law of diminishing returns"); the thesis of "path dependency" (the role of history), the importance of geography; the role of information costs and asymmetries; and the role of clusters in achieving competitive advantages (Michael Porter's use of clusters in explaining competitive advantages reminds Gunnr Myrda's concept of cumulative causation), etc.
The New Theories rely on, and bring back to the limelight, theses of the old development economics.
Albert Hirschman, Paul Rosenstein Rodan, Ragnar Nurkse, Gunar Myrdal, Harvey Leibenstein, and others highlighted the role of institutions and structural features of poor countries, which keep them hostage to various types of traps.
That suggests a need for development assistance -- or what Rodan termed as the "Big Push" in a famous article written in 1943.
To sum up, the current debate on development economics has rediscovered several of its old issues.
In this context, it re-emphasises the existence of externalities, multiple equilibria, bad path-dependencies, vicious circles and "underdevelopment traps", all of which pose numerous challenges to public policy.
It is increasingly obvious that public policy (at the national and the international level), while it has a role to play in order to address government failures, also needs to address market co-ordination failures.
In this context, one needs to underline the importance of good institutions and proper structures for public and corporate governance, which condition the overall performance of the economy.
The wide variety of economic performance in transition (post-communist) countries must be related to the different functioning of institutional set-ups and policy diversity.
It may be that we are on the verge of a new age of development economics, seen against the backdrop of the very disappointing record of economic advancement in most of the developing world (excluding China and parts of India), transition failures in many post-communist countries, andthe backlash against "unmanaged" globalisation.
Olivier Blanchard, Paul Krugman, Dani Rodrik, Joseph Stiglitz, and others form a remarkable platoon of brilliant economists, capable of injecting more realism and creativity into development policymaking.

Macedonia in troubled waters following NATO summit
Macedonia's hopes of NATO and EU integration hinge on reaching a compromise with Greece and fulfilling a set of eight benchmarks set by Brussels.
But with the country now in political limbo, progress on both fronts could be delayed.
By Zoran Nikolovski for Southeast European Times in Skopje – 21/04/08

After their initial shock and disbelief at the failure to receive a NATO membership invitation, Macedonians are now preparing to go to the polls on June 1st.
Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski decided to accept a proposal by the Democratic Union of Albanians (DUI) for early parliamentary elections.
He said he wanted to a new mandate and a more stable parliamentary composition, and in that way solve the problems that many expect may pile up by the summer.
The move, however, has sparked criticism, with some saying a round of elections will simply distract focus from the main problem at hand -- resolving the name dispute with Greece.
The disagreement not only stood in the way of a NATO invitation at the Bucharest summit, but also could affect the start of negotiations on EU membership.
At Bucharest, NATO leaders agreed that if Athens and Skopje are able to reach a compromise, a decision on extending an invitation to Macedonia could be made at the ambassadorial level, without having to wait for another summit.
Meeting with Gruevski and President Branko Crvenkovski, US Ambassador to NATO Victoria Nuland urged resolution of the name issue "within days or weeks, not months".
She urged Skopje to "seize the moment", and try to hammer out a compromise while NATO is still focused on the issue.
During a marathon debate on dissolving parliament, however, the opposition Social Democrats charged that Gruevski was turning his back on the allies and opting instead for a domestic political battle.
Addressing lawmakers, Crvenkovski claimed that he and Gruevski had earlier agreed on the need for a compromise with Greece, and had gone to Bucharest ready to accept the name Republic of Macedonia (Skopje) -- international mediator Matthew Nimetz's most recent proposal.
In any case, Macedonia's prospects for integration -- both in NATO and the EU -- now appear complicated by several factors.

The EU has put forward eight benchmarks which Macedonia must fulfil if it wants the European Commission (EC) to even consider the start of negotiations.
But with the elections now scheduled for June, it will be difficult to meet those conditions by the time the EC issues its reports in September.
It will be already be mid-summer before a new government can be constituted.
With parliament dissolved, meanwhile, opportunities for further negotiations with Greece are constricted.
The government now functions in a technical capacity, with limited competencies and a ban on making major decisions.
While Washington has been a strong advocate of Macedonia's integration, the United States could become less focused on the Balkans as its own presidential elections approach.
NATO membership is widely regarded not only as a major milestone, but also crucial for Macedonia's stability. Although a 2001 ethnic conflict was defused through the Ohrid Accord, multi-ethnic democracy in the country is still a work in progress.
Institutions remain fragile, and uncertainty about integration prospects is no boon to the weak Macedonian economy.
The country has a 113m euro trade deficit, rising inflation, and an unemployment rate of around 35%.
Increased foreign investment is needed to solve these problems, but the post-Bucharest summit uncertainty does not make Macedonia a more attractive place for investors.
Together, economic woes and institutional problems could be fertile ground for resurgent nationalism, especially in the wake of Kosovo independence.
The Macedonia-Kosovo border has not been marked, and secessionist groups could feel emboldened by developments in the region.
"If [Macedonia] does not enter NATO now, I have to tell you that I seriously doubt if your country will continue to exist a decade later," Edward Joseph of the International Crisis Group warned during an interview on March 21st.
"I am seriously concerned because the Macedonian identity is seriously jeopardised by neighbours, who I fear have dark agendas."

Albania's prime minister, Sali Berisha, has also expressed concern that radicalization could take place in Macedonia if the country stays outside NATO.
"The name issue is a matter that must be solved and can be solved," he told the BBC recently.
The Macedonian elections are expected to be fiercely contested, with bitter and polarising rhetoric.
The debate over dissolving parliament offered a taste of what may be in store, with the Social Democrats accusing the ruling VMRO-DPMNE of "betraying" Macedonia.
The opposition also claims the Gruevski administration is preparing to rig the elections, because the ruling party did not allow passage of some key election legislation -- including the appointment of a new State Election Committee president and a regulation on equal access to state-run media.
With Macedonians dismayed by Greece's veto and worried about ethnic tension at home, it may be difficult for politicians to avoid playing to nationalist sentiment.
"I have the feeling that both political campuses in Macedonia will confront each other in terms of proving who is a greater patriot and who is smaller, and this is absolutely unimportant at the moment," says Tanja Karakamiseva, a law professor at the University of Skopje.
"It is important to keep up with Europe."
Bulgaria's Kotooshu first European to win biggest sumo prize
Bulgarian sumo wrestler Kotooshu became the first European to win the prestigious Summer Grand Tournament in Tokyo last month and is now a step closer to attaining his sport's highest rank.

Less than six years after his debut in sumo wrestling, Bulgarian wrestler Kotooshu became the first European to win the Summer Grand Tournament in Tokyo and capture the Emperor's Cup, the biggest prize in the ancient sport.
"Finally, I made it," Kotooshu, born Kaloyan Mahlyanov, told reporters after he clinched the title a day before his final match on May 25th. "I can't find (the) right words to express my feelings."
The 25-year-old Bulgarian triumphed with a record 14 wins over 15 days, besting the two highest-ranked participants in the event, Mongolian yokozuna Asashoryu and Hakuho.
Kotooshu suffered only one defeat -- by the lower-ranked Aminishiki.
The wrestler's proud father, Stefan, was in Tokyo to watch.
Sitting in the crowded Kokugikan stadium, he waved a small Bulgarian flag and shook hands with dozens of other spectators.
Back in his hometown of Dzhulyunitsa, Kotooshu's mother did not miss a match on TV, either.
She and her friends are now experts of sorts on sumo, according to one of the friends.
Kotooshu has admirers in high places.
Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov sent off a congratulatory letter to the 202-cm-tall athlete, an EU Goodwill Ambassador since last year.
Former French President Jacques Chirac, reportedly one of Kotooshu's biggest fans, dined with the Bulgarian wrestler in Japan a few years ago.
At the age of 14, Kotooshu became a Greco-Roman wrestler.
He won a European championship but switched to sumo, making his debut in November 2002.
Kotooshu won promotion to ozeki, the second-highest category in sumo, in January 2006.
Clinching the title in Tokyo cleared the path for his promotion to yokozuna after an injury-hampered two years.
A victory at next month's Grand Tournament in Nagoya would significantly strengthen Kotooshu's chances of advancement.
His manager warned the achievement of that goal would require further effort.
Sadogatake said, "If he doesn't keep this up and become mentally stronger, he won't be able to aim for higher things."
Other Balkan athletes have excelled in similar sports in recent years.
The list includes two super-middleweight boxers -- Albania's Kreshnik Qato, a world and Eastern European champion, and Romania's Lucian Bute, who ranked fourth in his category in the World Boxing Federation's world ratings for March 2008.
Another popular fighter is former Croatian police officer turned kickboxer and mixed martial artist Mirko "Cro Cop" Filipovic.
His Romanian colleague Stefan Cojocnean set the world record at the 14th kickboxing "Impossibility Challenge" contest in Dachau, Germany, at the end of March.
Turkish taekwondo champions Bahri and Azize Tanrikulu, who are brother and sister, both hope to add Olympic gold medals to their collections in Beijing.
Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey could send up to 15 weightlifters to the Beijing Games in August, in which Turkey's Halil Mutlu hopes to win his fourth successive Olympic gold medal.

Attempted break-in targets Kosovo prime minister's home
A young man who tried to break into Hashim Thaci's house says he did not know who lived there and was just trying to steal something.
By Blerta Foniqi-Kabashi for Southeast European Times in Pristina – 09/06/08

Burglary was the motive behind an attempted break-in at the Pristina home of Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci, according to the main suspect.
Late Friday (June 6th), Thaci's bodyguards discovered a man on the balcony of the house, trying to force entry.
The intruder escaped but reportedly suffered a wound to his right arm during an exchange of gunfire.
Police subsequently arrested a 19-year-old man with a criminal record, acting on a tip from the suspect's own father.
Police say it is still not clear if the would-be burglar acted alone or had accomplices. Thaci was away at the time of the incident, but his wife and son were in the house.
"I am happy that my family is not injured," the prime minister said.
He declined to comment on possible motives, saying it was up to the courts to handle the case.
"I don't want to prejudge," Thaci said at a Saturday press conference. "We have our judicial institutions and police.
They should have time to deal with this attack.
At the end of the process, we will know the motive."
Government leaders, who initially characterised the incident as an assault on Kosovo's institutions and the rule of law, expressed scepticism about the suspect's story.
But opposition politicians accused the government of trying to score points.
Ramush Haradinaj, a former prime minister who heads the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo, said officials were trying to make political hay out of a serious security breach.
The incident comes at a jittery time for Kosovo, the self-proclaimed state that broke from Serbia in February.
It is still battling for international recognition despite opposition from Belgrade and Moscow, while Serbs in the north have refused to go along with independence and are setting up parallel institutions.
Meanwhile, the political coalition between Thaci's Democratic Party of Kosovo and its main rival, the Democratic League of Kosovo, is an uneasy one.
On Saturday, Thaci vowed that Kosovo would remain stable.
"No one will have the power to encroach on democracy, independence, freedom and security," he said.
Incidents such as Friday's would not hinder Kosovo's aspirations to become "a proud member of the EU family and NATO", Thaci said.

Turkey opts for caution regarding Bahrain
Ankara's relatively mild reaction contrasts with its earlier stance on the Egyptian crisis.
By Alakbar Raufoglu for Southeast European Times -- 04/03/11

As protestors in Bahrain call for ousting the country's ruling dynasty, Turkey has taken a cautious approach in voicing its concern.
"We appeal to all parties in Bahrain to refrain from violence," the foreign ministry said, avoiding direct criticism of the Bahraini government.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators, mostly Shia Muslims, have staged marches in the streets of the island nation, demanding the Sunni al-Khalifa dynasty cede power and enable the formation of a constitutional monarchy.
A police clampdown has led to the deaths of several protesters and hundreds of injuries.
Turkey's position is adequate to the ongoing processes in Bahrain, an administration official told SETimes.
"We have witnessed Bahrain taking steps towards reforms, and have urged them first to listen to their people," said the chairman of the Turkey-Bahrain Friendship Group, MP Veysi Kaynak.
According to Celalettin Yavuz, an analyst at the Ankara-based Centre for International Relations and Strategic Analysis, Turkey's views on Bahrain are shaped by trade ambitions in the Gulf and awareness of Bahrain's role in the Middle East.
"Turkish society is not interested in Bahrain protests that much, unlike in Egypt," he told SETimes. Ankara, he added, believes the ruling al-Khalifas will overcome the crisis.
"While these protests will pass, Ankara's relationship with Bahrain will remain," parliament member Kaynak notes.
Last month, Bahrain's Crown Prince Salman Bin Hamad al-Khalifa and two ministers visited Ankara, where they met with Turkish leaders to discuss improved diplomatic relations and commercial ties.
Trade volume between Turkey and Bahrain increased to $244m in 2010, from $150m in 2009.
"The difference in Turkey's approach to Bahrain may be rooted in reasonable fears," agrees Brian Mello, European specialist on social movements in the Middle East.
These, he said, include concerns that instability could undermine important economic ties, "or that in Bahrain, unlike Egypt, sectarian social divisions might make any political transition more messy and uncertain".
"This hesitance might also reflect an understanding that the regime in Bahrain is better able to survive than the former Egyptian regime, which would make strong statements ill-advised," he told SETimes.
Nevertheless, Mello said, the clear disparity between the approach to Egypt and Bahrain leaves the Turkish government open to criticism.
Raymond Ibrahim, associate director at the Washington-based Middle East Forum, said Turkey is also anxious about the possibility of a domino effect in the region.
"Ankara would not want to criticise the Bahraini government since it fears it may well find itself in a similar situation -- having to use force against the Turks, should they protest," Ibrahim told SETimes.

UK lawmakers: Turkey must improve border control to join EU
A group of UK lawmakers called on the EU on Monday to make arrangements for Turkey to take some of the attributes of membership in the Union prior to its full accession.
(UK Parliament, BBC, FT, The Guardian, Huffington Post, Belfast Telegraph, Daily Mail - 01/08/11)
Turkey's EU accession would pose serious security risks, some UK MPs warn. [Reuters]
Turkey must strengthen its border controls before joining the EU, a group of UK lawmakers said in a report released on Monday (August 1st), warning that the country's accession would pose risks to the security of the 27-nation bloc's external border.
Turkey began entry talks with the Union in October 2005, but the process has stalled for various reasons and several member states remain opposed to the country ever being admitted as a full-fledged member.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule told members of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, which prepared the report, that the predominantly Muslim nation is not generally expected to join the bloc until 2020 at the earliest.
Turkey's border with EU members Bulgaria and Greece in the north represents just a tiny fragment of the one it shares with its southern and southeastern neighbours, including Syria, Iraq and Iran, which will become part of the bloc's external frontier upon its accession.
The UK lawmakers, whose country is a staunch supporter of Turkey's membership in the EU, described the predominantly Muslim nation's land border with Greece as "the main loophole for irregular immigration" into the Union.
"By October 2010, about 46% of all irregular immigration detected at the EU external border took place at the land border between Greece and Turkey, and the authorities estimated that up to 350 migrants were attempting to cross the 12.5km land border near the Greek city of Orestiada every day," they said in the report.
At Athens's request, a team of experts from Frontex, the EU border agency, was deployed to the area in November last year to help Greece deal with the growing problem of illegal entries from Turkey.
The panel said that the number of irregular crossings dropped more than 4.5 times over a five-month period -- from 7,607 in October 2010 to 1,632 in February 2011, noting that the decline may be linked to the economic downturn in Europe in recent months.
The committee recommended that the EU should amend the regulation on the body's operations to allow it to work hand in hand with the Turkish border agencies, which it praised for their continued efforts towards better managing migration flows.
"We require a collective commitment from Greece, Turkey and the European and international law enforcement agencies to share intelligence and work together to bring down the criminal gangs who are responsible for bringing thousands of migrants into the EU each month," Labour MP Keith Vaz, the committee's chairman, said.
Turkish drug trafficking groups pose a significant threat to the internal security of the 27-nation bloc, the members of the committee further warned, noting that up to 80% of the heroin trafficked from Afghanistan to Western and Central Europe comes via Turkey.
According to Europol, the EU law enforcement agency, the amounts of cocaine from South America transported to the EU via Turkey and the Balkans have grown in recent years.
Although the volume of cocaine bound for the bloc's market that is seized by the Turkish authorities has increased over the last few years, it is far below that captured along the established cocaine trafficking route through the Iberian Peninsula, the MPs said.
They also voiced concern about the high levels of human trafficking to and through Turkey by local criminal groups.
According to the committee, the EU should "make special arrangements for Turkey to take on some of the attributes of EU membership prior to full accession, in order to tackle organised drug and immigration crime more effectively".
It also urged the new Turkish Parliament to take steps to bring into effect a data protection law to allow for a higher level of co-operation between the country's authorities and Europol prior to accession.
Football star Hristo Stoichkov joins Bulgarian EP initiative
Bulgarian European Parliament member Iliana Ivanova campaigns to overturn EU restrictions for Bulgarian labourers.
By Tzvetina Borisova for Southeast European Times in Sofia -- 01/08/11

Iliana Ivanova is a European Parliament (EP) member from Bulgaria's ruling GERB party.
In December 2009, six months into her EP post, she started an initiative to remove labour restrictions that prevent Bulgarian workers from landing jobs in ten EU countries.
Earlier this month, the initiative gained a powerful supporter – Bulgarian football star Hristo Stoichkov.
SETimes talked to Ivanova about the initiative.
SETimes: What progress has been made since launching the campaign?
In April 2010, I proposed a text to be included in the recommendations of the EP lawmakers on ways to fight the economic crisis.
It focused on the positive effects the expansion and free movement of workers and the removal of labour restrictions would have on improving the functioning of the internal market.
The EP Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection approved a text urging all EU member states that apply restrictions on Bulgarian workers to review their positions.
After discussing ways to boost the effect of our initiative on EU member states, Bulgarian Parliament spokesperson Tsetska Tsacheva sent letters to her counterparts in the ten European countries that still apply restrictions for Bulgarian workers -- Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands and the UK.
I have also had numerous meetings with these countries' ambassadors and with my EP colleagues.
SETimes: Is it realistic to expect removing labour restrictions for Bulgarian and Romanian workers by 2012 per your initiative?
Ivanova: I believe it is.
On June 18th, the EC began an EU-wide public survey about free movement of people and workers as well as discrimination that people from some EU member states face.
The survey is available in all EU languages and can be filled in online or on paper by August 12th.
The EC aims to assess the situation, identify the main obstacles and implement the principle of free movement and equal treatment of workers.
Another reason to feel positive is the answer I received to my second written question to the EC.
Labour commissioner Laslo Andor answered that at the end of the second transition period [end of 2011] he will ask those member states that want to extend it by another two years to provide "concrete and detailed evidence" of the need to keep restrictions.
SETimes: How do your EP colleagues feel about your and Bulgarians' ambitions regarding the EU labour market?
Ivanova: I have their total support.
As EP lawmakers, they are familiar and deeply appreciate the values of a united market -- most of all the free movement of people.
I was pleasantly surprised to be supported by the Dutch EP member Marije Cornelissen.
She is firmly against the restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian workers and organised a television debate on the issue of opening the labour markets.
SETimes: Who initiated the idea for Hristo Stoichkov to join the campaign?
Ivanova: We both decided that this is a case in which his popularity, determination and professionalism could impact and help the campaign's success.
With the support of a world famous athlete like Stoichkov, the campaign demonstrates that workers in the new EU member states can contribute greatly to the common EU labour market.
SETimes: What specific initiatives do you plan for Stoichkov, besides sending letters to EU member states to open labour markets?
Ivanova: After the letters are sent, we will organise jointly with our Romanian colleagues a round table at the EP.
We want to invite other popular persons who agreed to join the campaign, including Stoichkov.
Loan guarantors face dire straits in BiH
Loan guarantors assume liability in event of default, and under pressure, some meet an untimely end.
By Ljiljana Kovacevic for Southeast European times in Banja Luka – 01/08/11

Stress, strained relations with friends and family, bankruptcy and even suicide are often the outcome of guarantors no longer able to bear the weight of repaying other people's debts.
Nineteen guarantors committed suicide in the last three years, according to the Association for Protection of Guarantors of BiH.
"Guarantors have a signed contractual obligation to pay what others have borrowed if the borrowers are unable to pay the lenders, but they have no institutional protection," Association President Jovica Cvjetkovic told SETimes.
Cvjetkovic explained that in times of economic hardship, many want to help family, friends and acquaintances to obtain needed funding, but a large number are deceived by the very people they try to support.
According to Association data, there are 200,000 cheated guarantors, usually at the hands of friends or relatives.
In a country facing severe economic crisis like BiH, virtually any loan guarantor can potentially become a member of this group.
Problems with the guarantors emerged after the privatisation of the banking sector in 2002 and the arrival of foreign banks in BiH.
Credit expansion soon followed with massive borrowing by citizens that continued until the outbreak of the global economic crisis in 2008.
"The banks have valid contracts and can put the entire debt burden to the guarantors which they treat as equal to the borrowers.
Banks want to collect the debt as quickly as possible and are aware this can be accomplished much faster by charging guarantors rather than suing debtors," economist Sinisa Bozic told SETimes.
Bozic argues that the system is set up to allow borrowers to obtain loans in multiple banks and microcredit organisations, even if over-indebted.
"Initially, BiH's central bank did not have a Central Debt Registry (CKR) so that people borrowed beyond their means, but some borrowers soon began deceiving their guarantors who did not even know that over-borrowing occurred," Bozic said.
The Association is demanding a systemic resolution to the problem of guarantors, both in the two entities and at the level of BiH, as well as an organised a public campaign to that effect.
According to Cvjetkovic, the campaign's goal is to educate the guarantors, advocate amendments and additions to the law governing this area and to punish those responsible for defrauding guarantors.
Republika Srpska's Finance Ministry has already prepared draft legislation aiming to protect guarantors.
The Association leadership said it hopes the proposed legal changes -- specifying the precise obligations and rights of clients in their contracts with banks -- will prevent one from becoming a guarantor to over-indebted persons.
The Banking Agency of BiH, however, claims that this issue is already covered by the Law of Obligations, and recommends that the defrauded guarantors seek justice in court.
Its leadership said anyone who accepts being a guarantor immediately accepts the obligations of being the main debtor, and that all ensuing problems arising should be dealt with by the courts.
The Agency said it has launched a number of changes to address the systemic failures.
Since January, it prevents giving new loans to over-indebted persons.
The problem remains the already issued loans to a multitude of such people.
"Because it is unrealistic to expect retroactive changes to the law to relieve the guarantors of their obligation, the most practical thing is to put institutional pressure on the banks in case of payment delays or stopping debt payment [altogether].
Only when all options of the debtor are exhausted should collection be initiated from the guarantors," Bozic said.
After generals' resignation, Turkey enters uncertain period
The mass resignation reveals a shift in civil-military relations.
By Alakbar Raufoglu for Southeast European Times -- 01/08/11

Isik Kosaner, chief of the General Staff, together with the heads of the army, navy and air force stepped down on Friday (July 29th), sending shockwaves through Ankara.
The resignations were announced just days before a crucial high-level meeting of the Supreme Military Council (YAS), which runs August 1st to 4th to decide promotions and resignations.
Reports indicate the top military brass asked for early retirement in protest over the current detention of over 250 officers on charges of conspiring against the government.
The prime minister and president have traditionally endorsed the military's recommendations for promotion without interference, but tensions were raised when the government and military clashed over the promotion of detained officers.
In a farewell message to "brothers in arms", General Kosaner said it was impossible to continue his job as he could not defend detained solders due to a flawed judicial process.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan quickly announced commander of the Gendarmerie, General Necdet Ozel, as the new chief of the general staff.
Traditionally, the chief of the general staff has always been the ground forces commander.
According to analysts, the resignations indicate the rising supremacy of the civilian administration over the military in a country that has witnessed three military coups and substantial indirect intervention by the military into politics.
Salih Kapusuz, deputy leader of Erdogan's AKP, says everything has run according to procedure, while highlighting the resignations have not affected the order and functioning of the army.
"Turkey is implementing the procedures of democratisation and legalisation," he told SETimes, calling the resignation "nothing more than an act of early retirement".
"He [Kosaner] admitted the real reasons [of the resignation]," Kapusuz says, adding that when it comes to the independent court investigation "there is nothing to do with a third side, even the government."
However, the investigation into the alleged coup plots, going into its fourth year, has been criticised by many for its arbitrariness, politicisation, and the detention of suspects on often flimsy grounds.
Akif Hamzacebi, CHP parliamentary group deputy chairman, says "it is not about the court investigations; the issue itself is under the government's control."
"They [the government] want to redesign the military along their own lines", he told SETimes.
Oktay Vural, MHP deputy chairman and parliamentary group chairman, says the investigations have been used to blacken the image of the army which is often cited as the most respected institution in the country.
"There is a worry that investigations of the conspiracy against the government are targeted at discrediting and silencing the army," he told SETimes.
Meanwhile, analyst Halil Karaveli from the Central Asia-Caucasus Institute & Silk Road Studies Programme, emphasises that instead of staging a coup or sending veiled threats, the generals stepped down.
"That says it all," he told SETimes. "General Necdet Ozel, the incoming chief of the General staff, is a new type of general, with a 'civilian' mind, respectful of the government.
Thus, his elevation represents a chance to reset the relationship between the civilian authorities and the military."
"In the short run, I expect that the government will take steps that strengthen the position of General Ozel within the military, by displaying some leniency toward the generals," he adds.
Kemal Kaya, Turkey defence analyst and senior fellow at the Institute for Security and Development Policy, says recent developments show there is a power struggle between the secular establishment and moderate Islamists.
"With the assignment of Necdet Ozel as head of general, the crisis seems to be settled.
However, we should expect new peaks in crises in coming days between the civil authority and military circles," he told SETimes.
Serbian MPs adopt declaration on Kosovo
Lawmakers sent a toughly worded message to Pristina and the international community.
But can they change the reality on the ground?

Serbia's parliament met late into the evening Saturday (July 30th) and finally adopted a draft resolution on the crisis at Kosovo's northern border.
The document condemned Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci's government, saying its actions were a threat to "peace, stability and the possibility of finding a compromise solution".
Lawmakers demanded that the international community move to stop such moves by Pristina.
They called for a peaceful resolution of the crisis and dialogue aimed at reaching a permanent solution.
Tensions erupted on July 25th after Thaci's government sent police to take over northern crossing points in a bid to enforce an embargo on Serbian imports.
Following resistance by local Serbs -- and the death of a Kosovo policeman in an apparent sniper attack -- KFOR moved to intervene.
Civilian traffic resumed on Sunday at the Brnjak and Jarinje border checkpoints under KFOR supervision, but the situation remains tense and local Serbs continue to man roadblocks in some areas, local media reported.
Although Belgrade is staunchly opposed to attempts by Pristina to impose its authority, some political commentators say the Serbian government has relatively few concrete options.
The reality on the ground poses constraints, argues Zarko Markovic.
"We are much closer to the Kosovo government's establishing its state apparatus at border crossings than to returning to the previous state of affairs when there was UNMIK," he told SETimes.
Serbian authorities are seeking a solution that will not depict them as losers in the parliamentary elections next year, he added.
According to analyst Dusan Janjic, Belgrade has taken the wrong tack by shifting responsibilities to the international community and blaming KFOR and NATO.
Doing so "can bring Serbia into new conflicts with these organisations, which should be our partners in solving the crisis", he told SETimes.
"The content of the [parliamentary] declaration is dangerous," he said.
Serbian President Boris Tadic has accused some in the international community of using the enlargement process in order to pressure Serbia over the Kosovo issue.
"There is no better solution than dialogue, but Serbia will not agree to any change in the north of Kosovo and Metohija, nor to any blackmail related to European integration," Tadic said in an interview with the B92 media network.
If recognising Kosovo's independence is ever set as a condition for accession, Tadic said, Serbia will say no.
Among the Serb public, opinions are divided as to what should be done.
"I do not understand why our government ruined our democratic, European future because of Kosovo, where for over ten years Serbia does not govern, and where it is clear that the Kosovo Albanians do not want to live in Serbia," Belgrade resident Isidora Kravljanac, 38, told SETimes.
The EU says it is sending a mediator, Robert Cooper, to help settle the border crisis.
Meanwhile, two representatives of the Serbian government, Borko Stefanovic and Goran Bogranovic, have arrived in northern Kosovo to meet with the Serb community.
Media reports said they crossed into Kosovo via uncontrolled areas in the hills and forests after being refused entry at the Jarinje checkpoint.
Ashdown: Resignations Will Not Change BiH's Tasks
A better future for Bosnia and Herzegovina depends on co-operating with the UN war crimes tribunal and meeting EU conditions, High Representative Paddy Ashdown said Sunday.
Last week, Ashdown announced a series of measures meant to overcome obstacles.

Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) must co-operate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and meet EU conditions if it wants to move ahead on the road to a better future, High Representative Paddy Ashdown said Sunday (19 December).
"There is one task for BiH, which is not changed by resignations, and it would be only further delayed by elections, and that's to co-operate with the ICTY and to continue with the EU reforms," Ashdown said Sunday. "The longer we fail to do that, the future is more distant from us," he added.
Last Thursday, one week after BiH's application for membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme was rejected for the second time this year due to a failure to co-operate with the UN tribunal, Ashdown announced a series of measures designed to address problems with law enforcement and security.
The steps were prompted also by recent revelations that the army of BiH's Serb-run entity, Republika Srpska (RS), is continuing to protect one of the tribunal's most-wanted indictees, Ratko Mladic, who reportedly celebrated a holiday at an army installation in eastern BiH over the summer.
The measures, which included the dismissal of nine Bosnian Serb police and intelligence officials and freezing the bank accounts of individuals suspected of collusion with war criminals, were followed by the resignations of RS Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic and BiH Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic.
Several other Bosnian Serb officials from Ivanic's Party of Democratic Progress (PDP) have also tendered their resignations, or are expected to do so by Tuesday.
Borislav Paravac, the current head of BiH's tripartite presidency, has said he would step down if the Serb Democratic Party (SDS) asked him to do so.
Sulejman Tihic, the Bosnian Muslim representative of the BiH presidency, said he hoped RS politicians would not take actions that could jeopardise the functioning of authorities at the state level.
He described Ashdown's measures as being "in the interests of RS and BiH citizens" alike.
"It is very important that the nature of my original measures is understood, and it is important that the nature of these resignations is also understood," Ashdown said Sunday. "The measures I announced last week are not designed to punish the citizens of the RS.
Far from it. These measures have a clear and logical purpose -- to provide space, time and means for the RS to get into line with Dayton so that BiH can move forward."
Washington has also responded to the Bosnian Serb entity's lack of co-operation.
At a joint press conference with Ashdown on Thursday, US Ambassador Douglas McElhaney said his country had decided to freeze the assets of the SDS and prohibit US citizens from financial transactions with the party.
In addition, travel restrictions were being imposed on the leaderships of both the SDS and the PDP, McElhaney said.
Macedonian Parliament Approves New Government
EU and NATO membership, implementation of the Ohrid Agreement, and economic improvement are among the priorities of Macedonian Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski's new cabinet, which parliament approved Friday.

Macedonia's Parliament approved Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski's new government on Friday (17 December) after a three-day debate.
MPs from the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia, the Democratic Union of Integration and the Liberal Democrats voted in favour, while those from the VMRO-DPMNE, the Liberal Party and the Democratic Party of Albanians voted "no".
The cabinet is the third to take office since the For Macedonia Together Coalition won the 2002 parliamentary elections.
"After a long but not futile debate, the parliament approved the new government which is now facing major challenges," said Buckovski after the voting in a statement for Southeast European Times. "I am convinced that we will fulfil what I emphasised in my address.
Macedonia will carry through the reforms and receive an invitation for NATO membership and will become a candidate for EU membership.
I hope that, afterwards, Macedonia will be a prosperous, stable and safe country."
In his address to lawmakers, Buckovski pointed to completing the implementation of the Ohrid Agreement as one of the new government's priorities, noting that two major items of legislation -- the laws on use of minority languages and symbols -- are still awaiting passage.
Another priority, he said, would be improving the economy. "We will propose measures for improvement of competitiveness and strategies for development of export-oriented sectors in the industrial areas.
This should affect … the living standards of all," Buckovski said.
The cabinet has 19 members.
A newly established fourth deputy prime ministerial office has been given to businessman Minco Jordanov.
He has been tasked with co-ordinating economic policy.
Ilinka Mitreva will remain as foreign minister, Radmila Sekerinska is still deputy prime minister for European integration; Nikola Popovski remains at the helm of the finance ministry, and Blagoja Stefanovski is keeping her post as culture minister
Musa Xhaferi is the deputy prime minister charged with implementation of the Ohrid Agreement.
Azis Polozani remains minister of education and science, while Vlado Popovski will again serve as minister without portfolio.

EU on Track for Further Expansion
The prospect of future EU membership became clearer for four countries last week.
At a two-day summit in Brussels, EU leaders gave the green light for the signing of entry treaties with Bulgaria and Romania and for the launch of membership talks with Croatia and Turkey.

Taking a major step towards further EU expansion, European leaders have given the green light for the signing of entry treaties with Bulgaria and Romania and for the launch of membership talks with Croatia and Turkey in 2005.
"We have reached important conclusions for the future of Europe," European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso said Friday (17 December) at the end of a two-day EU summit in Brussels.
The summit was largely dominated by negotiations between the current Dutch EU presidency and Turkish officials over Cyprus.
Originally, Ankara was offered a deal that would have required it to sign a protocol expanding a customs union agreement to include Cyprus and the other nine new EU members -- a move that would, in effect, constitute recognition of Cyprus.
However, the two sides struck a last-minute compromise, under which Turkey will issue a declaration stating its commitment to signing the protocol prior to the start of accession talks and after "finalising the adaptations which are necessary in view of the current membership of the EU".
EU leaders, in their concluding statement, voiced confidence that Turkey would sustain the reform process and ensure respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights. The negotiations process, expected to last up to 15 years, will include safeguards allowing the EU to suspend talks if Turkey falters in its commitments.
Addressing thousands of cheering supporters in Ankara on Saturday, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the deal reached in Brussels paved the way for stronger democracy in the country and better economic performance.
"We did not obtain all that we wanted, 100 per cent, but we can say that it was a success," he said. "We have reached a point where Turkey is rewarded for 41 years of efforts."
In another significant step towards the Union's further expansion, European leaders set 17 March 2005 for the launch of Croatia's accession talks, making it conditional on the country's full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
Urging Zagreb to take the necessary steps towards that end, the EU stressed that fugitive Croatian General Ante Gotovina, one of the tribunal's most wanted indictees, "must be located and transferred to The Hague as soon as possible".
Croatia's earlier stated goal was to join the EU in 2007, along with Bulgaria and Romania.
However, experts believe 2009 is a more likely date.
Bulgaria and Romania are on track to join the EU in January 2007, the 25-nation Union leaders said Friday, setting April 2005 as the date for the signing of their accession treaties.
Both countries have also agreed to safeguard clauses allowing membership to be put off if they fail to implement reforms.
Protection of Equality head takes aim at discrimination in Serbia
The longtime activist against domestic violence acknowledges the playing field is far from equal, especially for women and minorities.

In office for nearly a year now, Serbia's Commissioner for the Protection of Equality Nevena Petrusic has been deluged with issues.
In an exclusive interview with SETimes correspondent Igor Jovanovic, Petrusic, former dean of the Nis Law School, says forms of discrimination are deeply rooted in the community and that changing ways of thinking won't be easy.
SETimes: Although women account for 51% of the population, they are paid less than men for the same jobs and participate far less in executive and legislative power.
What is your view of the position of women in Serbian society?
Nevena Petrusic: Despite the fact that women and men in Serbia have equal rights, women are exposed to structural, indirect and even direct discrimination and marginalisation -- the key causes of which are traditional, patriarchal stereotypes regarding the roles and obligations of women and men in the family and the wider community.
Research shows that women are in a more unfavourable position than men in all areas of social life, particularly members ... of ethnic minorities and minority groups, Roma women, disabled, displaced and refugee women, the poor and women from rural regions, single mothers, women of different sexual orientation and others.
On average, Petrusic says women make 16% less than their male counterparts. [Reuters]
Women are still not equally involved in the public decision-making process, as proven by the data that just 21.2% of Serbian MPs are women, 21.3% are members of local self-government assemblies and the percentage of female members of the state is 18.5%.
Of municipal heads, just 4% are women.
Discrimination against women is also evident in the economic sphere.
The rate of unemployment among women is twofold higher than it is for men.
The difference in salaries between men and women is 16%.
Women account for 30.5% of management posts in society and the economy, 20.8% of them at directorial posts.
The level of economic inequality, which is a consequence of multiple discrimination, is especially high.
When it comes to education, women are again in a poorer position.
Truth be told, the inequality of men and women is nearly completely eliminated in the majority population at the lower level, but it still exists in certain minority groups, particularly among Roma children, those living in rural areas and children with developmental disabilities.
At higher levels of education, there is a visible trend of growing involvement of young women, hence the percentage of female students exceeds that of their male colleagues, but this advantage is lost in postgraduate.
Domestic and sexual violence, the trafficking of women and other forms of gender-based violence are widespread occurrences.
That is primarily underlined by research conducted by NGOs, given that certain forms of gender-based violence are not registered at state level.
Women from marginalised and groups that are manifold discriminated against are particularly exposed to violence.
Existing mechanisms of legal protection from gender-based violence are not effective in practice, there are no protocols on police action, nor is there co-operation and multisector connection between the institutions authorised for handling the matter.
Roma women "make up the most endangered category of the population", Petrusic tells SETimes. [Reuters]
During court cases for protection from violence, women are exposed to secondary victimisation and do not receive appropriate psycho-social aid and support.
Roma women are discriminated against in exercising their right to protection from gender-based violence, especially regarding their placement in safe houses and shelters.
SETimes: Are there any outreach programmes designed specifically to help Romany women participate in mainstream society?
Petrusic: The fact that the average lifespan of Roma women is 48 years is truly depressing.
The position of Roma women in Serbia will not improve without adequate measures of affirmative action.
Apart from measures focused on improving the position of the entire Roma population, special measures should be designed for Roma women, as they are doubly discriminated against as both members of the stigmatised Roma community and as women.
Measures for giving Roma women greater access to education and employment are especially important, since those rights are now highly limited precisely due to racial and gender prejudice.
SETimes: How many complaints has your service received since it opened?
What sort of discrimination do citizens complain about the most?
Petrusic: We live in Serbia where discrimination is a widespread occurrence in both the public and private spheres and where cases of public outbursts of racism, misogyny, xenophobia, homophobia, hate speech and other forms of discrimination are frequent and are still tolerated and justified.
That is why we are facing hard work in the battle against discrimination if we really want to develop a democratic, open and tolerant society that respects human rights and acknowledges differences.
The making of anti-discrimination legislation is just the first step, which must be followed by anti-discrimination practice.
The Commissioner for the Protection of Equality has so far received over 200 complaints, most of them submitted by both male and female individuals, and about 20 by NGOs.
People predominantly complain about discrimination in the field of labour and employment, with ethnicity, membership or non-membership in political parties and unions most frequently listed as the basis for discrimination.
There were also six cases of hate speech against members of sexual minorities.
Apparently our citizens are not yet familiar with the essence of discrimination, and consider it to be any violation of rights, any situation that is unfavourable for them and where they believe they are being denied certain rights.
That is why we have a lot of work to do in educating people, so that they can understand what discrimination is, identify it and seek protection from it.
SETimes: Are you satisfied with the authority you have in determining sanctions for those who violate laws?
Petrusic: Serbia has a good legislative framework for protection from discrimination, and today provides efficient protective mechanisms, both in the fields of civic and criminal and misdemeanor laws.
When it comes to the jurisdiction of the Commissioner for the Protection of Equality, it seems to me that the jurisdiction is fairly broadly established, so as to enable a successful fight against all forms of discrimination.
A portion of that jurisdiction relates to acting on complaints in concrete discrimination cases.
The law regulates the manner of the Commissioner's acting on complaints and appoints the Commissioner, with consent from the person being discriminated against, to launch a court case and seek legal protection from discrimination, as well as to file a criminal report.
I would especially highlight the Commissioner's authority to recommend mediation in discrimination cases.
Mediation allows for discriminators to take responsibility for what they have done, to understand the consequences their behaviour has had on the victim, thus raising awareness of the unacceptability of discrimination.
As someone who has been engaged in mediation for a long time, I believe it is the best method for preventing discrimination.
EU approves aid for Turkish Cypriots
EU foreign ministers have approved a 139m-euro aid package for northern Cyprus.
The deal became possible after it was decoupled from provisions that would allow direct trade between the Turkish Cypriots and EU member states.
(FT, EUobserver, Financial Mirror - 27/02/06; AP, AFP, Zaman, Cyprus Mail - 26/02/06; Cyprus News Agency - 25/02/06; Reuters - 24/02/06)
“The genuine step Turkey expects is direct trade together with financial aid.
This unilateral decision by the EU will bring new problems and difficulties,” said Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul. [AFP]
EU foreign ministers approved a decision Monday (27 February) clearing the way for the release of 139m euros in financial aid to the Turkish Cypriot community.
The aid will underpin projects to improve infrastructure and the economy in the island's north.
The deal -- stalled for 18 months due to Greek Cypriot opposition to provisions for trade between northern Cyprus and EU members -- became possible Friday, when the EU Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) agreed to Nicosia's demand that the funding be decoupled from the trade issue.
"The aim of COREPER is to enhance co-operation between the two communities of the island and create a better climate, so as to increase the chance of resumption of talks for a settlement on the Cyprus problem," Greek Cypriot government spokesman George Lillikas said on Saturday.
Monday's approval comes ahead of a meeting Tuesday between Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in Paris.
A Greek Cypriot official said the move was intended to facilitate the revival of peace talks.
However, Ankara has voiced criticism, charging Brussels with acting unilaterally.
Turkey wants the financial aid to be part of a wider package, including also the initially envisioned agreement on direct trade between the Turkish Cypriots and the 25 EU member nations.
"The genuine step Turkey expects is direct trade together with financial aid," the Financial Times quoted Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul as saying. "This unilateral decision by the EU will bring new problems and difficulties."
Meanwhile, Turkish Cypriot authorities have voiced reservations about a cover note to the text approved by COREPER on Friday, making reference to additional Greek Cypriot conditions in order for their community to be allowed to trade with EU member states.
Ahead of the April 2004 referendum in Cyprus on a UN-sponsored plan to end the island's division, the EU promised measures to help relieve the plight of the much poorer Turkish Cypriot community, whose self-proclaimed state is recognised only by Turkey.
In the referendum, the Greek Cypriots overwhelmingly rejected the UN peace plan, while the majority of the Turkish Cypriots approved it. On 1 May 2004, only the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot part of Cyprus joined the EU, representing the entire island.
The proposal that was eventually approved by the EU envisioned the release of an aid package worth 259m euros and mechanisms to allow the Turkish Cypriots to start direct trade with EU member nations.
However, the expiry date for some of the funding has passed and the Turkish Cypriots are receiving 120m euros less than the originally planned.
Interethnic relations in BiH hampered by dispute over religious buildings
An ongoing argument over a church built on the site of a mosque destroyed in the BiH conflict has come to symbolise the difficulties of reconciliation in the eastern part of the country.
By Vlatko Vukotic for Southeast European Times in Banja Luka – 27/02/06

In the eastern Bosnian town of Divic, near Zvornik, an Orthodox church stands on land formerly occupied by a mosque.
The issue, which local government has been attempting to resolve for years, has hampered interethnic relations and could be said to symbolise the difficulties of reconciliation in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
Muslims who returned to Divic after the BiH conflict are demanding that the church be moved and the mosque rebuilt at its original site, while local authorities would prefer to find another location and leave the church where it is.
The local government has paid the Islamic community 30,000 euros in compensation for the mosque's destruction, and the human rights commission in BiH, as an ultimate judicial authority, has ordered the municipality of Zvornik to provide a building site for a new mosque.
Zvornik superintendent Dragan Jeftic says that two sites have already been proposed, but the Islamic community rejected them both.
The situation has sparked protests by Muslims, causing services at the church to be disrupted.
Behara Efendic, one of the demonstrators, says she does not mind the church, but adds that it would be much better to give the Muslims back their mosque.
Serbian refugees from other parts of BiH came to Divic during the conflict.
The town was renamed Saint Stefan -- after one of the most respected Serbian saints.
However, only one Serb now lives in the town.
Risto Djuretic is retired and admits he does not get along well with his neighbours.
Police had to intervene when he was verbally attacked and firecrackers were thrown at his house.
The tensions over the mosque issue are being fuelled, in part, by the dire economic situation in the area.
Only a few members of the 185 families in Divic have permanent jobs, though most have high school diplomas.
Residents say they get by on humanitarian aid and small pensions.
Serbia facing sale of electrical power stations
With no money available to achieve environmental standards or build new mines and plants, restructuring of Serbia's electrical energy sector is an eventual necessity.
However, any moves towards privatisation of the state electrical power company will likely spark opposition.
By Georgi Mitev-Shantek for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 27/02/06
EPS needs to invest 1 billion euros to achieve the minimum European environmental standards. [EPS]
The Serbian government hardly lacks challenges.
After being pressured by the IMF last fall into issuing a tender for the privatisation adviser for the Oil Industry of Serbia (NIS), the government created a stir by announcing the selection of a "strategic adviser" for the Electrical Power Industry of Serbia (EPS).
The move was clearly taken with a view to eventually privatising the company and selling the refineries.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus, the adviser will be required to provide "a concept for the development of the company through restructuring and investments, and to indicate the best privatisation model".
A $50m credit from the World Bank for restructuring the economy depends on opening this tender, while the future of EPS -- and the price the public will be paying for electricity -- depends on the outcome.
The price of electricity could potentially increase two-and-a-half times, but due to subsidies, would remain among the lowest priced in the region.
It is clear that something must be done with EPS.
The company needs to invest 1 billion euros to achieve minimum European environmental standards, but there is no money available for this.
Serbia today mostly manages to meet its electrical energy needs, but in five years it will require at least one more thermal-electrical power plant and one more coalmine -- at a cost of 750m euros to 1 billion euros.
Because of the government's electric price control policy, EPS does not have the option of raising prices to cover the costs.
Indeed, electricity prices in Serbia are still kept at a "socialist" level, rather than being determined by the market.
EPS pays at least 80m euros annually to import electrical energy, after which it sells the same electrical energy on the domestic market at one third of the market price.
The World Bank supports efforts to restructure the energy market, but says caution is necessary.
According to one of its senior economists, David Kennedy, the Bank does not want privatisation of EPS to take place immediately -- rather, any privatisation scheme should be carefully prepared.
The government's first steps in this direction have caused an uproar among employee unions and EPS management.
They charge that the company -- which employs about 40,000 and is worth several billion euros -- is about to be divided up and auctioned off.
The best hydro-electrical power plants and thermal-energy plants will quickly find buyers, as well as the electrical distribution companies with efficient payment collection services.
Experts, meanwhile, are concerned that the system's efficiency could be affected, and some argue that only vertically integrated systems can guarantee a reliable electrical power supply.
This has been an issue elsewhere in Eastern Europe, where Czechs, Hungarians and Poles are attempting once again to integrate their system vertically.
It is no different in Bulgaria, where the Czech company CEZ, an owner of power distribution companies and a potential buyer of power generating stations, is conducting the vertical integration.
Turkey, Britain to Strengthen Co-operation in Fighting Terrorism
Turkey and Britain will strengthen their co-operation in the fight against terrorism, the countries' top diplomats pledged following a memorial service for the victims of the November 2003 bombing attacks in Istanbul.
British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw also expressed his country's support for Turkey's EU bid.

British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and his Turkish counterpart, Abdullah Gul, said Wednesday (3 March) that their countries would step up co-operation in the fight against terrorism.
The two top diplomats were among about 200 people attending a memorial service at the British consulate in Istanbul for the victims of the 20 November bombing attacks in the city.
The suicide attacks on the British consulate and the offices of the London-based HSBC bank came five days after similar attacks on two synagogues in the city.
Sixty-three people were killed, including British consul Roger Short. Hundreds were wounded.
Police in the two countries have worked together during the investigation into the bombings.
"We will be strengthening our bilateral co-operation," Straw said at a joint press conference with Gul after the memorial service, adding that the fight against terrorism is "an international fight and one which affects every one of us in the civilised world".
His comments came a day after a series of deadly attacks on Shiite gatherings in Iraq and Pakistan claimed hundreds of lives.
Among those present at the service Wednesday were Istanbul Governor Muammer Guler and Short's widow, Victoria.
British and other foreign diplomats in Turkey, Turkish chief Rabbi Ishak Haleva, Greek Orthodox Patriarch Bartholomew and Turkish Armenian Patriarch Mesrob II also attended, as did relatives of the victims.
During his visit, Straw also expressed Britain's support for Turkey's EU bid, noting that it "is in the EU's interest" to admit Ankara to the expanding bloc.
An official EU candidate since 1999, Turkey is the only country in the group that has not yet opened accession talks with the Union.
Praising Turkey for its progress in achieving the economic and political criteria for membership, Straw said Britain was looking forward "to a positive decision from the European Council to set a clear time scale for negotiations in December this year".
Meanwhile, responding to a question by media representatives of the EU Communication Group about Turkey's reaction in the event of a negative decision in December, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country would be disappointed but would move on.
"The EU can't justify such a decision and will have difficulty in explaining it to the world," Erdogan said Wednesday. "We will also have difficulty in explaining it to our people.
There will be a big disappointment, but certainly this will not be the end of the world.
We will turn the Copenhagen [political] criteria into Ankara criteria and continue on our way."
The Council of Europe also commended Ankara Wednesday.
"Turkish authorities have not deviated from their efforts to implement the reforms necessary for the country's modernisation," the Monitoring Committee of the organisation's Parliamentary Assembly said.
"Turkey has achieved more reforms in a little over two years than in the previous ten," it added, citing in particular moves to abolish the death penalty and to show "zero tolerance" towards torture.

Freedom House: "mixed picture" in Balkans
Kosovo, Macedonia and Serbia have experienced modest improvement in their democratic development, a watchdog group says in its latest report.
(SeeNews, Blitz.bg - 01/07/10; Mediafax, B92 - 30/06/10; Freedom House, RFE/RL - 29/06/10)

Unlike most of the non-Baltic former Soviet states, those in the Balkans have made some progress in democratic development over the past decade, Freedom House concluded in a new study released on June 29th.
"In terms of population, nearly 80% of residents of the former Soviet Union -- 221 million people -- still live in entrenched authoritarian settings, where they are deprived of basic political rights," the US-based watchdog noted in its annual Nations in Transit report.
It cited Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Macedonia as some of the Balkan countries that "have made steady gains in civil society, electoral process" and other areas in the past decade.
The study assesses the state of democratic governance in 2009 for 29 countries from Central Europe to Eurasia on the basis of developments in seven different categories.
These include electoral process, civil society, independent media, national and local governance, judicial independence and corruption.
The countries are divided into three groups: new EU members, including Bulgaria and Romania; non-Baltic former Soviet states; and the Balkans, comprised of Albania, BiH, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia.
Each of the countries is given an overall democracy score, based on a scale from 1 to 7, with 1 signifying the highest level of democratic development, and 7 the lowest.
That score represents the average of the marks each nation has received in the individual categories.
Only five countries -- Belarus, Kosovo, Lithuania, Macedonia and Serbia -- slightly improved their overall democracy scores in 2009, while those of another 14, including Albania, BiH and Romania, were lower than in the previous edition of the Nations in Transit report.
"Countries throughout the former Soviet Union and Central and Eastern Europe suffered declines in their democratic institutions," Freedom House said in a statement.
Only eight of the surveyed countries -- all EU members -- received total scores lower than the 2.99 maximum to be considered "consolidated democracies".
Bulgaria, whose rating remained unchanged at 3.04, and Romania, rated at 3.46 in this year's report, down from 3.36 in the previous one, continue to "confront deep corruption and other institutional challenges, and are therefore classified as semi-consolidated democracies," Freedom House said.
Croatia and Serbia, rated at 3.71 each, Macedonia and Montenegro, both scoring 3.79 this year, as well as Albania, with 3.93, also belonged to that group.
BiH saw its overall democracy rating significantly improve, from 5.17 in 2001 to 4.04 in 2007.
The deterioration in the political climate in recent years has led to a new minor decline in its score, 4.25 in the new report.
Based on this, BiH has been classified as a "transitional government or hybrid regime", along with Ukraine and Georgia, both rated at between 4.00 and 4.99.
Kosovo experienced modest improvement in 2009, Freedom House said in the report, giving the country an overall democracy score of 5.07, which places it in the group of the "semi-consolidated authoritarian regimes" with scores from 5.00 to 5.99, together with Moldova and Armenia.
"If the EU remains without a clear strategy towards each country in the region, especially Serbia, BiH might easily end up on the road to slow dissolution, isolation, and further economic disarray, with a latent potential for the repetition of violence," the watchdog group warned.
Betting on the World Cup
In Belgrade, even those who have never gambled before have flocked to try their luck.

As the World Cup draws to a close, fans will be returning to regular life.
For weeks now, the international contest has kept many glued to their TV sets for significant portions of the day.
In Belgrade, as in many other parts of the region, it has also filled up betting venues.
"Everyone is betting: men and women, young and old; there is a complete euphoria since the start of the World Cup," a betting venue employee, who identified herself as Ivana, told SETimes.
Visits were most frequent prior to the Serbian team's matches, she explained.
"One customer told me he took a loan to bet Serbia will win against Ghana.
He took 500 euros from the bank and lost, and his wife doesn't know about it," she said.
Some were less patriotically inclined and bet Serbia would lose to Germany last month, only to be surprised by the outcome.
"There are no favourites in this World Cup, as there have been major surprises," Ivana noted.
Milena, a young woman at the venue, said she is placing bets for a friend.
"He is working and can't come to place a bet on time.
He lost 30,000 euros once but still hasn't had enough," she said.
Carefully looking at the lists and betting tickets, another visitor, Rade, confides that he places bets daily and earns about 10 to 20 euros per day on average.
"I used to bet on a daily basis even before the World Cup and now I simply can't miss a single game," he told SETimes.
Other customers, like Dragan, say the World Cup atmosphere encouraged them to give betting a try.
"I have never bet before, but all my buddies are doing it," he said. "I will make a small bet, and if I win -- great, if not -- nevermind."
Another better, Zoran, says he avoided putting money on the Serb games.
"We get impossible opponents and lose to the ones we are sure we can beat," he said.
"I was sure we would beat Australia and qualify for the second round," adds another customer, Petar. "Thank God I didn't bet a lot of money.
I am sadder at Serbia's defeat than losing money," he said.
Serbia was eliminated in the World Cup's first round, but Ivana says the interest in betting has not waned.
"Despite the disappointment, our regular customers came back the next day," she said.
Many will likely be there on Sunday when Spain takes on The Netherlands in the final, and on Saturday when Germany and Uruguay vie for third place.
Science and Technology: Anglo-Greek team decodes ancient computer
The Antikythera Mechanism has intrigued and puzzled scientists for more than a century, but a team of English and Greek scientists says they now understand its purpose.
Also this week: BiH inaugurates an e-government programme, and Bulgaria wraps up a pilot project for training unemployed women in IT.

A team of English and Greek scientists says they have discovered the workings of a 2,000 year-old computing device.
They say the Antikythera Mechanism, dating from the 1st century BC, was probably used to calculate the astronomical cycles of celestial bodies.
The device features an intricate array of cogs and gears that could be manipulated via a simple user interface.
According to the team, it was "technically more complex than any known device for at least a millennium afterwards". The Antikythera Mechanism also was the focus of a conference held in Athens last week.
Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) e-government project was presented officially in Sarajevo on November 29th. The 1.6m-euro project will be implemented jointly by the BiH Council of Ministers (CoM), the European Commission Delegation and the UNDP office in BiH.
The project provides for an integrated CoM network, a single CoM web portal, integrated security and e-mail systems, systems for information management and archive, and videoconference centres in Banja Luka, Mostar and Sarajevo.
Eighty unemployed women from Bulgarian towns completed web design training under a pilot project conducted by the Labour and Social Policy Ministry. The project, which wrapped up on November 27th, was aimed at boosting opportunities for women to use the internet for work-from-home opportunities in advertising or other fields.
The 10th Yunginfo scientific forum took place from November 27th to December 1st in Zlatibor, Serbia.
Some 160 Serbian and foreign experts participated in the event, which focused on the application and use of Information and Communications Technology in the oil and petrochemical industries.
The event was organised by the Yunginfo section of the Serbian Oil and Gas Association.
The World Conservation Union Programme Office for Southeast Europe presented its new project on the development of a network of eco-villages in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia, during a workshop held in Zabljak, Montenegro.
The two-year project, funded by the Austrian Development Agency, aims to protect biodiversity while enabling sustained development in the target regions.
More than 200 experts took part in an international conference on communication technologies and IT legislation, held in Opatija, Croatia.
The focus was on LAN, WAN, WLAN networks, as well as broadband infrastructure, cable internet and high speed communications.
Workshops on the integration of fixed and mobile telephony and on the introduction of broadband internet in Croatia were also held.

For a second year in a row, Romania shined at the Geneva International Invention Fair, with representatives winning gold medals in three different fields -- auto, medical and baby clothing.
The fair, in late April, was held at the Palexpo facilities in Geneva.
It drew 780 inventors from 45 countries.
Romania presented 1,000 inventions.
Raluca Ioana van Staden took the award for best female inventor for a sensor that detects cancer at the molecular level.
Romanian TV star Andreea Marin-Banica won gold for an extendable baby bodysuit.
Student Corneliu Birtok-Baneasa won for an invention that reduces auto fuel consumption.
"My invention is called air transfer dynamic device.
In brief, it improves the air flow to the air filters of the car, which generates an up to 20% fuel consumption decrease, especially during the warm season," Birtok-Baneasa, a senior at the auto section of the Engineering Faculty in Hunedoara, central Romania, told SETimes.
"I created the first filter in 2000 for my own car, and then started to test them on my friends' cars. In 2008, I came up with the air transfer dynamic device, which I tested on my girlfriend's car."
Birtok-Baneasa received support for his research from the Engineering Faculty and from a specialised institute in Bucharest after participating in the 2007 national invention fair.
"I intend to start my own business and hopefully, as of the second half of the year, to have my own production line. I estimate a selling price around 13 euros."
Van Staden recently returned to Romania after ten years of researching abroad.
"My invention consists of a new type of sensor which can be used to detect cancer in less than six minutes, directly from a blood sample," she told the public radio station.
"[The test can detect] cancer in the breast, ovaries, gastro-intestinal and prostate," she added, noting that early detection can lead to better outcomes.
The sensor she created is made up of a diamond paste, and measures less than 1mm.
Marin-Banica attracted interest with her extendable baby bodysuit, branded "Violet" after her daughter.
"I am a mere 'occasional inventor'.
My idea [was] simple and very useful to children in their first year of life, being inspired by my daughter's needs when she was a couple of months old," Marin-Banica wrote on her blog.
MB Telecom President Mircea Tudor -- the 2009 Geneva Inventions Exhibition grand prix winner for a device that scans trucks -- was a member of the jury.
Is Serbia ready for talks with Kosovo?
Though Belgrade still wants to revisit the question of status, many Kosovo Serbs say the focus should be on improved living conditions.

More than two years after Kosovo proclaimed its independence, Serbia's leaders have been suggesting a return to the negotiating table may be in the works.
Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic is confident that an anticipated International Court of Justice ruling will find the independence declaration contravened international law.
If so, officials say, the door would be open for new status talks and a compromise that is acceptable to Belgrade.
"One side will have to let go, and, of course, it will be Kosovo," insists Serbian State Secretary for Kosovo Oliver Ivanovic.
Many Kosovo Serbs, however, are sceptical.
According to representative Rada Trajkovic, Belgrade lacks the clout to achieve a solution to its liking.
"Serbia is weak politically and in terms of security, is economically dependent on donors and has no clearly defined strategy for Kosovo and Metohija," Trajkovic told SETimes. "Even if with all these weaknesses it was able to start negotiations on the status, they would not result in success."
Technical talks on issues affecting the lives of Kosovo Serbs are a more realistic possibility, she said.
Such talks, "if well prepared, could strengthen the position of the Serbs and the Serbian Orthodox Church in Kosovo", she said.
Trajkovic also urged Serbia to exercise caution in any negotiations.
Albanian extremist groups have begun regrouping in Macedonia, she said, and any ill-advised move by Belgrade could lead to new conflicts.
From another angle, hardline nationalists oppose Belgrade-Pristina negotiations, even those limited to improving the conditions for Serbs in Kosovo, on the grounds that it implies recognition of independence.
"The story of technical negotiations is a lure for Serbia," Vice President of the Council for Kosovo and Metohija Marko Jaksic told SETimes. "It would not improve our life here, because we live badly just because we are opposing the independence of Kosovo."
Kosovo Serb refugees, meanwhile, wait to see concrete improvements in their situation.
Many feel that, for all the talk of negotiations, Belgrade is doing little to help them.
Since leaving their villages of Ljipljan and Strpci in 1999, the Jelisavcic and Djurdjevic families have shared in a two-room apartment in the Belgrade suburb of Kaludjerica.
Both families support themselves through manual labour.
"My son Bojan wears two different shoes, on the left leg one model and number, on the right leg a second model and number.
One is number 38, another 40.
He found them in a container in New Belgrade," Stojan Jelisavljevic said.
"We haven't been able to buy clothes for the children in ten years," he added.
Social Affairs Minister Rasim Ljajic is openly critical of the country's Kosovo policy.
"Serbia allocates 500m euros a year for Kosovo, but I'm not sure that the money is the best spent," he said.
If talks do resume, analysts say, Serbia will likely seek different arrangements for northern Kosovo and territories around Serbian monasteries, allowing for special, parallel relations with Belgrade.
"Northern Ireland is a good example, as well as any solutions that are offered in [former UN envoy Martti] Ahtisaari's plan," said Predrag Simic, former Serbian ambassador to Paris and professor of international law.
Acknowledging that Serbia has formally rejected the Ahtisaari plan, Simic notes that UN Resolution 1244 and the Kumanovo Agreement were also deemed out of the question at one point, only to be accepted later.
As for status, changing any aspect of Kosovo's independence is unlikely, political analyst Dusan Janjic told SETimes.
"Belgrade would be wise to open talks with Brussels on co-operation on the status of crisis management.
This would end the blackmailing of Serbia over Kosovo when it approaches the EU," he said.
New School Year Marked by Reforms, Resistance
Reforms in Bosnia and Herzegovina's recently passed education law are under way this school year, but it hasn't always gone smoothly.
By Beth Kampschror for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 24/09/03
Students in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) are studying the same curricula in math and sciences following the unanimous passage of a new education law last summer, but another education reform that was supposed to take hold this year has already been hindered by politics.
Under pressure from the OSCE, which last year became the umbrella organisation for education reform, all canton education ministers have ordered the end of Muslim-Croat segregation in the more than 20 so-called "two schools under one roof" in the federation, where the two groups have different recess times and even separate entrances to school buildings.
But when about 300 Croat children showed up with their parents on 1 September to enroll in the Muslim-majority school in the northern town of Novi Seher, they were met by local members of the nationalist Croat Democratic Union (HDZ), who told them to take their children to a Croat-majority school in a neighbouring municipality.
The situation reportedly became very ugly and heated.
"You can say, what is the fuss about?" said OSCE spokeswoman Urdur Gunnarsdottir.
"They have made it an issue, that it's life or death for Croats, but one of the things enshrined in education reform is cultural differences, and the people making the fuss have signed the core curriculum and the law on education."
The Novi Seher incident brings to mind politically motivated riots in Brcko three years ago over Serb students' refusal to share a school building with Muslims.
The Brcko trouble blew over, and many now agree that the Brcko education system, which teaches Croats, Muslims and Serbs, works.
Gunnarsdottir said that parents usually become reasonable when politics are out of the picture.
"There are very many people who have no problem with their kids going to school with other kids, as long as they learn about their cultural heritage and their own language," she said.
"Generally people are not for segregation -- segregation is an ugly word and it doesn't belong in 2003."
It's now up to the canton ministers to make sure they are honouring their agreements.
But OHR has already made it clear that it is serious about prodding officials into compliance, having fined the HDZ 20,452 euros on 25 August for not issuing the instructions to unify the two-in-one schools by the deadline.
It's hoped that these schools will follow the example of similar schools in Vares and Zepce municipalities that began unifying last year.
Another reform starting this year is the nine years of mandatory education, up from eight.
And the all-local textbook committee --12 members from both entities -- removed questionable maps and pictures from Bosnian textbooks, and dealt with wartime history by creating a factual timeline without interpretation.
"There's no problem with [this presentation of] history," said Canton 8 Education Minister Jozo Maric by telephone from Siroki Brijeg.
He did not say when the committee would meet next.
In the Republika Srpska, the 2003-04 school year marks the first time since the war that handfuls of Muslim returnee children are going to schools in Visegrad, Srebrenica municipality and Zvornik municipality.
Thousands Pay Last Respects to Former Bosnian Leader
An estimated 150,000 people gathered in Sarajevo for the funeral of former Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) President Alija Izetbegovic, who led Bosnia and Herzegovina to independence and played a key role in ending the war that followed.
(BBC, CNN, AFP - 22/10/03; AFP - 21/10/03; AP, Reuters - 20/10/03; RFE/RL - 19/10/03)
Thousands of mourners gathered in Sarajevo on Wednesday (22 October) to pay their last respects to former Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) President Alija Izetbegovic, who died Sunday at the age of 78.
Izetbegovic will be best remembered as the man who led the former Yugoslav republic to its independence and as one of the signers of the Dayton Peace Accords that ended the 1992-1995 war.
In the country's first postwar elections in 1996, he was chosen to represent the Muslim community in the first three-member multiethnic presidency and became its first chairman. Citing health problems, he resigned from his post and quit active politics in 2000.
"President Izetbegovic will be remembered for his historic role in preserving the unity of Bosnia and Herzegovina and establishing the Bosnian state," UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said in a statement of condolence.
"Izetbegovic was a very courageous leader for his people," EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said. "Under difficult circumstances in the Balkans, he played an important role in ending the war in his country."
Doctors at Sarajevo University's Clinical Centre said Izetbegovic's death was caused by a long period of heart problems, complicated by injuries he suffered recently during a fall at his home.
Police officials said they were expecting around 150,000 Bosnians and foreign officials, including Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, to attend the funeral in the BiH capital.
Special trains and dozens of buses have been arranged to bring mourners from BiH's Muslim-dominated areas to Sarajevo.
Police sources told the Agence France Presse they also expected about 50 buses with Muslims from Croatia and Slovenia.
Izetbegovic will be buried at the Kovaci Cemetery, alongside hundreds of Bosnian Muslim fighters killed during the 1992-1995 siege of Sarajevo by Serb forces.
In the morning, his body lay in state at the BiH presidency. The flag in front of the building was lowered to half-staff.
Organisers scheduled a formal prayer ceremony in downtown Sarajevo before the funeral procession headed for the cemetery along streets adorned with Bosnian state flags.
A day of mourning was being observed only in BiH's Muslim-Croat federation, however, and there was no official delegation representing the country's Serb-run entity, Republika Srpska.
But some Bosnian Serb officials were expected to attend the ceremony informally.
A lawyer by training and the founder of the Muslim Party for Democratic Action, Izetbegovic was elected president of the Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1990. He is the author of "Islam Between East and West", a book published in 1982 depicting the problems faced by Muslims living in a Slavic country.
Yugoslav authorities sentenced him to five years in prison for advocating "pan-Islamic activity".
Romania's Ruling Party Edges Past Opposition in Tight Race
Romania's ruling party appears to have won the presidential and parliamentary elections on Sunday, but by smaller margins than exit polls had suggested.

The first preliminary results from Sunday's (28 November) general election in Romania show Prime Minister Adrian Nastase and his Social Democrats (PSD) in the lead, but by a smaller margin than exit polls had indicated.
With about 36 per cent of the votes counted, Nastase leads his main rival in the race for president, Traian Basescu, by a margin of 38 per cent to 35 per cent.
Vadim Tudor, the candidate of the nationalist Greater Romania Party (PRM), has about 12 per cent, while Marko Bela of the Hungarian Democratic Alliance of Romania (UDMR) has nearly 7 per cent.
Voter turnout was 57 per cent.
Nastase and Basescu will now face each other in second round of voting, scheduled for 12 December.
In the parliamentary vote, the PSD-Humanist Party coalition is leading Basescu's Justice and Truth Alliance, composed of the National Liberal Party (PNL) and the Democratic Party (PD), by a razor-thin margin -- 34 per cent to 33 per cent.
The PRM has 13 per cent.
With about 8 per cent, the UDMR's share of the parliamentary vote is very close to the percentage of Hungarians in the overall population.
Other parties that were competing in the election failed to pass the 5 per cent threshold for gaining a parliamentary seat, and their presidential candidates received a combined total of 7 per cent of the vote.
This figure, however, could become important during the runoff.
PSD leaders rushed to declare victory.
"Romania proved once again it is a solid democracy and that everything PSD has done in the last years was worth it.
We won the elections and we will start the negotiations for the new cabinet," Nastase said after the exit poll results were announced.
Basescu, however, said that no party had obtained more than half of the parliamentary seats or the right to govern Romania alone.
"The battle …will take place in the second round of the presidential elections," he said, noting that it is the president who designates the prime minister and gives the mandate to form a government.
The opposition is also calling for an inquiry into allegations of electoral fraud.
Pro Democratia, an independent group that deployed 3,300 monitors around the country, said it had been "submerged with complaints" about voting irregularities, including the bussing of PSD supporters from one polling station to another, as well as the disappearance of hundreds of voting slips.
Pro Democratia and other NGOs had warned prior to the vote that irregularities could make a difference of up to 3 per cent -- enough to tip the balance in a tight race.
According to analysts, a number of cabinet scenarios are likely.
The ruling alliance could join with the UMDR, some members of the liberal opposition, or even with the nationalist PRM -- though most see this as a last resort.
"It is known that the EU and the United States are openly against this party, so I strongly believe both the PSD and DA Alliance will avoid it," said Cristian Tudor Popescu, editor-in-chief of the daily Adevarul.
Water forum reflects Turkey's central role in region
In water politics, regional co-operation, development and environmental concerns require balancing.
By Anna Wood for Southeast European Times in Istanbul – 06/05/11
Turkey has sought to harness the southeast's agricultural potential by developing a series of large irrigation projects. [Reuters]
The 2nd Istanbul International Water Forum was held from Tuesday (May 3rd) to Thursday, drawing participants from around the world to discuss pressing water problems.
The emphasis was on regional co-operation, with a particular focus on the Middle East.
"The things that unite us are far more numerous than the things that divide us," World Water Forum Secretary-General Oktay Tabasaran said, highlighting common regional interests.
"Our country is not one that is rich in water resources," Turkish Minister of Forests and the Environment Veysel Eroğlu said during the forum. "But nor is it poor." With proper regulation, he claimed, there is enough of the resource to satisfy domestic needs.
For Turkey, the crucial issue is management of the headwaters of the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers, along which a rapidly increasing number of dams and hydroelectric power plants are emerging.
Dams and irrigation projects have largely been constructed within the context of the Southeast Anatolia Project (GAP), which aims to harness the energy of Turkey's water resources and bolster the economy of southeast, one of the poorest regions in the country.
Advocates argue that GAP will provide more than a fix to energy and economic problems; successful development of the southeast will, they say, also alleviate tensions with Turkey's Kurds through socio-economic development and integration.
Critics of GAP say the more Turkey utilises these rivers, the less water there is to flow to the downstream riparian states of Syria and Iraq. The issue of downstream water flows has created an ebb and flow of political difficulties among the three states.
Chief of the League of Arab States' Centre for Water Studies and Arab Water Security Chakra Ksia, however, expressed optimism on the water flows between Turkey and Syria.
"That's why I'm here," Ksia said.
"We currently have very, very good relations.
Many protocols have been signed, and memorandums of understanding concerning co-operation regarding the Tigris have been produced."
Regarding a proposal to export dammed water from Turkey to Iraqi farmers in exchange for oil, UN Representative and NGO worker Imane Abd El Al was not optimistic.
"We're talking about Mesopotamia here." Importing water to the "cradle of civilisation", she argued, is absurd, as is the idea of treating water as a commodity rather than a right.
Gazikent University's Mehmet Karpuzcu countered that any benefits Turkey's dams provide for other countries should be paid for by those countries, and that while water may not be a commodity, infrastructure is.
Though politics dominated many of the discussions, water management was not presented as something limited to the political sphere alone.
President of the World Water Council Loic Fauchon underscored environmental and moral concerns, too. "Even as we must share water equitably between man and states, we mustn't forget another obligation: sharing water between man and nature."
Josipovic seeks US support for Croatia's EU bid
Head of state meets with Biden and Clinton; integration described as crucial for region.
By Natasa Radic for Southeast European Times in Zagreb -- 06/05/11
Croatian President Ivo Josipovic says "The US recognises the steps we have made and the reforms we have taken." [Reuters]
President Ivo Josipovic wrapped up a visit to the United States on Wednesday (May 4th) after a series of high-level meetings in Chicago and Washington.
Officials say they reaffirmed the excellent ties between the two countries and US support for Croatia's long anticipated EU entry.
In talks with Vice-President Joe Biden, the main topics were Southeast Europe and the progress Croatia has made in its EU bid, which Biden's office later described as "crucial for the entire region".
Biden "recognises the efforts made in Croatia in order to fully respect the rule of law and continue with the fight against corruption", the office said in a statement.
The trip coincided with the killing of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden by US forces.
News of bin Laden's death prompted Josipovic to reaffirm that Croatia -- which has just over 300 troops deployed in Afghanistan as part of the ISAF operation -- is ready and willing to continue to contribute to the global fight against terrorism.
"Croatian-US relations have shown steady progress since the very beginning and evolved into the full status of allies, with Croatia being a NATO member," Ivan Grdesic, a former Croatian ambassador to Washington and a professor at the Faculty of Political Science in Zagreb, told SETimes.
But not all areas of co-operation have been explored fully, Grdesic added. "What is needed in our bilateral relations is improved economic and trade relations," he said.
US Ambassador to Zagreb James Foley, who accompanied Josipovic during his tour, told HINA that the president had "long and fruitful meetings" with both Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
The Obama administration, he added, considers Josipovic a "statesman who wants progress and reconciliation in the region".
One aspect of reconciliation may be the proposed establishment of RECOM, a regional truth commission for war crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia.
For its part, the US administration underscored "the leading role" that Josipovic plays in "healing wounds and building bridges in the region".
In Zagreb, teacher Josip Sabic, 49, said he hoped Washington would help Croatia wrap up the lengthy EU accession process.
"We have been waiting for too long and I hope that now the world's only superpower will tell these guys in Brussels that they should let Croatia in," he told SETimes.
Macedonia's Buckovski Becomes Ruling Party Leader, Prime Minister-Designate
Prime Minister-designate Vlado Buckovski has started consultations on the formation of Macedonia's new government.
Its composition is likely to be announced by 8 December.

Two days after officially being named Macedonian Prime Minister-designate, Vlado Buckovski voiced confidence Sunday (28 November) that consultations on forming the country's new government would be completed within a week and the new cabinet announced a few days later.
He also pledged to establish regular communications with the opposition.
President Branko Crvenkovski officially gave Buckovski -- Macedonia's defence minister -- the mandate to form a the country's new government on Friday, after the ruling Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia (SDSM) elected him as its leader during an extraordinary congress on Thursday.
Buckovski will replace Hari Kostov, who resigned earlier this month as prime minister.
Buckovski won 391 votes in the second round after all three candidates for the post failed to garner an absolute majority.
Deputy Prime Minister Radmila Sekerinska was second with 265 votes.
Parliament member Tito Petkovski also ran for the post; he won 144 votes during the first round.
"I believe that the new government will be announced on 7 December or 8 December," before being put to parliamentary debate between 15 December and 18 December, Buckovski said in an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) on Sunday.
He already has started consultations with the parties in the outgoing SDSM-led coalition government, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI).
Following talks Saturday, the leaders of the LDP and DUI, Risto Penov and Ali Ahmeti, confirmed that they would remain in the SDSM-led coalition.
They also agreed that the coalition talks should not take longer than a week, given some pressing issues awaiting the formation of a new government, such as putting together the country's 2005 budget.
Buckovski said there were also negotiations with VMRO-Makedonska leader Boris Stojmenov on a possible alliance. "However, this would be a coalition for the local elections, and not for the new government."
According to local press reports, only Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva is certain to retain her post in the new cabinet.
It is unclear whether Sekerinska will stay on as deputy prime minister.
As for the defence minister's post, there is speculation in the press that the SDSM would possibly agree to give it to the LDP, with outgoing Social Minister Jovan Manasijevski seen as Buckovski's possible replacement.
Croatia's green energy depends on investments
Sun and wind are significant energy sources, but still underexploited in Croatia.
By Ksenija Jurkovic for Southeast European Times in Sibenik –16/03/11
Sun and wind are Croatia's primary renewable sources. [Reuters]
Croatia's potential for the development of renewable resources is vast, but still underused, at least when it comes to solar, wind or geothermal sources.
The situation, however, has been changing in recent years.
"We currently produce 40% of our energy from renewable sources, thanks to the hydroelectric power stations.
We are much worse off with consumption because we must buy around 30% of our power," explained Nikola Ruzinski, state secretary at the Ministry of Environmental Protection.
The "new renewables" are increasingly stirring interest among private, mainly foreign, investors, especially when it comes to wind energy exploitation.
The first windmill power plant in Croatia was built on the island of Pag in 2004.
The company, Adria Wind Power, installed windmills with the capacity of 5.9550kW on the island at Ravna.
The greatest strides in the development of wind power have been made in the coastal region, particularly in the Sibenik area, where the German company Enersys has invested in two new plants.
The first was built in 2006 in the Trtar-Krtolin hills; the second was constructed last year on the hill of Orlice.
One hundred zones across Croatia have been designated for the same purpose, though most are in the coastal Dalmatia region.
Solar energy presents a different picture, having been underutilised despite its extensive potential.
According to data provided by Zdeslav Matic, of the Energy Institute Hrvoje Pozar, Croatia is home to about 15,000 square meters of solar collectors.
It is estimated that the total generating capacity of these solar cells is about 52 kilowatts.
"Exploitation of solar energy in Croatia doesn't have systematic support and is left to the enthusiasts," the president of the Eko Kvarner Association, Vjeran Pirsic, told SETimes.
Various energy lobbies, including wind power proponents, are blocking further development of the solar alternative, he said.
"Practically, the whole quota for renewable energy was given to wind power, which simply makes no sense," says Pirsic. "Wind energy itself is a much worse choice for our country than solar energy, especially in the south."
The economy ministry currently has almost 700 applications for development of renewable energy source projects.
Completion of these would result in the production of nearly 6500 MW of power, but the existing distribution system can cope with only part of that capacity.
An outdated energy infrastructure and a sluggish bureaucracy are just some of the obstacles to developing renewable energy sources in Croatia.
"Over 60 different certificates and permits are necessary if someone wants to set solar devices on his own roof.
Among them is even a certificate for a good conduct," Pirsic told SETimes.
Despite these difficulties, Economy Minister Djuro Popijac is optimistic.
"Croatia currently spends 18 Terrawat hours of electricity annually. More than 3.5 Terrawat hours will be included in Croatia from renewable energy sources by 2020," said Popijac.
Investing in renewable energy is important to Croatia's EU future.
To meet the bloc's stringent energy requirements, the country has pledged to meet at least 20% of its energy needs, in production and consumption, from renewable sources by 2020.
Talks on BiH constitutional reform to continue after the New Year
Representatives of the eight main political parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina will return to the negotiating table in 2006 to iron out changes to the country's constitution.
The future shape of the presidency is a major point of contention.
By Antonio Prlenda for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo – 29/12/05
"It will be much harder to find an agreement on reshaping of the state parliament.
So the hardest talks are yet to come," warned the head of the SDP, Zlatko Lagumdzija. [AFP]
Talks on constitutional reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) will continue after the New Year's holidays, with representatives of the eight major political parties seeking to resolve a key disagreement over the future shape of the BiH presidency.
Speaking after the last round ended on 21 December in Sarajevo, US Ambassador to BiH Douglas McElhaney stressed the need to "go beyond partisan politics and take an attitude of statesmanship".
"Those who expected possible answers on the future of the presidency might be disappointed with last talks.
But if you wanted to see all cards on the table than you should not be unsatisfied," the ambassador said.
US officials have said they back the idea of single BiH president with clearly defined authorities, but the parties from the Bosnian Serb entity, Republika Srpska (RS), oppose such a move.
"There is no way for one president," said RS President Dragan Cavic, who backs the current tripartite presidency.
A number of compromise solutions have been floated, including a single president with two deputies, each from a different ethnic group.
But RS representatives continue to insist that presidency members need to rotate every 16 months.
Dragan Covic, the head of the major Croat party -- the Croat Democratic Union (HDZ) -- also favours the tripartite presidency, but without the rotation.
His Bosniak counterpart, Party of Democratic Action (SDA) leader and current BiH presidency member Sulejman Tihic, opposes the tripartite presidency in its current shape.
Disputes have also arisen over how a president or presidency would be elected in the future.
The opposition parties, including the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the Croatian People's Union (HNZ), insist the institution has to be elected by the BiH Parliamentary Assembly.
But the SDA expressed the view that voters should elect a president, with possible deputies.
Tihic told reporters that some progress was achieved on the issue of presidential competencies and authorities.
The participants generally agreed that the head of the state would represent the state, appoint ambassadors and call upon special sessions of the Parliamentary Assembly and the Council of Ministers.
"It will be much harder to find an agreement on reshaping of the state parliament.
So the hardest talks are yet to come," warned the head of the SDP, Zlatko Lagumdzija.
Gathering in Washington in November, the eight parties signed a joint statement pledging constitutional reform by March 2006.
So far, a new constitutional amendment has been agreed upon that would give extra powers to the prime minister of the central government.
On Wednesday, the RS Parliament adopted a constitutional amendment providing for entity competencies in the field of defence to be transferred to the state level.
The RS Defence Ministry and Army will be abolished starting on 1 January, paving the way for a single defence ministry and military command in BiH.
Italian foreign minister visits Kosovo
Kosovo independence is not a foregone conclusion, Italian Foreign Minister Gianfranco Fini said in Pristina Wednesday, warning that Kosovo's authorities must show the international community they can ensure international standards are met.

Italian Foreign Minister Gianfranco Fini arrived in Kosovo on Wednesday (28 December) for talks with Prime Minister Bajram Kosumi and to visit Italian troops serving with KFOR.
He arrived in the province after visiting Belgrade, where he met with Serbian Boris Tadic.
The focus of Fini's trip has been the upcoming talks on the final status of Kosovo, under UN administration since 1999.
"I had occasion to repeat that the independence of Kosovo has not already been decided," Fini said following his meeting with Kosumi. "Independence on certain conditions may be the outcome of the negotiations but the authorities in Pristina must, with coherent behavior, show the international community that they can guarantee the respect of international standards."
According to Fini, discussions on the province's future "must go hand in hand with reaching standards especially regarding the multiethnic nature of Kosovo, not just the protection of the Serb minority but also the right of refugees to return home".
In some cases -- especially regarding refugee returns -- the minimum standards are not close to being met, while in other areas there is compliance of greater than 50 per cent, he said.
Citing sharply opposing Serbian and Albanian views of Kosovo's future, Fini said it is clear that "much good will is required on both sides and the EU must play an active role."
After his meeting with Fini, Kosumi emphasised the Kosovo government's interest in developing economic co-operation with Italy.
He also pledged that the government and local institutions in Kosovo are committed to implementing the UN-set standards and to building democracy.
"When we say democratic society, we mean a better Kosovo for all its citizens," the prime minister said.
Fini also paid a visit to the Serbian monastery Visoki Decani, which is under the protection of Italian soldiers.
A planned meeting with Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova was cancelled after Rugova, who is battling lung cancer, had to be hospitalised.
"The condition of President Rugova is stable," Fini told reporters.
"We knew and are aware that he is fighting with all his well known determination against the illness," he said, adding, "there is no immediate danger."
EU agrees to "stress test" bloc's nuclear facilities
In the wake of Japan's disaster, the 143 nuclear reactors operating in the EU will undergo stress tests.
(EurActiv, Euroalert.net, The Sofia Echo, FOCUS News Agency - 16/03/11; Euobserver, Deutsche Welle, European Voice, RFE/RL, VOA, Sofia News Agency, Dnevnik.bg, Mediapool, European Parliament - 15/03/11)
All nuclear plants in EU countries should be tested, the EU's energy chief said on Tuesday (March 15th). [Reuters]
EU energy ministers, atomic energy regulators and industry officials agreed on Tuesday (March 15th) that all nuclear reactors currently in operation on the territory of the 27-nation bloc should be subjected to thorough safety checks.
The decision was announced after an emergency meeting in Brussels, called by EU Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger after Friday's magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami in Japan.
Since then, a series of accidents have occurred at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, about 250km northeast of Tokyo, sparking fears of a new disaster equal in proportion to the one caused by the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear station in April 1986.
Speaking after the talks, the German commissioner explained that, under EU law, the stress tests could only be carried out on a voluntary basis, but that most of the 14 member states with atomic reactors on their territories had indicated they would join the initiative.
Non-EU members Russia, Switzerland and Turkey would also be invited to take part in the exercise.
"We want to organise a series of tests, very comprehensive tests, throughout the Union," Brussels-based Euobserver online news portal quoted Oettinger as saying Tuesday. "We also want tests for our partner states, our neighbours."
According to the European Nuclear Society (ENS), as of January 2011, there were 143 nuclear reactors in operation within the Union, with 58 of them, or about 40% of all, located in France.
The UK is next with 19, but in terms of total net capacity, it followed Germany, which decided this week to switch off seven of all 17 reactors on its soil.
In addition to the existing facilities, another six nuclear reactors were under construction at the beginning of this year -- two each in Bulgaria and Slovakia, one in Finland and one in France, according to the ENS website.
Turkey has contracted Russia's Rosatom agency to build its first nuclear power plant, while there are five already in operation in Switzerland and Russia is building a further 11 units on top of its existing 32.
Oettinger, who spoke before the European Parliament's (EP) Energy Committee later Tuesday, told MEPs that the European Commission (EC) would prepare the assessment criteria for the stress tests by June.
The purpose of the exercise, which should be completed by the end of this year, would be to check the nuclear facilities' resistance to earthquakes, tsunamis and terrorist attacks.
He also drew special attention to the 2,000MW Belene nuclear power plant under construction in Bulgaria, saying the project needs to be reassessed in light of technical and geological safety issues.
"We are all affected by the situation in Japan," an EP statement quoted the commissioner as saying.
Protests in Turkey over arrested journalists
Accusations fly as the debate over press freedom heats up.

Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan reacted sharply on Monday (March 14th) to criticism that media freedom in Turkey is taking a turn for the worse.
He accused the international press of creating a "defamation campaign", and urged journalists to analyse events properly.
"There is no balance in this report," Erdogan said of a document issued last week by the EU which criticised what it said were pressures being put on the media. "The wording of this report does not reflect the press freedom in Turkey."
The debate has heated up since the recent detention of seven journalists for alleged involvement in the so-called "Ergenekon" plot to topple the government.
On Sunday, thousands of Turks marched down Istanbul's crowded Istiklal Street, protesting the arrests.
It was the largest of several recent demonstrations arranged in support of press freedom in Turkey.
"Many journalists have been captured. Some of them have been in prison for two years," said protestor Guzide Dondar Efe, a 40-year-old teacher at Bilgi University.
"They put them in prison for nothing," said demonstrator Ikem Kaykan, 29. "We are here for their freedom.
They were defending democracy and the freedom of speech."
So far, according to local media, 68 journalists have been arrested for alleged links to Ergenekon.
The government claims that only 27 journalists are in jail.
Most of those arrested were open critics of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP).
However, the recent arrest of two journalists -- Ahmet Sik and Nedim Sener, known for their condemnation of the 1980 military coup -- was a shock to many.
The move was "too much for everybody here", said Dondar Efe, who describes herself as a friend of Sik's.
"If you accused Ahmet of [being part of Ergenekon] everybody would laugh at you."
Prosecutors said on Sunday that the arrests of Sik and Sener had nothing to do with what they have written in the media.
But they refused to explain why they were detained.
The recent arrests have some questioning whether press freedom is declining in Turkey.
Some journalists claim that since the elections are only three months away, the AKP is becoming more forceful in its efforts to silence critics.
Turkey's president and one of the AKP's founders, Abdullah Gul, voiced his own concern over the recent arrests last week.
"The impression I get is that there are certain developments that the public conscience cannot accept.
This is casting a shadow over the level that Turkey has reached and the image that is lauded by everyone," Gul said.
Albania uncovers oil fraud scheme
Two companies are under suspicion of passing off low-octane "virgin napththa" as high quality fuel, while customs officers and tax officials allegedly turned a blind eye.

A Tirana court decided on Monday (March 14th) to detain 13 persons who were arrested at the weekend for their alleged involvement in an illegal oil smuggling scheme.
The suspects are accused of allowing two companies to pass off a low-octane oil byproduct as high quality imported diesel, during the period from 2007 to 2009.
Businessmen, customs officers and tax officials are among the accused.
Two large companies, Euroil and Fisheku, have been implicated.
They have been operating on the market for years.
Still unclear is how much damage has been done, ranging from the fraud itself to the impact on vehicles and the environment.
If the charges prove true, however, it could turn out to be the largest contraband fraud in Albania's history.
The prosecutor's office told local media that the alleged illegal activities began in 2007, and continued till 2009.
Oil businessmen Hajri Elezaj and Ilias Fisheku, and Fisheku's son, Martin Fisheku, are the main suspects.
The Albanian daily Mapo reported on March 12th that over the past two years, high amounts of virgin naphtha, as the byproduct is called, were sold on the market as processed oil.
"This activity came from the private company Euroil with the shareholder and administrator Hajri Elezaj, in co-operation with another private company Fisheku, with shareholder and administrator Ilias Fisheku," Mapo quoted the Albanian prosecutor's office as saying.
Customs officials are thought to have aided the scam by forging documents.
The profits from the fraud amounted to millions of euros.
Dritan Prifti, a former minister of economy, trade and energy, alleged last year that such activities had been going on.
He now says the investigation has proven him right.
Three ministers, or at least former ministers, are involved, along with senior state police officials, and customs and taxation officials, he claimed.
But Prifti himself is the subject of a separate corruption probe involving allegations that he took a 70,000-euro bribe.
He says he did nothing wrong.
The administration of Prime Minister Sali Berisha says it is cracking down on graft and fraud.
"The government will continue an uninterrupted fight against all smuggling and anybody that tries to damage the [Albanian] economy," Deputy Minister of Finance Alfred Rushaj said.
Rushaj pointed fingers at the opposition, saying that when the Socialists were in charge, virgin oil was freely traded for eight years on the domestic market without taxation.
"The gangs that take hold of oil send it to the Berisha yard," opposition head Edi Rama said Sunday.
"Meanwhile, those who enabled this robbery and started the smuggling sit at the government table."
According to Transparency International's representative in Albania, Lutfi Dervishi, the scheme confirms that some institutions in the country are not functioning properly.
The fraud, Dervishi said, should have been exposed by fuel quality inspectors, the tax office, customs or the police.

Sibenik celebrates children
For two weeks, a small Croatian town on the Adriatic coast became a global centre for children's creativity.
Photos and text by Ksenija Jurkovic for Southeast European Times in Sibenik -- 12/07/10
Sibenik hosted the 50th International Children's Festival.
Sibenik hosted the 50th International Children's Festival from June 19th to July 3rd, aiming to recapture the event's past glory.
This year, it saw far better organisation, a greater diversity of programmes, and a more varied selection of activities involving the children.
Approximately 360 separate events were held in various indoor and open-air venues across Sibenik, with the participation of more than 2,500 artists from Croatia and around the world.
Participant applications almost doubled this year compared to the festivals in the last 20 years.
The spirit of the festival swept through every corner, street and square of the town's historic centre.
Artists from around the world held performances for locals, random passersby and tourists.
The event opened with the raising of the festival flag in the historic square between Sibenik's renaissance Cathedral of St Jacob and the old city hall.
President of Croatia Ivo Josipovic attended the opening.
"A festival with so many children from around the world is the pride of Sibenik and the whole country," Josipovic said.
The official programme of the Children's Festival opened with the play "Buratino" [The Golden Key] by A.N. Tolstoy, adapted by Croatian playwright Marijana Nola for the occasion.
The festival opened with the play "Buratino", a remake of the well known "Pinocchio".
"We have been working on this play for almost half a year.
It is a re-interpretation of the children's tale 'Pinocchio'," explained Nina Kleflin, the play director, adding that her team approached the project keeping in mind that it was to be performed for the festival's 50th jubilee.
Jasenka Ramljak, manager of the festival's external programmes, said this year's event featured excellent performers.
Participants included the ensemble Oplasteatro from Italy, Teater Grupen Batina from Denmark, Vaskakas Babszinhaz from Hungary, the Inis Eagle School of Irish Dancing, and Canada's Theatre Sun Ergos.
The audience was especially impressed with the Croatian National Theatre from Split and its ballet performance of Tchaikovsky's "The Nutcracker".
"We performed here two years ago, but are always pleased to return to this square and dance for the children.
This international festival is very important, and not only for Sibenik. It's generally important for children," said ensemble leader Lev Saposnikov.
In his opinion, Croatia has very few theatre events for children. "The Nutcracker" is one of them and we are pleased that to have performed here," Saposnikov said.
Street entertainers created a special atmosphere.
They arrived from Switzerland, the United States, Canada, Macedonia, Portugal, Spain, Poland, Italy and Croatia, performing in virtually every square of the old town.
Seth and Christina, street entertainers from the US, were among the international participants at the festival.
A couple of US performers entertaining kept the central Medulic Square, packed with people during the entire festival.
"We are Christina and Seth from New York City.
We met in Afghanistan, we were engaged in Scotland and got married in China, and now we're been looking for a country to have children in," they said, laughing.
The two have performed in 13 countries. "We used to be acrobats and jugglers but we got injured. So we made a new show with water balloons," Christina said.
"We wanted to have a show that isn't about love, so Christina said 'what about war?'," Seth said.
The event has thrilled grownups as much as the children.
Street performers were plentiful through the city.
People come here from Zagreb, and as far as Australia, just to come to the festival," said Benjamin, a 29-year-old from Germany.
"For the people of Sibenik, I think this is the only time in the year when they can see serious artists [in their town].
There are artists from New York, musicians from Poland and the people of Sibenik can see how big the world is during these two weeks.
It is very nice."
Dana, an 8-year-old festival participant, agreed that this year's event was special. To her everything was "great!"
Mural painting was one of the workshop highlights at this years Children's Festival.
In addition to various performances held daily throughout Sibenik's historic centre, children were able to participate in many workshops, express their creativity in art workshops, film and music workshops, doll-making, and, for the first time, the "Hands are Speaking" workshop for children with impaired hearing.
"We paint on walls with the little ones.
The theme is free and the emphasis is on space," said Danijela Cikatic Javorcic, the head of the mural workshop.
Marta Dujmovic, an 11-year-old from Split, said that she takes part in festival workshops each year.
"We draw the front of the boat and fishing net with fish, but we draw the details that not everyone sees and try to make the drawing special.
I got this idea because I live on the coast and my grandpa has a boat," she explained.
Farewell children -- until 2011.
This year's event also hosted a children's book fair which opened with the presentation of the monograph Season of Joy that examines the history of the Festival since 1958.
Croatian Radio Television produced a documentary about the very first festival, featuring Ljiljana Gospodnetic, who, as a little girl, was at the opening.
The performance "Misevi i macke naglavacke" ("Mice and Cats Upsidedown") by the Croatian National Theatre from Varazdin closed the event on July 3rd.
Just prior to the closing ceremony, on the Sibenik quay, children released air balloons and kites into the air.
"The festival has fully met our expectations," said festival Director Dragan Zlatovic.
"Just the workshops of this year's programme, where children presented their creations in 21 workshops, we must be satisfied.
And if we add to this all the performing arts and other types of programmes at the festival, I believe that we celebrated the festival's birthday in a worthy manner," Zlatovic said.
Turkish Government Seeks Parliamentary Approval for Troop Deployment in Iraq
Parliamentary consideration of a motion authorising deployment of Turkish peacekeeping troops in Iraq could come as early as Tuesday, officials said, expressing confidence that lawmakers would give their approval.
(BBC, The New York Times - 07/10/03; AP, AFP, Reuters, CNN, Anadolu Agency - 06/10/03)
The Turkish government on Monday (6 October) adopted a decision to send troops to Iraq and has sent a motion to parliament to authorise the deployment.
Officials have voiced confidence that lawmakers would give their approval, possibly as early as Tuesday.
After a five-hour cabinet meeting Monday, Turkish Justice Minister and government spokesman Cemil Cicek said all ministers had signed the motion, which limits the term of deployment to one year.
The number of troops to be dispatched to Iraq has not been specified, Cicek added, and would be decided on the basis of a needs assessment.
Earlier reports have suggested Turkey could send up to 10,000 troops.
Other specific issues, including their deployment location, will be subject to negotiation with the United States following the motion's approval by parliament.
Monday's decision came in response to a request by the United States for military assistance in bringing peace and stability to Iraq.
Washington has welcomed the move.
"Turkey has an important role to play in stabilising Iraq," said US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher. "We continue our discussions with Turkish authorities on the details of possible deployment, if parliament endorses the government's request."
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose Justice and Development Party has a majority in parliament, was to address party members on Tuesday, ahead of the debate in the assembly.
He recently voiced confidence that lawmakers would support the request for peacekeepers.
"Had we had any doubts, we wouldn't be sending this motion," Cicek told reporters on Monday.
An approval would not only make Turkey the first predominantly Muslim country to contribute troops to the US-led operation in Iraq, Cicek said, but would also allow it to have a say in future matters affecting the entire region.
"Turkey is the first country to be affected by developments in Iraq, both negative and positive...
We cannot just stand by and watch what is happening there," he added.
To compensate Turkey for the damages its economy has incurred as a result of the war in neighbouring Iraq, the United States agreed late last month to provide the country with $8.5 billion in loans.
Washington stressed, however, that the support was not conditional on the dispatch of Turkish troops to Iraq.
A role in the peacekeeping effort would also help Turkey cope with rebels from the Kurdistan Worker's Party, or KADEK, which led a 15-year armed struggle in Turkey that took about 37,000 lives.
The United States, which along with Turkey considers KADEK a terrorist organisation, recently assured Ankara that it would help remove the threat posed by the rebels.
An estimated 5,000 of them are believed to be hiding in northern Iraq.
Former Bulgarian cabinet ministers face criminal charges
Former Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev is being investigated in connection with leaked classified information, while a member of his cabinet is probed for criminal breach of trust and another has already been indicted on charges of abuse of power.

Prosecutors in Bulgaria have launched probes against several former ministers and heads of state agencies over their alleged involvement in corruption, embezzlement or other wrongdoings.
The highest-ranking among them is the leader of the main opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and former Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev.
On November 3rd, Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev asked parliament to lift Stanishev's immunity, so that he can be investigated in connection with a missing classified report handed to him last year.
"Stanishev will be probed for losing documents and materials containing information which was state secret," as well as for having "due to carelessness, become the reason for the disclosure of information constituting state secret," Velchev's office said in a statement.
The document in question was a memo prepared by the State National Security Agency (DANS) on the "actions of individual and circles exercising a destructive influence on the functioning of ministries and public administration structures".
The scandal erupted last month when incumbent Prime Minister Boyko Borisov said that former DANS agent Alexey Petrov gave him the missing report.
In line with the rules on handling classified information, Stanishev should have returned the document to a special department at the council of ministers, but failed to do so.
It was unclear how Petrov, who served as advisor to former DANS head Petko Sertov, got hold of the memo.
Shortly after, the classified report was published on the Internet.
Claiming he had returned the report to the security agency, the former prime minister denied any wrongdoing, but said he would voluntarily give up his immunity from prosecution.
According to Sofia city prosecutor Nikolay Kokinov, a person close to Stanishev, who acted as an intermediary, would also be investigated in connection with the case.
Borisov then told the media that the total number of top secret documents his predecessor had failed to handle in line with the established procedures was 11, among them one on contraband channels and another on Russia's growing energy influence.
The move against Stanishev prompted harsh criticism from President Georgi Parvanov, who jumped in to defend his successor as BSP leader.
He said the government would sue the former prime minister over "a misplaced file," while it did nothing to catch gangland bosses.
Stanishev met with city prosecutors in Sofia last month. [Getty Images]
"Why doesn't the government act as swiftly in combating the bosses of organised crime, who have turned into one of the symbols of the Bulgarian transition," Parvanov said on November 9th.
"I can't shake off the feeling that the big mafia bosses are still untouchable."
Borisov responded immediately. He reminded the president that there were 11 missing reports, not one, that shed light on the criminal circles impeding the functioning of the state and urged him not to interfere in the prosecution's work.
"We follow the natural path of logic: we will catch the big sharks first and then we will go after the small fry," Sofia-based Standart daily quoted Borisov as saying.
"Had we started with the bosses, we would have admitted that Bulgaria was run by the heads of organised crime and not by the [previous, BSP-led] three-way coalition.
Isn't that right?"
If Stanishev is found guilty, he could face a prison sentence of up to three years.
Borisov's centre-right Citizens for the European Development of Bulgaria party (GERB) won a landslide victory in the July 5th parliamentary elections in Bulgaria on promises to fight organised crime and corruption that have already cost the Balkan country hundreds of millions of euros in frozen EU assistance.
During the last four months, Borisov and his ministers have revealed numerous suspicious deals concluded by members of Stanishev's cabinet, with many already referred to the state prosecutor's office.
The facts brought to light thus far point to hundreds of millions of euros of budget funds having been siphoned off as a result of violating the public procurement rules, highly inflated contractual prices for construction or renovation works, or other schemes.
Just three days after Velchev asked parliament to lift Stanishev's immunity from prosecution, the legislature received a similar request for former Labour Minister Emilia Maslarova on November 6th.
Maslarova, also a member of the BSP, will be investigated for criminal breach of trust in connection with a contract for the repair and renovation of a social centre in the town of Stara Zagora.
The deal worth nearly 10m euros was won by a company allegedly linked to the former minister's partner and was signed shortly before the end of her mandate.
According to media reports, the price for the renovation of a single metre of space amounted to more than 1,200 euros, well above that charged for new construction.
The prosecution said that Maslarova will likely be probed for the embezzlement of nearly 5m euros.
Just like Stanishev, the former labour minister denied any wrongdoing, but asked parliament to strip her of immunity from prosecution so that investigators could do their job.
Borisov said his predecessor mishandled 11 top secret documents. [Getty Images]
If proven guilty, Maslarova could face a prison sentence of up to ten years and be banned from public office.
In early September, former Agriculture Minister Valeri Tsvetanov, a representative of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, became the first member of the previous coalition government to be indicted.
He is charged with abuse of power over 15 land swap deals.
The prosecution pressed similar charges against the former head of the State Forestry Agency Stefan Yurukov, who is said to have deliberately concluded disadvantageous deals worth nearly 2.3m euros.
One of the first legislative moves by the Borisov government was to impose a moratorium on the notorious land swap deals, through which sponsors or others close to Bulgaria's past few governments were able to obtain state-owned plots in resort areas in exchange for much less attractive landplants in the interior of the country.
On November 9th, the Sofia city prosecution indicted another senior official.
Hristo Monov, who was dismissed as head of the Balkan country's State Railway Company (BDZ) last month, was charged over a 16.5m euro deal for the purchase of 30 second-hand carriages.
Under the contract, the BDZ chief signed with a Swiss-based company the price for each of the 35-to-40-year-old carriages was set at 550,000 euros, while a recent expert assessment found them to be worth 217,000 euros each.
The carriages, which were renovated at least nine years ago, but were not repaired, recently, do not meet the effective technical requirements, Bulgaria's English-language daily The Sofia Echo quoted prosecutors as saying.
Furthermore, while Bulgaria has paid 90% of the contractual sum, only 12 of the carriages have been delivered.
Monov intentionally signed an unfavourable deal that caused 10m euros in damages to the state coffers, prosecutors said.
If convicted, the former BDZ head could face a jail term of up to ten years.
Majority supports Karadzic's surrender to ICTY
SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- More than half of Bosnian Serbs think Radovan Karadzic should turn himself in, according to a new poll.
The survey, conducted by Prime Communication, found that 53.3 per cent of citizens in Republika Srpksa favour Karadzic's voluntary surrender, while 46.7 per cent are against it.
As for ex-military commander Ratko Mladic, 46.9 percent back his voluntary surrender, 40.7 per cent oppose it, and 12.4 per cent have no opinion.
Both men have been indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal.
A total of 70.5 per cent of respondents favoured voluntary surrender as a way of bringing war crimes indictees to justice, while 51.5 per cent said they supported arrests as a method.
Notably, both options were supported by a majority, suggesting that RS public opinion favours meeting obligations to the tribunal. (RTRS, B92 - 11/11/05)
Serbian government collapses, early elections expected in May
The Serbian government, formed less than ten months ago by pro-democracy parties, will cease to exist because of core disagreements between the coalition partners regarding Kosovo and the issue of European integration.
Snap elections are expected in May.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 10/03/08
"The people of Serbia deserve a better life and an economic prospect that is possible only within the EU," President Boris Tadic said. [Getty Images]
At a news conference early Saturday (March 8th), Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica announced his own resignation and said the cabinet can no longer function due to the coalition partners' deeply differing positions on Kosovo.
Because of this, the government on Monday asked President Boris Tadic, leader of the Democratic Party (DS), to disband parliament and call for early elections, potentially on May 11th, the date of local and provincial elections.
"A government that lacks a common policy can no longer function -- that is the end of the government.
That means we have to return our mandate to the people," Kostunica said.
He added that the cause of the coalition's dissolution is the impasse over Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia on February 17th.
Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) backed a controversial resolution by the far-right Radical Party, which stated that Serbia could join the EU only if the Union pledged to respect Serbia's sovereignty over Kosovo.
Partners in the fragile ruling coalition, the DS and the G17 Plus party, which advocate the quickest possible European integration, rejected the resolution, which finally resulted in the government's collapse.
Tadic said that with such a resolution Serbia cannot defend Kosovo, but can only halt its accession to the EU.
He supports the decision to call an early election.
However, the president also said that the primary problem in relations among the coalition partners is the attitude towards the EU.
"I believe that this is about the Serbian government lacking a common stand on Serbia's -- and its citizens' -- European and economic prospect.
The people of Serbia deserve a better life and an economic prospect that is possible only within the EU, and I am also confident that we will best defend our Kosovo from independence precisely by joining that organisation," Tadic said on Saturday.
Analysts say the early election will be a referendum on Serbia's future path -- towards the EU if the pro-European forces win, or towards self-isolation if the nationalist parties win.
The primary battle is expected to be fought between Tadic's DS and the Radicals, whose leader, Vojislav Seselj, is on trial before The Hague tribunal.
According to a poll released in February, if the election were held now, the Radical Party would win 39% of votes compared to 38% for the DS and its partners.
According to these results, both parties could form a government only with the help of coalition partners.
Therefore, if the election turns out as predicted, the bloc around Kostunica would win around 10%, making the talks on forming a new cabinet tough and uncertain.
The public is polarised concerning Kosovo and the EU.
Polls suggest 67% of Serbian citizens still want to join the EU.
However, 74% would not accept accelerated European integration if it means recognising Kosovo's independence.
The early elections concern both economists and Kosovo Serbs.
Economists believe Serbia will lose a great deal of foreign investment due to political instability, while Kosovo Serbs think snap elections will not help preserve Kosovo and that political bickering is taking up valuable time.
Gotovina, Markac and Cermak war crimes trial opens on Tuesday
The trial of three high-profile Croatian generals charged with atrocities committed in 1995 is set to begin Tuesday at The Hague tribunal.

The trial of three retired generals who are accused of crimes committed during the war in Croatia in 1995, opens on Tuesday (March 11th).
The generals -- Ante Gotovina, Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac -- are charged with crimes against humanity and violation of war regulations during Operation Storm, which lasted from July to September 30, 1995, in areas of Croatia that were occupied by Serbs.
The men face seven charges, including murder, persecution and inhumane acts during and after the recapture of the Krajina region by Croatian troops.
They pleaded not guilty during their first hearing before the court and later, when their charges were partially altered.
At the time of the operation, Gotovina was commander of the Split Military District of the Croatian Army (HV) -- which he commanded from 1992 to 1996.
Cermak was commander of the Knin Garrison and the highest ranking Croatian military authority in the garrison's jurisdiction, and Marcak was commander of the interior ministry's special police.
Proceedings leading up to the trial have shown that the indictment might result in significant differences among the three defences.
Because each strategy is based on undermining the other, media analysts and independent legal experts predict that during the trial the three generals might accuse each other of criminal activity based on their individual command responsibilities.
The trial is expected to receive intense media and public attention in Croatia, where the three are perceived as national heroes.
Gotovina is an icon of right wing conservatives, who consider him responsible for liberating the country in the 1995 military action.
Gotovina was arrested in December 2005 and has since been held at The Hague's Scheveningen detention unit.
Markac had a provisional release, but failed to follow rules and consequently was ordered to return to The Hague.
Cermak had been held in Zagreb, awaiting trial.
The trial is not expected to conclude before the end of the year.
According to the tribunal's exit strategy, all appeals should be finalised by 2010.

Internet giant Google added a translation programme to Google Docs allowing users to translate documents into 42 languages, including Albanian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Greek, Romanian, Serbian and Turkish.
A translation is done in seconds, Google said.
Bulgarian archaeologists discovered a unique medieval seal at the site of the Knyazhevski [Princely] Monastery near Varna.
The seal, dating back to the tenth century, belonged to an important Byzantine dignitary.
Scientists also discovered other fragments of Byzantine ceramics in the same location.
Construction work in Elbasan, Albania, unearthed parts of a Roman road called Via Egnatia, dating back to 2nd century BC.
Old walls, columns, decorative stones and mosaics were found at what is believed to be the eastern gate of the road.
The municipality suspended work until a full excavation is made.
The National and University Library of Kosovo participated for the third time in the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions General Conference.
The forum was held from August 23 to Thursday (August 27th) in Milan, Italy.
Serbia is the first country in Europe to start testing the Lucanix vaccine against lung cancer.
The vaccine consists of genetically engineered lung cancer cells that are injected into the patient's arm on a monthly basis.
The purpose of the therapy is to train the patient's immune system to recognise and kill cancer cells.

Crisis drives up Romanian unemployment
Until recently a model of economic progress in Central and Southeast Europe, Romania faces a dramatic rise in unemployment.

An announcement by Romania's labour minister in November, that by May 2009 as many as 34,000 workers could lose their jobs, sent shock waves through the country.
In the government's assessment, unemployment will hit the private sector hardest.
While the governor of the National Bank of Romania tried to down play that estimate, saying it represents only around 0.5% of the country's labour force, he also warned projections could go higher.
Union leaders maintain that unemployment might reach 8%, or about 1.2 million people, as the most affected industries will be textiles, construction, agriculture, automobiles and finance.
Figures vary, depending on the source.
The president of the SME (Small and Medium Enterprises) Council, Ovidiu Nicolescu, said that as of October, private firms in 30 counties had shed around 50,000 employees, raising unemployment in the private sector to 150,000.
The Romanian Association of Construction Entrepreneurs (ARCO) announced in mid- November that around 70,000 employees will be temporarily laid off until January, and another 35,000 could lose their jobs permanently as of April.
According to ARCO, 32% of Romania's construction companies are affected by the crisis.
In turn, the Agrostar Federation asked the minister of agriculture to approve the dismissal of 50,000 employees -- almost 75% of its combined payrolls -- until April, as most agricultural firms cannot continue production.
Several companies announced they would either reduce production or suspend activity.
For example, the carmaker Dacia announced it would suspend activity from November 30th till December 7th, as sales collapsed.
Rompetrol Petrochemicals, a division of the Rompetrol Group, announced it would cut production by 55% in December and January, while dismissing 24% of its employees.
The chemical plant Oltchim Ramnicu Valcea said it would reduce production by 20% to 40% after suffering a 50% drop in demand.
Five hundred of the company's 4,800 employees will lose their jobs, mainly those approaching retirement, announced plant management.
The fertiliser plant Azomures temporarily dismissed 250 employees for lack of orders.
Krafts Food Romania will close its production unit in Brasov with 400 employees and partially relocate the jobs to Bulgaria, but Coca-Cola dismissed speculation about closing its units in Iasi and Oradea.
President Traian Basescu last week visited the headquarters of the companies Dacia, Oltchim, Azomures, Ford, Daewoo, Nokia and ArcelorMittal and assured the public none of the market giants would go bankrupt.
Meanwhile, the government passed several measures to help the economy, including abolishing the first year's registration tax on a new car and earmarking 1,000 euros for each employer who creates new jobs.
Who will get the lucky coin?
Macedonians mark the winter holiday season with a rich array of traditions and festivities.
By Valentin Nesovski for Southeast European Times in Skopje -- 24/12/08

"Kolede lede, padnalo grede ... " There is no Macedonian who has not been awakened with this song, sung in the early morning hours of January 6th.
That date, known as Badnik, is the eve of Orthodox Christmas.
Winter celebrations in Macedonia start well before that, however.
During December groups of people travel to the mountains to pick oak branches to decorate their homes.
The branches will be set aflame on Badnik.
Meanwhile, elderly women plant wheat in pots.
The green shoots symbolise life, fertility and prosperity.
In the last week of December, villagers and townspeople select a "Godfather" -- a respected person whose task will be to look after the community's well-being during the coming year.
On Christmas Eve, the entire family gathers at the table.
Only vegetarian food is served, as this is the last day of a 40-day fast observed by the faithful.
The head of the family breaks open a large, round loaf of bread, giving a piece to each family member.
One piece contains a lucky coin.
Everyone waits anxiously to see who will get it.
Although Macedonians celebrate Christmas only once, following the old Julian calendar, when it comes to New Year's, they are more liberal.
Both the Gregorian and Julian New Years are observed.
For decades, revelers have gathered in front of the famous Idadija Tavern in Debar Maalo, a Skopje district, to sing songs and perform folk dances on January 1st.
On January 5th, it's time to gather logs for a huge bonfire; people then gather to sing Kolede songs announcing Christ's birth and to drink warmed rakija.
Children go from door to door singing and usually receive coins, apples, pears and candies in return.
Another festivity follows on January 14th, when masked balls occur in many places.
Even at home, people don masks.
The purpose: to scare away evil demons.
Vodici, or Epiphany, is January 19th.
A custom on this day is to throw a cross into a river or lake; hardy celebrants will then jump in and try to retrieve it.
With this ritual, the cycle of winter festivities comes to an end, and it is time to await spring.
EU leaders voice support for return to nuclear energy
Amid soaring oil prices, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and several European leaders voiced support Thursday for a nuclear power revival, seeing it as a useful tool in meeting some the bloc's goals.

Joining other advocates of a resurgence of nuclear power, European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso argued on Thursday (May 22nd) that it could be instrumental to the EU's fight against climate change.
"Nuclear energy can make a major contribution to this battle," the EC president said at the start of a European Nuclear Energy Forum conference.
Increasingly concerned by global warming, the 27-nation bloc seeks a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20% by 2020, compared to 1990 levels.
Atomic energy's supporters insist its greater use could help achieve that goal, as it creates little carbon dioxide.
Soaring oil prices and EU nations' increasing dependence on hydrocarbon imports also are prompting calls for a diversification of the bloc's energy supplies.
Barroso stressed on Thursday that nuclear power is not only a low-carbon energy source but also the cheapest and less vulnerable to price changes than fossil fuels.
"Nuclear energy also helps to enhance the EU's security of energy supplies, and it increases diversification of our energy sources and reduces our dependence on imported gas," the EC president said at the forum, attended also by the Czech and Slovak prime ministers, Mirek Topolanek and Robert Fico, and senior energy officials from around the EU.
The EU, where 15 of the member nations currently have nuclear power, remains split on the issue.
Germany, which closed its reactors after the Chernobyl accident in April 1986, and Austria are the most anti-nuclear EU nations.
The Czech prime minister spoke in favour of a nuclear power revival, warning, "It really is five minutes to midnight."
His Slovak counterpart also views nuclear power as essential to Europe's energy security.
"It is clear to all of us that without nuclear we are unable to ensure energy security in Europe," Fico said on Thursday.
Before joining the EU, Slovakia agreed to shut down two Soviet-era reactors by 2009.
Fico said that the "reckless decision" would force "Slovakia ... to import 20% of its electricity needs".
The only possible solution would be a "new agreement" with the EU.
Lithuania and Bulgaria, which made similar commitments before joining the bloc, also are urging the EU to reconsider.
Bulgaria once had six operating nuclear reactors but closed four of them.
The former energy exporter is now planning a new nuclear power station about 250km northeast of Sofia.
Jolie attends Sarajevo movie premiere
Angelina Jolie said her directorial debut, set during the 1990s conflict in BiH, is intended to draw attention to global atrocities.

US actress and director Angelina Jolie arrived with her partner Brad Pitt to the cheers of 5,000 fans attending the premiere of the directorial debut "In the Land of Blood and Honey" on Tuesday night (February 14th).
Jolie, wearing a long black gown, walked arm-in-arm with Pitt on the red carpet, waving to photographers and fans.
She greeted the crowd in Bosnian.
The film's plot centres around the love story of two young people, which is abruptly ended by the start of the conflict.
Later, the two are reconnected -- as a Serbian soldier and Muslim woman imprisoned in a concentration camp in BiH, where a rape occurs.
The film has provoked negative comments in BiH, particularly among Serbs, who believe the movie demonises them.
As one of Hollywood’s most famous figures, Jolie’s star power is expected to draw renewed global attention to the events surrounding the 1990s conflict.
She has told reporters that she hopes the film will be a "wake-up call" for the international community to stop fighting around the world.
"The movie is about universal topics -- conflict, torture, violence of women, and the response of society.
This movie is not judgmental, it is not anti-Serbian," Jolie said. "I believe that its core issue -- which is the need for intervention and need for the world to care about atrocities when they are happening -- is very, very timely and especially with things that are happening in Syria today."
As the film ended to a standing ovation, Jolie tearfully told filmgoers, "To share this with you means the world to me."
"We judged about something that we do not know, and when I saw the tears in Angelina's eyes, I realised that this is not just another job for her, but a lot more," Amra Sabic of Sarajevo told SETimes.
"I did not make the movie … to show the dark part of the history of this country, but to show the world the remarkable [country of] Bosnia and Herzegovina. [I]t is a reminder of all the suffering that people experienced here," Jolie said.
"This movie changed my life and the way I see this region."
She dismissed the negative comments about the film from Republika Srpska and Serbia, saying they were from politicians and the media.

"Serbian people are smart and will able to see the differences between the truth and something that is imposed on them.
They will see that the movie is art," said Jolie.
"The movie is good, but is should be seen without prejudices, because only then does it have meaning," premier attendee Mensur Hajdarevic told SETimes.
"I thought it would be easier to watch this movie, but many things reminded me about my war fate; it reminded me of the town I left, and the violence that my family experienced," said Selma Fejzic.
The movie will be launched throughout the region on Thursday.
Bulgaria retracts support as Europeans protest ACTA antipiracy measures
Activists protesting ACTA decry loss of freedom of expression and basic civil liberties.

Bulgaria has formally withdrawn its support for an international anti-piracy agreement, just days after a wave of demonstrations across Europe from protesters who claimed the agreement would violate human rights.
Bulgaria's dismissal of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) comes only a month after its parliament signed the agreement, which aims to establish an international legal framework for counterfeit goods, generic medicines and copyright infringement on the Internet.
The proposal sparked co-ordinated protests across Europe on February 11th, including in Greece, Bulgaria, UK, Italy and France.
Bulgaria officials said they would wait until there is a clear EU position on the pact before moving forward.
"I'm a pessimist when it comes to regulating an industry, which hasn't adapted to the digital age, through sanctions rather than market means," Economy and Energy Minister Traicho Traikov told reporters in Sofia, according to Bloomberg.
"Authors' copyrights should not be placed above human rights."
The ratification of the pact was signed by 22 EU countries in Tokyo on January 26th, including Greece and Bulgaria.
Some countries, including the Czech Republic and Poland, have stopped moving toward ratification, while Germany, Slovakia and Estonia are among the EU members that have not signed.
Before it goes into effect, ACTA still has to be ratified by the European Parliament, which adopted a resolution on March 10th 2010 on the transparency of negotiations, claiming it had to "respect fundamental rights, such as the right to freedom of expression and the right to privacy".
The debate is set for June.
Protesters in Bulgaria have complained that ACTA was signed in secrecy, without any public debate or sufficient consultation with civil society groups.
Under ACTA, copyright holders would be able to force Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to disclose personal data without court proceedings.
Opponents also slammed the authorities for joining a "fluid" international accord, whose anti-piracy provisions could lead to violation of basic civil rights and freedoms.
"The key problems with ACTA stem from the fact that the texts are extremely vague and would allow the use of mechanisms violating citizens' fundamental rights and freedoms," Stanislav Dodov, one of the Sofia protest organisers told SETimes.
"It is absolutely crucial that ACTA be shelved," Anestis Samourkasidis, head of communications for the newly formed Pirate Party of Greece, told SETimes.
"What started off as a charter to deal with counterfeiting physical products has come to include digital material, and instead of being negotiated secretly it should have been drafted openly in collaboration with all countries under the umbrella of the World Trade Organization," Samourkasidis explained.
Alexander Georgiev, a Sofia engineer, said he opposes the treaty as it would "allow authorities to rummage through his files and all types of personal data under the pretext that they need to shut down a torrent tracker or some website".
Meanwhile, Romanian movie distributors are up in arms over Internet piracy.
"If we launch a movie later than two weeks after its official launch in the US, then we expect a much lower income than initially expected," Oana Stoinescu-Omer, deputy director of the RoImage, a Romanian movie distributor and representative of Motion Picture Licensing Company, told SETimes.
Varujan Pambuccian, head of the IT and Communication Commission of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the Romanian Parliament, warned that some ACTA provisions question its practical application.
"Counterfeiting is a phenomenon while piracy is direct theft.
But when you bring in an exaggerated enforcement to tackle these, you open the door to abuses," he told SETimes.
"I suggest the movie companies to follow the example of software producing companies.
We saw a decline in illegal software, while the acquisition of authentic software has increased.
That means their fight against counterfeiting is effective," he added, while criticising the absent public debate before ACTA was signed by the Romanian government.
SETimes correspondants Svetla Dimitrova in Sofia and Paul Ciocoiu from Bucharest contributed to this report.
Dangerous floods and landslides after heavy snow
Heavy snowfalls have paralysed BiH and other regional countries, but has also fostered co-operation.

Officials in the Balkans are discussing co-ordinating their efforts in preperation for the likelihood of extreme flooding and landslides in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Serbia, Croatia and Montenegro, following the massive snowfall that has piled as much as 5m of snow in some areas.
Republika Srpska President Aleksandar Dzombic has suggested a joint, mutual co-ordinating body to organise flood relief efforts.
He directed his proposal to FBiH President Nermin Niksic, Serbia Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic, Montenegro Prime Minister Igor Luksic and Croatia Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic.
"We are aware of the fact that we all do our best with available capacities, but our problems will not go away with the stopping of the snowfalls," Dzombic said in a letter to the other leaders.
The proposal for the joint action has been viewed by many in region positively.
"Serbia supports this initiative because it also tries to organise itself [as] the regional headquarters in case of natural disasters.
This would enable that each country in region ... could have beforehand organised help of neighbouring countries," Milivoje Mihajlovic, director of Serbia's office of media relations, told SETimes.
Niksic expects officials to act as fast as possible.
"I believe that the Council of Ministers would not make any obstacles in the realisation of this intergovernmental initiative and that will, as soon as possible, take specific activities," Niksic said.

The region is susceptable to flooding, and some are still recovering from flooding two years ago, in the Semberia region of Republika Srpska.
"My house was flooded then, and my family was evacuated.
That was in December 2010.
We still live at our family members', because our home was destroyed, and the promises that will be repaired are not carried out," Jovan Markovic, a resident of Dvorovi, told SETimes.
Temperatures are expected to remain below freezing for several more days, the Federal Hydrometeorological Institute said.
The necessity of the mutual actions regarding the arrangements of the river bed and making the walls which will protect the flooding is essential, as well as the supply of the machines which break the ice in the rivers.
Croatia borrowed such machines from the Hungary, and the danger of the floating ice is present in Serbia too.
"The danger of the icy waves is also present in BiH, and when it passes the period of ice and snow melting follows.
It would bring large floods and new problems especially in BiH, Serbia and Croatia," Jerko Ivanković, the commander of the Federal Headquarters of the Civil Protection, told SETimes.
Apart from the floods, the large consequences of the snow melting would be landslides.
Hazim Hrvatinovic, the director of the Federal Geology Bureau, said the whole country is being closely monitored.
"The landslides are monitored, we make priorities for the action of the most dangerous and try to minimize the possible consequences," Hrvatinović told SETimes.
Pro-European government will be best for Serbia, economists say.
As negotiations on forming a new Serbian government enter the critical phase, local economists say the country will benefit the most from a cabinet that accelerates European integration.

Although Serbia's political parties are still in negotiations on who will form the new government after the parliamentary elections earlier this month, Belgrade economists say that the coalition gathered around the pro-European Democratic Party (DS), led by Serbian President Boris Tadic, would be much more likely to garner the trust of foreign investors.
Economists also say that, for the sake of European integration, a DS-based government would attack the problem of inflation and would preserve the country's economic stability.
The future government depends on the coalition around the Socialist Party of Serbia, which won 20 seats in the May 11th election.
The Socialists launched negotiations with the Radicals and the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), but those plans collapsed.
Some of the leaders in the Socialist coalition now want to break off talks with the DSS and initiate negotiations with the DS.
The DSS and the Radicals claim they will annul the SAA, because they say that through the agreement, Serbia indirectly recognised Kosovo's declaration of independence on February 17th.
Belgrade economist Sasa Djogovic told Southeast European Times that if the Serbian Radical Party and the Socialist coalition organise the new government, foreign investors will be cautious until they see how Belgrade handles relations with the EU.
However, if the DS and the Socialists govern, investors would not hold back because "the officials whose policy they are familiar with and with whom they have been co-operating since 2000 would be in power", Djogovic said.
Economist Jurij Bajec says Serbia "needs a government that will enable direct foreign investment sufficient to ensure a 7% annual GDP growth rate in the coming period".
"Something like that requires the annual inflow of 3 billion euros worth of direct foreign investment and 2 billion euros in favourable loans with long grace periods," Bajec said.
He added that such an inflow of foreign investment could be achieved only by a pro-European government that "understands that the EU is Serbia's chief economic partner".
"A pro-European government that would adopt European standards would guarantee security and stability, not only for investors from Europe but from all over the world, Russia, China and India," Bajec said.
Some, however, believe differently.
Economist Jovan Dusanic said that foreign interests have invested in Serbia mostly through the privatisation of companies, with a small number of greenfield investments.
Regardless of who forms the new government, it will not be difficult to attract foreign investment through the sale of major entities, such as the oil industry and the power company, Dusanic wrote in a special supplement published by the Belgrade daily Politika.
He uses the examples of Russia and China -- saying that in the case of greenfield investments, what matters is not who is in power and what the country's international reputation is, but what conditions the country offers to investors.
Will Serbia Become a Kingdom Again?
The Serbian Orthodox Church, which enjoys great trust among the public, has proposed reinstating the monarchy in Serbia.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 11/12/03
Less than a month before the Serbian Parliamentary elections, Patriarch Pavle proposed the reintroduction of the monarchy.
The head of the Serbian Orthodox Church called on Crown Prince Aleksandar Karadjordjevic to take a more active part in the matter.
Pavle said Serbia's entire history had been marked by kings and that as a republic it had seen "incredible tyranny".
Serbia first became a kingdom in the 13th century.
But the Communists abolished the monarchy in 1945, after victory in World War II.
In 1947, the Karadjordjevic Royal Dynasty was stripped of its property and banned from the country. The family was allowed to return during former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's rule, despite their opposition to his regime.
In 2001, they were given back their citizenship and some of their property.
Public opinion polls show that the reintroduction of the monarchy is supported by between 7 per cent and 15 percent of the people.
However, the Serbian Orthodox Church has strong public influence, so that support is likely to climb after the patriarch's call.
Karadjordjevic said that the renewal of the monarchy was "a matter of rights and justice", adding that it was of national interest.
He believes the monarchy should be established by the Serbian legislature, not through a public referendum.
According to him, "the Crown provides stability, unity, and continuity". The royal family advocates establishment of a constitutional parliamentary monarchy, as in several EU countries.
They think Serbia needs a king for the sake of institutional stability, in the wake of three consecutive failed presidential elections.
However, the introduction of the monarchy by the Serbian legislature mostly depends on the four major Serbian parties -- Democratic Party of Serbia, Serbian Radical Party, Democratic Party and G17 Plus.
The Democratic Party and G17 Plus are republican parties, unlikely to support a change in the state order in the legislature.
The Democratic Party of Serbia and the Radicals have popular leaders, Vojislav Kostunica and Tomislav Nikolic respectively, who will not easily give up on the post of Serbian president.
Kostunica has already said that the monarchy issue is not of a top priority for Serbia, adding that it can only be resolved through referendum.
Montenegrin officials have also spoken negatively about the return of the monarchy in Serbia.
Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic said that should it happen, the survival of Serbia-Montenegro in its current state would be impossible.
He finds it impossible to have "a monarchy and a republic" functioning within a single state.
Decision Bans Phosphate Detergents in Macedonia
Macedonia's lakes have been facing a growing problem with phosphorus pollution.
A new ban on phosphorus-based detergents may help.
By Marija Lazarova for Southeast European Times in Skopje -- 26/05/05
Officials at OHIS -- the only Macedonian plant producing non-phosphate detergents -- say they are ready to enforce the new regulations. [OHIS]
As part of efforts towards protecting the country's natural resources, Macedonia's environment and physical planning ministry has issued a decision banning the production, sale and use of detergents containing phosphate levels of more than 0.5 per cent.
The rule goes into effect on 1 June.
Five months later, on 1 November, a ban on the import of such detergents will become applicable -- potentially affecting international producers such as Proctor & Gamble, Henkel and Saponia.
"Decreasing phosphate levels in detergents is not the only measure to protect water from aging," Environment Minister Zoran Sapuric said. "But for Macedonia, where a small part of communal waste water is purified, this is the most economic and fastest way for its protection."
Up to 50 per cent of phosphorus in the water in three Macedonian lakes -- Prespa, Ohrid and Dojran -- come from phosphate detergents.
Phosphorus levels in one of the lakes, Prespa, has reached alarming levels in recent years, according to experts.
"Detergents often contain a 30 per cent solution, including phosphorus, which is harmful for ecosystems … it contributes to an abundant growth of flora, thus interrupting the ecosystem and making surface waters become swamps," says Professor Josif Tanevski, the head of a study on the issue.
The rule also complies with EU standards.
Phosphate detergents have long been prohibited in member states of the Union.
Phosphorus will be replaced with zeolite, a substance that provides the same quality but without harming the environment.
Currently, only one Macedonian firm, OHIS, is producing eco-friendly detergents.
"We have invested 520,000 euros for adjusting the stations for production of non-phosphate detergents," says OHIS director Jorgo Kjuka. "Eco-gong is the first non-phosphate detergent in Macedonia and we have been producing it for three years now."

EUFOR Officially Replaces SFOR in BiH
NATO's peacekeeping mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina was officially transferred to a EU-led force at a ceremony Thursday.
At the same time, NATO opened a permanent headquarters in Sarajevo.

A ceremony held Thursday (2 December) at Camp Butmir in Sarajevo officially marked the handover of the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) from NATO's SFOR to the EU's EUFOR, as well as the opening of a permanent NATO Headquarters in Sarajevo (NHQSa).
US Army Brigadier General Steven Schook -- the last commander of SFOR and the first commander of NHQSa -- covered the SFOR flag and uncovered the NATO flag as the first EUFOR commander, British Royal Army Major General David Leakey, uncovered the EU flag.
The BiH Armed Forces Honour Unit took part in the ceremony, making its first official public appearance.
The ceremony was attended by dignitaries from BiH, NATO and the EU, including NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer and EU security chief Javier Solana.
Both said that SFOR had fulfilled its Dayton Agreement task of ensuring a safe and secure environment in BiH.
At the press conference following the ceremony, Solana said BiH would eventually join EU institutions.
When that will happen, he added, depends on the people of BiH.
"Today the EU assumed a new responsibility in your country ... that will be done with the same spirit and with the same efficiency as our predecessors from NATO," Solana said. "We gather here to look to the future but without forgetting the lessons of the past."
"Today is truly a day for celebration -- for BiH, and also for the wider international community," de Hoop Scheffer said. He added that the country has made significant progress
NATO's longest-running peacekeeping mission lasted nine years and included more than 500,000 troops from 43 countries.
The force has been assisting the BiH authorities with disarmament, the destruction of illegal weapons, and the hunt for war crimes indictees.
With 150 officers in Camp Butmir, the NHQSa will continue to support BiH defence reforms and undertake operational supporting tasks, including counterterrorism activities and the detention of persons wanted by UN war crimes tribunal.
EUFOR's mission, code-named Althea, will include 7,000 troops from 33 countries, of which 22 are EU member states.
It will have the same mandate as SFOR.
Lord Paddy Ashdown, whose duties as international community high representative are being transferred to the post of EU Special Representative in BiH, will be the political head of the EU's engagement in BiH.
EUFOR's primary responsibility will be to ensure a secure environment.
Its peacekeepers will support BiH authorities in countering organised crime and detaining war crimes indictees.
Chairman of the BiH presidency Borislav Paravac expressed his gratitude to NATO troops and his support for EU forces.
He said their help is necessary given the country's effort to join Euro-Atlantic institutions.
Peace Support Operations Training Centre Opens in BiH
A new Peace Support Operations Training Centre opened this month at Camp Butmir in Sarajevo.
It is the first international defence-related institution in Bosnia and Herzegovina in which members of the country's armed forces work shoulder to shoulder with their colleagues from partner nations.

With help of the UK and 11 donor countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) officially opened the international Peace Support Operations Training Centre (PSOTC) on 14 April at Camp Butmir in Sarajevo.
The centre, headed by Danish Army Brigadier General Henning Broechmann-Larsen, will deliver world-class peace support operations training for BiH and foreign officers.
The aim of the centre is to instil future leaders with leadership skills and a military ethos based on internationally accepted peace support operations doctrine.
The first course was held between 7 February and 1 April, and was attended by 32 officers from BiH as well as six from partner countries.
"It is the first international defence-related institution in BiH in which members of the BiH Armed Forces work shoulder to shoulder with their colleagues from the partner nations," said BiH Defence Minister Nikola Radovanovic at the opening ceremony. "Training that PSOTC offers enable us to improve, both in quantity and quality, the contribution of BiH to international peace and stability, which is one of the three main missions of the armed forces."
BiH recently deployed its 5th rotation of nine military observers in the UN peace support operation in Ethiopia and Eritrea, and five military observers in the 3rd rotation to the UN mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, while preparing the explosive ordnance disposal unit to be deployed in Iraq.
"These activities show that BiH has been increasingly taking its responsibilities as a member of the international community," said Radovanovic.
The PSOTC will provide three eight-week training courses a year for lieutenants, captains and some junior majors.
There will be up to 40 students per course, of which approximately 25 per cent will be international students.
The principal course is the Peace Support Operations (PSO) Staff Course.
Other courses will be developed, such as specialist seminars for senior officers and new courses and seminars that are of benefit to the BiH Armed Forces or other parts of the BiH security sector.
Directing staff come from partner nations, while five military officers are drawn from BiH.
"We would like to see this centre mature into a centre that also trains officers from the neighbouring countries in peace support operations," said Broechmann-Larsen. "In that respect, I am very pleased that Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia-Montenegro, Albania and Macedonia all have accepted the invitation to send young officers to be trained in PSO here."
The estimated construction cost of the PSOTC is 3m euros.
The UK led the project, with donor support from Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States.
In several years, the BiH Armed Forces will gradually assume the lead role in directing the PSOTC.
EU Green Lights Textile Agreement With Serbia
Belgrade and the EU recently signed an agreement that paves the way for Serbia to multiply its textile export levels.
The deal is the first practical example of the double-track approach adopted by the EU towards Serbia-Montenegro.

Belgrade and the EU signed a textile agreement in Brussels at the end of last month, establishing a quota-free regime for Serbia's textile exports to the EU, and allowing Serbia to multiply its textile export levels, which reached around 119.4m euros last year.
The deal goes into effect on 1 July.
According to Serbian International Economic Relations Minister Milan Parivodic, one of the signatories, it has great political significance.
"We see a positive trend in Serbia's political and economic development.
This should reflect on a better and more stable economic situation in Serbia," Parivodic said.
The agreement, which Serbia signed independently, represents the first practical example of the double-track approach to Serbia-Montenegro, approved by the EU last year, under which Brussels is allowing the two constituent republics to pursue separate economic development paths as they move towards membership in the Union.
According to Parivodic, Serbia's textile industry makes up about 7 per cent of the republic's GDP, while 70 per cent of Serbia's textile goods are exported to EU countries.
Previously, the EU applied a certain quota regime for several types of textile goods from Serbia, but that regime covered only 25 per cent of exported goods.
Under the new agreement, the remaining 75 per cent will also be exported to the EU free of customs barriers.
The local textile industry can now compete on level ground with neighbouring countries, the minister said. "It is a good message, and I believe that third-party finishing jobs are the real thing for this market.
We cannot produce textiles and compete with Bangladesh, Pakistan, India or China, but we can compete with ready-made apparel -- that is our competitive edge.
This is where I see a chance provided by the agreement, which should be an engine for kickstarting the textile industry," he said.
It is estimated that Serbia's textile industry could reach the 1991 export and third-party manufacturing levels of $1 billion in only a few years, through co-operation with the EU.
To accomplish this, Serbian textile producers must find serious partners and resume old business ties.
It will be up to the management of individual factories to decide how best to take advantage of the opportunity presented by the agreement.
Many economic analysts believe that Serbia has the potential to attract significant foreign investments in its textile sector, as production continues to move from Western Europe to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, where wages are lower.
At the same time, the living standards of those employed in the textile industry are expected to rise.
Serbia's textile sector employs around 100,000, which means that as many as 300,000 people depend on the industry.

KFOR commander: "There will be no security vacuum in Kosovo"
While Kosovo institutions are handling more responsibilities, KFOR remains committed to providing a safe environment.
No premature steps will be taken, Genreal Markus Bentler told SETimes.
By Linda Karadaku for Southeast European Times in Pristina -- 19/03/10
Currently, the security situation in Kosovo is quiet and stable, KFOR Commander General Markus Bentler says. [KFOR]
There are nearly 9,800 NATO soldiers in Kosovo, from 25 Alliance nations and seven non-Alliance countries known collectively as KFOR.
The troops have won and maintained the respect of the local population.
Their current commander -- German Lieutenant General Markus Bentler -- insists that KFOR will continue "to provide security for all the people of Kosovo, by close co-operation with local authorities and international organisations".
In an exclusive interview with SETimes, Bentler discussed how KFOR would work to meet that goal.
SETimes: NATO has reduced its forces in Kosovo to just under 10,000.
Is that enough for the work to be done?
Lieutenant General Markus J Bentler: At the moment, KFOR considers the security situation in Kosovo as quiet and stable.
The current adaptation of troop numbers is a sign of confidence.
In order to uphold the high level of flexibility and capability to react to any threat to the safe and secure environment, KFOR is regularly conducting exercises in all parts of Kosovo.
In the process of troop adaptation, no premature or irresponsible steps will be taken and there will be no security vacuum in Kosovo.
SETimes: How are your relations with the Kosovo Security Force?
How would you define the force?
Bentler: The Kosovo Security Force (KSF) is a non-military, lightly-armed, multiethnic, bi-gender disaster relief organisation.
It will provide unique capabilities for emergency response, explosive ordnance disposal and civil protection.
The KSF has already proved its growing competence as a civil protection and humanitarian aid organisation by conducting operations in Albania during recent flooding.
There is a substantial interest by representatives of different minority communities in joining this multiethnic force.
SETimes: You temporarily suspended co-operation with the KSF.
Why?
Bentler: [On March 6th], KFOR temporarily suspended support, mentoring and training activities of KSF. This action [lasting a week] was taken in response to the appearance of an armed, military-style KSF honour guard during the Martyrs' Commemoration Ceremony on March 6th.
This is inconsistent with the non-military status of the KSF.
The NATO flag was also flown during the ceremony.
This is not acceptable, as KFOR is status neutral.
SETimes: How was the relationship repaired?
Bentler: Following the suspension of KFOR's support to the Kosovo Security Force, the president and prime minister worked with [KFOR command] to satisfactorily resolve the issues in question.
The new agreement covers the use of the Kosovo Security Force ceremonial unit, which will be displayed using demilitarised weapons when agreed upon.
It was reaffirmed that the Kosovo Security Force will have no defence or military role, as that duty is undertaken by KFOR.
We resumed training and mentoring on March 10th.
SETimes: KFOR is still guarding some Kosovo Serb sites of religious and historic importance.
When will the Kosovo multiethnic police be able to take care of that job?
Bentler: The local institutions are ready to take on more and more responsibility.
One key element of KFOR's mission is to strengthen local security institutions so that they take over security tasks progressively, in accordance with their proven capabilities.
Preservation of religious and cultural heritage sites within Kosovo as valuable properties is a responsibility for all the people of Kosovo, while preserving them falls within KFOR's responsibility to provide a safe and secure environment.
The Kosovo Police (KP) are ready to take over responsibility for police tasks formerly implemented by KFOR.
In general, KFOR co-ordinates relevant aspects of its mission with the institutions in Kosovo and liaises with the KP through EULEX.
EULEX is responsible to monitor, mentor and advise the KP.
We have seen that the Kosovo Police are capable and willing to execute many tasks.
To give an example, one could mention the good job the KP did providing security during the recent municipal elections.
KFOR maintains contact with all agencies relevant for security issues on a regular basis, including, for example, the KP, EULEX and respective ministries.
SETimes: Is Serbia a military threat to Kosovo?
Bentler: KFOR doesn't see any threat from outside Kosovo.
KFOR's area of responsibility is limited by the Kosovo Administrative Boundary Line [ABL] and we are committed to providing a safe and secure environment, as well as freedom of movement for all of Kosovo. Under UN Security Council Resolution 1244, KFOR provides the same degree of security all over Kosovo.
We stay impartial and never take part in or comment on political issues, as long as they do not [threaten] a safe and secure environment.
SETimes: Are the parallel, Belgrade-supported structures in the north a threat to overall security?
Bentler: The existence of parallel structures is a political issue.
In line with its mandate, KFOR is providing stable security conditions, in which political questions can and should be solved by the relevant stakeholders.
Any duplication [or] mirroring of administrative structures is of no value.
It can, on the contrary, lead to undesirable results or even spoil the effects of both structures.
If, for example, a single judicial system does not exist, legal security or clarity on justice issues cannot be provided.
The political misuse of so-called "parallel structures", as well as related political agitation, can be a threat to a safe and secure environment and therefore is not tolerated by KFOR.
Therefore, KFOR also closely monitors the situation in the areas where the so-called parallel structures operate in order to react if any threat to the safe and secure environment should arise.
KFOR is in close contact with all relevant international and local stakeholders and supports their search for political solutions within the framework of its mandate.
Should the safe and secure environment of the people in Kosovo be threatened, KFOR would be ready to take appropriate measures to counter this threat.
SETimes: How do you control the border with Serbia in the north?
Bentler: KFOR has very good co-operation with the neighbouring countries [including] the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Albania, Montenegro, but also a very good technical co-operation with Serbia, concerning the administrative boundary line.
We have regular meetings with Serbia on a technical level.
We control the boundary with [KFOR and KP] and synchronised (KFOR/Serb Forces) patrols.
Control of persons and goods crossing the borders is a police task and does not concern KFOR.
How these tasks will be executed along the administrative boundary line will be agreed between the relevant actors as well.
KFOR will only get involved if and when the security of the people in Kosovo is jeopardised.
SETimes: Most people in Kosovo continue to trust KFOR more then any other local body.
Yet there are soldiers in KFOR from countries that have not recognised Kosovo as a state.
Is that a problem?
Bentler: [Recognition] does not influence KFOR's mandate or the position of the mission as a whole regarding the status of Kosovo.
About the cognition of the local population I believe that KFOR, as an expression of a credible Alliance, is perceived only and solely as a homogeneous unit.
KFOR soldiers are always committed to the impartial stance of our organisation.
SETimes: Kosovo has clearly expressed its aspiration for Euro-Atlantic integration.
How do you see the prospect for Kosovo integration into these Euro-Atlantic structures?
Bentler: KFOR is not actively involved in resolving the status question.
It refrains from participating in any discussions of political issues.
SETimes: How do you see the prospects for Kosovo in general?
Bentler: I am very optimistic.
Over the recent ten years together we have achieved a lot, particularly in the field of security.
This is the prerequisite for progress in other areas: economy and political development.
KFOR continues to provide the support that is needed, buying valuable time for the remaining challenges to be solved in a peaceful manner.
EU-member nations making slow progress on education targets, EC says
Bloc members have achieved only one of five education benchmarks that the EU wants met by the end of the decade.
Progress towards the other four has been moderate, the European Commission concluded in a recent report.
By Svetla Dimitrova for Southeast European Times in Sofia -- 28/01/08

Further efforts are needed over the next three years if EU-member nations are to achieve all five education benchmarks that they agreed on in 2002, according to a progress report the European Commission (EC) issued in October.
Noting that only one of the targets has been accomplished, Brussels warned that meeting the rest of the goals remains a serious challenge for education and training systems in Europe.
During a March 2000 meeting in Lisbon, EU leaders agreed on a strategy to make the bloc "the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-driven economy by 2010".
As part of efforts towards achieving that goal, common objectives for improving the education and training systems in Europe were outlined in 2002.
The five benchmarks include reducing the dropout rate to 10%, cutting by least 20% the percentage of low-achieving pupils in reading literacy and ensuring that at least 85% of young people will complete upper secondary education.
The other two targets involve an at least 15% increase in the number of tertiary graduates in Mathematics, Science and Technology (MST), and steps to reduce the gender imbalance and create conditions for 12.5% of the adult population to participate in lifelong learning.
Based largely on 2005 statistics, the EC annual report on progress towards meeting the Lisbon objectives in education concluded that the Union has succeeded in meeting only the benchmark for MST graduates, whose number has increased by over 170,000, or more than 25%, since 2000.
"If present trends continue, over 1 million students will graduate in mathematics, science and technology in the EU in 2010, compared to the present (2005) level of 860,000 graduates per year," the EC said.
The best-performing countries in terms of MST graduates per 1,000 people in the 20-29 age group are Ireland (24.5), France (22.5), and Lithuania (18.9) -- while Slovakia, Poland, Portugal, and Italy showed the strongest growth, ranging from about 70% to nearly 100%.
But little progress had been made towards reducing the gender imbalance among MST graduates, the report said, citing a mere 0.4% increase in the proportion of female graduates -- from 30.8% in 2000 to 31.2% in 2005.
The four best performers as regards gender balance were Estonia, Bulgaria, Greece and Romania, where females account for more than 40% of all MST graduates.
The ratio is highest in EU candidate Macedonia, at 46.9% in 2005.
Gender equality in education is lacking, the report says. [EU]
With progress in the four other areas still sluggish, however, the EC warned that unless significantly greater efforts are made, "a high share of the next generation will be at risk of social exclusion, at great cost to themselves, the economy and society."
Continuous improvements have contributed to a 2.3% decrease in the number of early school dropouts since 2000.
But at an EU average of 15.3% in 2006, their share was still high and showed that faster progress is needed to ensure that no more than 10% of students will be leaving school prematurely by the end of the decade.
"The European objective is to encourage young people to remain in education or training after the end of compulsory education and to obtain at least upper secondary education," said the report.
"Educational attainment of at least this level is understood as the minimum necessary for active participation in the knowledge-based economy."
Slovenia (5.2%), the Czech Republic (5.5%), Poland (5.6%), Slovakia (6.4%), Finland (8.3%) and Austria (9.6%), along with Norway (5.9%), which is not a member of the EU, have met or surpassed the target for 2010. Croatia, which hopes to join the EU by that year, is also among Europe's best performers, with a drop-out level of 5.3% in 2006.
Malta and Portugal were cited as the bloc's worst performers on this indicator, with rates of 41.7% and 39.2%, respectively.
No progress has been made towards achieving the benchmark to slash the percentage of low-achieving 15-year-olds in reading literacy.
In fact, the share of low achievers grew from 19.4% in 2000 to 19.8% in 2003, suggesting most EU members have a long way to go to ensure that by the end of the decade, fewer than 15.5% of their 15-year-olds will belong to that group.
The bloc's best performers, according to 2003 statistics, are Finland (5.7%) and Ireland (11%).
"Acquiring basic competences is a first step to participation in the knowledge-based society," the EC noted in October.
"However, at the age of 15 about 1 million out of 5 million pupils in the EU are low performers in reading literacy."

The EC report also showed that there has been insufficient progress towards achievement of the benchmark, requiring that at least 85% of 22-year-olds in the EU should have completed at least upper secondary education by 2010.
"The share of young people who have completed upper-secondary education in the EU is below 80% and has only slightly improved since 2000," the Commission said.
With rates of above or close to the 90% mark, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia are the bloc's top performers, while Portugal, Malta and Spain are its worst in this area.
In 2002, EU nations agreed that the percentage of population aged 25-64 participating in lifelong learning should reach 12.5% in 2010, viewing this as fundamental for the competitiveness and economic prosperity of the Union, as well as for the social inclusion, employability and the personal fulfilment of people.
Denmark, Britain and Finland are well ahead of other member states in this regard.
The percentage of the working age population participating in education and training last year amounted to 29.2%, 26.6% and 23.1%, respectively, well above the 9.6% EU average.
Bulgaria and Romania were the bloc's worst performers with a rate of 1.3% each, behind Greece with 1.9%.
"Top-quality education and training is vital if Europe is to develop as a knowledge society and compete effectively in the globalising world economy," EU Commissioner for Education, Training, Culture and Youth Jan Figel said as the EC released its annual assessment.
"Regrettably, this report shows that the member states need to redouble their efforts to make the EU's education and training meet the challenges of the 21st century.
The message to policy makers in the member states is clear: we need more efficient investment in our human capital."
Leading Romanian clerics suspected of collaboration with former secret police
Files of 16 top Romanian clerics were burned in 1989 as part of a cover-up, a member of a panel studying Securitate archives said on Tuesday.

The files of 16 senior clerics were burned during the 1989 anti-communist revolution in Romania to prevent their links to the country's former secret police, Securitate, from being revealed, a Romanian official said on Tuesday (August 28th).
"Their files were burned in December 1989 so that their names could be covered up," Mircea Dinescu, a member of the National Council for Studying the Securitate Archives (CNSAS), told reporters.
Ahead of the September 12th election of a new Romanian patriarch to succeed Teoctist, who died on July 30th, the council announced its plans to review the files of all top clerics and publish the names of those found to have collaborated with the former secret police.
"One of them will be the patriarch of the Orthodox Church and it would be a shame to discover later that he's a Securitate general," Dinescu said on August 9th.
He officially confirmed Tuesday that Nicolae Corneanu, the head of the Banat Metropolitan Church and a member of the Holy Synod, and Constantin Balaceanu-Stolnici, an academic and member of the electoral college that will choose the next patriarch, had collaborated with the secret police.
Both have previously acknowledged this.
A total of 20 high-ranking Orthodox clerics, including potential candidates for the patriarchal post, are suspected of ties with Securitate, Dinescu said, noting that there is solid evidence of involvement of up to four of those priests in secret police activities.
"Of what we've checked out so far, there are three or four whose situation is pretty clear, and there are 16 others for whom we only have suspicions," the Romanian daily Ziua quoted the former anti-communist dissident as saying Tuesday.
Several church leaders reportedly will be called to hearings at the CNSAS in the coming days in connection with their communist pasts.
The archbishop of Suceava and Radauti, Pimen Zainea, the archbishop of Alba Iulia, Andrei Andreicut, and the bishop of Arad, Timotei Seviciu, will be among those to be heard first.
"There are indications that these priests had ties with the Securitate and that, following their collaboration, they were nominated to higher posts within the church structures," an unnamed CNSAS source told the Romanian English-language daily Nine o'Clock.
Dinescu angered the Orthodox Church earlier this month by telling the daily Cotidianul that the late head of the Transylvania Church, Antonie Plamadeala, had been a Securitate officer.
He even cited a letter the cleric sent to Romania's communist dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu, asking him to be promoted from colonel to general.
Plamadeala died in 2005.
An AP report Tuesday said at least 700,000 people are believed to have worked for Securitate as informers.
Earlier this month, a local NGO urged senior clerics with Securitate links not to run for the patriarchal post in a country where the Orthodox Church is still considered the most trustworthy institution.
The 52-member Holy Synod will pick the candidates for the post.
Teoctist's successor will then be elected via secret ballot by a church assembly including Orthodox clergy, lay people and several politicians.

Gul elected as Turkey's 11th President
The new head of state pledged to uphold Turkey's secular system.

Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul is Turkey's new president, succeeding Ahmet Necdet Sezer.
Parliament elected him Tuesday (August 28th) in a third round of voting.
Gul, a member of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), won two earlier rounds but fell short of the necessary two-thirds majority.
In the third round, however, a simple majority was enough.
Two other candidates sought the post.
Sabahattin Cakmakoglu of the Nationalist Action Party (MHP) received 70 votes, and Tayfun Icli from Democratic Left Party (DSP) received 13.
There were two invalid and 24 blank votes as well.
"I am fully aware of the difficulty of my task," the new president said in his acceptance speech.
Gul, 56, is a devout Muslim and a former member of the now banned Welfare Party.
However, he has pledged to uphold the secular system in Turkey and to be everyone's president.
"In a democracy which is a system of rights and liberties, secularism, one of the core principles of our Republic, is as much a model that underpins freedom for different lifestyles as it is a rule of social harmony," he said. "Not only that; commitment to the principle of secularism is also the most expedient way of eliminating from the outset conflicts and elements of altercation that from time to time manifest themselves in every society."
"When we think about the realities and sensitivities inherent to our geography, we will better comprehend the significance of the principle of secularism which also guarantees the freedom of religion and conscience," the new head of state added.
US President George W. Bush, German President Horst Koehler and German Minister of Foreign Affairs Frank Walter Steinmeier were among the world leaders who have congratulated Gul on his election.
The president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), Rene van der Linden, was one of the first international officials to make a statement.
"I warmly welcome the election of our former colleague, Abdullah Gul.
He is a modern reformer and I am confident that he will be a president for all Turks," van der Linden said.
Gul is "very well acquainted with European and international affairs and I am confident he will succeed in bringing his country closer to the EU as well as further developing the role of Turkey as an important player in the international arena," he added.
US Ambassador to Turkey Ross Wilson also congratulated Gul.
"Once again, Turkey's commitment to democratic institutions and the rule of law has proven durable and strong," Wilson said. "We know President Gul well and worked closely with him throughout his tenure as prime minister and then foreign minister.
We look forward to continuing to work with him on issues of importance to both of our countries."
As foreign minister, Gul is best known for his role in launching Turkey's accession talks with the EU.
A key member of the ruling party, he also helped pass reforms and improve the country's human rights record.
He has said he will cut ties with the AKP after assuming the presidency.
Germany's Schroeder, Noting More To Be Done, Supports EU-BiH Talks
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said Tuesday that the EU should open talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina soon, given the country's progress in post-conflict reforms.

Hailing Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) progress in post-conflict reforms, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said Tuesday (3 May) that the EU should launch talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the country soon.
"In my opinion it would be justified that the European Commission (EC) decides to kick off negotiations," the German leader said after meeting BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic in Sarajevo.
He also met with members of the BiH presidency, High Representative Paddy Ashdown and EUFOR Commander General David Leakey.
An EC team is due to arrive in BiH on 19 May to review the country's progress in meeting a set of 16 requirements spelled out in its feasibility study.
A positive assessment would likely lead to a decision next month by the EU to open the SAA talks, seen as a first step towards eventual membership.
BiH is the only country in the Balkans that has not yet been given the go-ahead on the road to EU accession.
Noting BiH's achievements in the areas of judicial and administrative reform over the past two years, Schroeder also praised the country for recent positive steps in the area of police reform, a key requirement set by the EU.
Last week, the leaders of 11 parliamentary parties reached an important agreement on the core principles of police restructuring in BiH and are expected to complete negotiations on a deal before the arrival of the EC working group.
Schroeder also welcomed recent efforts to fulfil another major requirement, full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
However, he noted, "There is more to be done."
Nine Bosnian Serb war crimes indictees have surrendered to the ICTY since January.
But two of the UN tribunal's two most wanted indictees -- wartime Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander, Ratko Mladic -- remain at large.
BiH's entry into the EU would be unimaginable until Karadzic and Mladic are brought to justice, Germany's Deutsche Welle commented.
"The association with Europe will be a lengthy process but important because it should clearly show that it makes sense and that it is the only way forward," Schroeder said Tuesday.
He also offered German expert assistance in drafting BiH's new constitution and economic reforms.
Welcoming Schroeder's strong backing for BiH's EU bid, Terzic pledged that his country would work actively to become a leader in securing stability in the Balkans.
"This is the strongest support for what we have done so far and an enormous stimulus for the remaining reforms," Reuters quoted Terzic as saying.
Different Voices in Serbia Weigh in on Kosovo's Future
As Belgrade and Pristina gear up for the anticipated start of talks on Kosovo's final status later this year, Serbian politicians differ over what stance to take.

As the momentum builds towards the launch of talks on Kosovo's final status, Serbian political figures are expressing different views on the future of the province.
Former Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Affairs Minister Goran Svilanovic, a member of the International Commission for the Balkans, recently said it would be best for the whole region if Kosovo achieves independence with the Commission's report forseeing "strong guarantees of Serb and other minority rights," Svilanovic said.
Backing independence, however, remains a controversial stance within Serbia, and Svilanovic quickly came under attack by other political figures and the media.
Serbian President Boris Tadic declared that while a return to Serbian rule in Kosovo was out of the question, Belgrade would continue to oppose outright independence.
"That would raise instability in the region," Tadic said, including neighbouring countries.
Certainly, a vigorous discussion is under way.
But according to one analyst, Belgrade University political science professor Aleksandar Mitic, Serbian leaders have yet to formulate a clear platform or come up with arguments to support their position, opting instead to repeat the slogan "no independence!" A similar situation exists in Pristina, says Kosovo Albanian political leader Veton Suroi, except that the stance is reversed.
"Our negotiating platform is not particularly brilliant -- it begins with independence and ends with independence.
But in between not many premises have been formulated," Suroi told Radio B92 last month.
Despite their seemingly irreconcilable positions on independence, however, both sides do have areas of agreement.
They agree, for example, that the present status quo cannot be maintained much longer, and that minority rights is a crucial issue.
Furthermore, Serbs and Kosovo Albanians alike are looking ahead to a future within the EU.
In a recent interview with a Kosovo television station, UNMIK head Soeren Jessen-Petersen said he believes talks on Kosovo's final status could begin at the end of September or early October, and will involve Kosovo Albanian representatives, their Serbian counterparts and an international presence.
Three principles will form the basis for discussion -- no return to the pre-March 1999 situation, no division of Kosovo, and no unification with a neighbouring territory.
"What is clear is that Belgrade and Pristina will be the most important and most active participants.
But nobody expects Belgrade and Pristina to agree on their own.
An international presence in the talks is necessary.
This presence is still being discussed, but the final decision remains the UN Security Council's responsibility.
It will adopt a resolution that will define the final status of Kosovo," Jessen-Petersen told Koha Vision TV on 27 April.
New Turkish constitution in the making
Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party says a new basic law will broaden personal freedoms and bring the country closer to the EU.
(Zaman - 05/09/07; Reuters, Zaman, Turkish Daily News - 04/09/07; AP - 03/09/07; The New York Times - 02/09/07; Zaman - 30/08/07)

By the end of this year, Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) will be ready to present a new "civilian constitution", intended to replace the one adopted two years after the 1980 military coup.
Simpler and shorter than the existing one, the new constitution will broaden personal freedoms, while clipping the powers of the president and the army, and will help remove some obstacles on the country's path towards EU membership, according to a report in the Turkish daily Zaman on Wednesday (September 5th).
Stressing the importance of freedom of expression, Brussels has repeatedly urged Turkey to change or annul the controversial Article 301 in its penal code, which has led to a number of trials against prominent intellectuals, accused of "insulting Turkishness".
Among those who have faced prosecution are Orhan Pamuk, winner of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Literature, and Hrant Dink, a prominent Turkish-Armenian journalist, who was killed earlier this year.
According to Zaman, the constitution the AKP plans to propose will provide that international treaties and conventions Turkey has signed will have supremacy over national legislation.
This will allow local courts to ask the Constitutional Court to annul national legislation contradicting such international agreements, the daily explained.
The draft also envisions changes that will affect the Constitutional Court itself.
The number of its members will grow from 11 to 17, of which nine will be appointed by parliament and eight by the president, who currently appoints all judges on the court.
The constitutional draft would also grant the president immunity, but would take away from him "the leadership of the National Security Council," according to a senior AKP official.
Meanwhile, the parliamentary immunity currently enjoyed by Turkish lawmakers will be curbed.
The army is also likely to see some of its powers cut, in line with EU standards.
According to Reuters, the head of the armed forces would no longer report to the prime minister directly, but to the defence minister.
Announcing the completion of work on the first draft, AKP deputy leader Dengir Mir Mehmet Firat told reporters on Monday that talks on the document within the party would be "concluded next week".
"After the second round, a draft will be ready to introduce to our people, universities, political parties, media, and nongovernmental organisations for further discussions and contributions," he said. "A special website will be a platform for interactive discussions on the new constitution."
He expected the public debate on the new charter to last for more than three months, after which all views and proposals will be considered before the final version is prepared.
Other parties can submit their own proposals, said Firat.
"But whichever draft is approved by parliament is the one we will take to a referendum to ask the people to approve," he said, denying reports that the AKP is planning to include clauses in the constitution to lift the ban on wearing the Muslim headscarf in universities.
Serbia to host regional emergency centre
In an interview with Southeast European Times, Serbian Interior Ministry Emergency Situations Sector chief Predrag Maric emphasises that the Nis project has no military component.
Countries to take part will soon be announced at a Belgrade summit.

On Wednesday (February 17th), Belgrade will hold a conference for interior ministers from nations across Southeast Europe.
Each participating country will review its role in creating the regional centre in southeastern Serbia as well as what protocols to follow in response to natural disasters and other significant problems.
Serbian Interior Ministry Emergency Situations Sector chief Predrag Maric told Southeast European Times that the centre will help neighbouring states co-ordinate responses to fires, floods and earthquakes.
Scheduled to open in 2012, the centre has the backing of Russia according to documents signed last year by Serbian Interior Minister Ivica Dacic and Sergei Shoigu, Russia's minister for emergency situations.
SETimes: When can we expect the Nis centre to start operating and what activities will it undertake?
Predrag Maric: The centre is to be completed by 2012, but it is likely that new contents will be introduced one by one by that time until the centre takes its final shape.
The idea is to make Nis, due to its favourable geographic position and the possibility of reaching various other locations quickly, the centre for emergency situations in Southeast Europe.
What countries will be involved will be revealed after the February 17th [conference].
Apart from the former Yugoslav republics, we also expect the participation of ministers from Italy, Greece, Cyprus and Albania.
There has been a lot of unchecked information about the centre … that a military base is being opened, which is absolutely not true.
The idea is to hold regional training in Nis and to make it a centre where experts will gather and be sent [when] needed in crisis situations … to have more [expertise] and different teams, such as mine clearing teams and rescue teams for cases of floods, earthquakes and ruins.
If you have to evacuate half of a town, where will you relocate all those people?
You must have emergency accommodation facilities, tents, power units, kitchens … all that will be located in Nis.
SETimes: What is the current quality of regional co-operation in Southeast Europe in regards to severe emergency situations?
Maric: We [have] never paid any attention to ethnicity in the emergency situation sector.
Co-operation with other countries of the region is good and we hope the opening of the centre in Nis will enhance it further.
Every country in the region is special and is individually [expert] in certain areas.
All that we are good at should be joined together.
SETimes: In late 2009, Serbia passed a new Law on Emergency Situations.
What is new in that law?
Maric: Serbia was facing outdated [legislation] adjusted to a completely different state, which has long ceased to exist -- Yugoslavia.
We had a law on protection from natural disasters dating back to 1977, with an image of Tito in Article 5; and the law on protection from fires from 1988.
There was no single institution that would handle protection of citizens in cases of natural disasters.
Attempts to get a new law on protection in emergency situations took five years and the law was finally passed right before the end of 2009.
The law introduces a system [for reacting] to emergency situations and a single service for those activities.
The act also foresees close co-operation between local governments and the Interior Ministry's sector for emergency situations.
Mayors and members of headquarters for emergency situations, which will now be formed in all municipalities and towns, will have to undergo training for planning reactions to emergency situations.
The law is based on prevention, so that we no longer have major disasters such as the flood in the village of Jasa Tomic and the explosion in the Uzice-based weapons factory Prvi Partizan, where seven lives were lost. [The centre] will have its own budget for the first time, within the Interior Ministry's budget.
SETimes: An extensive reform of the sector for emergency situations is currently under way.
How long will that last?
Maric: By reforming the sector, we want to demonstrate that we can do a great deal before joining the EU.
The new law has opened the way for introducing the single European telephone number for emergency situations, 112.
We expect the first activities to be carried out [by the end] of this year.
The single European emergency telephone number is to be introduced in large cities first, primarily in Belgrade, and then in the rest of the country.
The project will take three to four years.
SETimes: What, in your opinion, is the biggest problem facing Serbia in the sector for emergency situations?
Maric: Serbia has 3,000 firemen, but it should have 7,000.
Interest has been growing over the past six months during which the emergency service started to form.
We are now able to accept 300 people this year and we will send them to those units in which the situation is the most critical.
Kosovo, EULEX to discuss task force
A new task force targeting corruption and crime would be composed of local and international prosecutors and law enforcement.

The government of Kosovo has invited EULEX to begin talks about establishing a wide-ranging task force focused exclusively on organised crime and political corruption.
The offer was confirmed by EULEX spokesperson Karin Limdal on Thursday (February 11th).
That same day, the Kosovo daily Koha Ditore reported that the idea was discussed in meetings of the Joint Co-ordination Board for the Rule of Law, chaired by EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon and Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci.
The task force would be composed of local and international prosecutors, as well as a range of police officers.
"I believe this group will be established very soon," said Kuci. "It will have full financial and physical support."
The task force idea appears to be a response to the most recent meeting of the International Steering Group (ISG), which asked for quick progress in fighting such high-level crime in Kosovo.
In a report after its February 8th meeting in Vienna, the ISG said it believes "Kosovo urgently needs to make further progress in the fight against corruption, organised crime establishing the Rule of Law, including in northern Kosovo."
Laura Pula, a Kosovo prosecutor in the Pristina District Court, fully supports the idea, saying it is "more than important" -- it is crucial.
Based on their experiences ... they have achieved results," Pula told SETimes.
"The security has to be enhanced for those people who will be part of it; they will need more protection [because] they will work with very delicate cases."
Pula said the number of prosecutors should not only be increased, but those on the task force should be specialists assigned to specific areas such as corruption, drugs or human trafficking.
And, she warned, if the identity of prosecutors and detectives working on specific cases is not protected, their lives will be in danger.
"It should not become publicly known which prosecutor is working on what case," she said.
The Kosovo "Civil Society" group is especially in favour of the task force and its eventual success.
"We consider that corruption and organised crime are the main threats for Kosovo today," the group said in a February 9th statement.
"They are damaging the institutions of the country and our society in general, hindering the economic revival and touching the fragile democracy of Kosovo ... systematically and for sure, they are damaging our European future."

Southeast European Countries Resolute at Regional Summit
The leaders of Balkan countries declared their resolve to fight organised crime and to foster regional co-operation, at the summit of the Southeast Europe Co-operation Process in Belgrade.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 10/04/03
At the end of the summit of the Southeast Europe Co-operation Process (SEECP) in Belgrade, on Wednesday (9 April), the heads of state and government of nine countries in the region adopted a joint declaration.
It said that the aim of all countries in the region was to become members of the EU and to take part in shaping Europe's future.
The leaders of the Balkan countries advocated continued regional co-operation, especially in the fight against terrorism and organised crime.
They reiterated that joining European institutions remains a regional priority.
In the statement, the nine countries pledged to adhere to the principles of "inviolability of borders and peaceful settlement of disputes" and promised to work with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
At the same time, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia, Romania, Turkey, Serbia-Montenegro and Croatia said they want a swift end to the war in Iraq and advocated a peaceful solution to the crisis.
They maintain that the UN should play a central role in the Iraqi crisis, including humanitarian aid and the country's reconstruction.
The further liberalisation of visa regimes, the creation of a free trade zone in the Balkans and co-operation in telecommunications, transport and energy were declared priorities in regional co-operation.
Those attending the summit condemned organised crime, which they say undermines peace and stability in Southeastern Europe.
"We were deeply affected by the brutal murder of the Serbian premier, Dr. Zoran Djindjic.
We welcomed the steps taken by the Serbian government, aimed at the continued programme of reforms, and have promised lasting support.
We also welcomed the admission of Serbia-Montenegro into the Council of Europe," read their declaration.
Albanian President Alfred Moisiu called for development of regional co-operation in the EU and NATO integration efforts of the countries.
He said his country plays a vital role in securing regional stability and praised the SEECP initiative as a means of boosting political and economic development in the region.
European Commission Chairman Romano Prodi told those attending that the key to joining the EU is political will.
"No political agreement can eliminate or reduce the criteria needed for EU membership," he said Wednesday.
Prodi called on the countries of the region to co-operate, because this was the way for them to prepare for the European structures.
"The process of Europe's unification will not end until the Balkan countries accede to the Union," he said.
Croatian President Stipe Mesic said Wednesday that his country would file an application to join the SEECP shortly.
Croatia now has the status of observer in the investment and co-operation initiative, hoping to improve its relations with countries in the region.
For his part, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis, who also serves as chairman of the EU, discussed the June EU summit in Thessaloniki.
He said it would send "a strong message" that the Balkans remain the key priority and that the Union is dedicated to the eventual membership of all Balkan countries.
Remembering Kiro Gligorov
While the nation mourns one of its most distinguished politicians, some question his legacy.
By Misko Taleski for Southeast European Times in Skopje -- 04/01/12

Many grieved at the news that the first president of independent Macedonia, Kiro Gligorov, died on the first day of the new year.
But a debate has also opened up over his role in Macedonia's history.
Gligorov was buried without any state ceremony -- at his request -- the government recognised the late leader by proclaiming January 3rd a day of mourning.
"Gligorov uttered the now well-known maxim 'Macedonia is all we have', through which he carried the faith of our ancestors," President Gjorge Ivanov said at the commemorative session in parliament."We remember what Macedonia meant to him, and also to all of us."
But Gligorov also aroused anger in his country in 1994 when he told Greek media that the Macedonians are a Slavic people, having come to the Balkans in the 6th century, and have no connection to Alexander the Great and his civilisation.
"Yugoslavism was in Gligorov's blood; for 50 years he believed all Yugoslav peoples have the same Slavic roots," historian Violeta Achkovska told SETimes. "Gligorov's unfortunate statement about the alleged Slavic character of the Macedonian nation was based on that old and unfounded argument."
"He tried to save Yugoslavia to the last moment, [even] proposing a confederation with Bosnia's president Izetbegovic," she added.
During Gligorov's two terms as president, between 1991 and 1999, Macedonia became a member of the UN under the temporary reference "the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia", accepted the 1995 Interim Accord with Greece and underwent a controversial economic transition.
"Practically, we laid the foundations of the Macedonian state," former Parliament President Stoyan Andov told SETimes. "Those were dramatic times and Gligorov showed how to manage and undoubtedly has his place in contemporary Macedonian history."
In October 1995, Gligorov survived a car-bomb assassination attempt in downtown Skopje.
The police still have not uncovered who ordered or carried out the attack.
"It is a pity those involved in this terrorist act, in which I believe domestic structures such as Gligorov's close colleagues were also included, still haven't been caught.
Not a single internal affairs minister, including the most called upon, Ljubomir Frchkovski, uncovered the truth to bring the matter to an end.
This case should not be left unsolved," security expert Ivan Babamovski told SETimes.
Skopje resident Jordan Nikolov, 49, credits the late leader for steering his people out of the bloodshed that engulfed other parts of the former Yugoslavia as the communist state fell apart.
"If it were not for Gligorov and his team, primarily then Prime Minister Nikola Kljusev, it would have been hard to pull Macedonia out of the bloody Yugoslav drama without war.
Gligorov chose a wise policy in not to allowing a single bullet to be fired," he said. "Macedonia became the only republic to have peacefully proclaimed independence."
Minorities could play key role in new Kosovo government
Efforts to secure a parliamentary majority have put Serb representatives in the role of kingmaker.

Serbs and other ethnic minorities could play a decisive role in Kosovo's new parliament, which held its first session Monday (February 21st).
"The minorities won 25 seats in a 120 seat parliament. Thirteen of those belong to the Serb minority and ten may join the new governing coalition," Radio Free Europe Pristina bureau chief Arbana Vidishiqi told SETimes.
This makes the new government dependent on the vote of the Serb minority and the other minorities."
Incumbent Prime Minister Hashim Thaci's new cabinet is expected to have 16 ministries.
Outgoing Minister of Education Enver Hoxhaj told Klan Kosova on Monday night that it will also have four deputy prime ministers, one of them from the Serb community.
"With their good participation, Kosovo Serbs have created space to be a strong voice in the Kosovo parliament, because they will have seats they won, plus the seats reserved for them," analyst Krenar Gashi told SETimes.
Thaci, who has the mandate to form a new cabinet, will be at the head of an uneasy ruling coalition.
His Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK), which won 34 seats in the general election, was able to forge an agreement with businessman Behgjet Pacolli's Alliance for a New Kosovo (AKR) -- but only after protracted negotiations.
The AKR conditioned its participation on Pacolli becoming president, a demand which the PDK eventually had to accept.
At the weekend, Thaci's party also hammered out deals with the New Kosovo Alliance, the Independent Liberal Party, the Ibrahim Rugova List and minority lawmakers.
The new coalition will face energetic opposition from the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) and the nationalist Vetevendosja movement, which is now the third largest group in parliament.
The LDK has already sought to paint the new coalition as unrepresentative of Kosovars.
The new government "will be that of a political minority -- or, even worse, a government of ethnic minorities", media reports quoted a senior party official, Lutfi Haziri, as saying.
The Thaci administration -- along with Kosovo's political establishment in general -- can be expected to face continuing public pressure to tackle corruption and other institutional problems.
On Monday, a local NGO known as the the FOL Movement organised a protest outside the parliament building.
Demonstrators called on parliament to vote in a government that would have "clean hands", as well as a credible president who would unify the citizens by representing all.
Protestors threw soap and detergent outside the building, alluding to parliamentarians who are under investigation or suspicion.
One such controversial figure, Fatmir Limaj, spoke during a press conference held at the opening of the parliamentary session and announced he does not want to be part of the new cabinet while EULEX investigates the transportation ministry for corruption and fraud.
Limaj was head of that ministry under the previous government.
Romanian Olympic Team Has Moderate Hopes for Athens
Romania is sending a team of 112 athletes to the Olympic Games in Athens and hopes to win medals in gymnastics, canoe/kayak, fencing and shooting.

Romania's goal for the Athens Olympics is to be placed among the top 15 nations.
Its aspirations are more modest compared to four years ago. In 2000, Romanian athletes won 11 gold medals, and the country ranked 11th.
With the exception of its gymnasts, however, this year's Olympic team is facing age as a hurdle.
In women's gymnastics, Athens 2004 could provide a good opportunity for rising stars such as Catalina Ponor.
"No doubt, we are leaders in gymnastics, and we have some expectations in canoe/kayak, fencing, shooting -- sports where we are ranked quite well," said the president of the Romanian Olympic Committee, former tennis ace Ion Tiriac.
Olympic medallists Florin Popescu and Silviu Simioncencu could repeat their champion performances in canoeing and kayaking.
Fencers Laura Badea, who won gold at Atlanta in 1996, and Mihai Covaliu, gold medallist at the Sydney Games, are expected to place.
So is junior world champion Ana Maria Brinza.
In the shooting events, Romania will be represented by Olympic veteran Sorin Babii, who won the gold at Seoul in 1988, and by Iulian Raicea, a medallist at Sydney.
The team has already faced disappointments.
Swimmer Diana Mocanu, a two-time medallist, did not qualify for Athens.
In track, Gabriela Szabo is the defending 5000m champion, but has suffered a sharp decline in her recent performances.
"The Romanians [are going] to Athens with a generation worn out by age, with Olympic medallists from eight or even 16 years ago," says sports journalist Lauretiu Ciornei. "They were trained within the system before 1989, according to Soviet standards, with long cantonments.
Nowadays, athletes prefer to train individually, somewhere abroad, and there are no resources to switch to another system."
This crisis is especially severe for team sports such as handball, volleyball, water polo, rugby, basketball, in which Romania will not be represented at the Athens Games.
"These teams did not qualify for Athens because many players from abroad do not join long training sessions with the national team.
It is very hard to assemble a team that meets from time to time," General Secretary of the Romanian Olympic Committee Dan Popper explains.
"It takes decades to develop a new strategy," says Tiriac.
In the meantime, Romanians can think back fondly on their most storied Olympic moment -- the 1984 Los Angeles Games, in which the team ranked second.
Owners of nationalised property await restitution
Serbia is preparing to denationalise pre-1945 property through a property restitution law.
However, some fear the process may jeopardise the country's macro-economic stability.

The former Serbian government, headed by current Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, unveiled a draft restitution law days before reaching an agreement on a new ruling coalition.
President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party is not expected to block the legislation, as the draft received positive evaluations from NGOs that advocate denationalisation.
Under the new law, original owners would either regain their former property or receive financial compensation.
Serbian citizens have so far filed some 73,000 claims seeking restitution of land -- amounting to an area the size of Montenegro -- and other property.
The draft calls for denationalisation of development land, which, unlike agricultural land, must be "separated" from facilities built on it before it can be returned to the former owners.
Commercial buildings, apartments, industrial and retail facilities, and other real estate, not privately owned, are also subject to restitution.
If the expropriated property cannot be returned to its pre-1945 state, the former owners will receive financial compensation.
Some 4 billion euros have been allocated for financial restitution of property, according to the draft law.
"The amount will not seriously affect Serbia's macroeconomic stability, as the funding should be raised through 20-year bonds, until January 1st, 2028, with a 4.5% interest," said former Finance Minister Milan Parivodic.
The bonds could be used to purchase state-owned stocks, pay taxes, or as a down payment for loans disbursed by state-owned banks.
Mile Antic, the head of the Belgrade's Network for Restitution, believes the draft law is the most sensible proposed so far, and that the return of original property will reduce financial compensation that the state would otherwise have to pay.
"When property is returned, the budget's tax revenues will grow, so the 4 billion euros amount will be much lower," says Antic.
Lawyer Branko Pavlovic, formerly head of the state's Privatisation Agency, says that the draft's main shortcoming is its failure to equally treat all original owners.
"The draft law does not treat equally former owners who receive their original property and those who will be forced to seek financial compensation," Pavlovic said.
According to Parivodic, however, the authors of the draft law sought to protect the interests of all, rather than individual citizens.
"The [draft] law does not seek to protect former owners' absolute interest, but the law must safeguard macro-economic policy.
It must also protect succeeding owners' interests and do so efficiently." Parivodic said.
The first task of Serbia's new government was to adopt the 2007 budget and end the semi-legal period of provisional financing.
The draft law will probably reach Parliament's agenda sometime this summer, much to the relief of original owners, who want Serbia to redress the historical injustice, as did other countries in the region.
Property restitution, as a form of protection of private ownership, is one of the key requirements on Serbia's path to European integration.
Proxima to Replace Concordia Mission in Macedonia
The mandate of Concordia, the EU military mission in Macedonia, expires on 15 December.
It will be replaced by a 200-member police force, Proxima, tasked with training Macedonian policemen in accordance with European standards.
By Marija Lazarova for Southeast European Times in Skopje -- 14/10/03
A new EU mission in Macedonia, Proxima, will start on 15 December, the day Concordia's term in Macedonia expires.
Foreign ministers of the EU member states made the decision in a meeting in Brussels, ending the debate over whether Macedonia needed an extension of Concordia.
The replacement of the military mission by a civil one comes after President Boris Trajkovski and Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski said the security situation in the country had stabilised and the international military presence was no longer needed, an assessment shared by Brussels.
The new mission will include 200 police officers with a precisely defined task: provide assistance to the Macedonian authorities in establishing professional and effective forces, in accordance with European policing standards.
The mission's mandate is expected to be 12 months, although it can be extended in agreement with the Macedonian government.
"The police officers from the Proxima contingent will not be empowered with decision making.
Rather, their duty will be to prepare members of the police to meet European standards and be able to act as European police members.
Practically, we will provide help in combating organised crime and dealing with it as well as consolidating the popular confidence in the police.
We believe this is a step that will strengthen relations between Macedonia and the European Union even further," said Christina Galach, a spokeswoman for EU security chief Javier Solana.
Belgian Bart d'Hooge has been appointed the head of Proxima.
He has previous experience with the Macedonian police and knows of the conditions in Macedonia.

Former KLA Leader Agim Ceku Arrested, Then Released
The recent arrest of Agim Ceku in Ljubljana and his subsequent release by Slovenian authorities after UNMIK intervention provoked a sharp response from Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova.
Since then, Belgrade has called on the UN to launch an urgent investigation against Ceku.
By Berat Buzhala for Southeast European Times in Pristina - 30/10/03
International airports have become risky places for the former leaders of what was known as the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).
This has become even more apparent with the arrest last week of General Agim Ceku by Slovenian police forces at the Ljubljana airport.
Ceku, former general commander of KLA and now commander of the civil Kosovo Protection Corps, was arrested on his way back to Pristina while he was passing through Slovenia on his way from Croatia, where he was visiting his family.
UNMIK chief Harri Holkeri told Slovenian police on 23 October to secure the release of Ceku, saying that his mission has sole jurisdiction over such cases and that the warrant issued by Serbian authorities is invalid.
"We have released Agim Ceku because we are convinced that the court that has issued the indictment does not have competencies over Kosovo," said Slovenian authorities, following Holkeri's intervention.
In June, Hungarian police detained former KLA leader Hashim Thaci for several hours on the basis of an old Serbian arrest warrant issued when Slobodan Milosevic was in power, according to his political party, the Democratic Party of Kosovo (DP).
Thaci, who now heads the DP, was released after then-UNMIK chief Michael Steiner intervened with the Hungarian Foreign Ministry.
The international indictment against Ceku came from Interpol and was signed by the Pristina Regional Court in Nis, Serbia.
After the war, the Serbian staff of Kosovo courts was reorganised within Serbia and continues to claim legitimacy over Kosovo, which is administered by the UN.
Serbian Judge Danica Marinkovic has dealt with the files of former KLA members and has pressed charges against two of the main leaders for the alleged killing of Serbs during and after the war.
Marinkovic charges Thaci and Ceku with killing around 700 people.
Officials in Belgrade expressed disappointment at Slovenia's move.
Meanwhile, Serbian Justice Minister Vladan Batic has not given up.
He has requested that UNMIK extradite Ceku, Thaci and Ramush Haradinaj to Serbia for trial.
Four companies shortlisted in Macedonia's ESM-Distribution tender
The list of firms competing to buy Macedonian public power utility ESM-Distribution has been narrowed from seven to four, with bids due within the next three months and a decision expected by late March.
By Marina Stojanovska for Southeast European Times in Skopje – 11/01/06
ESM-Distribution is one of three companies the Macedonian government created out of the state utility ESM. [ESM]
Four foreign companies have been shortlisted for the sale of public power utility ESM-Distribution, according to the Greek business portal reporter.gr.
The procedure is due to be completed by late March.
Austria's EVN, the Czech firm CEZ, Germany's RWE and Italy's ENEL will compete to purchase a 90 per cent stake in the firm, which has 110m in capital and is considered the most valuable of the Macedonian public enterprises that have been put up for sale.
Three other companies -- the US-based firms AES and Prism Energy, as well as EnBW of Germany -- reportedly picked up the required documentation in December but did not make it through the qualification stage.
The tender was announced on 9 December and published in the Financial Times in London and the Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia.
Companies had until 12 December to obtain the tender documentation, for which they had to pay 50,000 euros.
The bidders are to submit their offers by early March.
Under the terms of sale, the purchaser must have assets exceeding 1 billion euros, shareholding capital of more than 500m euros, and more than 150m euros in profits over the past three years.
In addition, it must be experienced in power distribution to more than 700,000 users.
The winning bidder will be required to invest up to 42m euros in the company over the next three years, as well as honour collective agreements.
It will also have to deposit a bank guarantee that the government can withdraw in case the investor does not fulfil its investment commitments.
Immediately before launching the privatisation process, the Macedonian government split ESM into three companies: ESM-Distribution, the transmission firm ESM MEPSO, and the power producer ESM ELEM.
Austria's Mainel Bank is the main consultant in the privatisation.
Turkish authorities step up measures to contain spread of bird flu
Amid criticism over its response, the Turkish government is boosting efforts aimed at halting the bird flu outbreak in the country.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan insists the situation is under control.

Turkish authorities have stepped up measures to contain the further spread of a bird flu outbreak, which has claimed the lives of at least two teenagers in the country's east.
Of some 70 people hospitalised with flu-like symptoms across the country in a week, the number of patients to have tested positive for the virus's deadly H5N1 strain was set at 13 on Tuesday (10 January).
Muhammet Ali Kocyigit, 14, and his sister Fatma, 15, from the rural eastern town of Dogubeyazit, near the Turkish-Iranian border, became the country's first H5N1 victims last week.
Their sister Hulya, 11, died shortly after, but initial tests indicated H5N1 was not the cause of her death.
A fourth sibling was also treated for bird flu and has reportedly recovered.
All four children came into contact with infected chickens.
According to latest reports, the virus has quickly spread westwards, reaching Ankara, Istanbul and the country's popular Aegean Sea resort of Kusadasi, some 1,650km from Dogubeyazit.
The infection is said to have affected poultry in 30 out of Turkey's 81 provinces.
The government said on Tuesday that a total of 306,000 birds have been killed across the country since 26 December.
Facing criticism over their alleged slow response, authorities stepped up efforts this week to raise public awareness about precautionary measures against the disease.
The campaign includes the distribution of leaflets, and television spots urging people not to touch fowl and to wash their hands after handling poultry.
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan says there is no reason for panic.
"The situation is fully under control," he told reporters at a joint press conference Tuesday with visiting Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. "We will continue to deal with the situation with the utmost care."
Scientists are concerned that while the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus remains hard for people to catch, it could mutate into a form that can become easily transmissible among humans and spark a pandemic.
A report in the The Times quoted British scientists, who have been studying the bird flu virus found among patients in Turkey, as saying that initial tests showed no indication that it has mutated.
The WHO, which sent a team of health experts to the country following the Kocyigit teenagers' deaths last week, also said Tuesday there is no evidence to suggest human-to-human transmission of the infection.
Guenael Rodier, the leader of the WHO investigative team currently in Turkey, said the bird flu outbreak appears to be limited to cases in which those infected with the H5N1 virus had contracted it through direct contact with sick birds.
"It seems to be clear that we are dealing with a situation similar to what we have seen in Asia, which means in practice a number of small sites, family clusters of disease involving many children and always with documented or reported contact with infected birds, typically backyard poultry," Rodier said.
"I have a sense that what is going on in Turkey can be brought under control relatively easily," he was also quoted as telling reporters in Geneva by phone.
What is seen as puzzling in Turkey is the fast spread of the infection, which has claimed 76 lives in China and Southeast Asia since 2003, or about half of the confirmed H5N1 cases in that region over the last two years.
Restitution demanded for confiscation of Croatian Jews' assets
Croatia is making moves towards settling the thorny problem of compensating expatriated Jews whose property was seized by the Ustashe and communist regimes during the last century.
By Kristina Cuk for Southeast European Times in Zagreb -- 22/11/05
Croatian Justice Minister Vesna Skare-Ozbolt says restitution must take place regardless of Croatia's EU hopes.
Expatriated Croatian Jews who lost their property during two sucessive regimes could receive compensation as Zagreb works to resolve this longstanding issue.
The total amount of restitution could reach 20m euros.
In October, the US State Department's Special Ambassador for Holocaust issues, Edward B. O'Donnell, was in Zagreb for consultations.
He said Washington is ready to negotiate a bilateral deal that would bring US citizens under the scope of Croatia's 1996 Restitution Act.
In 1941, the Ustashe regime in Croatia -- a puppet regime of Nazi Germany -- ordered Croatian Jews to report their property, including homes, apartments, bank accounts and personal valuables, such as jewelry.
The assets were then seized and, in many cases, given to members of the former German minority in Croatia, known as the Volkdeutschers.
After the war's end, the property was nationalised by the communist government.
As Croatia moves forward with its EU bid, it is coming under pressure to resolve outstanding issues of restitution with a number of bloc members, including Italy, Germany, Slovenia, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
Zagreb already has been conducting negotiations with Austria over compensating the Volkdeutschers who were kicked out of Croatia in 1945.
This, in turn, has highlighted the problem of Jewish restitution, since some exiled Germans lost property that originally belonged to Croatian Jews.
According to the Zagreb-based historian Ivo Goldstein, the number of Jews who are requesting restitution should not be very high.
But the process, he adds, should go back to 1941, when the first assets were seized.
If the Croatian government accepts the demand, it will have to return assets in the form of real estate or provide a financial refund.
One major obstacle is the fact that many of the properties have been turned into residential apartments, houses, forest and agricultural complexes, or offices.
The Ukrainian embassy building, for example, reportedly belongs to an expatriated Jewish family in Argentina.
Croatian Justice Minister Vesna Skare-Ozbolt says restitution must take place regardless of Croatia's EU hopes.
It has been a problem for more than half a century, she says, and cannot be avoided forever, even if solving it proves a complicated task.
UN envoy arrives in Pristina
Former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, the UN secretary general's special envoy for the Kosovo status talks, has begun his fact-finding tour of the region.
His first stop is Pristina.

UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari arrived in Kosovo on Monday (21 November) and has already met with UNMIK head Soren Jessen-Petersen.
He next holds talks with Kosovo's negotiating team and representatives of the province's Serb minority.
"I am delighted that we have been able to come so soon after my nomination to head the negotiations for the future status of Kosovo," the former Finnish president told reporters after his arrival in Pristina.
He faces the formidable task of hashing out a compromise between two sharply divided positions concerning the future of the province, which is technically part of Serbia-Montenegro although under UN administration.
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority is demanding outright independence, while Serbia insists it should retain some form of sovereignty over the province.
As though to highlight the challenge, Ahtisaari's arrival coincided with the Serbian Parliament's adoption Monday of a resolution calling for Belgrade's sovereignty to be preserved even as "substantial autonomy" is granted to Kosovo.
The resolution's text reflects the "more than autonomy, less than independence" formula that Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica intends to make the basis of his side's negotiating position.
"Kosovo is part of Serbia, and not only part of its history but also part of its present and future," Kostunica told parliament at the session Monday.
In Pristina, meanwhile, independence supporters greeted Ahtisaari by spray-painting "no negotiations -- self-determination" on the concrete walls surrounding UNMIK headquarters.
Speaking to journalists ahead of the envoy's visit, Jessen-Petersen suggested that if Kosovo leaders want to see a swift resolution to the status issue, they should focus on meeting UN-set standards laid out for the province, including decentralisation, ensuring security for minorities, and dialogue with Belgrade.
"Violence cannot speed up the resolution of status; success in standards implementation and decentralisation can do so," the UNMIK chief said.
Meanwhile, the international community is taking a dim view of Serbian President Boris Tadic's suggestion that Kosovo should be partitioned into entities, in a manner similar to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
"I do not think that the model of Bosnia can be applied in Kosovo, because Kosovo has its specifics," EU security chief Javier Solana told the daily Koha Ditore.
Jessen-Petersen echoed those remarks. "It is sure that the Dayton Agreement for BiH cannot be applied in Kosovo," he said.
US official urges BiH political party leaders to agree on constitutional reform
US Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns voiced hope Monday that Bosnian political leaders will declare their readiness to revamp Bosnia and Herzegovina's Constitution.
(The Washington Times, AP - 22/11/05; Washington File, Reuters, AP, BBC, VOA, RFE/RL - 21/11/05)
"We're not there yet.
We don't have an agreement yet," said US Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns. "But I'm confident that they're heading in that direction." [AFP]
A senior US diplomat voiced hope Monday (21 November) that while ceremonies marking the 10th anniversary of the Dayton Peace Accords (DPA) are under way in Washington, political leaders from Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) will agree to revamp their country's constitution.
"What we hope they'll agree to tomorrow is, as political party leaders in the country, that they will dedicate themselves to this process of constitutional reform, that they will pursue that over the coming months in advance of the 2006 elections," said US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns.
About ten days ago, the leaders of the eight main ruling and opposition parties in BiH met in Brussels to discuss changes in the constitution, which is part of the DPA.
They continued their talks in Washington on Sunday, ahead of the two-day commemorative ceremonies, which began Monday with a conference entitled "Beyond Dayton: the Balkans and Euro-Atlantic Integration".
"Dayton established a state with internal divisions, internal Berlin walls, separating one community from another because that was the only way to stop the war and to build a tentative and fragile peace," Burns said at the conference, sponsored by the US Institute of Peace. "Ten years later these internal walls must now be torn down.
The country's people -- the Croats, Serbs, and Muslims -- must be allowed to mix, they must be allowed to integrate as differing people do in normal multiethnic states."
The Accords left BiH divided into two political entities -- the Federation of BiH and Republika Srpska (RS) -- each with its own government and parliament.
In addition, there is a national parliament and government, and a tripartite presidency, whose members represent the three main ethnic groups.
In recent months, as the country strengthened its ties with the international community, calls have been intensifying for reform of what most analysts agree is one of the world's most cumbersome political and administrative systems.
"Bosnia can't remain a fractured state and think that it can become part of the unified Europe or a unified NATO," Burns said.
Under the proposed constitutional changes, the two entities would be retained, but with their powers sufficiently curtailed, while the currently weak national parliament and government would be strengthened.
The three-member presidency would be replaced by a single president.
Speaking at Monday's conference, Richard Holbrooke, a former US ambassador to the UN who brokered the DPA n 1995, also urged the BiH politicians, particularly the Bosnian Serbs, to agree to reform the constitution.
"I need to tell you, frankly, that by defending the Dayton Agreements in their present form you are essentially trying to prevent progress," he said. "You must help improve Dayton.
RS needs to realise once and for all that it is part of a single country called Bosnia and Herzegovina."
On Tuesday, the BiH delegation, headed by the chairman of the tripartite presidency, Ivo Miro Jovic, and including the other two members of the presidency and some 40 other Bosnian officials and politicians, will attend a gala luncheon, hosted by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

Albania, BiH welcome a visa-free future
In Tirana, leaders hail one of the most important milestones since the fall of communism.
By Linda Karadaku for Southeast European Times in Tirana -- 09/11/10

The EU flag, with its circle of stars set against a blue backdrop, is everywhere in Albania these days.
So are signs marked with distances to the Schengen zone capitals.
People have been placing them at the main crossroads in Tirana.
Meanwhile, a poster at the Opera and Ballet Theatre -- once a symbol of pride for the communist regime -- announces "no visas required!"
It's all part of the hubbub surrounding the EU's decision to approve visa liberalisation for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In Albania, a country that endured long decades of isolation under former dictator Enver Hoxha, the significance cannot be overestimated.
Since the regime's fall, many have emigrated to other parts of Europe -- indeed, there is scarcely a family in Albania that does not have at least one member abroad.
Up to now, though, most had to do so illegally.
Hasan, an Albanian who once crossed the sea to work in Italy, stands in front of the big poster, thinking of his two brothers who made the journey with him -- and stayed.
"I will go and visit them now any time I can.
It's only a one hour flight," he notes.
The EU's decision is expected to enter into force 20 days after it is published in the official gazette, and possibly in time for Albania's Independence Day, which is celebrated on November 28th.
Whatever the exact date, travel restrictions will be lifted in time for Christmas.
The good news, however, does not come without warnings.
Bruised by problems surrounding visa liberalisation for Serbia and Macedonia, the EU is determined to enforce the rules and will strictly punish violators who remain in Schengen Zone countries for longer than the three months allowed.
Brussels wants to make it clear that visa-free travel does not mean permanent residency or asylum.
Great Britain and Ireland are not in the Schengen zone and visas still apply for them.
Tanja Fajon, the European Parliament's rapporteur for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina's visa liberalisation process, says the two countries have fulfilled the criteria.
"We brought an end to the long queues at the consulates and tore down the walls that separated families and friends.
The responsibility now is with all sides," she said in a press release.
She also sought to allay concerns about illegal migration and crime.
"People who wanted to leave the country have done so by now and we know that criminals do not have borders; visas are not a threat to them," she said.
At home, the decision has temporarily accomplished the impossible -- uniting Albania's quarrelsome politicians.
Though they agree on little else, all joined together in hailing the EU's move.
President Bamir Topi called it "the most important day for the Albanians, after the proclamation of Independence and fall of communism".
"It marks the biggest achievement for [Albanians'] freedom and dignity since the Iron Curtain fell down," agreed Prime Minister Sali Berisha.
His main adversary, Socialist Party head Edi Rama, said it is time to put aside polemics and savour the moment.
He also called on Europe to "tear down the visa wall" for neighbouring Kosovo, the only country in the region left out of the visa liberalisation process.
BiH's defence industry fights to regain footing
Weapons and ammunition manufacturers have spent years trying to rebuild and attract the level of business they did before the 1990s conflicts.
By Jusuf Ramadanovic for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo – 09/11/10

The military industry in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- once a major pillar of economic development -- all but crumbled after the conflicts of the 1990s and the breakup of the former Yugoslavia.
Back in the day, factories dotted the country -- Pretis in Vogosca, Igman in Konjic, Vitezit in Vitez, Zrak in Sarajevo, Cajavec in Banja Luka, Soko in Mostar, Bratstvo in Novi Travnik, Eagle Institute for Technical Overhaul, and Famos in Hrasnica. They produced everything from bullets for small calibre pistols to projectiles for rocket launchers.
The statistics, in black and white, are startling. According to 1986 data, defence was an $825m a year industry. In 2009, the figure was roughly $30m, or 45m KM, according to the Foreign Chamber of BiH.
Arguably more important is the impact on the workforce.
Before the war in BiH, the military industry boasted 40,000 employees; today that figure is less than 3,000.
Although many local economists believe the military industry remains BiH's "chicken that lays the golden egg", the industry has been tarnished by neglect, and crippled by the decision to split the country into two entities.
"There is not a single state-level commercial company that produces arms or military equipment, and they all require entity-level permits for any kind of such business activity," says Uma Sinanovic, spokesperson for the BiH state defence ministry. "The state-level Ministry of Foreign Trade only provides final consent for trade transactions, based on the entity approvals."
Largely left to fend for themselves, some BiH companies managed last year to export to some demanding markets, including Switzerland, Great Britain, and Egypt.
The most successful company, Igman, in Konjic, exports the whole range of its ammunition and has earned nearly 15m euros in the past year.
All arms producers in BiH agree that relations need to be redefined in terms of ownership of such companies.
With this in mind, the state-level ministry of foreign trade and economic relations has recently started working to amend the law on Foreign Direct Investment policy, to cancel restrictive measures involving the 49% of foreign shares requirement in military industry companies.
A ray of hope is also seen in the completion of interstate agreements on military industry co-operation between BiH and Pakistan, Romania, Turkey, Egypt and Serbia.
According to Dragisa Mekic, assistant minister for foreign trade policy and foreign investment, the agreement with Pakistan has already been signed and ratified, while the agreement with Turkey is in the final stages of drafting.
Closer to home, Mekic notes a certain level of co-operation with the military industries of neighbouring countries, through commercial contracts between factories.
And farther afield, BiH has been trying to boost its profile.
"Our exhibitors have been present at some major and relevant worldwide international fairs, such as the ones in Paris, Ankara, Abu Dhabi, Kuala Lumpur, and the like."
BiH has what it takes, he adds.
"We have the human resources, organisational and technological capacities required to come out to foreign markets, as well as a long-standing experience in military production," Mekic says.
What BiH lacks is a huge army in need of weapons and ammunition.
Long gone are the days when the former Yugoslavia had more than 400,000 soldiers and was producing everything from small-calibre ammunition to submarines.
Draft resolution offers more time for Belgrade-Pristina talks
Western nations are set to circulate a new draft resolution on Kosovo's future, giving Serbian and Kosovo Albanian officials four months to reach an agreement on the province's final status.

The members of the UN Security Council are likely to get a new draft resolution on Kosovo's future Wednesday (June 20th), paving the way for fresh status talks between Belgrade and Pristina.
The document, drawn up by the United States and EU nations, would reportedly give the two sides four months to reach an agreement.
If the negotiations fail to produce a deal, UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan for Kosovo would be automatically put into effect, Reuters reported.
The former Finnish president has recommended that Kosovo be granted EU-supervised independence with trappings of statehood, including a constitution, flag, anthem and rights to membership in international organisations.
Ahtisaari's blueprint also calls for protecting the rights of all minority groups living in the province, particularly the Kosovo Serbs.
Under the plan, an International Civilian Representative would be appointed to supervise the implementation of the settlement.
Operating under a UN and EU mandate, that person would have the power to veto laws and dismiss local officials.
KFOR would continue to provide security in the province, while the EU would deploy a police mission to assist in the development of "effective, fair and representative rule of law institutions".
Kosovo Albanians, who make up 90% of the province's population of 2 million people, have accepted the plan, Serbia has flatly rejected it, insisting that it retain some sovereignty over Kosovo.
Backing Belgrade's demand for more talks on the province's future, Russia has threatened to exercise its veto power to block any UN Security Council resolution that is unacceptable to Serbia.
Hoping to avoid that possibility, Western nations have suggested incorporating, in the final draft of the plan, Moscow's suggestion that an envoy be appointed to deal with internally displaced ethnic Serbs.
Belgrade effectively lost control over Kosovo in June 1999, when the province was put under UN administration following a NATO air campaign.
Prior to that, Serb forces had engaged in a crackdown on independence-seeking ethnic Albanians.
Speaking during a visit to Athens on Tuesday, Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic reiterated Belgrade's call for more talks with Pristina, while also stressing its staunch opposition to granting Kosovo full independence.
"We've got to talk, we want to talk and we're ready to make a deal.
We are prepared to look at all options, because we believe that any compromise, any compromise whatsoever, is infinitely better than any imposed solution," the minister said. "Our position is that we cannot give up the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country."
There is broad skepticism, however, that new negotiations between Serbian and Kosovo Albanian leaders will prove more fruitful than those held last year under Ahtisaari's mediation.
Nearly 14 months ended earlier this year with no significant change in the two sides' stances.
Pushing for a quick resolution to the province's status issue, Kosovo's leadership has voiced opposition to any renewal of talks with Belgrade.
"Reopening the Ahtisaari package would be completely unacceptable," the Belgrade-based Beta news agency on Tuesday quoted Skender Hyseni, the spokesman for Kosovo's negotiating team, as saying. "Kosovo might need to finalise its status by alternative ways.
In that case, the countries that blocked the process in the Security Council would be held responsible."
Ahtisaari, meanwhile, said Tuesday that he expects Russia to block a Council resolution based on his plan.
However, he said, Kosovo would still likely gain independence before the end of this year.
Speaking on Finnish television, he said in the case of a veto by Moscow. a solution to Kosovo's status could be found outside the UN – with backing from the EU and the United States.
Romania, Moldova seal border treaty
After seven years of negotiations, Romania and Moldova sign a treaty hailed as "an excellent example of the things that can be achieved when there is mutual interest".

Romania and Moldova sealed a long-awaited border treaty on Monday (November 8th), setting the stage for closer co-operation between the two neighbours.
The agreement was signed by Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Baconschi and Moldovan Prime Minister Vlad Filat during a ceremony in Bucharest, on the sidelines of a regional summit of the 14 countries bordering the Danube River.
The treaty deals with a number of technical issues, such as the marking of the 681km border, joint construction projects, utilisation of water resources, infrastructure and communication installations, as well as border maintenance and surveillance.
It also regulates the way various activities -- such as fishing, hunting and forestry -- are conducted in that region.
The deal was reached after years of negotiations and at an important time for both countries.
Moldova, which was part of Romania until it was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 to then declare independence in 1991, faces critical parliamentary elections on November 28th.
Moldova was the only neighbouring country with which Bucharest had not signed such an agreement.
Romania hopes to join the 25 European nations in the visa-free Schengen area in March 2011, when its border with Moldova will also become part of the EU external border.
"By signing this treaty, we discourage the obsessive allegations of some political circles in Moldova concerning "an imaginary irredentist agenda of Romania", Baconschi said in a joint statement with Filat, following the signing ceremony.
His remark was in an apparent reference to repeated accusations by Moldovan communists that Romania has territorial claims on their country.
Filat, the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party -- one of the four parties in the ruling Alliance for European Integration (AIE) coalition -- said Monday's agreement would pave the way for the adoption of European-style border practices in his country.
European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso, who was in Bucharest on Monday, welcomed the signing of the treaty as "an excellent example of the things that can be achieved when there is mutual interest".
Noting the move's importance for Romania's Schengen bid in a speech at the opening of the Danube summit, he said it was also a "demonstration that Moldova is getting closer to the EU".
Romania's Baconschi voiced confidence later that Barroso's stated support "can only inspire us to continue placing this bilateral relationship irreversibly in a European logic".
"We want the Republic of Moldova to follow this path and we want this border to gradually fade away when all the conditions are met and for it to become an internal border of the EU," he said.
EU Accession Roadmaps Could Cause Some Bumps
[EU] Bulgaria and Romania have received roadmaps from the EU to serve as measures of reforms needed for accession to the Union. Some of the reforms will be harder than others.
By Daniel Daianu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest - 21/04/03
At the last EU summit in Copenhagen, Bulgaria and Romania received roadmaps which act as yardsticks of reforms needed for EU accession.
Although the roadmaps are fairly eloquent, they leave a number of questions unanswered.
The adoption of the Acquis Communautaire (the set of EU norms and regulations) is only partially a technical operation of transposing the EU rules into national legislation.
In a deeper sense, the assimilation of the Acquis concerns the actual functioning of local institutions as a precondition of economic and social performance.
For this reason, the European Commission has underscored the need for reform of public administration and justice and for continuing the fight against entrenched corruption.
Arguably, the reforms that are being requested by the EU are more demanding than the creation of a "conventional" market economy together with a liberal democracy.
This is because the EU is the fruit of organic development and also of meticulously engineered institutional construction.
The latter, in particular, is meant to bring national contexts -- of relatively close economic development levels -- nearer institutionally and functionally.
Accession demands a series of institutional adaptations, which otherwise would not be asked for.
In spite of lingering economic discrepancies, the EU is made up of prosperous economies and societies.
Therefore, Bulgaria and Romania are confronted with a major developmental handicap, which cannot be done away with quickly.
The income per capita in Bulgaria and Romania is below 28 per cent of the average in the EU in Purchasing Power Parity terms.
At the same time, the Maastricht criteria, which concern the level of inflation, interest rate differentials, budget deficit limits, and limits of variation of the exchange rate, are not easy to fulfil and may constrain economic growth.
The autonomy of economic policy would be severely constrained even during the pre-accession period and may reduce considerably the capacity to deal with adverse shocks.
The "political economy" of enlargement is also an issue to consider. The first wave of enlargement in 2004 can be taken for granted; further accession waves are far from being a certainty.
Future enlargement depends on the internal metabolism of the EU, which could be severely tested by rising divergence of economic performance, due to mounting economic difficulties all over the EU in recent years, and by the formation of various "coalitions", with different views on the nature of deepening and the management of EU internal issues as well as the formulation of a common security and foreign policy.
A main inference is that the assimilation of the Acquis implies both benefits and costs, and the latter are not to be underestimated.
Moreover, costs are not easy to illustrate and measure, and that could create a credibility problem for public authorities should these costs be revealed as substantially higher than anticipated.
Admittedly, benefits would go far beyond costs.
The accession negotiations would discipline policy making; EU accession related reforms would become more consistent and steady.
Against the background of assimilating the Acquis, the link with the EU looks far richer than that with the international financial institutions.
The EU could provide a push in order to overcome a developmental and modernisation challenge.
Aside from the benefits brought about by institutional reforms, financial assistance can make a huge difference, if it is used wisely.
The EU can also provide an economic "shelter" at a time when uncertainties and vagaries multiply in the world.
But there is a series of aspects that the roadmap leaves open:
There are policy issues which do not have clear-cut solutions and multiple policy options are available; choices should try to optimise according to domestic circumstances and most likely external conditions.
Policy needs to observe the ABCs of sound economics (achieving low inflation, keeping fiscal balance over the business cycle, making hard budget constraints operate ubiquitously, etc) but be pragmatic at the same time; it is inimical to succumb to theoretical fundamentalism when it comes to real life.
For example, markets should be regulated effectively.
Policy needs to avoid hasty decisions, which may score "prestige points" but are likely to be quite costly unless addressed properly.
One example would be a hasty full liberalisation of the capital account.
The fate of national industry depends on how domestic sectors enter main European industrial networks.
Public authorities can play a role by using various policy tools (including tax incentives and a better business milieu for inward investment in industry).
This assertion does not imply continuing to subsidise heavy loss makers and denting the profitability of successful companies.
Infrastructure needs a lot of improvement.
To this end, funds from the EU and from other specialised institutions -- the European Investment Bank, in particular -- have a key role to play.
The experience of Portugal, Spain and Greece shows what tremendous progress can be made by making good use of EU structural funds.
More resources have to be assigned, via the public budget, to education and health care services.
This issue will be increasingly challenging in the years ahead.
As in the case of infrastructure, a better performing economy and better tax collection would allow significant improvements.
Agriculture will, very likely, be a major stumbling block in accession negotiations, for it holds a relatively large share of the GDP and keeps much of the active population busy.
One should also consider the heavy subsidisation of this sector in the EU.
The purely economic problem could be compounded by farm land consolidation, which would likely force younger people to try to find jobs in the urban areas.
This might recreate the old "rural overpopulation problem" if other sectors do not provide a sufficient number of jobs.
In view of the demographic ageing in Europe and the increasing propensity (because of wage differentials) of Bulgarians and Romanians to work abroad, the export of labor may offer a venue for alleviating or averting a major social crisis.
Both countries need to avoid a Latin American-type evolution in this regard, and proper agreements with the EU would be a means of tackling the issue.
In fact, a "Grand Bargain" may be in the offing.
Transition economies would supply labor to the EU, making it possible for citizens who work abroad to send substantial amounts of money back home; and these private transfers would make up a sui generis safety net.
Belgrade Airport: the Gate of Serbia
The ongoing major reconstruction of Belgrade's airport aims to transform the Serbian capital into a regional traffic centre.
By Dusan Kosanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 07/10/03
Belgrade's airport was built 27 years ago, and much of its equipment and facilities are obsolete.
Under the Gate of Serbia project, however, it will be transformed into a regional air traffic hub.
Between now and 2007, the airport will see between 500m euros and 700m euros in investments, either from credits or through the airport's business operations.
According to Serbian Transport Minister Marija Raseta Vukosavljevic, Belgrade has an advantageous strategic position at the centre of two international corridors, allowing the combination of virtually every means of transport.
The reconstruction, aimed at increasing arrival and departure capacities, implies not only a larger space, but also restructured operations, accompanied by up-to-the-minute security equipment. Police and airport security have already begun training in the special security measures required for establishing air traffic on the Belgrade - New York route.
For the first time in 11 years, Serbia-Montenegro will offer regular service to the United States.
Flights to New York, operated jointly by JAT and Uzbekistan Air, are planned twice a week.
Despite some initial hurdles involving documentation of the US-bound passengers, the service is expected to begin shortly.
Investigators from the US Transportation Security Agency have already arrived in the country.
The airport's expansion opens up many options for subsidiary industries.
Construction of a luxury-class hotel, capable of hosting passengers and providing a venue for business conferences, is already being planned.
A future railway is aimed not only at connecting the airport with the city centre, but also at the transport of goods from the planned cargo centre.
The feasibility study now being drafted by the US Agency for Reconstruction and Development has not yet determined where the hotel and cargo centre will be situated, but the airport's surrounding area offers 85 acres for this purpose.
Completion of work on the international terminal is scheduled for May 2004.
As plans for the airport gather momentum, the issue of its future name arises.
Some suggest naming it after Serbia's assassinated prime minister, Zoran Djindjic.
Just as New York's international airport honours President John F. Kennedy, they argue, the most appropriate name for the Gate of Serbia is that of the prime minister who did so much to open Serbia to the world.
Experts Call for Improved EU Approach to Western Balkans' Integration
The EU needs to improve the way it provides support to and designs new assistance strategies for the Western Balkans, some area experts say.
(EUobserver.com - 19/03/03; European Stability Initiative)
Analysts with experience in Southeast Europe have called on the EU to improve its approach to the Western Balkans, to increase the impact of its assistance to the region.
During a discussion of the European Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee last month, experts said the EU needed to show greater commitment in providing necessary support and introduce new assistance strategies to make accession prospects more realistic for Western Balkan countries.
The purpose of the discussion was to help prepare for the Stability Pact Parliamentary Conference scheduled for May, which in turn will prepare the June Thessaloniki European Council meeting.
The Western Balkan countries, which have already been promised EU entry in the future, will be invited to a "strategic summit" within the framework of the Greek forum.
Albania, Macedonia and Croatia have signed Stabilisation and Association Agreements (SAA) with the EU.
Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia-Montenegro are not there yet.
In February, Croatia submitted an official application for EU membership, which it hopes to gain in early 2007, together with Bulgaria and Romania.
Albania and Macedonia are planning to follow Croatia's example later this year.
Vladimir Gligorov, of the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies, says on the one hand, the approach of the SAA process was too slow, while on the other, the Union was unintentionally not always supporting the right people in the region.
He feels it is critical therefore that the EU show greater commitment in providing the needed support.
The president of the European Stability Initiative (ESI), Gerald Knaus, told the members of the European Parliament that the Western Balkans region faces two major threats today: organised crime and social and economic decline.
By introducing more cohesion in its strategy for the region, the EU could help solve the social together with the economic problems, Knaus said, adding that in return, the Western Balkan countries should commit themselves to carry on the reform process and the fight against organised crime.
Furthermore, he recommended that the Union work in partnership with those countries towards the development of their own domestic cohesion instruments.
A recent ESI paper outlined three benchmarks for measuring the success of the Thessaloniki summit.
The first was a pledge to make cohesion an explicit EU objective in the Western Balkans, which would require commitment of more meaningful resources and greater involvement by EU institutions.
The ESI went on to explain that making a serious commitment to cohesion in the Western Balkans was more about developing new assistance strategies rather than about mobilising large new financial resources.
The second benchmark would be a commitment to apply the lessons learned from the cohesion policy, implying also a more effective use of funds.
The third benchmark would be a commitment to sustaining the levels of assistance in a proportion that will not lead to a wider gap between candidate countries, such as Bulgaria and Romania, and the countries of the Western Balkans.
The ESI said that if the currently planned assistance for the Western Balkans of 500m euros for 2006 -- equalling only 1 per cent of the regional GDP -- were doubled to 2 per cent, it would still be lower than the amount envisioned for Bulgaria and Romania that year.
Kurdish issue reaches pivotal point
Turkey has reached a critical juncture with its "Kurdish problem", as the gap between the state and the various Kurdish movements widens.
By Anna Wood for Southeast European Times in Istanbul -- 08/08/11

During national elections in June, the Kurdish-backed political party BDP managed to get 36 members elected to parliament.
Though the victory of the BDP-backed independent candidates was initially a cause for celebration, the situation quickly deteriorated when the candidacy of one of the elected parliamentarians, Hatip Dicle, was nullified post-election.
In reaction to this, the party has staged a boycott, with elected officials refusing either to enter parliament or to take the oath of office.
Evaluating these events as they were unfolding, Lehigh University professor of political science and Kurdish expert Henri Barkey expressed serious concerns.
Preventing Dicle from entering parliament, he explained, "risks undermining the goodwill [Prime Minister Recep Tayyip] Erdogan and the AKP had garnered" through the Kurdish Opening.
Though a parallel series of events affected the country's largest opposition party, the People's Republican Party (CHP), a deal was reached between it and the AKP and the CHP boycott soon ended.
A similarly rapid solution does not seem likely for the BDP-backed candidates, however.
The negotiations that have occurred between the state and party representatives have been ineffective.
The candidates' refusal to enter parliament has been criticised by some observers, including Denise Natali, the Minerva Chair of the Institute for National Strategic Studies, who believes the boycott and its fallout represent a wasted opportunity.
"The BDP did indeed have other alternatives that could have given it greater leverage in influencing change, as well as further legitimising its position and Kurdish claims inside the political arena," Natali tells SETimes.
She says these alternatives included fielding candidates who had no prison record and taking the oath of office "so as to move forward with negotiations and show the Turkish state that it is serious about change".
Announcement of democratic autonomy
In mid-July, the level of conflict was suddenly heightened by two parallel events.
The first was an attack attributed to the PKK that left 13 soldiers dead in the southeast province of Diyarbakir, the headquarters of Kurdish political activity in Turkey.
The deaths of Turkish soldiers as a result of PKK attacks have led to a rise in Turkish nationalism, deepening the divide between Turks and Kurds. [Reuters]
The clash gave new energy to Turkish nationalism and boosted anger towards the Kurdish people and the BDP.
The second event may stand as a landmark in the evolution of the Kurdish nationalist movement.
On the same day as that Diyarbakir attack, the Democratic Society Congress (DTK) announced a plan for so-called "democratic autonomy" of Kurds in Turkey.
"A solution to this problem will only be found with the recognition of Kurds as a people and their attainment of a status that is fundamentally equal to all of Turkey's peoples," DTK Vice-President Aysel Tugluk said.
"As it currently stands, the Kurdish people do not want to live as a people without a status in the face of policies that threaten their existence as a nation."
In an exclusive interview with SETimes, Kurdish parliamentarian Sebahat Tuncel shared what she believes to be the significance of the plan. "The problem isn't just bringing an end to the violence or the conflict.
At the same time, it will enable a democratic society to manifest its style of governance."
Tuncel also highlighted the multiple aims of the DTK's announcements.
"Democratic autonomy has two dimensions," she told SETimes.
"The first is the democratic and peaceful solution to the Kurdish problem, what we might call the peace project."
The second, Tuncel continued, is "the democratisation project, which will create opportunities for all Turkey's identities, cultures and beliefs to express themselves freely and as equals."
Though the actual efficacy of this pronouncement of democratic autonomy is in question, with some dismissing it as empty words and others perceiving it as a threat to the territorial integrity of the Turkish state, it inarguably augurs a new phase in Kurdish politics.
Though somewhat inelegantly and inefficiently divided among multiple organisations and various authorities -- the BDP, the DTK, the KCK, the PKK and the figure of its imprisoned leader Abdullah Ocalan himself -- the Kurdish nationalist movement is evolving and articulating its demands on a national and international stage.
Concern clearly remains regarding the connections between these groups, with the state, the media and much of the public quick to categorise BDP as merely an extension of the PKK.
To influence the state agenda, Natali says the BDP must convince people otherwise.
"The BDP, or its successors and affiliates, will have to affirm that they and the Kurdish demands are not a threat to the unity and stability of the Turkish state in order for the Kurds to make future progress on the political front," Natali told SETimes.
"At this point, they have done just the opposite."
Feasibility of an autonomous zone in Turkey
The question that lingers in the wake of the DTK announcement is what, exactly, a system of democratic autonomy in Turkey might look like, and whether it is possible given the current political climate.
Autonomous regions have, in some places, provided a productive solution in areas of ethnic or religious conflict and majority-minority tensions.
Spain, whose government included a roadmap for the establishment of autonomous zones in its 1978 constitution, is often touted as an example of a successful, peaceful transition to autonomy.
Catalonia and Basque country, each home to communities the state recognises as historical nationalities, are governed by autonomous legislatures and courts, and maintain ties to the federal government through government councils, whose presidents require approval from the monarch.
PKK deaths have also flamed Kurdish nationalist sentiment. [Reuters]
Canada, too, stands as an example of a state that has grappled with demands for autonomy, particularly from the province of Quebec.
Though debate regarding the level of provincial autonomy continues there, it is a peaceful part of the political process rather than a cause for war.
However, as noted by Turkish detractors of autonomy, the geopolitical and ethno-cultural realities of Turkey and the Middle East are much different than of Spain and Canada.
Crucial to any system of political autonomy is a large degree of state decentralisation, something that has long been considered an anathema by the Turkish state.
Officially, the central state is the arbiter of many local policies, a fact that leads to a system both inefficient and, for many, undesirable.
In a country where the Kurdish language was illegal until the early 1990s and its use is still curtailed in some settings today, the ideal of equality -- let alone autonomy -- may seem out of reach.
Juha Raikka, a professor at Finland's University of Turku who has studied the practical and ethical facets of autonomy, says the public must be tolerant for such solutions to be practical.
"The main condition is general acceptance of the solution," Raikka told SETimes.
"Canadians accept that Quebec has autonomy.
Finns accept that the island of Aland has autonomy.
That is why regional autonomy works well."
KB, a political writer and founder of the blog Kurdistan Commentary, expressed scepticism about Turkey's readiness for such autonomy.
"If speaking Kurdish is seen as threatening the territorial integrity of the state, how could autonomy be possible?
The Kurds need to be recognised constitutionally and guaranteed their rights before autonomy can be considered."
According to Natali, the lack of readiness exists not simply within the public, but at the state level, as well.
"Turkish officials, institutions, and political parties remain committed to the unity and the stability of the state," she says, adding that "the very idea of an autonomous Kurdistan Region bordering another autonomous Kurdistan region in Iraq would undermine that sense of security and unity."
Natali emphasises that a unilateral decision such as that made by the DTK has no hope of affecting true change in Turkey.
"Any change in the nature of the Turkish state and its institutions would have to engage constitutional and administrative reforms acceptable to the Turkish populations and officials, including the devolution of powers to the regions," Natali says.
Indeed, the consensus is that constitutional change is at the heart of any potential compromise between the restive Kurdish populace and the less than flexible AKP, which makes extensive use of nationalist sentiments to garner votes.
"The constitution is the key," Barkey emphasised.
"No matter what happens, Turkey needs a new constitution.
If nothing emerges from Ankara on this front, all bets are off."
As the solution is delayed and the impasse deepens, however, the prospect of productive co-operation dims.
"The passage of time makes things always more difficult to settle," Barkey said.
"What people do not understand is that in conflictual situations, barring unexpected dramatic developments, time works against the simplest compromise."

Turkey, Bulgaria seek to enhance bilateral ties
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in Sofia on Monday for talks with his Bulgarian counterpart, Boyko Borisov.

Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived on a one-day working visit to Sofia on Monday (October 4th) at the invitation of his Bulgarian counterpart, Boyko Borisov.
The Turkish leader was accompanied by the country's chief negotiator with the EU, Egemen Bagis, as well as by State Minister Faruk Celik, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz and Transportation Minister Binali Yildirim.
In an interview with the Sofia-based mass circulation daily 24 Chasa on Monday, Erdogan listed regional and international developments, as well as political, trade and economic issues, as some of the items topping the agenda of his talks with Borisov.
Ways to strengthen the two countries' co-operation in specific sectors, including energy, transport and tourism would also be discussed during the visit, he indicated.
"We are allies and our multilateral co-operation, undoubtedly, contributes to regional stability in the Balkans," Erdogan told 24 Chasa.
The Nabucco natural gas pipeline, Bulgaria's possible inclusion in the Turkey-Greece-Italy gas interconnection project, or the construction of a separate direct pipeline between the two countries, were among the issues expected to be discussed in greater detail at Yildiz's meeting with Bulgarian Energy Minister Traicho Traikov.
Speaking upon his departure for Sofia, eight months after Borisov's trip to Ankara in late January, Erdogan voiced hope that a final decision on the construction of a dam in the border region between the two countries would be reached Monday.
Erdogan also criticised circles in Bulgaria insisting that Sofia must block Turkey's EU bid unless it pays out billions of euros in compensation for the properties of ethic Bulgarians, who were expelled from the Ottoman Empire nearly a century ago.
"Under the treaty of friendship between Turkey and Bulgaria, signed in Angora in 1925, the issue found its solution after the two parties withdrew their claims for the period 1912-1925," said Erdogan.
Recalling that Turkey backed its northern neighbour's admission into NATO in 2004, he said he expected reciprocal support from Sofia for his country's bid to join the Union, in line with the principles of solidarity within the Euro-Atlantic community.
Bulgaria's EU entry in 2007 prompted an increase in bilateral trade between the two countries -- peaking at more than 3.6 billion euros at the end of that year, before dropping to nearly 3 billion euros in 2008, according to Erdogan.
The decrease in the trade volume between the two countries last year was due to the global financial and economic crisis, he said, adding that he expects the numbers to match the 2007 ones within months.
"We will catch it by the end of this year," the Anadolu Agency quoted him as saying.
Erdogan was also scheduled to meet with Ahmet Dogan, the leader of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, a party supported mainly by Bulgaria's ethnic Turkish community, and with the head mufti of Muslims in Bulgaria, Mustafa Alis Haci.

Britain to limit influx of Bulgarian, Romanian workers
Britain reportedly plans to impose measures to limit the influx of unskilled Bulgarian and Romanian workers following their countries' entry into the EU in January.

Britain is expected to unveil measures this week aimed at curbing the access of migrant workers from Bulgaria and Romania to its labour market, British press reports said Sunday (October 22nd).
The two countries will join the bloc in January.
Britain, Sweden and Ireland were the only EU member states to fully open their labour markets to migrant workers from the ten mostly former communist countries that joined the Union in May 2004.
The British authorities' initial estimates were that no more than 13,000 Eastern European citizens would enter the UK.
Recent reports suggest however, that the actual number exceeded 400,000 people.
That sparked concerns that Bulgaria and Romania's entry into the EU will lead to thousands of new job seekers flooding the British labour market after January.
Calls have come from unions, the opposition Conservatives and members of Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labour Party for the government to end its open-door policy.
Following weeks of media speculation, British Home Secretary John Reid is expected to announce a number of planned steps.
These include the introduction of time-limited controls on the right of Bulgarians and Romanians to work in Britain after the countries' EU entry, The Observer reported on Sunday.
The authorities intend to allow only specialised workers to enter the British labour market, the report said.
Even these would be issued temporary work permits.
A limited number of unskilled Bulgarian and Romanian workers -- such as fruit pickers -- would have the opportunity to get seasonal jobs in Britain, but would not be offered a general right to work.
Meanwhile, The Times said on Monday that the British government also is mulling measures to stop people from the two Balkan countries from entering the black economy.
While there are no legal grounds for Britain to deny nationals of EU member states to move into the country, denying them work permits is expected to prevent a large-scale influx of migrant workers.
"We should have roughly the same policy as the other main European countries so that we only take in the people who will benefit our economy," the AFP quoted Home Office Affairs spokesman Damian Green as saying.
Many economists say the influx of East European workers has had a beneficial effect on the British economy, boosting economic growth over the past two years.
But employers' unions warn that a new large wave of migrants could be hard to absorb.
The reported measures have angered some in the two incoming EU member states.
"We are deeply concerned about the denigrating campaign of the past weeks in the British media that does significant harm to the true image of Romania," The Observer quoted a group of senior Romanian figures as complaining in a letter to Blair. "The numbers of Romanians who intend to come to work in the UK after 1 January, 2007 has been highly exaggerated."
Recent reports have suggested that Bulgarians and Romanians were more drawn to Italy and Spain, and to a lesser extent to Britain.

The Croatian national air carrier, Croatia Airlines, said on Wednesday (June 4th) that it will start regular flights between Zagreb and Pristina as of June 16th.
According to its website, flights between Zagreb and Kosovo's capital will take place three times a week on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
The company said the new route would better connect Kosovo with the region.
The World Bank approved a 8.3m-euro loan to improve secondary and local roads in Albania, an Albanian newspaper reported on Wednesday (June 4th).
The project also aims to improve basic services and retail centers in the rural regions.
The total cost of the project, to be implemented by the Albanian Fund for Development, is 25.8m euros.
Kosovo will request financial assistance worth 1.4 billion euros through projects that it will present at the July 11th Kosovo Donors' Conference in Brussels, Economy and Finance Minister Ahmet Shala said on Wednesday (June 4th).
Shala presented Kosovo's midterm budget and investment framework to the foreign ambassadors in Pristina.
Bulgarian tobacco producer Pazardzik BT will buy the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) government's 67% stake in the Mostar tobacco factory, the FBiH Privatisation Agency announced on Tuesday (June 3rd).
Executives will sign the contract in 15 days.
The agency said that the Bulgarian investor has committed to pay 100,000 euros for the stake, invest an additional 3.5m euros and keep all 122 employees.
Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic opened on Tuesday (June 3rd) in London the Montenegro Investment Forum, which the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is hosting.
Event planners are seeking financing for the construction of the 280km Bar-Boljare highway to the Serbian border.
The Portuguese energy firm Martifer said on May 29th that it plans to start the construction of three wind power projects in Romania in September through its subsidiary Eviva Energy.
The plants will have a combined 50MW capacity.
The company's plans in Romania are to own wind power parks with a total installed capacity of 400MW by 2012, which would mean investing around 600m euros.

Controversy in Macedonia over law on religious groups
Proposals to liberalise the registration of religious groups have run into objections from the country's main religious institutions, the Macedonian Orthodox Church and the Islamic Religious Community.
By Marina Stojanovska for Southeast European Times in Skopje – 10/01/07

The Macedonian government, in consultation with the OSCE, has been drafting new legislation to amend the Law on Religious Communities and Groups.
However, a stumbling block has arisen over proposals to liberalise the registration process, a move called for by the European Commission.
Current law recognises a single religious community for people of a particular denomination.
The Macedonian Orthodox Church (MOC) is considered the representative of the Orthodox denomination, while the Islamic Religious Community (IRC) represents the Muslim denomination.
The MOC, IRC and the Roman Catholic Church have all come out in favour of maintaining the current system, rather than allowing the establishment of more than one religious community for each denomination.
Proponents say the liberalisation would give religious groups more freedom to choose their denominational orientation, thus potentially introducing more diversity.
According to the MOC, however, liberalisation would open the door for registration of the Ohrid Archbishopric in Macedonia, which is headed by a controversial bishop of the Macedonian Orthodox Church, Jovan Vraniskovski.
He is currently imprisoned at the Idrizovo penitentiary for misusing donations at the diocese he previously headed.
The IRC, meanwhile, says the proposed changes would lead to the registration of an independent Bektesi Community, a move it opposes.
After a meeting between Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski and MOC officials, it was announced that negotiations on amending the law would continue.
However, no specific solution has been chosen.
In parallel with the registration issue, the MOC has sent a letter to the Serbian Orthodox Church, proposing continuation of their dialogue regarding a decades-long church dispute.
The Serbian church continues to deny ecclesiastical independence to the MOC, instead offering it autonomy.
But MOC bishops insist on an auto cephalic church under its own constitutional name.
Croatian property laws pose hurdle in EU accession process
Foreigners face significant barriers in purchasing Croatian real estate under current laws, and the issue has become a roadblock in talks with the EU.

For the time being, Croatia will not take part in negotiations on the EU free movement of goods and capital.
During the screening process, EU experts concluded that Croatian property law does not comply with European standards, and must be adjusted.
"A large number of legislative restrictions still exist," the European Commission reported. "Citizens of EU countries do not enjoy the necessary rights that would enable them to obtain property in Croatia."
As a burgeoning tourist destination, Croatia has great appeal as a potential property market for foreigners.
EU residents are especially interested in purchasing holiday summer houses and apartments along the coast.
However, Eurosceptics in the country are not keen to open the property market to foreigners, fearing an immediate sellout.
Under current law, foreign citizens and enterprises seeking to own property in Croatia must obtain consent from the foreign ministry, which must be co-signed by authorities at the justice ministry.
The process can take years.
In deciding on each application, the foreign ministry examines whether there is reciprocity between Croatia and the applicant's state in real estate matters.
For the nationals of Italy, Germany and Austria, the procedure is the quickest, since reciprocity is well-established.
That is, a vast number of Croatian citizens living in these countries have purchased property there.
Foreign citizens and enterprises cannot acquire ownership of agricultural or forest land in Croatia.
If the object of acquisition is a protected cultural monument, it is first offered to the authorities -- federal, regional, and municipal.
Only if they decline to exercise their pre-emptive right to purchase can the property be offered to foreign citizens and enterprises.
Other EU members with a significant focus on tourism have run into issues similar to Croatia's during the accession process.
A case in point is Malta, where negotiators took seven years to complete a liberalisation of the country's real estate market.
Croatia should complete the liberalisation of its market by 2009, according to previous agreements signed with the EU.
Turkish Cypriots tear down controversial bridge in Nicosia
Turkish Cypriots have dismantled a controversial footbridge in the heart of Nicosia, fulfilling one of the preconditions set by the Greek Cypriot authorities to open a new crossing point on the divided island.
(Financial Mirror - 10/01/07; AP, DPA, VOA, Xinhua, Cyprus News Agency, Cyprus Mail, ABHaber, Zaman, The Anatolian Times, Turkish Daily News - 09/01/07; AFP - 07/01/07; Turkish Weekly - 06/01/07; AP - 05/01/07)

Turkish Cypriots on Tuesday (January 9th) dismantled a footbridge in Nicosia, whose construction in late 2005 frustrated plans for the opening of a crossing in the heart of Cyprus's ethnically partitioned capital.
At the end of last year, Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat first announced his decision to remove the controversial overpass on the Turkish side of Ledras Street, the main commercial road in Nicosia and a major symbol of the island's 32-year division.
According to the Greek Cypriots, the metal footbridge was built to enhance Turkish military patrols in the area.
Talat's plans for the structure's removal were criticised by General Yasar Buyukanit, Turkey's chief of general staff.
"The opening of Ledras Street is not a problem for us, but such steps need to be simultaneous," an AFP report on Sunday quoted the general as saying, noting that he had informed Talat of the Turkish military's views during a meeting Friday in Ankara.
Despite Ankara's opposition, Talat said after the meeting that the decision to demolish the bridge -- one of the preconditions set by Greek Cypriot authorities for the reopening of Ledras Street -- was still valid.
"Our only aim is to open the crossing," the AP quoted Ozkan Murat, a top Turkish Cypriot interior affairs official, as saying on Tuesday. "As Turkish Cypriots, we have done what had to be done."
Other preconditions outlined by the Greek Cypriots for the reopening of Ledras Street include the withdrawal of Turkish troops from the area, mine clearing and the restoration of adjacent buildings.
"The aim of opening Ledras Street is the safe movement of citizens and cultivation of a climate of mutual trust through contact and communication between the two communities," Greek Cypriot government spokesman Christodoulos Pashiardis said on Tuesday.
Hoping to pave the way for the revival of UN-sponsored peace talks with the Greek Cypriots this year, the Turkish Cypriots have described the move to tear down the controversial bridge as a gesture of good will.
Pashiardis, however, insisted on Tuesday that the removal of the overpass could by no means be considered as a retreat or concession by the Turkish Cypriots.
"Removing this illegality … should not be applauded as a noble gesture of goodwill, neither should it be rewarded with concessions on our part," the Cyprus News Agency quoted him as saying.
Asked if the Greek Cypriot authorities plan to remove a wall in front of the National Guard observation post at Ledras Street, Pashiardis said the government was ready to discuss its proposals for the opening of a crossing point on the thoroughfare through the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus.
Five crossing points have been opened on the divided island since 2003, none of them in the centre of Nicosia, where barricades were first erected during the interethnic clashes between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots in 1963.
Cyprus has been divided into a Turkish-run north and Greek-run south since 1974, when Turkish troops occupied about a third of the island's territory.
EC Proposes Free Trade With Northern Cyprus
New proposals by the European Commission would end the long-standing embargo againt Turkish Cypriots and provide 259m euros in aid.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen says the aim is to end the area's isolation.

In a move seen as acknowledging Turkish Cypriot support for international efforts to reunify Cyprus, the European Commission (EC) has announced a set of proposals which include liberalising trade with the northern part of the island, as well as a grant of 259m euros.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen said the EU remains committed to its long-term goal of reunifying the Greek and Turkish parts of Cyprus.
"The aim of the package is to bring the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community to an end, and we're using different instruments in doing so," he said.
During a referendum held on 24 April, Greek Cypriots rejected a UN-sponsored reunification plan, while Turkish Cypriots approved it.
As a result of the split vote, only the Greek part of Cyprus entered the EU on 1 May.
"It would be unfair, to say the least, to leave [Turkish Cypriots] out in the cold," Verheugen said.
The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), which is recognised only by Turkey, has been under an international embargo and sanctions since 1974.
Turkish Cypriot products currently cannot be exported abroad under the name of TRNC.
The new proposals, however, will allow free trade with Northern Cyprus except for foodstuffs.
Among potential EU-financed projects, Verheugen listed examples such as sewage treatment plants, the rehabilitation of copper mines, and -- in the longer term -- tourism ventures, agricultural support and infrastructure projects involving electricity and telecommunications.
He said the EU will seek to promote joint projects involving both Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot authorities.
The proposals, which would go into effect after the European Council meets in September, also include regulation of the trade across the "Green Line" separating the island's two communities.
While the EC's action represents a major political milestone for Turkish Cypriots, Verheugen repeatedly stressed that the proposals do not constitute direct or indirect recognition of the TNRC.
"We have certainly not the slightest interest to see a Turkish ministate in the eastern Mediterranean," he said.
Nevertheless, the set of proposals has been greeted with concern by Greece and Greek Cypriots.
Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman Giorgos Koumoutsakos describing the idea of direct EU contact with the TNRC in economic matters as "a negative point".
Greek Cypriot Foreign Minister Giorgos Iakovou, meanwhile, said the package is based on the wrong political assumptions and on laws that lack a solid foundation.
The Greek side is especially opposed to the free trade provisions, over which it lacks the power of veto.
But neither Greece nor the Greek Cypriots are expected to object to the 259m-euro aid grant, which requires a unanimous vote by the European Council.
Del Ponte Demands Handover of Top War Crimes Suspects by Year's End
The war crimes tribunal at The Hague will not close its doors before Bosnian Serb wartime leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic and Croatia's Ante Gotovina are tried, vows UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte.
(Reuters, AP, AFP, BBC, HINA - 12/09/03)
Embarking on her 2nd four-year term as chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), Carla del Ponte has said the surrender of all remaining fugitives is one of her top priorities.
The court would not close its doors before Bosnian Serb wartime leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic and Croatian General Ante Gotovina are tried, said del Ponte, setting the end of 2003 as a deadline for their handover.
The three are the most wanted among 17 war crimes indictees still at large.
"The government of Croatia should immediately transfer Ante Gotovina to The Hague and Serbia and Montenegro should do the same with Ratko Mladic.
The Bosnian Serbs should extend all co-operation to apprehend Karadzic," del Ponte said during a press conference on Friday (12 September).
Under a strategy recently endorsed by the UN Security Council, the ICTY is to complete all investigations by the end of 2004 and finalise all trials, excluding appeals, by the end of 2008.
That timeline would allow it to wrap up all activities in 2010.
But the completion strategy could be jeopardised should efforts to capture the most wanted suspects fail, del Ponte warned.
Mladic and Karadzic face genocide charges for their alleged involvement in major atrocities during the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), including the Srebrenica massacre.
Insisting that Mladic is in Serbia, del Ponte urged authorities there to arrest him immediately.
Karadzic is believed to be hiding in BiH's Serb-run entity, Republika Srpska.
Gotovina, who has been on the run since 2001, has been indicted for atrocities against Serb civilians during a Croat Army offensive in 1995.
Del Ponte said the Croat authorities were aware of his whereabouts.
"Both my office and the government of Croatia know the whereabouts of General Ante Gotovina," del Ponte said.
She also said that she would continue seeking the international community's assistance in bringing the tribunal's most wanted suspects to justice, adding that failure to apprehend and try them is not an option.
"I will not consider this option.
Karadzic, Mladic and Gotovina will be arrested and transferred by the end of the year.
The tribunal will not close its doors without Karadzic, Mladic and Gotovina on trial," del Ponte said.
Reacting to those remarks, Croatian Prime Minister Ivica Racan said Friday that his government "has had no contact with General Gotovina".
He said that the fugitive would be arrested "if Croatian services knew that he is in Croatia and where he is".
He urged the retired general to turn himself in, saying his surrender to the tribunal would be good both for him and his country.
In a separate statement, Croatian President Stipe Mesic also called on Gotovina to surrender to defend his and Croatia's honour in The Hague.
EU gradually reopens European airspace
EU transport ministers began allowing limited air traffic across Europe on Tuesday.
The continent's airspace is currently divided into zones, based on the amount of volcanic ash in each.
(Various sources -- 19/04/10 - 20/04/10)

European airspace began reopening on Tuesday morning (April 20th), six days after a volcano in Iceland sent huge clouds of ash across the continent.
The ensuing aviation ban turned Europe into a virtual no-fly zone.
Eurocontrol -- the agency that handles air traffic across 38 European nations -- said it expected up to 60% of flights scheduled over Europe to take off Tuesday.
This followed a Monday agreement to divide the continent into three air zones, based on volcanic ash content.
The first zone, covering the region above the volcanic plume, remains a strict no-fly area, said Jose Blanco, minister of public works for Spain, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency.
The second zone, with a lower concentration of ash, will allow flights co-ordinated by EU member states, as advised by aviation experts.
The third zone, unaffected by the volcanic eruption, will have no restrictions.
"There cannot be any compromise on safety," EU Transport Commissioner Siim Kallas said on Monday. "All decisions must be based on scientific evidence and expert analysis."
The unprecedented closure of most of Europe's airspace a day after last week's eruption of Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull volcano caused travel chaos that left an estimated seven million passengers stranded around the world.
With more than 63,000 flights cancelled in 23 European countries between Thursday and late Sunday, airlines claimed losses exceeding 1 billion euros.
Bulgaria, whose airspace was partially closed during the weekend, said on Monday there would be no flights to Western Europe on Tuesday, while flights were allowed to the eastern and southern parts of the continent.
Serbian media quoted the country's JAT Airways as saying that half of Monday's planned flights took off and air traffic to Russia, Greece, Turkey, Montenegro, Macedonia and southern Italy has been fully restored.
However, flights to and from Britain, France, Germany, Switzerland, the Scandinavian and other Western European countries were still banned.
The full impact of the crisis has yet to be measured.
It has already been deemed bigger in scale and negative effect on the economy than the forced suspension of flights in the wake of the September 11th 2001 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington when US airspace was closed for three days.

Sarkozy stands between Turkey, EU
The French president has become the personification of European opposition to Turkey's bid to join the EU, but his dialogue with Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan has raised hopes.
By A. Simsek for Southeast European Times -- 20/04/10

Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's meeting in Paris earlier this month with French President Nicolas Sarkozy has led to some optimism -- however cautious -- that France may rethink its opposition to EU membership for Turkey.
Erdogan met with Sarkozy on April 8th.
The French president's strong opposition has been a persistent roadblock for Ankara.
Turkey has the sixth largest GDP in Europe with 644.8 billion euros annually and its growth over in the past decade and a half has hovered at around 6.5%.
That figure is not just higher than all other candidate nations but one that remains unattainable for many current EU members.
Turkey and European partners have played major roles in addressing the Iranian nuclear crisis, the security situation in Afghanistan and enhancing stability in Iraq.
Nevertheless, the country's increasingly prominent role has not won over sceptics.
Sarkozy has argued that "Europe must give itself borders" and that "not all countries have a vocation to become members of Europe."
Turkey has no place within those borders, the French president has insisted.
This has been Sarkozy's official line since he took power in 2007.
But a recent visit by Erdogan -- to be followed by a Sarkozy trip to Ankara -- may signal a shift in Turkey's favour.
"The most significant outcome of Erdogan's visit is Sarkozy's acceptance of his invitation to [visit] Turkey late this year," Dr. Cengiz Aktar of Bahcesehir University in Istanbul told SETimes.
"Since he assumed the presidency, Sarkozy has changed his mind on almost all policy topics but Turkey," Aktar said. "But recently he is under growing pressure from the French business sector, which has almost lost all competitiveness in the Turkish market against its rivals.
We can foresee that Sarkozy is now also looking for ways to turn away from strong opposition to Turkey."
Erdogan said that he and the French president discussed all aspects of bilateral relations, including economic and military ties, along with the possibility of co-operating to address regional and global problems.
"I hope we will host Mr. Sarkozy in Turkey late this year and discuss in more detail, our steps for the future," Erdogan said.
Turkey and France are NATO allies and enjoy similar views on many foreign policy issues.
Yet the last French official to call on Turkey was former President Francois Mitterrand, in 1992.
Sarkozy's immediate predecessor, President Jacques Chirac, was viewed as a friend of Turkey.
With Chirac's backing, Turkey began membership negotiations with the EU in 2004.
But Sarkozy has openly challenged Turkey's full membership and blocked the opening of five of the necessary 35 chapters of accession talks.
The fact that Ankara could not get strong political support from France in efforts to resolve the Cyprus dispute is another source of trouble.
Aktar says it is not France that opposes membership for Turkey, but "Sarkozy's France".
"Sarkozy only aims at getting the support of voters who fear Islam, and he thinks he can manage this by opposing Turkey," Aktar said. "If Sarkozy loses the 2012 elections, France will have a new policy towards Turkey -- whether by a president elected from left or right."
Other EU members such as Britain, Italy and some northern European countries strongly support full EU membership for Turkey, stressing its geo-strategic importance as a bridge to the Muslim world.
Germany, however, has only offered "privileged partnership" status for Turkey, which falls short of full membership and is thus unacceptable to Ankara.
One of Turkey's strongest supporters for EU inclusion is Spain, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the bloc.
Diego Lopez Garrido, the Spanish secretary of state for European affairs, recently said that accession chapters on education and food safety would likely be opened for Turkey by year's end.
Bosnian Serb Lawmakers Urge Karadzic to Surrender Immediately
The Republika Srpska Parliament is urging all war crimes indictees, including Radovan Karadzic, to surrender immediately or face arrest.
In a resolution adopted Tuesday, it also asked the government to work towards meeting obligations to The Hague tribunal.

The parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) Serb-run entity, Republika Srpska (RS), has called on all indicted war crimes suspects, including wartime Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, to turn themselves in immediately, or face arrest.
In a resolution on RS's co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) adopted late on Tuesday (20 July), lawmakers also asked the entity's government to take immediate steps towards meeting its obligations to The Hague-based tribunal.
According to Reuters, the document, proposed by RS President Dragan Cavic, was supported by a huge majority of the MPs in the entity's 83-seat assembly.
The international community has made it clear that BiH's chances for Euro-Atlantic integration hinge on full co-operation with the ICTY, including the handover of suspects indicted for war crimes committed during the 1992-1995 conflict.
RS has yet to arrest a single war crimes fugitive, and its lack of co-operation with the tribunal recently cost BiH an invitation to join NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme.
Karadzic, who is among 20 ICTY-indicted suspects still at large, has been on the run since 1996 and is reportedly hiding in the mountainous parts in the country's east, aided by a network of supporters.
Following NATO's decision to postpone BiH's admission to the PfP, the top international envoy in BiH, Paddy Ashdown, announced a package of wide-ranging measures targeting the country's stalled co-operation with the ICTY.
As part of the measures, 59 Bosnian Serb officials believed to be obstructing the process were dismissed.
Among them were Dragan Kalinic, the RS parliamentary speaker and leader of the Serb Democratic Party (SDS) founded by Karadzic, and Zoran Djeric, the entity's interior minister in charge of police.
Tuesday's resolution urged the government to make all necessary changes within the interior ministry to ensure that the entity's police forces are operationally capable of capturing war crimes indictees.
It also called for drafting a bill that would establish an institute tasked with the investigation, documentation and assessment of crimes committed during the conflict in BiH.
Voicing their full support for BiH's Euro-Atlantic integration through NATO's PfP and the EU's Stabilisation and Association Process, the MPs also urged "all elected representatives of all constituent peoples in BiH to condemn the war crimes committed by the representatives of their peoples".
Earlier in the day, 44 of the lawmakers attending Tuesday's special session elected Dusan Stojicic, 40, as the parliament's new speaker.
An SDS spokesman, he is not considered to be among those helping Karadzic evade justice, the AP reported.
Also on Tuesday, Ashdown urged RS to apply immediately the BiH Constitutional Court's February ruling on geographical names.
In a letter sent to RS Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic, he warned that legal amendments recently passed by the RS cabinet removing the prefix "Srpski" had stopped short of full compliance with the court's decision.
In particular, he noted that the cabinet had left in place the double reference Foca/Srbinje for the municipality of Foca.
The court's ruling was final and compulsory, Ashdown said, adding that Mikerevic bore personal responsibility for ensuring compliance.
Crvenkovski, Gruevski strike deal on ambassadorial appointments
Overlapping responsibilities between the presidency and government have left Macedonia without ambassadors in several countries, but a solution has now been found.
By Zoran Nikolovski for Southeast European Times in Skopje - 26/09/07

After a year-long impasse, President Branko Crvenkovski and Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski have finally reached an agreement on staffing Macedonian diplomatic missions throughout the world.
Poor co-operation between the two leaders has hampered progress in this area, and many Macedonian embassies currently do not have ambassadors.
On Monday (September 24th), Gruevksi appeared at a press conference and accepted the president's proposal that ambassadors should be selected only from a list of professional career diplomats.
The foreign ministry will now draw up a list of job vacancies and deliver it to Crvenkovski.
Currently, Macedonia is without ambassadors to Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Britain, Denmark, Montenegro, Qatar, Romania, Serbia and Spain.
In addition, the country does not have an ambassador to the UN, and the ambassadors to Greece, Ukraine and NATO have had to stay on past the end of their terms.
Two other ambassadors -- to the Netherlands and Switzerland -- have been recalled, leaving those posts vacant as well.
According to Gruevski, the situation has not caused serious damage.
The foreign minister has appointed officials who can perform all the duties of an ambassador, he told reporters.
The stalemate was a byproduct of the way Macedonia's constitution distributes responsibilities between the presidency and the government.
The government nominates ambassadors and consular officials, but it is up to the president to accept the nominations.
Under current law, two thirds of the ambassadors must be career diplomats, while the remainder may come from the ranks of distinguished public figures or politicians with a partisan background.
The deal between Crvenkovski and Gruevski may signal better co-operation between the two branches, analysts say.
It comes after open criticism by NATO and the EU, which say political dialogue must be improved to resolve various issues.
The Macedonian public, meanwhile, hopes that removing roadblocks to ambassadorial appointments will help the country improve its representation abroad and attract foreign investment, which is part of an ambassador's duties.
World Bank lists Croatia, Macedonia, Bulgaria among top reformers
Countries in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union reformed the most in 2006-2007, the World Bank said in an annual report.

Economic reforms implemented between April 2006 and June 2007 have allowed Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to surpass East Asia in terms of ease of doing business, the World Bank said in a new report, released Wednesday (September 26th).
Some countries in the region have passed many Western European economies in this area, it added.
Three Balkan countries -- Croatia, Macedonia and Bulgaria -- were named among the top ten reformers in the world in the Bank's fifth annual Doing Business report.
The group, led by Egypt and including also Ghana, Georgia, Colombia, Saudi Arabia, Kenya and China, accounted for nearly a fifth of all 200 pro-business reforms introduced in 98 of the surveyed 178 economies in 2006-2007.
"The results show that as governments ease regulations for doing business, more entrepreneurs go into business," said Simeon Djankov, lead author of the report. "Eastern Europe has witnessed a boom in new business entry that rivals the rapid growth in East Asia in the past."
Croatia is among the top ten performers for a second year in a row, thanks to efforts to improve the conditions for starting and closing a business, registering property and getting credit -- four of the 10 areas studied by the report.
"Two years ago registering a property in Croatia took 956 days.
Now it takes 174," the Bank said.
Still well behind Singapore -- the most business friendly country in the world -- Croatia now ranks 97th in the world, up from 124th last year.
Macedonia, which implemented reforms to speed up company startup, ease the licensing regime and cut or simplify taxes, moved 17 places up the global scale to take the 75th position in this year's ranking.
Bulgaria -- the 10th on the top reformer list -- has emerged as a leader among the countries in Southeast Europe (SEE) in terms of ease of doing business, and is now 46th on the list.
Reforms in the areas of dealing with licenses, paying and enforcing contracts allowed the country to move up nine places.
Of the other SEE countries, Romania, Turkey and Greece also have improved their rankings, while Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Montenegro and Serbia moved down the ladder.
Romania ranks 48th, Turkey is 57th and Greece is 100th.
Of the three, Turkey has made the greatest progress, moving up 34 places.
Bulgaria and Romania, which joined the EU in January, are ahead of four other older members of the Union -- Italy, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Greece.
Reforms appear to have slowed down in Serbia, which now ranks 86th among the 178 countries in the world, down from its 68th position last year.
In the Bank's 2005 report, Serbia-Montenegro topped the list of countries that had done the most to improve the climate for doing business.
Albania ranks lowest among the SEE countries.
It is 136th now, 16 positions down the ranking it was given last year.
Montenegro is 81st and BiH is 95th.
Besides Singapore, the other 24 countries seen as best for doing business are New Zealand, the United States, Hong Kong (China), Denmark, the United Kingdom, Canada, Ireland, Australia, Iceland, Norway, Japan, Finland, Sweden, Thailand, Switzerland, Estonia, Georgia, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Latvia, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, and Austria.
Turkish Tourism on the Rise
Fears of terrorism, SARS and war in Iraq all had a negative impact on the tourist season in Turkey.
However, the industry recovered in July, which saw a record number of visitors.
By Fatih Baran for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 23/09/03
Prospects for Turkish tourism, bright in 1996 and especially in 1997, deteriorated in the years that followed because of the threat of terrorism and bad publicity resulting from the 1999 earthquake.
The capture of Abdullah Ocalan in 1999 quieted the armed conflict between the government and the outlawed Kurdistan Worker's Party, boosting the tourism sector.
War in Iraq, however, awakened fears of returning to the bad old days, and the sector has been struggling to offset the negative impact through last-minute sales.
Turkey hosted a record number of tourists in July, compensating for losses in May and June.
Bed capacity usage has reached 100 per cent in Antalya, Turkey's premier resort region, though other well-known resorts such as Bodrum, Marmaris and Kusadisi are still lagging.
Representatives of the tourist sector hope that August and September turn out to be record-breaking months.
That would alleviate some of the disappointment resulting from failure to meet targets for the season set by the tourism ministry, which ran a worldwide promotional campaign targeting central European countries and the Commonwealth of Independent States.
At the start of the season, the ministry estimated that 15 million tourists would spend their holidays in Turkey, leading to $13 billion in revenues.
However, indicators now show that the number of tourists visiting Turkey declined by about 2.45 per cent in the period between October 2002 and July 2003, compared to the same period last year, while total tourism-related revenues decreased by 7.2 per cent.
Fear of terrorism, the outbreak of SARS and war in Iraq all contributed to the shortfall, leading to mass cancellations of holiday plans worldwide.
Representatives of the Turkish tourist industry also say that accommodation prices were too low.
Almost all the five-star hotels used an "all-inclusive" system, which affected revenues.
Of all the tourists who visited Turkey between October and July, the largest number came from Germany, followed by Russia, England, Holland, Bulgaria, France, Iran, Austria, Greece and Belgium.
Figures from the tourism ministry show, however, that the overall number of tourists coming from OECD countries declined 8 per cent, while the number of tourists coming from Eastern Europe increased by over 12 per cent, compared to last year's figures for the same period.
During the entire 2002 season, around 13.2 million tourists visited Turkey, generating revenues of $8.4 billion.
Turkish tourism representatives have projected 25 million tourists in 2010 and revenues of $20 billion.

European Commission (EC) Enlargement Directorate Director-General Michael Leigh arrived in Bulgaria on Monday (December 8th) in an attempt to reduce tension after the EC withheld the accreditation of two agencies that managed PHARE money.
The move led to the loss of 220m euros in funding for Bulgaria.
Sofia accuses the EC of double standards and of exploiting Bulgaria in the forthcoming elections for the European Parliament and a new commission in June 2009.
The UN envoy in the name talks between Greece and Macedonia, Matthew Nimetz, met informally Friday (December 5th) with Macedonia's new representative in the talks, Zoran Jolevski.
They discussed plans for the next round of discussions between Athens and Skopje, though the exact date is unclear.
Belgium will extend the current restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian workers in its labour market by another three years, Employment Minister Joelle Milquet announced on Friday (December 5th).
Milquet cited the "economic crisis" and "risk of an increase in unemployment" as reasons.
The restrictions expire December 31st 2011.
Romanians and Bulgarians can work in Belgium but only in regions short of labour.
Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski met on Saturday (December 6th) with Polish counterpart Donald Tusk in Gdansk.
They discussed bilateral relations and ways to boost co-operation.
Tusk supports Skopje's bid to join the EU.
Gruevski briefed him on Macedonia's progress in Union-related reforms.
Albanian Defence Minister Gazmend Oketa was in Washington to discuss bilateral military ties Thursday (December 4th).
The United States called on Albania to continue its participation in peacekeeping missions in Afghanistan and Iraq, Oketa said after meeting with US Deputy Defence Secretary Gordon England.
Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov pledged his country's support for Albania's EU and NATO integration processes at a meeting with Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha on Wednesday (December 3rd) in Tirana.
The two leaders agreed that bilateral relations are excellent.
Berisha said Albania is following Bulgaria's example as a country that successfully managed to integrate into the EU and NATO.

Bulgaria Takes Over OSCE Chairmanship-in-Office
Combating terrorism and improving border security will top the agenda of Bulgaria's one-year chairmanship of the OSCE. Foreign Minister Solomon Passy, who will act as chairman of the 55-nation organisation in 2004, is to present the priorities in mid-January.

Strengthening international co-operation in the fight against terrorism will top the agenda of Bulgaria's one-year chairmanship of the OSCE. Foreign Minister Solomon Passy, who will lead the 55-nation organisation's activities in 2004, will present his country's programme of chairmanship in mid-January.
During its OSCE leadership, Bulgaria will seek to achieve a better balance between the political and military, economic and environmental, and human dimensions of the organisation through further enhancement of activities in those areas, the Bulgarian OSCE chairmanship Web site notes.
Bulgaria's envoy to the Vienna based organisation, Ivo Petrov, said Friday (2 January) that his country would continue work on the priorities of the Romanian, Portuguese and Dutch OSCE chairmanships.
He cited combating terrorism and human trafficking as two of the most important issues during Bulgaria's term at the helm.
Improving the security of travel documents and border controls will be another priority issue during Bulgaria's OSCE chairmanship, according to Voice of America.
Quoting sources close to the OSCE, the news agency said Bulgaria also wants to see stronger co-operation with Afghanistan, the organisation's newest partner.
Activities in this area could include promoting education and police training, as well as assisting Kabul in preparations for the country's first elections in 2004.
Viewing education as a key factor for security and sustainable development, Bulgaria says it will promote education as one of its main priorities.
"The challenge for the OSCE chairman in the coming year is to further address the threats to security and stability and to further promote the basic principles and values that unite us," Passy said in a special message in early December.
On Thursday, he assumed the post of OSCE Chairman-in-Office from his Dutch counterpart, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, the new NATO Secretary General.
"The Bulgarian Chairmanship in 2004 is prepared to work together with all participating states to provide continuity in the achievement of these major goals," Passy said.
According to the Bulgarian chairmanship Web site, Sofia will also focus on the further improvement of the synergy between the chairmanship, the OSCE institutions, the organisation's field presences and the Secretariat in order to increase efficiency in implementing their respective mandates.
Bulgaria's bid for the 55-nation organisation's rotating one-year function was approved unanimously at the 10th OSCE Ministerial Council in Porto, Portugal, in December 2002.
"It is a voluntary system.
It is not like the EU where it rotates according to a pre-arranged plan," OSCE spokesman Richard Murphy told the VOA.
"Basically you put your hand up and say 'I will do it' and Bulgaria put its hand up a few years ago and said we'd like to do in 2004 and everybody else agreed."
In 2003, Passy was a member of the OSCE Troika along with de Hoop Scheffer and Portugal's foreign minister, whose country will take over the OSCE chairmanship on 1 January 2005.
Macedonia Tree Day encourages ecological awareness, regional co-operation
A new initiative centred on creating and protecting forests as well as uniting peoples is fast becoming a Balkan exercise in co-operation.
By Misko Taleski for Southeast European Times in Skopje -- 25/11/11

Citizens planted nearly six million trees in over 400 locations throughout Macedonia as part of the Tree Day -- Plant Your Future event Wednesday (November 23rd).
An estimated 250,000 people participated.
Internationally-renowned opera singer Boris Trajanov, who established Tree Day, told SETimes the event has gained such popularity it may well turn into a pan-European, and, he hopes, a global ecological holiday in coming years.
"This project raises awareness so that citizens act to protect and improve the environment long-term by planting and nurturing trees.
It also enables Macedonia to make so far symbolic steps to bring closer the Balkan and other peoples," Trajanov said.
He explained that he conceived of the idea after witnessing the catastrophic fires in Macedonia and the region in 2006 and 2007.
Moved by the apocalyptic scenes, he spontaneously told the media that a day of mourning should be proclaimed for the decimated forests, and appealed for mass foresting of "naked" hills and valleys.
The statement hit a nerve and awakened many who tried to contact him.
Soon, Trajanov established a citizens' initiative, an association, with an ever growing network of supporters.
"But instead of a day of mourning, we established a day of joy for the new and future forests," he said.
Democratic Renewal of Macedonia (DOM), a green party in the ruling coalition, supports this and similar initiatives because they contribute to ensuring a more secure future for the environment and the people.
"Knowing that one ten-year-old tree produces daily oxygen sufficient for one person, we are cognizant that planting new trees is more than necessary," DOM President Ljiljana Popovska told SETimes.
Popovska said DOM wants to see this initiative extend to cities where the concentration of people and pollution is greater.
Last year, at the Conference on Climate Change in Copenhagen, the Balkan countries accepted Macedonia's proposal to turn Tree Day into a regional project.
"We obtained agreement from six Balkan states to organise Tree Day jointly as 'Balkan Tree Day'.
This will create a different, more positive Balkan image.
Instead of associating us with conflict, the region will be known as a leader in planting trees, a defender of the eco-system," Trajanov said.
Prior to the Copenhagen decision, on March 30th, foresting took place in 14 Macedonian border regions, including the municipalities of Peshkopeja in Albania; Polikastro and Aksiopoli in Greece; Strumjani and Kustendil in Bulgaria.
Foresting in Macedonia is conducted by the public company Macedonian Forests and it has included Tree Day as part of its action plan.
This year, the company celebrates the UN decision to proclaim 2011 as the International Year of the Forests via Tree Day.
"Of the already planted 38 million trees, over 65% have been successful -- an excellent percentage in foresting.
The European standards consider an average of 35% successful.
In the first years the planting had a smaller percentage of success, but now we have a comprehensive approach and achieve a greater quality," Macedonian Forests Director Zharko Karadzoski told SETimes.
Karadzoski explained Macedonian authorities plan to export ready-to-plant trees to regional countries because many do not have enough seeds and other required planting materials.
"Macedonian Forests possesses enough forest tree material and is ready to assist other countries, primarily Kosovo and Bulgaria, to help enliven the project.
Still, the countries should first address the issue legally, in line with established practices of mutual co-operation," Karadzoski said.
Authorities estimate that including the last Tree Day, citizens have planted 44 million trees.
Macedonia treats its forests as a national treasure and heritage protected by the constitution.
The country has signed and ratified numerous international agreements and conventions that affect the forestry sector.
Although conceived and organised by the civil sector, Tree Day has continually been supported by the Macedonian government, including all ministries, the Agency for Local Self-government, municipalities and the public company Macedonian Forests.
This year, ambassadors serving in Macedonia also participated in Tree Day.
EC seeks stronger powers over eurozone members
The European Commission presented a package of new measures that would, inter alia, allow it to monitor the eurozone countries' finances more closely.
By Svetla Dimitrova for Southeast European Times -- 25/11/11

The European Commission (EC) tabled on Wednesday (November 23rd) two new regulations that would boost its powers over the national budgets of the 17 eurozone members and allow it to strengthen its supervision of members facing serious financial difficulties.
They were part of a package aimed at resolving the crisis in the euro area that includes an annual growth survey defining the EU's economic priorities for 2012 and a plan containing three options for the introduction of common euro "Stability Bonds".
"To return to growth, [EU] member states need to raise their game when it comes to implementing their commitments to structural reforms, as well as embrace deeper integration for the euro area," EC President Jose Manuel Barroso said.
"The goals driving this package -- economic growth, financial stability, budgetary discipline -- are linked to each other," he added at a joint news conference with EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn. "We need all of them, if we are to move beyond the current emergency, towards a Europe in which solidarity is balanced by strengthened responsibility."
Under one of the two new regulations it proposed, the eurozone countries would have to submit their draft budgets for the forthcoming year to the Commission and the Eurogroup first, and then to their own parliaments.
They would do that no later than October 15th, when they have to make their budgetary plans for the following 12-month period public.
The second legislative measure would allow the EC to place eurozone nations experiencing grave financial problems or receiving assistance from others in the area, in its rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, or under bailout programmes with the IMF under enhanced surveillance.
The idea for the issuance of common Eurobonds as one of the means for alleviating the eurozone debt crisis was floated earlier this year.
The EC launched the debate on the matter on Wednesday with a 38-page Green Paper offering a detailed analysis of three options for the full or partial replacement of national bonds by Stability Bonds, backed by all 17 countries in the euro club.
A final decision is expected after a broad consultation with all relevant stakeholders, due to close on January 8th.
The idea for common Eurobonds has been rejected by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who reiterated her opposition to it on Wednesday.
She has also been resisting calls for expanding the European Central Bank's (ECB) role in efforts to deal with the debt crisis.
"It is extremely troubling, I might say inappropriate, that the Commission is now focusing on proposals on Eurobonds in different varieties," Merkel was quoted as saying in comments at the German parliament.
At the auction the same day, Germany was able to sell just 3.9 billion euros worth of ten-year securities out of the 6 billion euros it offered to the market.
The setback raised concerns that Europe's powerhouse is unlikely to avoid being scarred by the crisis.
Threats that France, the second-largest economy among the 17 in the euro area, could lose its triple-A credit rating have increased recently.
"As the crisis deepens with yesterday's bond auction, the veil has been torn off Merkel's policy of muddling through," Bloomberg quoted Sebastian Dullien, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, as saying in a telephone interview Thursday. "It's only got us closer to the end-game: either the breakup of the euro or euro bonds.
The strategy has failed."
One of Berlin's main arguments against the joint Eurobonds idea is that it will deter countries with big sovereign debts from settling their financial problems.
Petar Ganev, senior economist at the Institute for Market Economics (IME), a Sofia-based think-tank, said on Wednesday he expects a serious debate in the coming weeks.
"Obviously there are different positions on the issue," he told SETimes. "The problem with the huge debts amassed by individual member states can hardly be solved by accumulating new debt by all eurozone countries taken as a whole.
It is somewhat naïve to believe that new debt can help settle the difficulties posed by existing debt, which has risen to a level that makes it unsustainable."
Other experts and analysts believe that the Eurobonds would be a key element of steps to resolve the debt crisis in the eurozone, but stressed the need for additional measures.
"We have a panic regarding peripheral debt and thus a liquidity crisis [for both sovereigns and banks]," Daniel Gros, director of the Brussels-based Centre for European Policy Studies, told SETimes. "Only the ECB can alleviate the liquidity crisis.
But the ECB might do this only if there is more fiscal integration and Eurobonds.
So Eurobonds might be an essential element of any crisis resolution."
Former Romanian Finance Minister Daniel Daianu voiced doubt that the eurozone would be able to survive the current crisis unless it moves quickly to revamp its common policy and takes steps towards deeper fiscal integration.
But fiscal rules are far from being sufficient; they cannot be a substitute for a solid fiscal arrangement that must include a common treasury," he told SETimes.
"Appointing also a finance czar, who should make judgments and recommend penalties, is not enough either ...
The eurozone, in particular, needs a rounded up common policy in order to survive."
That policy should provide for "deep financial integration via a common regulation and supervision of financial entities, as well as joint resolution mechanisms", Daianu explained, noting also the need for "a common treasury", which would involve joint Eurobonds.
All that would require deeper political integration as well, according to him.
"A monetary union cannot function properly [survive] without adequate fiscal underpinnings (including burden-sharing arrangements), a common regulation and supervision of financial markets," Daianu stressed. "Eurobonds would be a radical step to this end."
EU leaders are expected to discuss the package and related ideas during their summit on December 9th.

Hungarian President Laszlo Solyom discussed minority issues with his Serbian and Croatian counterparts Boris Tadic and Ivo Josipovic in the southern Hungarian town of Pecs on Friday (April 16th).
The leaders agreed on the idea of a "cultural nation", describing a community of ethnic groups with the common language and culture but with different citizenship, Solyom explained.
Josipovic stressed that EU enlargement is the only guarantee of stability in Europe.
Without "Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro," Josipovic said, "Europe's integration will not be accomplished."
The wave of volcanic ash blowing across Europe led NATO Military Committee Chairman Giampaolo di Paola to cancel his visit to Kosovo, due to delays in international air traffic, KFOR said in a statement Monday (April 19th).
Only Allied Joint Force Command Naples Commander Mark Fitzgerald managed to arrive in Pristina to observe a Kosovo Security Forces drill at a thermoelectric power plant near Pristina.
Bulgaria backs Serbia in its EU integration process, Bulgarian Parliament Speaker Tsetska Tsacheva said during a meeting with her Serbian counterpart Slavica Dukic-Dejanovic on Monday (April 19th).
Any help from the Bulgarian parliament would be welcomed and appreciated, said Dukic-Dejanovic on a one-day visit to Sofia, were she met with Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov and other members of government.
They focused on bilateral issues including infrastructure and environmental problems.
European integration and economic co-operation are priorities for Macedonia and Albania, the two countries' leaders announced in Skopje, on Wednesday (April 14th).
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov and visiting Albanian counterpart Bamir Topi called for strengthening co-operation in the economic sector.
Topi praised the role of ethnic Albanian political parties in Macedonia and urged full implementation of the Ohrid Agreement.
He also voiced support for Skopje's NATO bid.
Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman and Romanian counterpart Teodor Baconschi discussed bilateral security and economic ties during a meeting in Bucharest on Wednesday (April 14th).
During a three-day visit to Bucharest, Lieberman also met with President Traian Basescu, visited the Holocaust Memorial and met with members of Romania's Jewish community.
Croatia will be able to open the judiciary negotiation chapter soon, Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen said at a news conference with visiting Croatian counterpart Jadranka Kosor on April 13th.
Croatia has fulfilled all conditions for opening this chapter, said Kosor, noting her country's efforts to fight corruption, reform the judiciary and co-operate with The Hague war crimes tribunal.
She said Zagreb will do its best to wrap up EU accession talks this year.

Romania aims to quadruple EU funds absorption
Can the country make big improvements to the way it utilises EU funds?
Leonard Orban, head of a new ministry focused on this task, explains what's involved.
By Paul Ciocoiu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest -- 25/11/11
Minister Leonard Orban (left) talks with SETimes correspondent Paul Ciocoiu. [Victor Barbu/SETimes]
Former EU Commissioner Leonard Orban was recently appointed to head Romania's newly created European Affairs Ministry, which is to deal with efficient use of available EU funds.
Romania has found itself at the very bottom among members of the bloc when it comes to his issue.
SETimes correspondent Paul Ciocoiu spoke to Orban about the challenges involved.
SETimes: Is the decision to found a ministry specially dedicated to drawing EU funds a belated one?
Leonard Orban: My simple answer is better later than never.
SETimes: Did you assess the problems leading to poor utilisation of EU funds?
What went wrong?
Orban: Of course we did an assessment, including what is going on at the structures and authorities that manage EU funds.
Based on this evaluation we decided to take a series of measures meant to finally increase the absorption rate.
There are a multitude of problems and difficulties -- insufficient administrative capacity and a certain lack of experience in this field.
We have noticed differences among the state institutions and that those state structures that have done better are those that managed funds before Romania joined the EU, namely pre-accession funds.
The others encounter bigger difficulties in managing these funds.
At the same time, we have found difficulties that the recipients run into when preparing and then implementing their projects.
These difficulties relate to procedures that are more complicated than usual.
Also, difficulties related to the hesitant involvement of the private sector, such as the banking sector in this field.
But let me say it clearly: we are also facing, to put it diplomatically, certain irregularities in the system.
SETimes: Do you have any statistics concerning fraudulent projects?
Orban: Not us, but those who deal with such cases.
The anti-fraud department has a clear view of the projects under investigation, or those against which a legal case is being bought.
But if they exist, either number is not significant.
SETimes: But are we looking at a decreasing number?
We do not really have terms of comparison here because the more we propose to attract larger funds the bigger the risk of running into such cases.
There have been problems concerning public acquisitions that the European Commission has found to be systematic.
Thus, we have radically changed this system.
SETimes: What does the public acquisition system consist of and what are the main measures taken to correct it?
Orban: The measures are under way, both legislative changes that are already in place and changes in the system.
The latter include the two state structures that deal in the public acquisitions in the EU funds managing mechanism.
That means the two institutions from now on will be held responsible.
Thus far, regardless of the decision they took no one was held accountable.
Now they joined the system and their activity is audited and has to be corrected if flaws are found so as to make these institutions responsible.
To achieve these changes, we risked being suspended from EU fund payments for six months, a move that would have blocked the activity for the next year's first semester.
This is why reforming the public acquisition system is by far our first priority.
SETimes: What are your main objectives during your term?
As concerns absorption of EU funds, I have established, as a goal, reaching an absorption rate of a minimum 20% by 2013.
That means effectively spending 3.1 billion euros from this very moment until the end of 2012.
Compare that figure to the 716m euros spent so far.
SETimes: Some in the EU argue those countries that do not manage to attract a significant amount of the funds allotted from the 2007-2013 EU budget should receive less from 2014-2020 budget.
Orban: Yes, this is an argument used by those member states, net contributors, who want to reduce their share of the EU budget.
Why give Romania, Bulgaria and other countries so much money when the absorption rate is so low?
We, in turn, will have to present two counter arguments.
First, we will have to improve the internal situation by raising the absorption rate; and second, it is the EU's poorer states that need this money the most, granted through the cohesion policy.
It is in the EU's best interest to blur the differences between developed and less developed states.
With no cohesion, the EU cannot move forward.
SETimes: Do you think Romania would have weathered the economic crisis better if it had been able to draw more EU funds?
Orban: Absolutely!
I am looking at Poland, which has managed to maintain a high level of EU funds absorption.
They admitted the economic growth it generated was larger than they expected.
And they did not invest only in infrastructure, but in projects that generated economic growth.
Of course, for a country such as Romania, infrastructure is essential.
It is a pre-condition.
In parallel, we need to invest in fields that generate development, that have a multiplier role for the economy.
SETimes: Romanians see the EU funds field as very entangled and bureaucratic.
Have you considered relaxing the procedures and the project selection criteria?
Orban: It was not simple to draw these funds.
We deal with complicated procedures and many other difficulties that are hard to remove.
But I personally have noticed an improvement and a perspective of a more rapid advance in this field, at least in terms of road infrastructure.
The procedures required by European regulations are also complicated.
But sometimes we have made these procedures more complicated than necessary.
One of the priorities is to simplify them and we are analysing this.
It is a thin line we are treading on because we have to be more flexible but rigorous at the same time.
The first condition is to ensure a rigorous financial management.
Thus, we will not simplify more than the case [allows] so as to endanger or to cast doubt on this rigorous financial management.
SETimes: There is a debate on a new administrative division of Romania.
One of the arguments in favour of this measure is that it will lead to a better absorption of the EU funds.
Orban: We have sometimes observed a lack of a systemic approach, one in which projects are submitted by different county councils that run counter to each other.
We have also noticed a lack of correlation among financed projects even within a county.
Creating larger entities, regions, can lead to a systemic approach and help identify those priorities that can be financed through EU funds.
The lack of correlation led to cases where a road construction project was followed by a main water pipe connection project so the newly built road had to be torn up.
Such examples are numerous, where there are many visions and options -- sometimes dictated by various interests -- and an agreement cannot be reached.
As a result, we find ourselves compelled sometimes to withdraw the financing of projects that cannot be implemented in time.
Serbia sails through IMF review, ahead of elections
The IMF's first review under the precautionary stand-by arrangement went well.
But the big question remains: how closely will the ruling coalition manage the purse strings during the upcoming election?

This month's IMF Mission to Belgrade, led by Mark Allen, representative for Central and Eastern Europe, performed its first review under the precautionary stand-by arrangement worth 1.2 billion euros, which Serbia negotiated on September 29th.
So far, so good.
The agreement is being honoured and the Serbian banking system is stable.
Due to the leadership of the National Bank of Serbia and a good capital base among banks in the pre-crisis period, inflation is dropping while public spending is being kept in check.
The IMF Mission left Belgrade with assurances that the hole in the Serbian budget will shrink in 2012 to a lower level than the 4.5% of GDP agreed on for this year.
And Serbia remains satisfied with a higher approved deficit, which had been capped at 3.9% in negotiations only three months ago.
These "approved" 25m euros mean a lot for Serbia's frail economy.
Thus, in December, Serbia will be able to draw on the first 190m-euro credit line, although National Bank of Serbia (NBS) Vice-Governor Ana Gligorijević says this money will only be spent in the event of domestic economic instability.
According to NBS analysis, Serbia is currently far from such a situation.
Inflation has been dropping since May, falling from its April level of 14.7% to 8.7% in October, compared to the same period year on year.
At the Central Bank, they hope that the planned goal for 2011 of 4.5% ± 1.5% will be achieved in the first quarter of 2012.
The problem is that the inflation rate is still largely dependent on two things: the success of the agricultural harvest, and how much the state will raise the undervalued prices of electricity, gas, utilities, and food staples, which it controls directly or indirectly.
The current inflationary trend is encouraging.
It allowed the NBS to further drop its key policy rate by as much as 225 base points (2.5 percentage points) since the start of the year.
On the other hand, industrial production gives little reason for optimism.
Due to plummeting demand on the world market -- above all in the EU, where Serbia exports the majority of its products -- industry is subject to extreme pressures.
Economic growth this year will be capped at 2%, but is expected to drop to 1.5% next year, with forecasts of further possible contraction.
Vladimir Vučković, editor of the monthly economics bulletin, Macroeconomic Analysis and Trends (MAT), tells SETimes that "imports of raw materials are dropping, and this points to a deepening of the crisis in production.
In an optimistic scenario, industry would have a growth of 1%."
An even bigger cause for concern is the announced shut down of the second blast furnace at US Steel's factory in Smederevo.
The first has been idle for half a year.
The company is the biggest exporter in Serbia, responsible for around 16.5% of Serbia's total exports in the first nine months of this year.
In a country where unemployment is above 22%, this company alone employs 5,300 workers.
As he left Belgrade, the IMF's Allen raised a central issue: the likelihood of ramped up public spending heading into the parliamentary elections, as politicians work to woo voters.
The government says it plans to improve the collection of taxes, earn dividends from public enterprises and boost supervision of public procurement.
If this fails however, further international indebtedness would be virtually impossible.
"The current 7.25% interest on state Eurobonds is already too expensive for a country where annual GDP growth amounts to 1.5%," Economist Miroslav Prokopijević tells SETimes. "Spain and Italy -- as the next most problematic EU countries beside Greece -- pay interest of 6.6% to 7.1% so it is clear that for Serbia, even the much smaller.interest is not sustainable in the long term."
Papandreou vows to help Israel develop business ties with EU
ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister George Papandreou said on Thursday (February 10th) that he will help Israel develop its economic ties and co-operation with EU member states.
"This will be of great importance for the Israeli economy, but also for strategic security," Papandreou said in Athens, after a meeting with visiting representatives of the Jewish community in the United States.
Papandreou said Greece is interested in co-operating with Israel in the fields of tourism and defence. (Nafthemporiki, Eleftherotypia - 10/02/11)
World Bank warns about impact of aging populations
The countries in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union must carry out urgent reforms that will help mitigate the long-term economic impact of rapidly aging populations, the World Bank warned on Wednesday.

Economic growth in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union could come to a halt unless governments take quick steps to address the challenge of rapidly aging populations in the region, the World Bank warned on Wednesday (June 20th).
By 2025, many of the 28 countries in the region will have populations that are among the oldest in the world, the Bank said in a new report, "From Red to Gray: The Third Transition of Aging Populations in Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union".
Over the next two decades, the region's overall population is projected to shrink by almost 24 million people, according to the almost 300-page paper.
At the same time, the proportion of people over the age of 65 will be higher than in 2000.
In nine of the countries -- including Slovenia, Croatia, Bulgaria and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- between one fifth and one quarter of the population will be over 65 by 2025.
Unprecedented declines in fertility and rising life expectancies are two reasons for the populations to be rapidly aging and shrinking at the same time.
Bulgaria's population is expected to shrink by 18% over the next two decades, making it one of the countries facing the most significant decrease after Ukraine, which is expected to lose 24% of its current population. By 2025, Romania's population is likely to shrink by 10% and Croatia's by 5%.
Only eight of the countries in the region -- including Albania, Macedonia and Turkey -- will see populations grow over the next 20 years.
The proportion of those over 65 will grow at the fastest pace in BiH, where the elderly dependency ratio is expected to almost double by 2025.
By then, more than one in five Bulgarians will be over 65, and the average Slovene will be 47-years-old -- among the oldest in the world, said the report.
To accommodate the growing number of elderly, governments in many of the countries in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union will have to increase their pension expenditures.
Another expected consequence is that health care spending will have to grow to meet the higher demands of people in this group for ambulatory, in-patient and chronic care.
Besides the problem of rapid aging, the region also faces the challenges of relatively poor populations and an incomplete transition to mature market economies, the report said.
"Wealthier and more developed countries, such as France, Italy and Japan, are in much better shape to meet the challenges of aging than the countries in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union," World Bank Human Development Economics Manager Arup Banerji, and co-author of the report, said.
The best way to offset pension cost pressures, according to Bank experts, is to increase the retirement ages, which tend to be very low in the region, particularly in Albania, Romania, Serbia and Turkey.
Another suggestion is to change the formulas for how benefit rates are calculated.
"Though some increase in public expenditures is inevitable, it is possible to reduce the blow.
For that, the countries in the region need to put in policies to make pension systems financially sustainable even with more retirees, and to take proactive measures for financing long term care," another of the report's authors, World Bank Lead Economist Mukesh Chawla, said.
Strong productivity will be essential if the countries in the region are to continue to grow rapidly and achieve EU incomes and living standards, the report says.
These goals could be obtained by expanding financial markets, implementing reforms to make labour markets more flexible, by providing better education and promoting lifelong learning and innovation.
PIC board hopes to set the stage for BiH's future
Two weeks before the new high representative takes over, international officials accused political leaders in BiH of blocking reforms and the country's path to Europe.

The Peace Implementation Council Steering Board met in Sarajevo. [OHR]
The Peace Implementation Council (PIC) Steering Board expressed concern about the political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), during its meeting earlier this week in Sarajevo.
The board, which began a two-day meeting on Monday (June 18th), said the country's political leaders are responsible for the chaos because of their aggressive rhetoric and opposition to progress.
"Since April 2006, there has been a near total deadlock in peace implementation and the delivery of reforms required for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA)," the board said, referring to the first formal step towards EU membership.
The group praised High Representative Christian Schwartz-Schilling for his contributions during his mandate, but criticised him for allowing the political situation to deteriorate.
The international community will not tolerate the endangerment of the Dayton Peace Accord, and will not have a passive attitude towards provocative statements and actions, the board said in a declaration issued during the meeting.
The declaration outlines a strategy for incoming High Representative Miroslav Lajcak, who takes office on July 2nd.
The political deadlock in the country, as well as fears that possible independence for Kosovo may prompt a Serb secession movement, led the West to postpone the closure of the OHR office for a year and appoint Lajcak to take over the position.
The lack of progress -- especially in constitutional and police reforms -- threatens BiH's economic prospects.
The PIC is particularly disappointed with the blockade of constitutional reform.
The last effort to restart that process failed at the weekend when representatives of leading parties disagreed on a solution.
The PIC declaration said that signing the SAA with the EU must be the country's first priority.
For that to happen, there must be concrete progress in police reform and co-operation with The Hague tribunal.
PIC members also rejected recent rhetoric suggesting competencies should be returned from the state level to the entities.
Republika Srpska, under the leadership of Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, recently reiterated a threat to call a secession referendum if the autonomy of the region is weakened without its consent.
The Federation of BiH -- with the support of BiH presidency member Haris Silajdzic, has backed the dissolution of the country's ethnic-based lines.
Consolidation of state institutions must continue, the PIC said, with an obligation to transform jurisdictions from the entities to the state, so that all necessary reforms can be completed.
Members of the PIC steering board are the United States, Russia, Great Britain, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Turkey, which represents the organisation of Islamic countries, Holland and Spain, which have observer status, Portugal, which is taking over presidency of the EU, and a representative of the European Commission.
EU sparks employment action in Macedonia
The Macedonian government will create 2,800 jobs for civil servants by 2010 in order to meet the criteria for EU membership and establish a more effective administration.

The new initiative will give many educated young people jobs. [File]
In a move that aims to improve the workload capacity of Macedonia's administration, the government will employ 2,800 people by 2010.
The plan, part of the National Programme for Adoption of Acquis (NPAA), a key document in the country's relations with the EU, was sparked by the Union's criticism of the administration, and its lack of alignment with Euro-Atlantic standards.
The NPAA serves as a guide on how to harmonise a country with the European legislation, deadlines, institutions, how much money will be spent and how many people are employed.
Implementing the NPAA will cost the government about 210m euros.
The plan provides for employment of around 2,780 people, who will work to elevate crucial areas in the administration to EU recommendations.
In the next three years, the judiciary and fundamental rights sector, justice, freedoms and security sector, the environmental sector and the agriculture and rural development sector will all gain workers under the plan.
The Information Technology, food safety and regional policy sectors will also gain employees.
The public, however, is concerned that the move will further enlarge the state administration, which has already been criticised as being too robust and inefficient.
But Finance Minister Trajko Slavevski says there will be no new increases in absolute figures due to the retirement of 900-1,000 workers annually.
Rigorous criteria for employment in the state administration have been established, especially for the sector working on EU integration issues.
Experts will be employed to work on each chapter of the EU legislation.
The hiring plan will also reduce jobless rates.
Unemployment, which is around 37% in the country, according to official statistics, is a problem -- especially among highly educated professionals with university degrees.
Experts believe the NPAA will improve prospects, since young and educated people will be hired.
Turkey's Erdogan rejects accusations of government pressure on media
None of the 26 journalists arrested in Turkey last month were detained because of their professional activities, says the prime minister.

Addressing the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) on Wednesday (April 13th), Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan rejected allegations that his government has curbed freedom of expression.
The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has removed restrictions in this area, as part of the democratic reforms it has implemented since coming to power in 2002, he argued.
"We have attached utmost priority to the struggle against all forms of prohibitions and strengthened the fundamental rights and freedoms in the widest possible sense in the last eight and a half years," Erdogan said in his speech at the Strasbourg-based body.
"Recent allegations of pressures, restrictions or bans on the media and freedom of expression do not reflect the truth.
I have to say that some press organs that used to run stories on the order of some anti-democratic formations, in particular gangs and mafias, until eight years ago are continuing their publications freely today."
Addressing the recent arrests of 26 Turkish journalists as part of an ongoing investigation into Ergenekon, a covert criminal network accused of plotting to overthrow the government, Erdogan noted that none of them had been detained for their professional activities.
"We are aware that some of the recent detentions are perceived in Europe as an interference in the freedom of the press.
In this connection, I would also like to remind you that journalists and newspapers who applaud and provoke coups simply do not exist in Europe," the Turkish leader told PACE lawmakers.
He also invited the Council of Europe (CoE) to send its representatives to Turkey to assess the state of media freedom on the ground.
"We hope that Europe and European institutions will continue to follow-up developments on this subject, not based on news disseminated by certain circles, but rather through more objective sources and will evaluate the situation accordingly," said Erdogan.
Following talks with Erdogan, CoE Secretary-General Thorbjorn Jagland later said that he had accepted the invitation and would send an envoy to Turkey "as soon as possible" to assess the situation.
"This is a constructive approach and a move forward in the discussion about media freedom in Turkey,'' the head of the 47-nation rights organisation said.
Among the 26 arrested in March was investigative journalist Ahmet Sik, who was detained over suspected links with Ergenekon.
Police raided the offices of the publishing house that was planning to publish his book, The Imam's Army.
Acting on an Istanbul court's orders, they also confiscated all drafts of Sik's manuscript.
Nevertheless, a copy of the book was later published on the internet.
"I am not the person who ordered the seizure of that book," Erdogan said on Wednesday.
NATO and EUFOR Ready to Work Together in BiH
The commanders of SFOR and the new EU-led peacekeeping force (EUFOR) held a joint press conference Tuesday, affirming their readiness to work together to ensure a smooth transition and a high level of co-operation.

Following the UN Security Council's unanimous approval Monday (22 November) of the establishment of a European-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), the commander of the new force and his SFOR counterpart have announced they are ready to work together.
"This is a team effort between NATO, the EU and the BiH authorities. We are better together," SFOR commander, Brigadier General Steven P. Schook, said at a joint news conference Tuesday with EUFOR commander, Major General David Leakey.
"Once all the guidance and the ideas are sent from Brussels, we will work out details for the best way of doing this," he said.
SFOR will complete its mission on 2 December, having fulfilled its task of ensuring a safe and secure environment in BiH, Schook said.
He added that NATO's long-term political commitment to BiH remains unchanged, noting that the establishment of a headquarters under his command will constitute the Alliance's residual military presence in the country.
NATO headquarters in Sarajevo will continue to support BiH defence reform and will undertake other supporting tasks, including counterterrorism activities and assistance in the search for war criminals wanted by the UN tribunal at The Hague, Schook said.
The inauguration ceremony for NATO HQ Sarajevo will be held in conjunction with the inauguration ceremony for EUFOR at Camp Butmir on 2 December.
NATO's longest running peacekeeping mission has involved more than 500,000 troops from 43 countries over the last eight years.
EUFOR will have the same mandate as SFOR, but will also reinforce the EU's political engagement, assistance programmes and ongoing police and monitoring missions, to help BiH make further progress towards European integration.
The EU presence will be headed by the international community's top envoy to the country, High Representative Paddy Ashdown, who also holds the post of EU Special Representative to BiH.
His duties as High Representative will be transferred to the EU post.
Leakey said EUFOR would provide a robust, capable force of 7,000 troops from 33 countries, including 22 EU member states.
"The national contributions that are here are entirely the EUFOR's assets and capabilities," Leakey said. "All the operations that EUFOR will conduct here are exclusively the force's operations.
The Berlin Plus arrangement gives EUFOR the opportunity not to duplicate things like communications and information structure and architecture, the satellite networks and so on.
We are sharing intelligence, because NATO has a whole intelligence bank and facilities there.
Also, we are sharing some contract arrangements for basis support that NATO previously established."
Schook and Leakey both emphasised that the prime responsibility for the arrest of war crimes suspects lies with BiH authorities.
However, Leakey said, EUFOR will intensively continue the search, in conjunction with NATO HQ.
"We have very good co-ordination.
The job will get done," Leakey told reporters.
Turkey arrests over 40 in al-Qaeda crackdown
"Massive" terrorist attacks were planned, authorities say.
By Alakbar Raufoglu for Southeast European Times -- 14/04/11

Breaking up an al-Qaeda cell in the country, Turkish anti-terror police arrested more than 40 people in dozens of raids on Tuesday (April 12th), mainly in Istanbul.
"This is one of the routine, but very effective, operations conducted by the Turkish police," a government official told SETimes.
Halis Bayancuk, 26, considered one of the ringleaders of al-Qaeda in Turkey, is among the detained.
He is thought to have formerly belonged to the Hizbullah organisation, which has no links to the Lebanese Shi'ite group of the same name.
His father, Hacı Bayancuk, is suspected of being the mastermind behind the 2001 murder of Diyarbakir Police Chief Ali Gaffar Okkan and five other policemen.
Halis Bayancuk was detained in 2008 for leading a terrorist group, but was released in 2009.
Police found evidence that suspects established Sharia courts at home and did not allow their children to attend the secular schools.
After monitoring physical and wire activities of the group, the investigators concluded that members were planning to organise massive terrorist acts.
Sedat Laciner, a terrorism expert and head of the Ankara-based International Strategic Research Organisation, believes authorities have been tracking Halis Bayancuk and his associates for a long time.
"As a rule, when the danger is the highest, the police stop following them and start raids," he told SETimes.
Al-Qaeda is believed to have been behind several high-profile attacks in Istanbul, including four truck bombs in November 2003, targeting the British Consulate, the Turkish headquarters of HSBC bank and two synagogues, killing 57 people and wounding hundreds.
Police have accelerated regular operations against the militant group since July 2008, when three policemen and three assailants died in a gun battle outside the US consulate.
In January 2010, 120 alleged members of al-Qaeda were detained in Istanbul and other cities, possibly including senior members. There were similar raids in 2009.
"There are other possible links to al-Qaeda that can be found in our country," Laciner believes.
Until recently al-Qaeda was off the radar for many Turks, argues Sinan Ogan, chairman of the Turkish Centre for International Relations and Strategic Analysis.
"This week's operations showed us that the terrorists are more professional and quiet than we imagined," he told SETimes, urging the government to keep its eyes open.
Ogan is a parliamentary candidate for the right-wing National Movement Party.
Memet Yılmaz Helvacioglu, deputy chairman of parliament's National Security Commission, says the administration's efforts are on the right track, despite opposition criticism.
"We are doing our best and this is not only Turkey's problem," he said.
As a regional Muslim leader and Western ally, Ankara has strong credentials when it comes to fighting terrorism, he added.
Six terror suspects held in Greece
Police say a series of weekend arrests helped foil a planned terrorist attack.

Greek authorities said on Sunday (December 5th) that six individuals arrested as part of a police operation the previous day have been formally charged with belonging to a terrorist organisation and possession of arms and explosive materials.
The suspects, aged between 21 and 31, were detained during co-ordinated raids in Athens, the port of Piraeus, the western town of Agrinio and the southern Mediterranean island of Crete, Greek police chief Lefteris Oikonomou told reporters.
The authorities also indicated that Saturday's detentions helped foil a new terrorist attack, but would not provide any details about the timing or possible target of the planned assault.
"There were serious indications that a new terrorist attack was being planned, so we moved quickly to arrest these people," UPI quoted police spokesman Thanassis Kokkalakis as saying.
Two of the suspects -- Alexandros Mitrousias, 21, and George Karayiannidis, 30 -- are believed to be members of a group calling itself the Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire.
The organisation has claimed responsibility for a series of parcel bombs sent to embassies in Athens and several European leaders last month.
The other four were identified as Christos Politis, 31, Constantine Sakkas, Styliani Antoniou and Dimitrios Michail, all aged 26.
Sakkas and Mitrousias were the first to be apprehended during a raid on a safehouse in the Athens district of Nea Smyrni.
Antoniou, the only woman among the six, and Politis were arrested in two other districts in the Greek capital, while Karayiannidis was detained following a raid at a safehouse in Piraeus and Michail was held in Sitia, Crete.
Media reports quoted a police source as saying that a flat near the town of Agrinio served as another hideout.
According to state television NET, it had apparently been used as a transfer point for weapons smuggled from Albania.
Police said the explosives and weapons seized by the country's counter-terrorism division during Saturday's operation included 50kg of industrial-grade ANFO, 200 grams of TNT, eight handguns, four Kalashnikov assault rifles, three sub-machine guns, four hand grenades and a large cache of ammunition of various calibres.
They also confiscated an unspecified "big number of laptops and desktops", three pairs of car license plates, a bullet-proof vest, wigs, full face hoods and cellular phones.
Officials say Karayiannidis had a forged police identity card on him.
According to reports, police initially suspected that the weapons belonged to a far-left extremist group, Revolutionary Sect, believed to be responsible for the murders of an anti-terrorist police officer and investigative journalist Sokratis Giolas.
The group emerged after the riots following the death of teenager Alexis Grigoropoulos, who was killed by police in December 2008.
Revolutionary Sect gunned down Giolas in front of his pregnant wife in Athens in July.
The Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire was initially involved in arson attacks before turning to bombings in 2009.
Early ballistic tests have however failed to link the seized weapons to previous terrorist attacks.
"Tests conducted until now on the weapons found around Athens have not been matched to terrorist activity," the police said in a statement.
"The investigation continues to determine possible links to other punishable acts."
The weekend raids came ahead of several rallies planned for Monday to mark the second anniversary of Grigoropoulos's killing.
According to the AP, police have closed roads and have deployed several thousand officers around Athens.
Kosovo elections: what the parties have to say
European integration, the economy and honest government are some of the campaign themes ahead of the December 12th snap election.

With early elections around the corner, Kosovo officially kicked off a ten-day period of campaigning Wednesday (December 1st).
The election commission has certified 29 political parties and groups and a total of 1,265 candidates seeking seats in parliament.
Acting President Jakup Krasniqi launched the campaign process, telling voters that with these first general elections since declaring independence in February 2008, Kosovo "is entering, once again, in a difficult democratic test".
He underscored the need for stable institutions, capable of facing significant challenges ahead such as democratic and economic development, implementing the rule of law, membership in the UN and other international organisations and Euro-Atlantic integration.
He appealed to all political parties to campaign according to established rules, without provoking hatred or intolerance.
"The successful conclusion of the elections ... is a guarantee for building and consolidating the representative institutions, which will lead our country towards new and historic achievements," he said.
Incumbent Prime Minister Hashim Thaci has made the Euro-Atlantic perspective a cornerstone of his campaign.
He describes his Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) as "a party of integration, which will lead Kosovo towards ... NATO and the EU".
Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) leader Isa Mustafa told supporters that a victory by his party would ensure Kosovo has an "honest government, economic growth, integration in the EU and prestige ... in the world".
He has also vowed to fight for visa liberalisation and against organised crime.
The Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK), whose chairman, Ramush Haradinaj, is facing retrial for war crimes in The Hague, started its campaign by asking voters if they are better off now than before.
Blerim Shala, AAK deputy chairman says Kosovo has never had richer politicians in power and poorer citizens.
"We swear that in four years, you will live much better than today," Shala said.
Businessman Behgjet Pacolli's Alliance for New Kosovo is asking the public to change Kosovo's image.
Deputy chairwoman Mimoza Kusari-Lila said her party guarantees economic growth, new jobs, better education, better health care, the rule of law and much more.
The radical Vetevendosja (Self -determination) movement kicked off its campaign in Mitrovica saying the divided city is not the problem, but rather is the beginning of the solution to Kosovo's problems.
Movement leader Albin Kurti told supporters that the will of the people is bigger than that of institutions.
"That's why it should not be left out of the institutions; it should be inside and around them," he declared.
The new party FER (New Spirit) -- founded only in October -- played up its political infancy by choosing the monument NEWBORN as its symbol and vowing to "turn our words into concrete acts".
"Change starts with Kosovo citizens," said FER's Valdete Idrizi.
The European monitoring agency ENEMO has been on the ground throughout the campaign and will be working on Election Day as well, along with thousands of domestic observers monitoring the vote itself and afterwards, the count.
Supporting them are 70 long term observers from the network of NGOs Democracy in Action and 63 people monitoring campaign spending.
Visa liberalisation: is an exodus in store?
The EU does not want to see emigrants flooding into member states as a result of relaxed visa rules.
Some Albanians, though, say they have a right to claim political asylum.
By Erl Murati for Southeast European Times in Tirana – 06/12/10
New destinations have opened up for Albanians as a result of the EC's decision. [Reuters]
Starting on December 15th, Albanian citizens will be able to travel to the EU without a visa.
The European Council made that decision on November 8th, saying any Albanian who holds a biometric passport will be able to visit the EU member states for up to 90 days over six months, though there is no right to residence or work.
Brussels has no desire to see a mass influx of would-be immigrants.
"We have been very clear in saying that if there will be systematic abuses, I repeat systematic, the process will be revised.
Please, don't disappoint us," EU Justice and Internal Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said in Tirana after the move was announced.
The results of visa liberalisation for Macedonia and Serbia has triggered concern.
After the rules were eased for them, numerous ethnic Albanians from those two countries have requested political asylum in the EU.
Albania's interior minister, Lulzim Basha, has been campaigning hard to raise public awareness about the seriousness of the issue.
Through community meetings, leaflets, billboards and TV spots, the government has been driving home the message that breaching EU regulations can have consequences.
"We asked the citizens not to abuse the possibilty of free movement and avoid the chance of a penalty, " Basha told SETimes. "In any case, no one should abuse free movement and I am sure that these conditions will be respected."
According to a survey by the EUNACAL Institute and the Open Society Foundation, the number of Albanians travelling to EU countries will likely double after the eased visa regime goes into effect.
The Albanian Institute of International Studies, meanwhile, found that 21.9% of Albanians surveyed think visa liberalisation is very desirable because it opens up the possibility of working in member countries.
The same study found that 20% would like to travel outside Albania for study purposes, and 28% for purposes of taking up residence.
This is exactly the message Brussels does not want to hear.
Complicating the issue is the fact that many victims of persecution by Albania's former communist regime say the wrongs they suffered have never been redressed at home, giving them a rationale for claiming political asylum abroad.
"In Albania, we are a neglected class.
That is why we will ask collectively for political asylum in Brussels," Xhaferr Agaraj, a representative of the National Association for the Rehabilitation of Political Convicts in Albania, told SETimes.
A total of 1,800 people convicted by the old regime on political grounds are seeking compensation for the years spent in prison.
Disappointed with their treatment at home, many believe that Europe could somehow heal their pain.
Dubrovnik Declaration Sets Stage for Improved Scientific Research Co-operation
The COST conference, held in Dubrovnik, Croatia, set the stage for better scientific and technical co-operation among member states and institutions.
(EU, HINA - 27/05/03)
An intergovernmental organisation aiming to promote co-ordinated scientific and technological research in Europe completed its one-day ministerial conference in Croatia's coastal town of Dubrovnik on Tuesday (27 May), adopting a declaration that sets the stage for better co-operation among member states and institutions.
European Co-operation in the Field of Scientific and Technical Research (COST) was established by 19 European states in 1971.
Its goal is to promote the co-ordination of nationally funded research on a European level.
The conference in Dubrovnik, held at the invitation of Croatian President Stipe Mesic, brought together senior officials from the organisation's 35 member states, the EU and the European Science Foundation (ESF) to exchange views on COST's future role.
The working session, presided over by Croatian Minister of Science and Technology Gvozden Flego, focused on COST's partnership with the ESF.
The two organisations signed a memorandum of understanding, under which the ESF will act as the legal entity providing and managing COST's administrative, technical and scientific secretariat.
ESF Secretary General Enric Banda said the synergy between the two bodies would pave the way towards the creation of a European Research Area.
Since 1971, COST has launched hundreds of initiatives, many of which have already been completed.
Of the Southeast European countries, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Macedonia, Romania and Serbia-Montenegro are all members of COST and have been involved in various scientific and technical research actions.
According to the Dubrovnik declaration, COST should continue to lend support to non-member countries, including in the Western Balkans.
Croatia, for example, has been involved in a number of different projects, including one focusing on the improvement of groundwater resource utilisation in coastal aquifers, and another on artwork conservation by laser.
Addressing the forum, Mesic said COST programmes had played an important role in the development of science and technology in his country.
Croatia joined COST in June 1992 -- a time when it was difficult for the country, which had just gained political independence, to join scientific and technological processes and programmes of developed European countries.
After the forum, Flego said that the expansion of co-operation would also bring grant money from the European Commission, totaling 80m euros, for COST's 2002-2006 programme.
The Dubrovnik declaration said COST must continue and should be encouraged to develop as a European initiative and as an intergovernmental mechanism of prime importance.
Steiner Leaving Kosovo Post in Summer
Ending speculation concerning the future of Kosovo's top administrator, Germany's Foreign Ministry announced that Michael Steiner will be transferred to Geneva.
(AP, Reuters, AFP, UN Wire - 28/05/03)
The German Foreign Ministry announced Wednesday (28 May) that UNMIK chief Michael Steiner will be transferred to Geneva to become Germany's permanent UN representative there.
He will replace Ambassador Walter Lewalter, who is retiring at the end of June, the ministry said.
Steiner, who was appointed to his current post in January 2002, has confirmed the move.
"I always said one year is too short and two years is too much," he was quoted as telling reporters.
A former foreign policy and security adviser to German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, Steiner, 53, is the third UN administrator in Kosovo since the mission's establishment in June 1999.
His predecessors were Hans Haekkerup of Denmark and Bernard Kouchner of France.
Since 1999, Kosovo has been a de facto UN protectorate, with UNMIK providing essential administrative services.
The mission also has key responsibility for security and foreign relations, the establishment of autonomy and self-government in the province, and the return of refugees and displaced persons.
Steiner took up his Kosovo job following a landmark general election in November 2001 that led to democratically elected institutions in the province -- a president, a government headed by a prime minister, and a 120-seat assembly.
In a recent statement before the OSCE Permanent Council in Vienna, Steiner said the focus of the international community's efforts in Kosovo is now the transfer of responsibilities to provisional institutions.
Earlier this year, he said his top priorities in 2003 included the fight against organised crime, reviving the economy and building a multiethnic society.
Steiner maintains the contentious issue of Kosovo's final status is not on the agenda, as certain standards must be met first.
He has come under fire from Serbian officials, who reject his plan for the transfer of responsibilities to provisional institutions as "absolutely unacceptable".
About two months ago, Serbian Justice Minister Vladan Batic claimed Steiner had lost the confidence of both Kosovo Serbs and Albanians and should resign.

Turkish minister clarifies "racism" remarks
Turkey's chief EU negotiator explains a comment he made at Auschwitz earlier this week.
(Zaman - 04/02/11; AFP, DPA, EurActiv, The Sofia Echo - 03/02/11; Bloomberg, Zaman - 02/02/11)
The best response to the growing racism in Europe lies in greater support for and further development of the principles of democracy and EU values, Turkish EU Affairs Minister Egemen Bagis said. [Reuters]
EU officials said on Thursday (February 3rd) they had asked Turkey's chief negotiator with the 27-nation bloc to clarify his remark this week that rising racism in Europe could lead to a replication of "the facist methods of the 1930s".
Turkish EU Affairs Minister Egemen Bagis made the statement during a Holocaust commemoration ceremony at the former Nazi concentration camp in Auschwitz, Poland, on Tuesday.
"The EU, founded in order to eliminate the threats of that period to peace, is today under the risk of being overtaken by a racist mentality that cannot internalise its own values and emulates the fascist methods of 1930s," the Turkish official said.
"Unfortunately, today Turkey and the Turkish people in Europe bear the consequences of being different … Turkish people, implicitly or openly, are being told this: 'You are different and you have no place among us'," media reports quoted the official transcript of his statement as reading.
"Those who have racist and distorted mentalities have no right to degrade democracy and the philosophy of the EU."
Those remarks raised eyebrows in Brussels and prompted an "immediate" reaction by EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele, who called Bagis, asking him to clarify.
"Bagis explained to the commissioner that his words were intended to express his concern at the rising role of some extremist groups in the EU and ... that this could contribute to a potential lessening of tolerance towards minorities," Natasha Butler, Fuele's spokeswoman, told reporters Thursday.
"The commissioner was grateful for this clarification," she added, noting however that Bagis's statement would have sounded less confusing if it was better phrased.
"Clearly the original words could have been better chosen and could have avoided any potential misunderstanding, which was all the more important given the timing and of course the location of their pronouncement," Butler said.
Some Turks also found the minister's statement as misplaced.
Kader Sevinc, the representative of Turkey's main opposition Republican People's Party to the EU, viewed the remarks as "superficial".
"We should not generalise these destructive trends in European politics," EurActiv, a Brussels-based independent news portal dedicated to EU affairs, quoted her as saying.
"We are confident that Europe will overcome the present difficulties and prove once more the universal value of its democracy.
This is why a majority of the member states and wide political circles in each EU member country support Turkish membership on the basis of rational arguments."
A day after Bagis's statement in Auschwitz, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu also voiced Ankara's concern about the potential impact of the spread of racism in Europe, according to Turkish daily Zaman.
Speaking after talks with Dutch Foreign Minister Uri Rosenthal in Ankara on Wednesday, he said "we must work together on immigration and integration to stop xenophobia in Europe and prevent its damage to European values".
According to Bagis, "the best response" to the growing racism in Europe lies in greater support for and further development of the principles of democracy and EU values.
"The only remedy for this distorted mentality is Turkey's accession to the EU," he said in Auschwitz.
Search Continues for Mass Graves in Tetovo
Though police have yet to find anything at the suspected sites, Macedonia's Interior Ministry has committed itself to continuing the search for 18 people reported missing during the 2001 conflict.
By Valentin Nesovski for Southeast European Times in Skopje - 02/06/03
With the help of a team of experts from Germany, Macedonian police carried out a search last month for mass or individual graves in the Tetovo area.
Police teams dug in three locations with heavy machinery and used sniffing dogs to try to find the remains of those reported missing during the 2001 conflict.
The search was monitored by forensic experts, as well as by representatives of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), the OSCE, NATO, the EU and the EUFORCE Concordia mission.
After three days of digging, police officially announced that they hadn't found anything in the suspected sites.
However, they have continued efforts to locate the 12 missing ethnic Macedonians and 6 ethnic Albanians.
According to police sources, the search was based on information obtained by the Macedonian Directorate for Security and Counterintelligence.
That information suggested that three murdered ethnic Macedonians were buried between the villages of Neprosteno and Dzepciste in 2001.
The bodies of the six missing ethnic Albanians were believed to be near Trebos, and the body of an ethnic Macedonian from the village of Dobroste was reported to be buried in the vicinity of Prvce.
Wolfgang Graven, an OSCE spokesman, confirmed that neither mass nor individual graves had been found. Graven said the OSCE's only task was to monitor the process.
The ICTY says the digging was initiated by the interior ministry, which asked the ICTY to assist in the field.
The tribunal took over inquiries into four cases involving war crimes from Macedonian courts last year.
Relatives of the 18 have been seeking information for the past two years.
A Macedonian Parliamentary Commission was established to address the issue.
The parents of the missing have met with the prime minister and with President Boris Trajkovski, as well as with representatives of NATO, the OSCE and the EU.
They also met with Ali Ahmeti, the leader of the now disbanded National Liberation Army.
EU integration, regional co-operation top agenda at SEECP summit
The two-day SEECP summit in Thessaloniki kicked off Wednesday with a meeting of the member nations' foreign ministers.

A two-day summit of countries in the Southeast European Co-operation Process (SEECP) opened in the northern Greek port city of Thessaloniki on Wednesday (3 May) with a meeting of member nations' foreign ministers.
It will be followed Thursday by a closed-door session -- chaired by Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis -- of the heads of state or government of the nine-nation group.
The SEECP includes Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia-Montenegro and Turkey.
Moldova has observer status.
The rotating, one-year SEECP chairmanship is currently held by Greece, which will hand it over to Croatia after the summit.
Among the leaders participating in the meeting are Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, BiH Presidency Chairman Sulejman Tihic and Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski.
Others attending the forum include the UN special envoy for the Kosovo status talks, Martti Ahtisaari, OSCE Secretary General Marc Perrin de Brichambaut and Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe Special Co-ordinator Erhard Busek.
Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Akiko Yamanaka is attending Wednesday's session as a guest speaker.
The EU membership prospects of the Southeast European (SEE) countries and regional co-operation are the main issues on the agenda.
Summit participants will also discuss the role of the SEECP in a future modification of the Stability Pact and current developments in the region, including the situation in Kosovo.
The transport ministers of member nations are expected to sign an agreement Thursday establishing a high-speed rail network in the SEE region.
"We have very close co-operation with the other countries," Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis said on Tuesday. "Good regional co-operation always bears positive results for all the peoples in the area."
Greece is the only EU member within the group.
Bulgaria and Romania are scheduled to join the Union in January, while Turkey and Croatia began their membership talks with Brussels several months ago.
The Western Balkan countries are at different stages of the EU integration process.
Apart from the official joint sessions, a number of bilateral meetings are expected on the sidelines of the summit.
The meeting that has generated the greatest media interest is the one between Karamanlis and Erdogan on Thursday, which Turkish media have described as aimed at reviving confidence-building measures between the two NATO members.
Karamanlis also is scheduled to meet with Crvenkovski for the first time in 18 months.
According to the Greek daily Kathimerini, the focus of those talks will be bilateral trade rather than the name dispute between the two neighbours.
Bakoyannis is expected to hold separate meetings with her counterparts from Albania, Macedonia and Serbia-Montenegro.
Fourth round of Kosovo talks begins Thursday
The divided town of Mitrovica will be the main subject of the fourth round of UN-brokered talks between Serbian and Kosovo Albanian negotiators, beginning on Thursday.
By Davor Konjukusic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade – 03/05/06

A fourth round of UN-mediated talks between delegations from Belgrade and Pristina is due to kick off on Thursday (4 May).
On the agenda this time is the thorny subject of Mitrovica, a northern Kosovo town divided along ethnic lines and the scene of frequent clashes over the years.
As with the other major issues on the agenda of the status talks, the two sides have sharply opposite stances when it comes to Mitrovica's future.
The delegation from Pristina will be advocating the establishment of two municipal units in Mitrovica., both answerable to an executive council that would be overseen by an international administrator in the coming years.
The Serb negotiators, by contrast, want to see two entirely separate municipalities, with northern Mitrovica forming part of a proposed grouping of Serb municipalities with close ties to Belgrade.
The Kosovo side rejects this approach, seeing it as an attempt to partition the province by creating ethnic enclaves.
Participants have described previous rounds of talks -- which have yet to touch on the status issue -- as cordial and constructive.
Yet the sides have been mostly unable to reconcile their fundamentally different visions for Kosovo.
UN envoy Martti Ahtissari's deputy, Albert Rohan -- who is chairing the talks -- has described the impasse as "disturbing".
The Serbs, he says, envision a great degree of autonomy for municipalities and a minimal role of the central government, while the Albanians are asking for a stronger role for the central government.
Decentralisation is supposed to apply to all municipalities, and to be based on the principle of ethnic neutrality, but the Serbs have been insisting that an ethnic principle be applied in all municipalities where Serbs form a majority, according to Rohan.
Slobodan Samardzic, a member of the negotiating team from Belgrade, says the main goal of the decentralisation is the return of refugees, safety and freedom of movement.
It is important to establish normal conditions for the Serbs who have lived for the last six years in discrimination, he says.
The Serbian side wants such guarantees to be incorporated in the agreement on status, and not left for a subsequent discussion in Kosovo.
Albanian negotiators say they endorse autonomy, but not in a way that leads to the creation of an entity.
They insist that their concept of municipalities is based on European principles, meaning that municipalities are functional and sustainable.
"We have made an effort to provide functional and applicable suggestions that should lead to the final status, independent and sovereign Kosovo with all guarantees for national minorities, including the Serbs.
The Serbs should have a right to make decisions on the local level," says the chairman of the Pristina delegation, Kosovo Deputy Prime Minister Lutfi Haziri.
Both sides, meanwhile, have voiced objections to a proposal drafted by Rohan and a UN team of experts.
The UN has run Kosovo since mid-1999, when a NATO air war halted a Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists, forcing Belgrade to relinquish control of the province.
Kosovo officially remains part of Serbia, with its final status yet to be determined.
In April, the Contact Group said the status question should be resolved by the end of this year, and that the solution must be acceptable to all citizens.
International Community Acknowledges Own Share of Responsibility for Srebrenica Massacre
Representatives of the international community joined tens of thousands of Bosnian Muslims at the commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre.

Many senior Western officials attended a ceremony in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) on Monday (11 July) marking the 10th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre of 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys.
Addressing tens of thousand of mourners, they acknowledged the international community's share of responsibility for the atrocity, while pledging persistent efforts to bring to justice those who orchestrated it -- wartime Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander, Ratko Mladic.
"Our first duty is to uncover, and confront, the full truth about what happened… for us who serve the UN, that truth is a hard one to face," UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said in a message delivered by his Chief of Staff, Mark Malloch Brown.
"We can say -- and it is true -- that great nations failed to respond adequately," Annan said.
In July 1995, a contingent of 370 lightly armed UN soldiers, with orders to shoot only in self-defence, was in charge of protecting Srebrenica, which the UN had declared a "safe area".
They were helpless to stop the onslaught of Bosnian Serb forces under Mladic's command, which overtook the enclave on 11 July.
In the course of the following week, Mladic's forces killed virtually every man and boy they were able to capture.
"The victims had put their trust in international protection," EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said in a statement. "But we, the international community, let them down.
This was a colossal, collective and shameful failure."
During the ceremony at the Potocari memorial centre outside Srebrenica, British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, also expressed his personal remorse over the massacre, describing it as "one of the darkest chapters" in European history since 1945.
"It is a shame for the international community that we have allowed this to happen right in front of our eyes," Straw said. "I particularly regret this.
And I am deeply sorry for it."
Other international officials attending Monday's sombre ceremony included UN war crimes tribunal president Theodor Meron, US Ambassador-at-large for War Crimes Issues Pierre Richard Prosper and Richard Holbrooke, the former US diplomat who negotiated the Dayton Peace Agreement that ended the war in BiH.
Calling for the arrest and handover of the architects of the massacre, Meron said the crimes committed in 1995 were not simply murders.
"They were targeted at a particular human group with the intent to destroy it.
They were so heinous that they warrant the gravest of labels: genocide," he said.
The tribunal will not have accomplished its task of bringing justice to and fostering reconciliation in the region so long as Karadzic and Mladic remain at large, Meron added.
Sulejman Tihic, the Muslim member of BiH's tripartite presidency, also called for the arrest and punishment of ICTY indictees charged with genocide over the Srebrenica massacre.
"The only thing we can do now is to do our best in finding the missing and killed ones -- to bury them with dignity -- and to punish those who are responsible for the crime.
Particularly, the most wanted war criminals Karadzic and Mladic," Tihic said.
Albanian Socialists Dispute Election Results
Refusing to concede defeat to the opposition Democratic Party, Albania's ruling Socialist Party plans to contest the results of the 3 July parliamentary elections.

Albania's Central Electoral Commission (CEC) issued on Sunday (10 July) preliminary official results of the country's 3 July parliamentary elections, confirming former President Sali Berisha's Democratic Party (DP) as the winner.
Although the Democrats are said to have won a clear majority in the country's 140-seat legislature, they are unlikely to be able to form a government before the end of this month.
Refusing to concede defeat, the incumbent ruling Socialist Party (SP) of Prime Minister Fatos is planning to contest the results, citing violations of electoral law in 30 constituencies.
A count of the votes cast in 97 out of the 100 single-seat constituencies, showed the DP winning 55 parliamentary seats.
The SP trailed with 40 seats, while an independent candidate and former Prime Minister Ilir Meta's Party of Socialist Movement took the other two seats.
Under Albanian law, the remaining 40 seats are distributed through proportional allocations depending on the percentage of the vote parties surpassing the 2.5 per cent threshold have won nationwide.
The additional seats the DP and its allies are said to have won on the basis of this system give them an at least 73-seat majority, allowing them to form a government.
The SP and its allies would take a total of 64 seats.
The election was seen as a key test of the country's ability to hold free and fair elections in line with international democratic standards. All five elections held in Albania since the fall of communism in 1990 have been tarnished by voting irregularities, violence and intimidation.
The latest poll "complied only partially with international commitments and standards for democratic elections," said the OSCE, which sent more than 400 international election observers to monitor the voting.
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana urged authorities to conduct an official investigation into irregularities.
The CEC said it must investigate 230 complaints from parties and independent candidates before announcing the final results.
Berisha could eventually end up with fewer parliamentary seats, which would dilute his strength in the 140-member assembly.
"I will accept any result showing defeat or victory for the Socialists only when it is certified by the electoral courts and the Central Election Commission," Nano said Sunday.
His government will continue to run the country until the certification of the poll's outcome.
Mixed Feelings in Serbia About Srebrenica
Ten years later, Serbs are still deeply divided about the Srebrenica massacre.
Many seek to minimise the atrocity or insist that Serbs suffered equally.
And attempts to show respect for the victims have met with threats.
By Jelena Tusup for Southeast European Times in Belgrade – 12/07/05
"We weren’t standing behind this crime.
We have to show the distance between citizens and war criminals.
This is what Serbia’s future depends on," Serbian President Boris Tadic said of the Srebrenica massacre. [AFP]
On the 10th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre, Serbs still have an ambiguous view of Europe's worst atrocity since World War II.
Most people interviewed by TV crews agreed that an apology was needed, but said all sides in the conflict were to blame and should express remorse.
Some tried to minimise Srebrenica's significance by drawing comparisons with other incidents in which Serbs were the victims.
A few -- mostly older men -- were defiant.
"They should be apologising to us," said one.
The media also was divided.
Some TV stations, such as B92 and Studio B, broadcast live coverage of Monday's anniversary ceremony, but Serbian national TV did not.
All stations, however, dedicated the first half of their prime time information shows to the anniversary.
Newspapers provided extensive coverage of Serbian President Boris Tadic's visit to Potocari, as well as commentary and reminiscences concerning events in Srebrenica in July 1995.
The Serbian Parliament observed a minute of silence for the victims of Srebrenica, Bratunac and Skelane, as well as those who died in last week's London bombings.
But only the representatives of the ruling coalition were present.
MPs from the Democratic and Radical parties were not told of the commemorative action and thus were left out.
What could have been a profound occasion instead became another source of political bickering.
The clearest message came from Tadic, who attended the Potocari ceremony.
Prior to his departure, he said his visit was meant to show respect for the victims.
"We did not stand behind these war crimes.
We need to show the distance between the war crimes and the citizens; the future of Serbia depends on it. [Another reason] for going to Srebrenica is the necessity to create complete trust and co-operation between the countries of this region.
Many war crimes were committed against the Serbian people as well, and justice for those involved is expected.
However it takes virtue and strength to condemn war crimes that were committed against another nation in the name of our nation," Tadic said.
Two incidents perhaps best demonstrate the divided atmosphere in Serbia on the subject of war crimes.
On Sunday, 100 members of the "Women in Black" organisation attempted to hold a commemoration in Belgrade for the Srebrenica victims.
They were met by a group of young people who shouted threats and attacked them with tear gas.
In Novi Sad, meanwhile, organisers of the Exit Festival had planned to broadcast a message of peace at midnight on Sunday.
The Annie Lennox song "I Saved the World Today" was to have been played, followed by a message: "Ten years after, let us promise to our children, and their children, that Srebrenica, Bratunac, Vukovar, Oluja, Ahmici, Djakovica, Staro Gacko won't be repeated.
Ever again." At the last minute, however, organisers scrapped that part of the programme, after local police warned of a bomb threat.

Romania responds to EU criticism
In the wake of a scathing assessment by Brussels, Romania's parliament moved to lift a key agency out of constitutional limbo.
By Paul Ciocoiu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest – 01/09/10

Romania has taken a step towards meeting EU justice standards by adopting a new law on the National Integrity Agency (ANI), a state body entrusted with controlling the assets of politicians and other important public figures.
The country came under criticism in a July report by the EU on the progress of judicial reform.
"I can characterise the senate's vote as a positive evolution," ANI Secretary-General Horia Georgescu told SETimes after last week's vote. "I believe the EC's latest report on justice has weighed very much on the senators' vote."
The ANI had been crippled for several months after a constitutional court ruling in April which overturned portions of the previous law governing the agency.
As a result, more than 4,000 cases were suspended.
With the impasse dragging on, Brussels urged Romania to take action and correct the legislation.
"Parliament was aware of the consequences of this report as concerns its political accountability before the citizens, as well as the external consequences, that affect Romania's interests," Georgescu said. On August 24th, parliament's upper house voted 78-0 to adopt the new law.
Senators from the Social Democratic Party, however, chose to abstain.
According to party leader Victor Ponta, the revised law doesn't fix the problems with the old one.
"We will abstain from voting [until] the Romanian government ... comes up with a bill that respects both the demands of the European Commission and the decisions of the Constitutional Court," Ponta said.
Although they did not cast votes, PSD senators did attend the parliamentary session in order to ensure a quorum.
The new law restores a series of provisions that were previously removed.
These include establishment of investigatory committees subordinated to Courts of Appeals and a single wealth statement form, with sections for jewellry, accounts and real estate.
It also requires public officials to declare any contracts with state authorities in their statements of interest.
Both the wealth and the interest statements become public.
Furthermore, the law enables ANI to investigate officials for up to three years after they have left office.
The bill now moves to President Traian Basescu for signing.
"The most important gains are that the wealth and interest statements are still public and the paragraph requested by the Romanian president -- which compels the dignitaries to transparently declare publicly-funded contacts -- brings an extra instrument in fighting conflicts of interests in public acquisitions," Georgescu said.
He added that the ANI expects the legislation to be challenged again.
As for cases put on ice by the earlier court ruling, they will go back to square one.
"All these investigations will have to be resumed from scratch," he said. "Two years of work were annulled.
Many investigations will be lost because the three year limit has been exceeded."
American football team gains popularity in Serbia
Serbia and the city of Kragujevac recognise a team's successes in a newly popular sport.

American football is slowly taking hold in Serbia and the new European Federation of American Football (EFAF) ranking proves it.
EFAF included for the first time a Serbian team on its list of Europe's Top 20 teams, the Kragujevac Wild Boars.
American football growth in Serbia is inextricably linked to this team.
In March 2003, the Wild Boars played the first ever American football match against the Belgrade Wolves, establishing an arch rivalry between them.
By year's end, the Wild Boars participated in the initial assembly of the Serbian American Football Federation and in 2004 won Serbia's first national championship.
Since then, the Wild Boars have won five out of seven national championships.
Club Secretary Vladimir Gajic told SETimes that the team wasn't built to win a trophy or two, nor was it created for someone's personal gain.
"Thanks to the true love for this sport and the unity we nurture among players and management, the club will remain a last bastion of sportsmanship and purity in sports," Gajic said.
The Boars nurture the development of players from an early age, helping 7 and 8-year olds learn to play flag football.
The junior team is the pool from which the first team is formed; ten 2009 juniors played in the first team this year.
Leading the charge for the first team is Aleksandar "Alf" Ristic.
To him, the team spirit of American football requires each player to constantly improve physical and mental performance.
"We are all aware of this [principle] and that is why we are the best," he said. In the 2009 season, Ristic gained over 1,000 yards in 11 games.
One of the three Americans on the team, quarterback Manny Diaz, told SETimes that Ristic deserves the lion's share of the credit for winning this year's trophy.
"Alf is the man who keeps all the players together.
He is the heart and soul of the team, a true sportsman," Diaz said.
Management seems certain they will maintain the club's success.
"There is no room for staying in one place; any stagnation means regression," President Nemanja Calija told SETimes.
Calija concedes, however, that the Boars face diverse challenges.
"We need to provide a permanent playing field since we still don't have a home ground, even after winning five national championships."
The club wants additional US players and attempt to win the EFAF cup.
The Wild Boars' home city of Kragujevac -- 120km south of Belgrade -- has supported the team from the very beginning.
As interest grows and turnout surpasses 2,000 spectators per game, Kragujevac Mayor Veroljub Stevanovic has vowed to continue supporting the club financially and logistically, and to build two new stadiums.
His assistant in charge of sports, Jovan Pavlovic Bojadzic, told SETimes they "recognised the club's good work and the possibilities for our [city's] self-promotion through their excellent performances".
Kragujevac was selected to host the qualifying tournament on August 22nd and 23rd for the European Junior Championship in Spain next year.
Serbia's team beat Great Britain 13-12 and The Netherlands 28-15, and will advance to the next round to play in the key qualifying game to be held in Paris.
Ljuboten trial ends at The Hague

The trial of former Macedonian Interior Minister Ljube Boskovski and former security official Johan Tarculovski ended last week at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague. The trial, which began on April 16th 2007, included testimony from 64 witnesses, 1,200 exhibits and 11,000 pages of recorded minutes.
In closing arguments, the prosecutor sought a 15-year prison sentence for Tarculovski and a 12-year sentence for Boskovski.
The two allegedly ordered a brutal police attack on the Albanian-populated village of Ljuboten near Skopje during the 2001 conflict between Macedonia's security forces and Albanian guerrillas.
According to the prosecutor, Boskovski has command responsibility for the atrocity, while Tarculovski bears individual criminal responsibility for committing, ordering, planning, instigating or aiding and abetting violations.
By using the word "committing", the prosecutor does not allege that the defendants physically committed any of the crimes, says the indictment.
The two men are the only Macedonian citizens indicted by the tribunal for violating the customs of war.
Defence attorneys say prosecutors failed to prove the pair bore responsibility in the case.
Boskovski's legal representative, Edina Rasidovic, said there was no evidence that the former interior minister commanded the attack or had direct influence over the reservists in Ljuboten.
Boskovski undertook the legal measures necessary to conduct an investigation into the case -- informing judicial organs, establishing an interior ministry commission and co-operating with the relevant officers while investigating the village, Rasidovic said.
The Hague Tribunal Office in Skopje also received notification about the victims.
In its final arguments, the prosecution said the police unit directed by Tarculovski killed civilians and destroyed 14 homes that were not legitimate military targets.
The court allowed Boskovski and Tarculovski to present their final arguments.
They thanked the court for the "just" treatment.
Both said that they expect a just verdict -- acquittal.
"I fully agree with the clearly stated positions and arguments of my defence team, which did everything in its power in order to spread the truth about my country, Macedonia.
I am very grateful to it for working in line with all the laws, so that no stain remains on the period that the Republic of Macedonia endured," Boskovski said.
Tarculovski's lawyer, Antonio Apostolski, said the prosecution did not prove that his client participated in a conspiracy.
He emphasised that Tarculovski followed orders given by the late President Boris Trajkovski.
Observers expect a verdict in July.
EU calls for quick formation of new Serbian government
EU officials urged Serbia on Monday to move quickly in forming a government that can accelerate on the road to European integration.

Balkan countries, the United States and the EU welcomed on Monday (May 12th) the outcome of Serbia's parliamentary elections, in which the coalition around President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party (DS) won the majority of votes.
Croatian President Stipe Mesic stressed that the victory of the For a European Serbia coalition over nationalist forces bodes well for the entire region's future.
"The election outcome also shows that we will have a neighbouring country in which a respectable number of people ... are not focused on the past," he said.
Officials in other Balkan countries, including Macedonia, Montenegro and Kosovo, echoed Mesic's remarks, as they hailed the outcome of Serbia's most important poll since democratic forces overthrew former President Slobodan Milosevic's regime in October 2000.
The victory of Tadic's pro-European coalition in Sunday's vote came as a surprise, as all pre-election polls had shown it trailing the ultranationalist Serb Radical Party (SRS).
The state electoral commission said on Monday that For a European Serbia won 38.44% of the vote and will occupy 102 of the 250 seats in the country's legislature.
The SRS trailed with 29.36% and 77 seats.
The Tadic camp's strength pleased Western governments and senior EU officials, who also praised Serbian voters for backing European integration.
"The Serbian electorate has clearly demonstrated that its heart is in Europe," the US Embassy in Belgrade said in a statement Monday.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn joined a chorus of top diplomats of the 27-nation bloc's members in hailing the success of Tadic's camp and signalled Brussels' readiness to support Serbia's faster progress in the accession process.
"The European Commission ... welcomes the success of the reformist forces that share European values," Rehn said. "The EU is ready to accelerate its EU course -- including granting membership candidate status."
"I hope that a new government, which will be adamant in implementing reforms and meeting the necessary conditions for further progress toward Europe, will be formed soon," EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said on Monday.
But, as neither Tadic's coalition nor the SRS managed to secure an outright 126-seat parliamentary majority, both seek coalition partners.
The fourth-place finisher -- a coalition led by the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), formerly headed by Milosevic, which won 7.6% of the vote and will take 20 parliamentary seats -- is the perceived kingmaker.
The coalition between outgoing Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia and New Serbia, which took third with 11.59% voter support, translating into 30 seats, signalled its readiness to join an SRS-led coalition government.
SRS acting leader Tomislav Nikolic met on Monday with Kostunica to discuss forming a joint cabinet.
Together, with the SPS seats, they would enjoy a 127-seat majority .
Observers consider a coalition of Tadic and Kostunica impossible, as their rift over the country's EU bid deepened after the majority of EU members recognised Kosovo's independence.
Thus, the president would also need the Socialists and some of the ethnic coalitions to secure a parliamentary majority. Cedomir Jovanovic's pro-Western Liberal Democratic Party, which won 5.24% of the vote and will take 13 of the seats in parliament, purportedly opposes allying with the SPS.
Bank of Greece Warns the Government About State of the Economy
The Greek government is facing fiscal hardship, the possibility of a warning from the EU, and striking public sector employees.
Meanwhile, the elections approach.
By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 25/11/03
In a letter to Prime Minister Costas Simitis, Bank of Greece Governor Nicholas Garganas has voiced concerns about Olympic spending, the ballooning deficit and promises of new benefits, warning that the next government of Greece will have huge burden on its shoulders.
According to Garganas, the deficit won't allow reduction of the public debt and will not slow the rate of inflation, which is undermining competitiveness.
At an average of 3.6 per cent for 2003, he says, it will be 1.5 per cent higher than the Eurozone's average.
The central bank has reported that the fiscal deficit for the public sector in the first eight months of the year reached 5.5 per cent of the GDP, which is estimated at 150 billion euros.
Last year's deficit was 2.6 per cent of GDP, so the figure has more than doubled.
The deficit for the central government reached 4.6 per cent, up from 1.9 last year.
The economy and finance ministry is at the same level.
Although it may not mean much to the average citizen, the rising deficits signal that Greece has taken a step backwards in fiscal management.
The government's fiscal worries, combined with fears of a public reproach from the EU, is the major reason for Finance Minister Nikos Christodoulakis' refusal to accommodate strikers demanding higher raises, including school teachers, university professors, policemen and nurses.
Not only does the ruling PASOK party face an upcoming election, but the fiscal crisis comes at a time when all the professional bodies on the state's payroll are used to asking for more benefits or raises.
With PASOK at least 5 per cent behind the opposition in polls, Christodoulakis is now trying to find a way out of the financial problem.
But his options are limited because the deficit cannot be allowed to increase.
That explains the sudden rush of privatisations that have infuriated the opposition party, New Democracy.
The opposition's spokesman on the economy, George Alogoskoufis, has criticised the government's effort to sell the Post Savings Bank, saying the process has not been transparent.
Furthermore, Alogoskoufis charges, the budget for 2004 that was presented to parliament on 6 October is unreliable.
Because the deficit exceeds the maximum of 3 per cent of GDP set by Maastricht Treaty, the Greek government could face official action from the EU.
Due to the recent Eurostat embezzlement scandal and the fact that Germany and France are also not within the limit, Greece may have bought some time.
Why fast economic growth isn't enough
Conventional wisdom assumes that growth goes hand in hand with political stability.
That's not necessarily so, argues economist and former Romanian Finance Minister Daniel Daianu.

Political turbulence in the new EU member states has surprised many observers. [Getty Images]
Recent political developments in Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland have raised eyebrows among observers worldwide.
How can it be that after EU accession domestic politics in these countries has stumbled in such an alarming manner?
Instead of a consolidation of democratic politics, the post-accession period has seen fragmented, stalemated governments, coalitions formed by mismatched parties with incompatible philosophies, and in Hungary's case an eruption of political tensions into public anger.
The trend is puzzling to many.
It pays to remember, however, that these economies are part of the dynamic area of Europe, with annual economic growth rates that have been many times higher than those in the core of the EU (5-6% vs 1-2%).
Conventional wisdom, blending politics and economics, says that wherever economic growth is high, social stability and sound politics have a better chance of prevailing.
In the case of Central Europe, a logical inference would be that, owing to significant economic growth in this decade, a large part of the population would enjoy tangible economic fruits and, therefore, support the ruling coalitions.
EU accession was expected to buoy the foundations of these young liberal democracies.
And there is another factor to consider.
Unlike citizens in most of the EU-15 (Portugal and Spain are exceptions), people in the post-communist countries have lived through the command system.
One would expect them to be better able to detect fake democrats and cheap populism, be it on the right or the left.
Orderly democratic life would seem to be more alertly guarded in countries that endured so long without it.
In fact, there is an ongoing debate among economists about the fundamentals of economic growth, and about the relationship between democracy and prosperity.
Some argue that growth matters first and foremost, even when it incurs substantial inequities among social partners.
Another line of reasoning, however, argues that sustainable economic growth should not impair social cohesion, and that it has to be accompanied by adequate production of public goods.
Good practices in both the public and the private sector, as well as an effective fight against corruption, are key.
The experience of post-communist Mitteleuropa suggests that high growth rates, in and of themselves, are not enough to secure a sound social and political life.
Arguably, wherever in Central and Eastern Europe numerous citizens have lost out in the economic race or have found themselves marginalised (excluded from the fruits of economic growth), their frustration is likely to be captured by extremist parties and centrist parties lose political ground.
Economists continue to debate the relationship between democracy and prosperity. [Getty Images]
As for the buoying power of EU membership, this was in a sense more effective when the countries involved were hoping to get into the bloc.
That hope enabled politicians with differing ideological stances to rally citizens behind the banner of a "return to Europe".
More than a few of these citizens saw this "return" as an initiation into a Nirvana-like society, with immense economic benefits.
Now people have seen that nothing changed dramatically for the better after May 2004. On the contrary, some additional pains have been brought about by the rigours of complying with the EU regulations.
A wake-up call was unavoidable.
It has been amplified by the revival of "economic patriotism" in the major EU member states, a force which seems to contradict the very principles with the bloc has been so earnest about imposing on would-be members.
In order to join the EU, Eastern European countries diligently observed the intellectual and operational matrix of the Union -- for instance, the total opening of markets, including those for financial services and public utilities.
In these sectors, Eastern Europeans have in fact been much more liberal that their western counterparts.
It is easy to comprehend the frustration in some political circles in central Europe when EU heavyweights preach what they do not practice.
Economic nationalism in the West thus spurs economic nationalism in the East.
Other issues add fuel to the fire -- for example, Poland's fear of Germany and Russia, both of which are working together in the very sensitive field of energy procurement.
The memory of the past is not necessarily an effective antidote to antiliberal sentiments.
People enjoy their political liberties and like to voice their satisfactions and frustrations, but it is all too easy to forget how things were when such liberties were non-existent and how that affected their lives.
Younger people who have no personal experience with communism do not know what it is like.
Their reference points are different. In way that is not too dissimilar, some in the West are oblivious to the second world war and its atrocities, including the Holocaust.
Actual democracy and textbook democracy are two different things.
In practice, democracy means the functioning, for better or worse, of checks and balances.
The actual state of democracy hinges greatly on the morality and sense of accountability of political leaders, which can be dismaying under certain conditions.
It is for this reason that some talk about a democracy deficit in EU member countries and a shortage of responsible politicians, of true statesmanship.
More than a few myths and clichés are fading away in the "New Europe", and individual and group psychologies react one way or another.
Eastern European societies are much less prosperous than their western EU partners.
At the same time they are facing similar structural challenges: aging, the crisis of the welfare system, identity-related confusion, and a rising pressure of immigration.
High economic growth is not a panacea.
It will not forestall a political reaction if governments prove incapable of dealing with the social challenges that accompany modernisation, against the background of globalisation.
There are no easy solutions, and national politicians will be severely tested in this respect in the years to come.
What they do will influence domestic politics and their countries' economies greatly.
Moreover, what is happening in Central Europe should sound warning bells when it comes to the Balkans.
SEE countries are also making the transition from communism, with all of the hopes and disappointments this entails.
Economic woes, including unemployment, are substantial. "Enlargement fatigue" and other barriers have made the prospect of EU entry remote for some countries in the region.
They face the same pressures that have fostered instability in Central Europe, but with less of an anchor to keep them on a steady course.

Croatia, Albania welcomed at historic NATO summit
NATO leaders nominated the new secretary-general of the Alliance and greeted two new members, Albania and Croatia.

With two new members, Albania and Croatia, bringing NATO's size to 28 countries, NATO leaders discussed the Alliance's future at the April 3rd-4th 60th anniversary summit in Strasbourg, France.
It was US President Barack Obama's first NATO conference.
NATO leaders agreed to send 5,000 additional troops to Afghanistan, but the European members stuck to their insistence on sending "only military trainers and extra security forces for upcoming elections", as reported by the media.
They also selected Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen to replace Jaap de Hoop Scheffer as secretary-general on August 1st.
Turkey initially opposed this nomination but acceded after other NATO leaders agreed to address Turkish "concerns", which media reports listed as "the closure of a Kurdish satellite television broadcaster based in Denmark; the establishment of contacts between NATO and Islamic countries; appointment of a Turk as an aide to Fogh Rasmussen; and senior NATO command positions for Turkish generals".
France's decision to return to NATO's military command structure after four decades outside it was a historic moment and ended a rift dating back to the presidency of Charles de Gaulle.
Two new NATO members, Albania and Croatia, sent their presidents and prime ministers to the summit.
Both countries' delegations were visibly delighted to attain full Alliance membership.
"We've reached a goal we have been pursuing for 20 years," Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said.
Albanian counterpart Sali Berisha, after flying back to Tirana, wished his compatriots "a happy first day of NATO membership".
Obama praised the new members for "making extraordinary efforts at reform".
Albanians, who express 96% support for NATO entry in polls, celebrated in the streets Sunday upon the return of their delegation.
Croatians, for whom the analogous figure is 55%, did not organise public celebrations, although the government did invite distinguished foreign guests to an opera night in Zagreb.
Widespread and sometimes violent demonstrations marred the NATO leaders' effort to project unity.
Tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Strasbourg during the summit, smashing shop windows, setting one hotel on fire Saturday and clashing with police just 3km from the summit venue.
French police arrested more than 300 demonstrators.
Ivanov elected as Macedonia's new president
A calm and orderly atmosphere characterised the second round of Macedonia's presidential election, which barely exceeded the required turnout of 40%.

Macedonian voters elected Professor Gjorge Ivanov as their fourth president since the country declared independence in 1991.
Supported by the ruling VRMO-DPMNE-led coalition, Ivanov won 437,470 votes, while SDSM candidate and fellow professor Ljubomir Frckovski -- ironically, a former co-author of Ivanov's -- took 252,195 votes, with nearly 97% of the ballots counted.
The first unofficial results for local elections showed the VMRO-DPMNE winning 31 mayoralties in the runoff (on top of 24 in the first round).
The SDSM and two independent candidates it supported won nine, while the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) emerged with eight.
The opposition Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) won the key city of Tetovo.
The VMRO-DPMNE took the mayoralty of the capital, Skopje.
Huge electoral battles raged in several major cities like Ohrid, Centar, Resen and Struga, where new mayors' victory margins amounted to mere dozens of votes.
In his victory speech, Ivanov said his main priorities are NATO and EU integration and resolution of the "name issue with Greece", as quoted by Reuters.
The strong support for the VMRO-DPMNE "feels not like a victory but rather like the [creation of an] obligation towards all citizens", said party leader and Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, who thanked outgoing President Branko Crvenkovski for co-operation "despite our disagreements".
The VMRO-DPMNE congratulated voters for participating in fair, democratic and peaceful elections and emphasised they were crucial to NATO and EU integration.
Frckovski also congratulated the winners, while SDSM leader Zoran Zaev emphasised the VMRO-DPMNE now has absolute power but also absolute responsibility.
The SDSM initially echoed the VMRO-DPMNE in praising the conduct of the elections.
However, later in the night, it raised allegations of unfairness: electoral-list problems, intimidation and inappropriate use of UV lamps meant to prevent citizens from voting twice.
The 43% voter turnout is the lowest in Macedonia's history of presidential runoffs.
International monitors from the OSCE/ODIHR expressed initial satisfaction with the calm elections but were still awaiting full reports from teams throughout the country.
One noticeable characteristic of the runoff was low turnout in Albanian-dominated areas, with relatively few voters making a presidential choice.
An official of the DUI -- the ethnic-Albanian party within the ruling coalition -- said the party supported Ivanov but the decision lay with the voters.
Some experts said the absence of support by ethnic Albanians will be a serious handicap for Ivanov.
Lajcak announces steps to strengthen BiH institutions
The top international envoy in Bosnia and Herzegovina announced Friday the start of a process that would lead towards a more functional state.
(Office of the High Representative, DPA - 19/10/07; Fena, Office of the High Representative - 18/10/07)
High representative Miroslav Lajcak [OHR]
High Representative Miroslav Lajcak on Friday (October 19th) outlined a set of measures aimed at healing the "ailing" state system in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and strengthening the functionality of its institutions.
Announcing them as the first step in a process towards achieving that goal, he called for changes to the Law on the Council of Ministers of BiH and to the Rules of Procedure on the work of both houses of the state parliament, as well as measures to improve the co-ordination within the ruling coalition.
If Bosnian politicians fail to implement the proposed amendments by December 1st, he said, he would have no other choice but to impose them and probably sanction those who have rejected them.
The proposed measures are aimed at facilitating the decision making process within the government and parliament and reducing obstructions in the making and passing of laws.
Their enactment would allow the government to take decisions even when some of its members have decided not to attend the meeting, a practice frequently seen in the past on the part of those seeking to block a certain decision.
"It is clear that Bosnia and Herzegovina does not function in a proper way. It does not function as a healthy, normal state," Lajcak said at Friday's press conference in Sarajevo.
"The goal of the international community … is to change this -- and change it to the better.
We cannot consider our mission complete until changes are made in the direction of establishing a stable, European, democratic, multiethnic society in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
The best way for achieving that goal would be through European integration, but Bosnian politicians' failure to reach the EU-required agreement on police reform has hampered the country's progress on that road, thus choosing isolation instead of integration, he noted.
"Last Thursday, [the politicians] showed definitely and clearly that they were not ready … and they would not, or could not, go towards Europe," Lajcak said. "It is clear to everyone that not all sides had the good will to find a solution for police reform in the framework of the European principles.
It is also obvious that, regardless of conscious and voluntary commitments they have made, it is not possible to make the necessary agreement for this today or tomorrow."
The EU gave Bosnian political leaders until October 15th to reach a deal on police reform, in order for the country's Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the 27-nation bloc to be signed by the end of this year.
Following their failure to meet that requirement, the finalisation of the key accord -- considered a major first step towards eventual EU membership -- could be delayed by at least a year.
"Nobody can be forced to go on the European road -- it goes against the European integration philosophy," said Lajcak. "Until the local politicians decide that they want to take you that way, it remains closed for you, although Europe is ready and waiting."
But as it is the international community's responsibility, as well as his own wish, to work on strengthening the Balkan nation, a new approach needs to be found to turn into a stable, modern and democratic state.
"Because agreements cannot be made and solutions found, work of the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina is blocked.
Decisions are not made, laws are not adopted," Lajcak stressed, noting that only three reform laws had been adopted in the past 12 months.
Only one of them was related to EU integration.
"I think the current situation illustrates the fact that I am no longer asked when will we enter the EU, but when will you remove the people we have elected," the top international envoy further noted. "Today's measures do not abolish anybody's rights or responsibilities.
The only people who can feel endangered by this are those who believe that they have the right to undermine the functioning of this country."
Community centre opens in Kosovo Serb village
Funding by KFOR and USAID helped build a new community centre in the Serb enclave of Partesh.

A new culture and sports centre opened this week in Gjilan, southeastern Kosovo.
The centre -- funded by KFOR and USAID -- cost around 147,000 euros to build in the village of Partesh, which is a Serb enclave and a pilot municipality.
Congratulating local residents, Tina Kaidanow, chief of mission of the US Office in Pristina, said that she is in Partesh to support the local community.
"This project is a symbol of co-operation between Partesh and [the US government].
This is also a way to demonstrate that we care for the future," she said.
Kaidanow also said that co-operation between the Kosovo Serbs and the Kosovo Albanians is expected to increase, which will improve the life of Serbs in Partesh and other parts of Kosovo.
According to US General Douglas B. Earhart, commander of the KFOR Multinational Brigade East, this is a very important centre for the citizens of Partesh.
He said the centre is a symbol of the country's partnership with different agencies, of the partnership with the population and the youth of Partesh, and of the co-operation that will continue in the future.
"I can assure you that the KFOR commitment for your benefit will continue for a long time in order to achieve a peaceful and safer environment in Kosovo," Earhart said.
On behalf of Partesh's inhabitants, Kosovo Assembly Member Vesna Jovanovic thanked the US government for their significant support, saying that the project is very important for motivating the village youth.
US soldiers, representatives from the US Office in Pristina and USAID, and members of KFOR attended Monday's dedication.
Also present were two representatives from the Pentagon in Washington, DC, and from the office for social assistance.
"I am very happy that we have this centre now and I hope that [the United States] will help us also in the future," said the Partesh resident Ljubisha Markoviq.
Culture and Sports: Croatia's Ljubicic wins Qatar Open

Croatia's Ivan Ljubicic won the Qatar Open ATP tennis tournament last week, defeating Britain's Andy Murray 6-4, 6-4.
The win marks Ljubicic's 7th ATP title.
The Macedonian Culture Ministry has launched a tender for the restoration of the house in which missionary Mother Teresa lived as a child.
The winning contractor will be tasked with turning the house into a museum.
Eight Macedonian cities -- Debar, Kavadarci, Kicevo, Kocani, Ohrid, Prilep, Radovis and Struga -- are bidding for the title "City of Culture" this year.
The ministry's Council for Culture is expected to decide on the issue in the coming weeks.

New Dink murder trial prompts renewed calls for justice
Turkey must ensure that all those behind the assassination journalist Hrant Dink are brought to justice to avoid damage to its image within the EU, a European lawmaker said Tuesday.

The Turkish authorities were criticised Tuesday (February 12th) for failing to act on demands for a full-blown investigation into the assassination of Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink to ensure that all involved in the plot will face justice.
A day after the third hearing in the case against 19 people charged in the murder of the founder and editor of the Istanbul-based bilingual Turkish-Armenian weekly, Agos, observers appeared increasingly sceptical that the whole truth will ever be established.
"We reiterate our support for all who are calling for the judicial system to do its job in this case," the Paris-based media watchdog Reporters Without Borders said in a statement on Tuesday.
"We regret that the conditions are not in place for the truth to emerge… In these circumstances, we doubt that the judges will manage to establish once and for all the responsibility and guilt of the different protagonists."
Dink, 53, was gunned down on January 19th 2007 outside his newspaper's offices.
In July 2006, he was given a six-month suspended sentence after being convicted on charges of "denigrating Turkishness" because of an article in which he described the killings of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians during World War I as "genocide".
A hardline nationalist from the Black Sea city of Trabzon, Ogun Samast -- the primary suspect in the case – has confessed to the murder, citing Dink's statements on the Armenian issue as his motive.
The other defendants include Yasin Hayal and Erhan Tuncel, a police informer.
Reports following the journalist's murder indicated that the police had received more than one tip-off about the assassination, but had failed to take any action to prevent it.
Dink family lawyers have also repeatedly claimed that there has been destruction of evidence and that the authorities have refused to probe the suspected involvement of members of the country's security forces in the plot.
"The trial cannot proceed in a healthy manner because documents containing information on more than 6,000 telephone calls made by some of the defendants have been destroyed by security officials in Trabzon," Lawyer Erdal Dogan said.
Dutch member of the European Parliament and co-chair of the Turkey-EU Joint Parliamentary Commission Joost Lagendijk attended the court hearing.
He criticised the Turkish government for failing to act on its promise for a proper investigation into the case to reveal all who were involved in it.
"It's clear that police officers and security services knew about these plans, but they didn't act," he told the BBC. "Or some of them were probably actively involved in the planning.
All of these things should be dealt with in this court case, and if it doesn't happen, it will leave a very dirty stain on Turkey's image."
Court efficiency, judicial independence pressing issues for Macedonia
Reforms in Macedonia's judicial system need serious and immediate attention in order for the country to meet EU and NATO requirements.
Analysis by Goran Trajkov for Southeast European Times in Skopje -- 13/02/08
EU and NATO membership depend on judicial reform. [SE Times illustration]
Judicial reform is a major challenge that Macedonia must meet in its efforts to join NATO and the EU.
Two particular problem areas are efficiency of courts and independence of the judicial system.
In Macedonia, cases that would elsewhere take a maximum of six months to complete sometimes drag on for as long as a decade.
Meanwhile, under the constitution, judges are elected by parliament, allowing the possibility of direct political influence on their selection.
"It must be ensured that the judges, themselves, elect members of the State Judicial Council in free elections," says legal expert Renata Deskoska.
"The parliamentary political parties should be aware of the meaning of this process, not only because of the Euro integration prospects, but also because Macedonians are faced every day with politically dependent judges and inefficient legal processes," Deskoska says. "The political parties should consider the interests of the people and reach greater consensus for constitutional changes."
Education of people working in the judicial system is also a crucial factor.
As the country moves towards integration, its judiciary will be tasked with implementing European and international law.
Newly organised judges will be called on to build a more efficient system.
Adequate training is needed to achieve this.
According to experts from within the courts, the reforms will be very deep.
They will include changes in the constitutional judiciary, by broadening its functions and competences and implementing the so-called "constitutional complaint" as a final measure for people to plead their case in court.
The reforms have to be carried out quickly, experts say.
The window of opportunity for Macedonia's EU integration is open, but it may not remain open indefinitely.
Media watchdog: press freedom deteriorating in Bulgaria
"Investigative journalism and media pluralism are seriously threatened by organised crime and by different forms of pressure from political and business quarters," Reporters without Borders said last week, regarding press freedom in Bulgaria.

Press freedom has diminished considerably in Bulgaria since the country joined the EU in January 2007, an international media watchdog group warned in a report Thursday (February 5th).
"Organised crime groups ... have extended their ascendency over the media," the Paris-based Reporters without Borders (RWB) said.
Bulgaria ranked 59th out of 173 countries in the group's latest annual press freedom index, lower than any other EU member nation.
Its ranking has fallen 24 places since 2006.
The RWB compiled its new 14-page report on the country's beleaguered press after several disturbing incidents in 2008.
In April, Georgy Stoev, a reporter with expertise on organised crime, was shot and killed in Sofia.
In September, a gang beat Ognyan Stefanov, the editor of the Frog News web site, into a three-day coma.
It additionally emerged that month that the State Agency for National Security (DANS) had tapped the phones of a number of lawmakers and journalists.
That, according to the RWB, showed corruption and news manipulation have largely replaced the violent intimidation characterising the first half of the 1990s, although the Stoev and Stefanov incidents show violence still occurs.
"Some journalists are resigned to censoring themselves, while others continue to actively resist business and political pressure," the media watchdog found.
Stoev's murder and Stefanov's assault, it added, "have served as reminders of the risks" for those who defy such pressure.
In addition, a 1998 law banning members of the country's communist-era National Security from holding executive positions in news media is not strictly observed, according to the RWB.
The group also found that the official Union of Bulgarian Journalists has little authority and that the journalists' code of ethics remains largely a piece of paper.
For example, some reporters are prone to accepting "business gifts", since journalism is not a highly esteemed or lucrative career.
According to the group, the country's journalists experience two levels of press freedom, with those in Sofia enjoying more latitude than their counterparts in provincial cities, where powerful figures linked to local officials frown on honest reporting.
Assen Yordanov, a journalist from Burgas, told RWB that the situation has worsened over the past 15 years.
The most sensitive subject, he said, was corruption involving high-level officials in the judiciary or in the interior ministry.
"But the number of such subjects is growing in [this] neo-feudal society," said Yordanov, who has endured threats and a physical assault.
The group said that the European parliamentary elections in June will test the Bulgarian authorities' commitment to ensuring that journalists can do their job freely.
Gazprom euro infusion, temporary remedy for weak Serbian dinar
Russia's Gazprom, by infusing 400m euros into the Serbian economy, is shoring up Serbia's plunging currency.
However, even the most optimistic experts consider the effect temporary.
By Georgi Mitev-Shantek for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 09/02/09

The Serbian dinar enjoyed a surge against the euro immediately after the announcement that Russia's Gazprom would pay 400m euros for a 51% stake in Serbia's national oil company (NIS). As of Friday (February 6th), 92 dinars equalled 1 euro, up from the all-time low of 96.3 to 1 set on January 28th.
Nobody in Serbia expects the Russian purchase to restore the dinar strength seen in the first days of 2009, when 88.6 dinars could buy a euro.
Experts predict the dinar's slide -- 24% versus the euro since October 1st -- to resume after two months at the most.
The Turkish lira, the second fastest-depreciating currency in the region, fell by 17% in the same period.
Serbian experts are divided on the real value of the dinar.
Optimists think it should stabilise around 90 to 95 per euro, while pessimists frightened by the recession and falling exports fear the proper exchange rate is as low as 150 per euro.
A weak exchange rate imposes real hardship on Serbia's citizens, companies and government.
Heavily dependent on imports like other Southeast European countries, Serbia suffers high inflation if its dinar weakens.
In addition, as inflationary expectations build, companies that import their raw materials raise their prices.
Consumers who are paying house and car loans denominated in euros need to come up with more dinars too.
Like its neighbours, Serbia has no easy cure for its fundamental macroeconomic imbalances.
A lack of foreign investment and an 8.2 billion-euro trade deficit in 2008 compound the country's current-account deficit.
Serbia's central bank is struggling to service the nation's foreign debt.
Even with the Gazprom euro infusion, it simply lacks the assets to service foreign debt and prop up the dinar in perpetuity.
The National Bank of Serbia (NBS) sold 1.2 billion euros in 2008 and 420m euros so far in 2009 to stabilise the dinar but to little effect.
Furthermore, the NBS has effectively lost another weapon, the interest rate it pays to banks that buy dinar-denominated repurchase securities.
Fearing recession, the NBS cut that rate, killing off any desire by banks to sell euros in exchange for dinars.
NBS Governor Radovan Jelasic said the bank cannot keep defending the dinar.
"These interventions are taking the place of planned privatisation revenues, foreign direct investment or new credits from abroad, which are the government's responsibility to obtain," Jelasic complained.
The NBS warns the dinar's relentless plunge illustrates a serious defect in the economy and the need for Belgrade to stop spending money it doesn't have.
Budget cuts, attractive conditions for foreign investment and growth of exports -- requiring an increase in product quality -- will stabilise the dinar and bring down inflation, it says.
Croatian real estate market liberalised
Croatia's real estate market opens up to EU citizens in an effort to fulfill another SAA requirement and as a potential boost to the national economy.

Beginning this month, EU citizens have as much opportunity as Croatian nationals do to purchase real estate in Croatia.
In the past, EU citizens had to deal with long bureaucratic procedures and fulfill numerous legal requirements, such as obtaining permission from the foreign and justice ministries to buy property, which took years.
With the passing of the Bill on Property, which was implemented this month, Croatia fulfilled a requirement of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement that grants EU citizens equal rights to purchase property in Croatia.
The new bill, however, excludes agricultural land and protected cultural and national property.
Non-EU citizens still need approval from the foreign and justice ministries in order to purchase real estate.
Despite skyrocketing property prices over the last few years and the onset of the global economic crisis, observers expect brisk sales to foreigners to continue.
Foreigners find Croatia appealing as both a tourist destination and a long-term home.
In the past, a foreigner buying a private residence had to obtain a permit from the two ministries mentioned above.
At least 98% of applicants would obtain a permit, but the process was extremely slow, sometimes taking up to two years.
Another problem was establishing a clear title to the land, as the government updated the Land Registry only a few years ago.
It is now available online.
According to the Croatian Chamber of Economy, more than 3,500 foreign citizens received a permit to buy property in the last decade.
The Germans are in the lead (2,000 permits), followed by Austrians (700), Hungarians (120) and surging numbers of Russians and Britons.
The foreign buyers flock to the coast, preferring Dalmatia and its islands and the Istrian peninsula.
Though official numbers are far from accurate, over 70,000 foreign nationals reportedly already own property in Croatia, either by purchasing it through a foreign company or by arranging a lifelong lease, which does not require a special permit.
Marusa Vizek of the Zagreb Institute of Economics told the financial magazine Banka that the foreign ministry receives up to 1,500 permit requests annually, adding that the price per square metre will not rise after liberalisation, since foreign nationals' interest in Croatian property is already "priced into" the market.
Turkey backs Afghan peace process
Afghani officials visiting Ankara received strong pledges of support from Turkish officials.

Ten members of Afghanistan's High Peace Council paid a four-day visit to Turkey this week, aimed at strengthening bilateral relations.
Led by its chairman, former president Burhanuddin Rabbani, the delegation met with Turkish President Abdullah Gul and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, as well as with members of parliament's Turkey-Afghanistan Friendship Group.
The head of that group, MP Mahmut Esat Guven, told SETimes that Ankara offered "unlimited support" for the reconciliation process in Afghanistan.
"We have assured our Afghani friends we are ready to self-sacrifice for the sake of every peaceful effort made by them, as much as we can," he said.
Turkey has already made significant contributions, especially in the area of infrastructure, Guven added.
"We have opened hospitals there and trained their troops and military," he said.
"Our companies work there, and we host their students at our universities."
As for details of the High Peace Council's visit, he said the Afghan delegation requested Ankara's assistance in forming a new parliament as well as the Afghani part of the bilateral Friendship Group.
Afghanistan's National Assembly held its first meeting January 26th, but failed to elect its speaker or establish the parliamentary committees.
Ankara's goal, Guven said, is to bring all sides to the table, with the exception of the Taliban, which he termed an "unlawful organisation".
Not all are convinced that Turkey's mediating efforts are on the right track.
Gokhari Capoglu, head of the Ankara-based Anatolian Strategic Research Foundation, believes the conditions are not right for such an approach.
"We are talking about a country where soft power is not going to work and all sides fight; don't like each other, as well as those who support their rivals," he told SETimes.
"Turkey had better find a more powerful way to contribute to Afghanistan as a member of an international coalition," Capoglu said.
Other analysts are more hopeful, however.
Sercan Dogan, an Afghanistan specialist at the Ankara-based Center for Middle Eastern Strategic Studies, believes Turkey can succeed in bringing about reconciliation.
That will especially be the case, he said, if Turkey can reach out to other countries with a stake in Afghanistan's future, including Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan.
"Now is the time to talk about Ankara's unlimited co-operation with all the political players," Dogan said.
Bulgaria needs to catch up to join Schengen
Romania must wait for Bulgaria in order to join the travel-free zone.
By Svetla Dimitrova and Paul Ciocoiu in Sofia and Bucharest for Southeast European Times -- 25/02/11
Bulgaria and Romania will not join the so-called Schengen zone in March. [Reuters]
Although Romania has met the conditions for joining the Schengen area, it will have to wait for Bulgaria to fulfill them as well, to gain admission to the 25-nation passport-free zone, according to a statement by the Hungarian EU presidency on Thursday (February 24th).
The two Balkan countries, coupled together since their 2007 entry into the Union, were hoping to become part of the European border-free space by the end of March.
According to the 2005 EU accession treaties with the two nations, neither can join it until both have fulfilled all parts of the Schengen acquis.
"Bulgaria has to date closed all but one of the evaluated areas of the Schengen acquis, with a re-evaluation of the external land borders scheduled for the fourth week of March," the Union presidency said.
The Schengen acquis covers five evaluation areas, including air, sea and land borders; personal data protection; visa issuance; police co-operation; and the Schengen Information System SIS/SIRENE.
The last technical report on Bulgaria's accession progress, which was prepared in mid-January, cited security shortcomings at the country's Turkish border, according to a Sofia News Agency report.
Sofia however has shown "strong commitment" to fulfill its obligations "as soon as possible", Thursday's statement noted.
"Bulgaria will make the necessary efforts to ensure the implementation of the recommendations listed in the evaluation reports and regularly informs the Council [of interior ministers] on the follow-up to these recommendations," it added.
The statement offered no timetable for the two countries' accession.
According to Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov, a decision on whether they can join will be taken in June.
"All European countries, except France, have already made clear their position on the matter," he said in an interview with private Bulgarian TV channel bTV on Friday morning.
According to him, European experts will begin a three-day inspection of Bulgaria's border with Turkey on March 21st.
"The decision that was taken is that no decision is made," Romanian President Traian Basescu said after the EU decision.
"It is essential [that] we wait for the next inspection on the Bulgarian border at the end of March and then we will be able to evaluate a new calendar."
"Romania starts from the premise it doesn't want to be separated from Bulgaria and we are not asking for this.
At the same time, we are starting from the absolute premise we will not accept supplementary conditions.
This is not possible," Basescu underlined.
In December, France and Germany voiced opposition to Bulgaria and Romania's admission, citing concerns over the countries' slow progress in fighting organised crime and corruption.
Speaking to visiting EU President Herman van Rompuy on Wednesday, Romanian Prime Minister Emil Boc said "We [need] a fair evaluation within the Union as concerns the accession to the Schengen area, without [being] connected to subjects that do not concern the Schengen.
We are expecting a calendar of accession from the acting EU presidency."
Macedonia Overhauls its Army
Major changes to the Macedonian Army are under way, as part of the Strategic Defence Review aimed at meeting NATO standards.

The Macedonian Army (ARM) is implementing a Strategic Defence Review aimed at transforming it into a small modern army, in keeping with NATO standards. A Joint Operation Command was promoted in Kumanovo on 11 August, ending the operations of the previous Land Army Command.
"The goals that have to be achieved with the formation of the Joint Operation Command derive from the Strategic Defence Review," said Commander Atanas Jovcevski of the Macedonian Land Army. "They include establishment of a new organisational structure and termination of some ARM units."
According to Jovcevski, certain units that do not fit into the Joint Operation Command will be dissolved.
Redeployment of the technical and tangible resources, military equipment and weaponry will follow.
"The Republic of Macedonia is redeploying its resources on behalf of defence and security and in line with its plans for a full NATO membership," ARM Chief of Staff General Miroslav Stojanovski said. "We are aware that NATO is changing and we have to adjust to those changes."
Macedonia faces a new strategic setting, including the threats posed by terrorism, and must transform its army in order to meet such challenges, Stojanovski said.
The reserve infantry brigades will be abolished as part of the changes. The Strategic Defence Review, which should be implemented by 2007, also provides for transformation of the barracks, facilities and all immovable property, which the Joint Operation Command no longer needs.
One of the major tasks that must be completed is the handover of the Macedonian borders from the ARM to the border police.
That process is to be completed by 29 August, when control of the country's western border with Albania is transferred.
Along the other borders, the handover is already well under way.
A total of 1,500 army personnel will join the border police as a result of the change.
Serbian Politicians Say Dropping of Charges Against Milosevic's Son Part of Political Deal
Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's minority government needs the silent support of Slobodan Milosevic's Socialists to stay in power.
The price for that support may have included the dropping of charges against Milosevic family members, according to the opposition.

Opposition politicians in Serbia have blasted the recent withdrawal of legal charges against Slobodan Milosevic's son, charging that the move is part of a political deal made by the government of Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"The dropping of charges against Marko Milosevic is part of a political trade with the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS)," Aleksander Vlahovic of Serbian President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party (DS) said in an interview the Belgrade-based daily Blic carried Monday (15 August).
The ruling coalition, which lacks a parliamentary majority, relies on the "silent support" of Milosevic's SPS.
An earlier withdrawal of legal charges against Milosevic's wife, Mira, was also rumoured to be politically motivated.
Marko Milosevic, who is believed to be hiding in Russia, was sentenced in absentia by a court in his parents' hometown of Pozarevac to six months in jail for threatening an activist of the Otpor movement, which opposed his father's regime.
Earlier this month, however, Zoran Milovanovic retreated from his initial account of the event.
Several days later all charges against the former Yugoslav ruler's son were withdrawn.
Milovanovic's retraction came soon after his mother had written to Kostunica and Tadic saying her family was again receiving death threats and could no longer cope.
On Friday, Tadic called on State Prosecutor Slobodan Jankovic to examine the legality of the withdrawal of the charges and issue a report to the public.
Jankovic returns from his summer holiday Monday.
Nenad Konstantinovic, a member of the DS executive board, said Jankovic should respond to the party's questions by Tuesday and also clarify if he had been in contact with the justice minister and other officials in connection with the case.
If he fails to do so, the party would seek his resignation, Konstantinovic said.
"Apparently the law that applies to others does not apply to Marko Milosevic and Mira Markovic," Belgrade-based Radio B92 quoted Konstantinovic as saying Friday.
Local media speculate that those developments are meant to facilitate a Milosevic family reunion in The Hague, where Slobodan Milosevic is on trial.
Meanwhile, Serbian Capital Investments Minister Velimir Ilic denied allegations that he had intervened in the case.
He said he had only suggested to Milovanovic that he "forgive" the former Yugoslav president's son.
"I told Milovanovic: 'If you want to -- take the arrest warrant off his back ...
Let bygones be bygones, let him go and see his father'," the minister told Radio-Television Serbia.
Serbian Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic, a leading member of ruling coalition member G17 Plus, described the dropping of charges against Marko Milosevic as a "shameful" act and a blow to the pro-democracy forces in Serbia.
If Jankovic is found to have intervened in the case, the party will demand his resignation, the minister said Friday.
G17 Plus will also request a meeting of the governing coalition to discuss the case.
121 Dead in Plane Crash Near Athens
Investigators are struggling to explain why a commercial airliner bound for Athens apparently experienced a catastrophic in-flight loss of cabin pressure or oxygen, resulting in the worst aviation crash in Greek history.

The worst accident in Greek history took place on Sunday (14 August) at around noon, when a passenger jet from Larnaca crashed near Athens.
It carried 115 passengers -- most of them Cypriots -- and 6 crew members.
All died in the crash.
Flight HCY 522, operated by Helios Airlines, had been scheduled to land in Athens and then continue to Prague.
It entered Greek airspace at 9:37 am, and was identified by the Greek Civil Aviation Service (YPA).
Half an hour later, when the control tower at Athens International Airport attempted to contact the plane, there was no response.
At 10:20 am, the YPA contacted its Cypriot counterpart, and found out that the pilot had reported a problem in the air-conditioning system.
At 10:25, the YPA mobilised all its national search and rescue services.
At that time, the plane started circling the island of Kea, south of Athens.
It is now presumed to have been on autopilot.
Five minutes later, two F16 fighter jets were scrambled to escort it.
They subsequently reported that the pilot was missing and the co-pilot was slumped over the controls.
There was no sign of life in the plane and the oxygen masks had dropped.
Two persons were then seen in the cockpit, but it was not clear if they were the pilots or passengers making a last-ditch effort to take control of the plane.
Civil and military rescue services were then set in motion on the ground, at sea, and in the air, in order to get closer to the area and be prepared to assist in the rescue services.
A Puma helicopter, a frigate and two destroyer ships responded to the call immediately.
At 12:07 pm, the plane crashed in Grammatiko, a mountainous area north of Athens, possibly when its fuel ran out.
Thirty-five ambulances arrived at the scene, ten mobile medical service units and many specialised service vehicles.
At the crash site, only the tail of the fuselage remained intact, and the government quickly ruled out the possibility of any survivors.
The debris sparked fires, which hindered the work of rescue and salvage crews.
Investigators are now struggling to explain what appears to have been a catastrophic loss of cabin pressure or oxygen supply at 35,000 feet.
On Monday, the Greek Defence Ministry reported that many of the bodies recovered were "frozen solid", and some were found wearing oxygen masks.
According to the Greek government's spokesman, Theodore Roussopoulos, one of the passengers was able to send an SMS text message to his cousin.
"The pilot has turned blue.
Cousin, farewell, we're freezing," it said.
The same plane was reported to have had a similar problem in a flight from Warsaw to Larnaca on 16 December 2004.
On that occasion, the pilot quickly dropped the plane to 11,000 feet to avoid cabin decompression at a high altitude, and many passengers were taken to hospital upon arrival, because of the sudden change in pressure.
Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis cut his holiday short in order to manage the crisis.
All the political leaders in Greece and in Cyprus expressed their condolences, and Tuesday was proclaimed a national day of mourning.

Montenegro Strives to Increase FDI for 2005
Montenegrin European Integration Minister Gordana Djurovic is pushing the government to formulate a plan to kick Montenegro's FDI into high gear for 2005.
By Antonela Krstovic for Southeast European Times in Podgorica - 16/11/04
Because competition on the global capital market is fierce, authorities will need to work hard to attract FDI, says European Integration Minister Gordana Djurovic. [File]
Montenegro is seeking to boost Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) dramatically during 2005, following disappointing numbers this year.
According to European Integration Minister Gordana Djurovic, the government hopes privatisation campaigns, greenfield investments and other development projects will result in an FDI inflow of 150m euros.
Because competition on the global capital market is fierce, Djurovic says, authorities will need to work hard to promote Montenegro through campaigns targeting potential investors, as well as through bilateral negotiations.
Next year is considered crucial, since many international experts believe FDI will begin to decrease in 2006 and 2007.
This year, an Agency for Investment Promotion was established.
It is expected to soon start playing an important role, especially in light of the upcoming privatisations of large enterprises, such as the state-owned telecom and aluminium factory.
FDI is a key instrument for increasing production, lowering unemployment, enhancing infrastructure and improving the standard of living.
Despite the ongoing privatisation process, Serbia-Montenegro and other Balkan countries have so far not been able to attract foreign capital to the same degree as countries like Poland and the Czech Republic -- a fact which officials chalk up to the SEE countries' small markets and late transition process.
International indicators suggest that Serbia-Montenegro does not have a significant investment rating.
Among regional countries, it lags behind Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania.
Responding to this problem, Podgorica has hired foreign consultants to assess the overall investment environment and possibilities for business development.
A recent Foreign Investment Advisory Service's (FIAS) report, "Diagnoses of Investment Environment in Montenegro", highlighted some of the challenges the government faces in attracting FDI.
In addition to the small, low-revenue market and late transition, the republic is also hampered by structurally weak industries, shortcomings in the administrative system, macroeconomic instability and corruption.
However, FIAS experts also pointed to a number of advantages that Montenegro enjoys -- a good geographic location, fast-paced economic reforms, a qualified workforce and rapid privatisation.
According to the FIAS, Montenegro's potential has yet to be promoted fully through governmental activities.
Thus, according to Djurovic, the government must formulate a long-term plan and a clear strategy to tap this potential
Macedonian Prime Minister Kostov Resigns
Parliament will officially announce Prime Minister Hari Kostov's resignation during a meeting scheduled for Thursday, launching a ten-day period during which President Branko Crvenkovski should give the mandate for forming a new government.

Macedonian Prime Minister Hari Kostov resigned after five months in the post on Monday (15 November).
The move also entails the resignation of the entire cabinet, though it will remain in office until a new government is chosen, to prevent a power vacuum.
Parliament will announce the prime minister's resignation in a meeting scheduled for Thursday, launching a ten-day period during which President Branko Crvenkovski should give the mandate for forming the new government.
Whoever receives the mandate will have 20 days in which to assemble his or her team and come up with a working programme.
"Despite its declaratory commitment, one coalition partner in the government understands its role and place in the government only as an instrument for partial implementation of the political processes of the Ohrid Framework Agreement by advocating urgent implementation of the principle of adequate and just representation, which is a long-term process apart from the significant results in this area in the past two years," Kostov said.
According to the prime minister, the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) blocked laws that did not influence interethnic relations but were important for attracting foreign investments.
"The government has been blocked in the past period, even in issues concerning some economic reforms that underwent a few phases of the parliamentary procedure and are a part of arrangements with international financial institutions," Kostov said. "The principle of setting conditions and replacing expert and professional knowledge with political bargains is becoming practice.
This has narrowed the possibilities for efficient operating."
DUI expressed surprise at Kostov's decision.
"As the coalition partner, we were neither informed nor had we any announcements of his resignation. [His] accusations against DUI are very serious.
We have always thought our co-operation with the prime minister was successful and productive.
So far, we jointly surmounted some serious challenges, such as the last one with the referendum," said party spokeswoman Ermira Mehmeti.
The largest party in the ruling coalition, the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDSM), has been without a leader since Crvenkovski's election as president.
The party conference, originally scheduled for the second half of next month, has been moved up to 25 November.
In the next few days, SDSM will have to decide whether its new party leader will also be the new prime minister or whether the two positions will be separated.
Bosnian Serb Police Make First War Crimes Arrests
Bosnian Serb police have detained eight people indicted by a local court on charges of war crimes.
The arrests are the first of their kind made by RS authorities, who say the move signals co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.

Authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) Serb-controlled entity, Republika Srpska (RS) have arrested eight people charged with committing war crimes against Bosnian Muslims during the 1992-1995 conflict. Monday's (15 November) action marked the entity's first step towards the capture of war crimes suspects.
However, none of the detainees is among the 21 fugitives being sought by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
Acting on an order of the Sarajevo cantonal court, RS special police forces arrested Jovan Skobo, Svetko Novakovic, Momir Glisic, Goran Vasic, Zeljko Mitrovic, Veselin Cancar, Dragoje Radovanovic and Momir Skakavac.
Two of them, Skobo and Novakovic, have been charged with genocide, while the others are accused of committing crimes against civilians and prisoners of war, said court official Slobodan Nikolic.
According to local media reports, the men were arrested in the towns of Pale, Lukavica and Foca during raids conducted by RS special police forces.
According to Nikolic, all eight suspects have been transferred to the court in Sarajevo.
Local press reports Tuesday suggested they would remain in custody for a month.
The ICTY has agreed that the suspects should be tried locally, according to Judge Sreto Crnjak, with the Sarajevo cantonal court.
The arrests came amid strong pressure from the international community for RS authorities to start handing over indictees wanted by the ICTY, including wartime Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander, Ratko Mladic.
During a briefing at the UN Security Council last week, High Representative Paddy Ashdown again criticised RS authorities for their failure in this regard.
He warned it could jeopardise BiH's chances for joining the EU and NATO.
The chief spokesperson in Ashdown's office welcomed Monday's arrests as a positive first step, but stressed the distinction between domestic and international indictments.
"Although the alleged crimes of those arrested are serious, they are small fry in comparison to those indicted by The Hague tribunal," the BiH daily Dnevni Avaz quoted Irena Guzelova as saying. "The RS authorities will ultimately be judged on their record with regard to the arrest of Hague indicted war criminals," she added.
RS officials said Monday the arrests were an indication of the commitment to co-operate with the ICTY.
RS Interior Minister Darko Matijasevic pledged further steps towards meeting the entity's obligations to the tribunal.
In other news, the Council of the EU reportedly decided Monday to expand a freeze on all funds and economic resources of persons indicted by the ICTY, adding 18 new names of indictees to the list, which originally included Karadzic, Mladic and Croatian fugitive Ante Gotovina.
The newly added names include 17 ethnic Serbs, as well as Miroslav Bralo, a Bosnian Croat who was recently transferred to The Hague following his surrender.
All but Bralo are also barred from entering the EU, newspapers in BiH reported Tuesday.
"We welcome the EU decision.
It represents another step that will limit space for manoeuvre to those avoiding and obstructing justice," Guzelova said. "We expect BiH authorities to do the similar thing and freeze assets belonging to the 18 Hague indictees."
Croatia's presidential election right around the corner
Polls show that the SDP's Ivo Josipovic is in the lead, but the outcome of Croatia's presidential election remains uncertain.

Croatia is ready to elect its third president since the country declared independence.
The first election round is scheduled for Sunday, December 27th.
Should no candidate win a majority, a second round of voting will be held on January 10th.
There are 12 candidates vying for the position.
Kresimir Macan, a prominent political analyst, describes the campaign so far as "the most boring campaign ever, without any originality or political imagination", lacking a heated debate, but rehashing topics of interest to individual candidates.
One key campaign issue, however, is the economic downturn.
According to the latest polls, the Social Democratic Party's (SDP) Ivo Josipovic will easily enter the second round with over 28% of the vote.
"The citizens will be able to vote between honesty and corruption, between light and darkness, and my contacts with the public indicate that citizens want a just Croatia and a better life," the Zagreb-based Vecernji quoted Josipovic as saying.
He titled his campaign "Justice", promising to fight corruption on all levels.
Two women are running for president: Vesna Pusic of the Croatian People's Party and independent candidate Vesna Skare Ozbolt, but polls suggest neither is likely to win.
"We made it clear that a campaign can be conducted with competence and knowledge, not just slogans," said Pusic.
Research company Promocija Plus suggests that Zagreb Mayor Milan Bandic, running as an independent, will rake in about 18% of the vote, closely followed by former economy minister and fellow independent Nadan Vidosevic.
Dragan Primorac, a former education minister, will attract about 8% of the vote, followed by ruling Croatian Democratic Union candidate, Andrija Hebrang, a former health minister, with 7.2%.
The presidential race might be decided by the 260,000 Bosnia and Herzegovina Croats in the country, who will cast their ballots at 124 polling stations.
The president of Croatia plays a role in foreign policy-making, is the chief military commander and heads the national intelligence service.
Incumbent Stipe Mesic has served two consecutive terms and cannot run again.
Boc again at the wheel in Romania
Romania has a new coalition government, led by a familiar face.
Are months of political crisis now ending?

Romanian Prime Minister Emil Boc was reconfirmed on Wednesday (December 23rd) as the head of a new coalition government.
By a vote of 276 to 135, parliament gave the thumbs up to his team of 15 ministers, many retaining their jobs from the previous cabinet.
In comments afterwards, Boc pledged to undertake measures that were "not necessarily popular, but badly needed".
"It is not necessarily a moment of joy, but of responsibility and work," he said."It is a new partnership between the government and parliament, which I think Romanians will benefit from.
People are tired of speeches and expect us to do the right thing for the country.
"But we have to be aware of this: before faring well, we will fare a little badly," he cautioned, warning 2010 could be difficult despite forecasts of modest economic growth.
President Traian Basescu, fresh from his own re-election earlier in the month, swore in the government following parliament's approval.
He voiced hope that it would succeed in alleviating the country's economic crisis.
The cabinet's first move, taken Wednesday evening, was to approve a draft state budget for 2010.
Boc says he hopes parliament will endorse it by mid-January.
Budget approval is a key condition for receiving further disbursements from an IMF loan, which has been put on ice for months due to the country's political stalemate.
With 240 seats, four above the threshold for a majority, the new coalition government's parliamentary majority is a fragile one.
Faced with opposition from the Social Democrats and the Liberals, Boc's Democrat-Liberals had to team up with the Magyar-oriented UDMR, other minority representatives in parliament, and the bloc of independent MPs.
UDMR has three portfolios in the new cabinet -- Culture, Health and Environment -- while the independents will be represented by Gabriel Oprea, who now heads defence.
Despite their parties' stance, 36 Social Democratic and Liberal MPs joined in endorsing the government Wednesday, apparently out of fears that Romania was otherwise headed for early elections.
Boc has been at the helm in one way or another since December 2008.
He first led a coalition government together with the Social Democrats, but they withdrew this fall as the presidential election approached.
The prime minister then headed an interim administration until it was toppled by a no-confidence vote.
Serbia's Zastava car factory becomes part of Fiat Group
The year is ending on a high note for one Serbian factory.

Fiat and the Serbian government signed an annex Wednesday (December 23rd) to their 2008 joint venture agreement that will allow the Italian carmaker to take over the Balkan nation's Zastava automobile factory.
The document was signed in Belgrade by Fiat Group Vice-President Alfredo Altavilla, Fiat Automobili Srbija CEO Giovanni De Filippis and Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Mladjan Dinkic.
"This is a great day for Serbian industry," Dinkic said.
Under Wednesday's agreement, Fiat will acquire a 67% majority stake in the car factory once it has paid half of its 200m-euro share in the founding capital of the joint venture company, as envisioned in the September 2008 deal.
Altavilla said that the money will be transferred by the end of this year. The second 100m-euro installment will be paid in 2010, when Fiat will also invest 700m euros to modernise the car plant located in Kragujevac, Serbia's fourth largest city, about 140km south of Belgrade.
The Serbian government will retain 33% of Zastava, will be providing property and equipment for the joint venture company and will contribute 50m euros to its founding capital.
The annual output of the factory is expected to reach 200,000 cars by 2011.
Under Wednesday's deal, that same year, the factory, which already manufactures the Fiat Punto, will start producing two new models to be sold on the US and European markets.
Dinkic said he expects exports to earn around 2 billion euros annually.
According to him, the new company will employ about 2,500 workers.
Zastava, which is best known for its Yugo model, produced 16,000 Fiat Puntos for the domestic market this year.
Speaking at a news conference after Wednesday's signing, Altavilla praised Serbian President Boris Tadic for his personal role in clinching the deal.
"Tadic gave us his support and I am truly grateful to him," he said, thanking also the entire Serbian government, and especially Dinkic, for their co-operation and engagement.
In September of last year, Serbian officials hailed the agreement with Italy's largest carmaker as the biggest foreign investment in years.
But implementing the project slowed due to global financial turmoil.
"This means that the economic crisis is at the end for Serbia," Dinkic said before signing the annex Wednesday.

The Berlin Wall's last domino
Memories of considerable economic development and freedom to travel make many Bosnia and Herzegovina citizens nostalgic for the Yugoslav brand of socialism.
By Antonio Prlenda for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo -- 09/12/09

Devastated by the 1992-1995 conflict and with their economy hampered by nationalistic and corrupt politicians, the majority of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) citizens are nostalgic about life prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall.
"Some say socialist Yugoslavia fell with the Berlin Wall," Sarajevo law professor Zdravko Grebo told the SETimes.
He explains that the political reforms of 1965 led to the introduction of a form of market economy, which, in turn, led to open borders allowing Yugoslavs to travel freely.
This setup eased internal pressures and tensions.
In addition, Yugoslavs enjoyed a strong social safety net, employment, and free quality education and health care.
"Yugoslavia was different from other communist countries within Europe.
But with the fall of the Berlin Wall, that positive difference just disappeared," Grebo observed.
Although that fall changed Europe, it was not particularly big news in BiH at the time.
However, adds Grebo, "soon after the fall of the Iron Curtain, new barriers began to be raised.
Sarajevo was under siege for more than three years. [Today] BiH citizens still face a visa regime for travel within Europe."
He says it is hard to tell whether there are more freedoms and rights today than under socialist Yugoslavia.
"There was no freedom of the press and expression in Yugoslavia.
Now we have a multi-partisan political system, independent judiciary and media, but social, economic, cultural and educational rights were much better guaranteed for the majority of our citizens in the past.
The current state of human rights is a catastrophe."
Retiree Zdravko Prlenda, 66, describes the last 20 years as "socialism with a human face".
He said that the state provided him a flat when he was very young and life was much more secure.
While he was never a communist party member, "the fact one had to be a communist to be 'morally and politically suitable' for a promotion always made me angry," said Prlenda.
By contrast, he says "in today's BiH there is way too much crime, corruption and unemployment.
There are no smiles on people's faces like in the past."
Journalist Hajdar Arifagic, 62, says that expectations of the fall of communism have definitely not been met in BiH.
He believes that Yugoslavia would have been the very first Eastern European country to join the EU and NATO had it remained unified.
"We do not have freedom of movement to travel abroad, we do not have a peaceful state and developing economy, we have no [sound] policy; we neither have freedom, equality nor brotherhood.
Every ideal of the French Revolution failed in BiH, though I do not see them [reached] even on global level," says Arifagic.
"If the Berlin Wall was a line of dominos that were falling, then I feel BiH was the very last domino. … The whole pressure of the process has fallen on that domino."
No negotiations date for Macedonia
Athens welcomes and Skopje criticises Tuesday's move to postpone a key milestone.
By Marina Stojanovska for Southeast European Times in Skopje -- 09/12/09
The EU foreign ministers will decide the start date for Macedonia's negotiations next year. [EU]
Greek leaders expressed satisfaction Tuesday (December 8th) as EU foreign ministers put off deciding on a launch date for Macedonia's accession talks.
The name dispute between the two countries must be resolved first, Greek Alternate Foreign Minister Dimitris Droutsas said.
"Before a solution is achieved there is no question of starting negotiations," he said, adding that Greece is ready to help with the accession process once the long-standing issue is overcome.
To avoid an outright Greek veto, the EU ministers decided to revisit the matter during the first half of 2010, when Spain will have taken over the rotating EU presidency.
Although current presidency holder Sweden had presented draft proposals concerning a start date, it was unable to achieve a consensus in the face of strong objections from Athens.
Reaction in Skopje was immediate.
Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said the decision was simply a more sophisticated version of what happened at the NATO summit in Bucharest last April, when Greece squelched Macedonia's NATO bid.
Open issues between the two countries cannot be tackled through blackmail and blockades, he stressed.
Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki, meanwhile, described the outcome of Tuesday's EU meeting as "another Greek hypocrisy".
A group of students from Skopje's Sts. Cyril and Methodius University announced plans for a protest Wednesday in front of the EU representative's office.
According to European Parliament member Eduard Kukan, the chances of a achieving a breakthrough rest with the newly-elected Greek government.
"If there is no progress under [new Greek Prime Minister George] Papandreou, I really don't know how we can resolve the name issue," he said.
Kukan, who chairs the European Parliament's delegation for relations with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo, cautioned Macedonians against allowing the dispute to fuel nationalistic sentiment.
Gruevski's government has very strong popular support, he noted.
"This could be used in two directions: either to approve brave, courageous political decisions on the name issue, or to exacerbate nationalism," he said.
Last week, Gruevski met with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso to discuss the situation.
Barroso said that he is convinced that there is real possibility of a solution and both countries need to show political will to achieve it.
"EU membership is the most important goal in a foreign policy of your country, together with the NATO membership," he told Gruevski.
Gruevski said his latest direct meetings with Papandreou had a positive tone but failed to yield anything concrete.
"There is dialogue …but still we don't have [any] serious progress on the substance of the issue," he said.

Serbia's Conservatives Seek Milosevic Party Backing
Since talks on a government coalition in Serbia have stalled, a conservative party is turning to Slobodan Milosevic's Socialists for support.
(AP, Reuters, Scotsman, Transitions Online, Radio B92, RFE/RL - 02/02/04)
The Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) is expected to decide Tuesday (3 February) whether it will back the nominee of the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) for parliamentary speaker in an election scheduled for Wednesday.
The conservative DSS, the strongest among four democratic parties that won seats in December's parliamentary elections, sought the Socialists' support after weeks of talks on a new government resulted in a deadlock.
Citing "national interests", SPS leaders indicated after talks Monday with the DSS that their party, officially led by detained war crimes indictee Slobodan Milosevic, would likely support the conservatives' parliamentary speaker candidate.
However, the key issue in the talks, an SPS official said, was the platform of the future government, which would likely be headed by DSS leader Vojislav Kostunica.
"In any case, not even for the sake of political stability, can we support a political platform which is opposed to what the SPS stands for," said Ivica Dacic, president of the party's central committee.
According to SPS member Milorad Vucelic, the party would demand a review of the privatisation process and a ban on further extradition of Serbs to The Hague.
Confirming consultations with the Socialists, DSS deputy leader Dejan Mihajlov said "there were and there will be" more talks with them.
He also ruled out the possibility of further coalition talks with the Democratic Party (DS), another of the four political forces in the democratic bloc.
The DSS, the DS, the G17 Plus and the Serbian Renewal Movement-New Serbia (SPO-NS) coalition together won a 146-seat majority in the 250-seat legislature. With 53 MPs, the DSS has the largest parliamentary representation among the democratic parties.
It came in second, behind the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS) of war crimes detainee Vojislav Seselj.
The SRS holds 82 seats, while Milosevic's Socialists have 22.
After several rounds, coalition talks among the four parties in the democratic bloc fell apart.
The DS, which plays a leading role in the outgoing government, does not support the DSS candidate for parliamentary speaker, Dragan Marsicanin. On 27 January, when the parliament held its constitutive session, the election of a speaker failed, as the DS and the SPS abstained from voting.
Furthermore, the DS has refused a scenario supported by the other three democratic parties to elect the speaker first so the parliament can begin work and then seek a government solution.
It has insisted that all institutional issues be resolved simultaneously, even if this means postponing the process for a week or two.
Following failure of the talks, the DS, which won 37 parliamentary seats, said it would not support a minority government of the other three parties.
Condemning the DSS move to seek the Socialists' support, the DS has said it would not join a coalition that includes the SPS.
"The Democratic Party will not take part in a government of democrats and anti-democrats, we'll be in opposition," DS deputy leader Boris Tadic said Sunday.
A day later, Belgrade-based Radio B92 quoted him as warning that a coalition between the DSS, G17 Plus, the SPO-NS and the SPS would mean a return to the period before October 2000, when democratic parties overthrew the Milosevic regime.
A coalition government including the SPS is also likely to dismay the West, which has been calling for a government of parties in the democratic bloc.
On Monday, the SRS issued a statement demanding either that parliament be formed promptly or new general elections called as soon as possible.

Privatisation Plans for Ancient Sites in Turkey Criticised
Experts caution that festivals, shows and concerts may attract more tourists to archaeological sites and museums, but could also cause problems.
By Mustafa Azizoglu for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 24/12/03
The Turkish Culture and Tourism Ministry is planning to transfer the operational rights of ancient sites and museums to private tourism companies and associations.
The move aims to revitalise ancient sites and museums that have been attracting fewer and fewer visitors each year.
According to a draft law still being prepared, the government will turn over museums to foundations and associations and transfer the ancient sites to tourism companies along with their ticket office income and sales units.
Companies will be responsible for all the excavation, entrance fees, and the organised events held at the sites, though the ministry will continue to appoint excavation team heads.
Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, Ephesus and other top sites in the country would be excluded from the framework of the draft law.
Officials said their main aim is to revitalise ancient sites with artistic activities, along the lines of the Aspendos Festival.
Held on the shores of the Mediterranean near Antalya since 1994, the festival features opera, ballet and classical music performances.
The ministry sees a potential for similar festivals to attract tourists.
Private companies would prepare the activities without burdening the state budget, promoting them in their catalogues and brochures.
Meetings are planned with local officials of towns that qualify as tourist destinations.
But experts have expressed doubts about the proposal.
"You can auction Afrodisias, Troy or Ephesus," said UNESCO Turkey National Committee Director Coskun Ozgunel. "Troy produces about 8m euros.
Ephesus has 4m euros of income each year.
What about the small places?"
According to Ozgunel, private companies do not have the infrastructure to undertake such a responsibility.
"There are some private museums in Europe, but these are mostly castles or chateaux they inherit from their ancestors.
In Turkey, all the ancient sites and museums are public property," he said.
Professor Altan Cilingiroglu from Ege University's Archaeology Department said he is not against artistic activities being held on the sites, but believes that the organisers should be careful.
"They didn't use a 10,000-watt sound system in ancient times", he said.
He added that the protection committee should decide on the process for conducting repairs. "Eliminating ministerial supervision could have severe effects on the sites," Cilingiroglu said.

Turkish Court Indicts Key Istanbul Bombings Suspect
A Turkish court has charged a man with involvement in Istanbul's November bombings.
The suspect is said to have played a key role in the attacks that killed 62 people and injured hundreds.
(Bloomberg - 15/12/03; AP, Reuters, BBC, VOA, Anatolia - 14/12/03)
A Turkish court on Sunday (14 December) charged a man with involvement in last month's suicide bombings in Istanbul, which killed 62 people and injured hundreds more.
The suspect has reportedly admitted to recruiting the perpetrators and prepared the explosive devices used in all four attacks.
According to the Turkish daily Hurriyet, Fevzi Yitiz was caught as he was trying to flee into Iran using a false passport.
He is thought to have played a key role in the preparation of the deadly attacks against the Neve Shalom and Beth Israel synagogues on 15 November and the bombings of the British consulate and the offices of the London-based HSBC bank five days later.
Yitiz reportedly rented a workshop in an industrial district in Istanbul, where the bombs were assembled and mounted on the four trucks.
The premises had been rented as a detergent factory, police said.
"Every once in a while we saw men carrying bags in and out. That's all," the AP quoted a worker at a metal shop near the workshop as saying.
He had not seen anyone in the shop recently, he added.
Local press reports said Yitiz fled Istanbul three days before the synagogue bombings.
Early Sunday, an armoured vehicle escorted by a convoy of police cars took a hand-cuffed Yitiz -- described as being about 30 years old, with dark hair and a short beard -- to the workshop for reconstruction of the crime scene, a standard procedure in the Turkish investigative process.
Police sources said Yitiz has admitted to having hired the four suicide bombers -- all Turkish nationals.
"During his interrogation, the suspect said that he had training on war techniques, bomb making, usage of heavy weapons in a camp under the control of radical organisations in an Asian country in 1994," the Istanbul Security Directorate said in a statement.
The statement noted that a total of 94 people have been interrogated so far, and 31 of them have been detained because of alleged connections to the terrorist attacks.
The Turkish daily Milliyet reported that Yitiz had been trained in Afghanistan.
Last month, Justice Minister Cemil Cicek said Chechens and Turks linked to the al-Qaeda network were involved in the preparation of the explosive devices used in the blasts.
On Sunday, the death toll from the four attacks rose to 62 after a 31-year-old computer expert, identified as Selahattin Yildirim, died in hospital from injuries sustained in the bombing at the HSBC bank.
More than 700 people, mostly Turks, were wounded in the blasts.
Role of Muslim Charities in the Balkans Comes Under Scrutiny
Muslim charities in Southeastern Europe have provided important humanitarian services.
Many, however, are suspected of links to terrorist organisations.

The 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre in New York launched a general discussion concerning the role of fundamentalist Islam around the world, with attention being drawn to the role played by Muslim charities.
While many of these charities have provided humanitarian assistance and relief to thousands of refugees in war torn areas in Africa, Asia and Europe, some have also funded terrorist activities.
Several Muslim relief organisations are currently active in the Balkans, having established operations there after the conflict in the former Yugoslavia.
The threat of terrorism has led governments in the region to examine their activities, some of which have been outside the scope of relief efforts.
For example, authorities found plans for chemical attacks and maps of Washington at the Sarajevo offices of the Saudi High Commission for Aid to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
Other Saudi charities in the Balkans have also proved to have links to terrorism.
Meanwhile, the Chicago office of the Islamic Benevolence Committee, which was active in BiH and Kosovo, was used as a cover by Osama bin Laden's operatives until authorities indicted its head for conspiracy and fraud and blocked its bank accounts.
The Islamic Relief Agency, the Red Crescent, the Co-ordination Council of Islamic Associations, the Islamic World Committee and the Koran Foundation are under close surveillance for connections with terrorist organisations in the Balkans.
Albania has closed down several Muslim charities and financial institutions that may have been linked to terrorist activity.
The Bank of Albania ordered a check on private banks of Muslim and Arab origin.
Other charities that operate in the region include Islamic Relief, Muslim Aid, Malaysian Relief International, Kosovo Humanitarian Aid, ICNA Relief and Convoy of Mercy.
Islamic Relief and Muslim Aid have developed activities in Albania, BiH and Kosovo.
In Kosovo, more than 30 Islamic NGOs are active.
One of them, the Saudi Joint Relief Committee for Kosovo, which is also active in BiH, has come under suspicion of financing terrorist activities.
The organisations have mostly originated from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and other Gulf states.
At the same time, Islamic organisations have without doubt provided humanitarian assistance to the Muslim population in the Balkans.
Muslim Aid alone has donors that contributed at least 1.5m euros towards aid for refugees from Kosovo.
Provided they avoid any connection to terrorist organisations, Muslim charities have an important role to play in the region.
Despite drop, unemployment remains a problem for some
The rate of unemployment in both Bulgaria and Romania was lower than the EU average in 2007, while in other Balkan nations it is still soaring and could force more young people to leave their homes in search of job opportunities.

Unemployment in Bulgaria continued to drop, reaching a 6.2% average for the country in May, down from 6.5% the previous month, the Balkan nation's Employment Agency said in mid-June.
Of the nearly 14,000 new job offers, more than 2,000 were for seasonal work in tourism, agriculture transport, the forestry and other sectors, while nearly as many came under special employment promotion programmes.
In Sofia, Plovdiv, Varna, Burgas and several other cities in Bulgaria, the rate of unemployment was typically lower than the average for the country.
But in some it was more than, or nearly, twice as high.
At 13.7%, it was highest in the town of Targovishte, 270km northeast of Sofia.
The northern towns of Montana and Shumen came next, with 11.4% and 11.3%, respectively.
In four other towns, unemployment ranged between 10% and 11% of the workforce there.
According to the Employment Agency's Yearbook 2007, the rate of unemployment by municipalities varies within extremely broad ranges.
Thus, in some areas, in Bulgaria's northwest and northeast mainly, the figures are higher than the national average.
In the municipality of Nikola Kozlevo, in the district of the northeastern town of Shumen, for example, the average annual unemployment rate in 2007 was 55.1%, nearly eight times higher than the national average and the highest for the country.
Unemployment peaked in Bulgaria in 2001, when some 663,000 people were out of a job, representing 19.5% of the labour force aged 15-64.
Since then the number of the registered jobseekers has been steadily decreasing in the Balkan nation, reaching 286,980 people in 2007, or 6.9% of the labour force over 15 years of age, below the 7.1% average for the EU.
Of all registered unemployed in Bulgaria last year, close to 60% were women and some 62% were with basic or lower education.
Less than a third of the employees working under a labour contract in Bulgaria in 2006 were in the public sector.
According to the country's statistical office, the vast majority were in the education sector, the public administration, and in health and social activities.
Of the nearly 1.6 million employees with labour contracts in the private sector, more than 610,000 were in manufacturing and over 335,000 in trade, repair of motor vehicles and personal and household appliances.

In Romania, the unemployment rate for 2007 was even lower than that of Bulgaria, standing at 6.4%.
But it was much higher than Cyprus's annual average of only 3.9% last year.
In Greece, the number of jobless comprised 8.3% of the active population over 15 years of age, according to Eurostat.
The figures for Croatia and Turkey, which began their accession negotiations with the EU in October 2005, are similar to that of Greece, at 9.1% and 8.5%, respectively.
Citing the results of a labour force survey in Croatia, the European Commission (EC) said there was indication that the unemployment rate had declined to 8.2% in the third quarter of 2007, largely due to seasonal factors, such as tourism.
As to Turkey, the EC said developments on the country's labour market remained in line with traditional seasonal patterns in the last quarter of 2007. "The number of employed decreased by 6.6%, mainly in the agricultural sector.
In the manufacturing sector the number of employed increased by 1.7%."
At 71%, the rate of employment in Cyprus was above the EU average of 65.4% in 2007, while those of Bulgaria (61.7%), of Greece (61.4%) and of Romania (58.8%) stood lower.
Macedonia, which is also an official EU candidate, is the country with one of the highest unemployment rates in the region.
In 2007, the number of registered Macedonian job seekers equalled 34.9% of the labour force, down from 36% a year earlier.
In Serbia, the rate of unemployment dropped from 21.6% in 2006 down to 18.8% in 2007.

According to the EC, labour market conditions in the country remained difficult and employment continued to decline during the fourth quarter by 1% year-on-year.
That trend continued during the first two months of 2008, said the commission.
In Montenegro, the number of the unemployed has been decreasing steadily since 2003, when 26% of the active labour force aged 15-64 were registered as jobless. In 2007, their share stood at 11.9%, down from 14.7% a year earlier.
According to the EC, the unemployment rate in the country declined a further 0.1% over the first quarter of 2008, reaching 11.8%.
As to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), the picture is somewhat blurred.
According to a Labour Force Survey, conducted by statistical institutions in the country in April 2007, the average unemployment rate was 29%, ranging from around 25% in Republika Srpska to 31% in the Federation of BiH.
The figures were, however, much lower than the EC ones, which showed the unemployment rate in the country as standing at 42.9% in 2007, down from 44.2% the previous year.
In Kosovo, the number of registered job seekers has been growing since 2004, when they accounted for close to 40% of the workforce.
The unemployment rate in the country is currently estimated to stand at around 45%, according to the EC.
Experts also believe that the reconfiguration of UNMIK, including a substantial reduction of its structures, will add to the difficult labour market situation, especially in Pristina. "Young people and ethnic minorities are also more likely to be unemployed than other groups," they also note.
Youth unemployment, measured as a percentage of the labour force in the 15-24 age group registered as jobless, has emerged as a problem not only in the region, but elsewhere in Europe as well.
The EU average in 2006 was 16.9%, above those of both Cyprus (10.5%) and Turkey (16%).
But in some of the other SEE countries the youth unemployment rate is much higher. In Croatia it stood at 28.9% in 2006, in Greece it was 25.2% and in Romania -- 21.4%.
EU labour ministers said during a meeting in Luxembourg on June 9th that young workers in Europe have to cope with labour market conditions that differ significantly from those facing the rest of the population.
They are more often hired on temporary contracts and less frequently on full-time ones, and it is more common to see a young person work in irregular employment situations than a representative of any other group.
The ministers urged the EC to take quick steps to ensure that the share of people aged 24 and under who hold a regular job will grow.
Turkey plans to pour billions into impoverished southeast
Turkey is planning to invest up to $12 billion in a comprehensive five-year programme for its Kurdish-dominated southeast, in a bid to improve living standards in the region and draw young men away from militant activities.
(Christian Science Monitor, Zaman, Turkish Daily News, Hurriyet - 13/03/08; The New York Times, UPI, VOA, The New Anatolian - 12/03/08; Hurriyet - 11/03/08)

Turkey is preparing a multi-billion dollar programme for its Kurdish-dominated southeast, aimed at boosting employment in the region and drawing young men away from militancy, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Wednesday (March 12th).
"Everything we can see in the western part of the country we can see in the east," he told The New York Times in Ankara on Tuesday.
The government is planning to set aside up to $12 billion to underpin a series of projects in the impoverished region, home to most of Turkey's approximately 12 million Kurds.
The programme is expected to create new jobs and thus improve living standards in that part of the country, as well as erode support for the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), classified as a terrorist organisation by both the United States and the EU.
Erdogan told the Times that the projects envisioned in the five-year programme would include the construction of two large dams and an irrigation system, as well as completing the paving of roads and removal of land mines from fields along the Syrian border.
While the plans for the new initiative are to be finalised within the next two months, the prime minister is expected to present it formally during a visit to the region on April 6th.
He "will make very important statements in Diyarbakir," former adviser Mehmet Metiner, himself a Kurd, was quoted as saying earlier this week. "He will deliver important initiatives to promote Kurdish culture and language as well as a comprehensive package for the region."
Erdogan's remarks came in the wake of the Turkish forces' major ground offensive against PKK militants in northern Iraq last month and his talks with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani in Ankara on Friday.
He said military action alone is not enough to combat terrorism.
"The fight against terrorism is not only this. … It also has a socio-economic part, a psychological part, a cultural part," Erdogan said in his interview.
Therefore, besides the economic measures, the government plans to dedicate a state television channel to Kurdish language broadcasting, which would meet a long-standing demand of Turkey's Kurds.
The television channel, which is expected to start operating in several months, will also run programmes in Persian and Arabic.
"This will be the most important step in providing cultural rights to the region," the Times quoted Erdogan as saying.
He also reiterated Ankara's willingness to improve ties with the Iraqi Kurds, whom it has blamed for supporting the PKK rebels stationed in the country's north, using it as a launch-pad for cross-border raids on Turkey.
"We are the most important door for northern Iraq to open up to the world.
We are the healthiest door," Erdogan said.
PKK rebels have been fighting for self-rule in Turkey's southeast since 1984.
More than 30,000 people were killed in their armed conflict with Turkish forces until 1999, after which several thousand militants fled to northern Iraq.
"Everyone who has entered Iraq until now will stay for a while and go away, but we will stay," Erdogan told the Times. "We have relatives in northern Iraq.
And people living there have relatives in our southeastern region.
With whom will we have good relations other than with ourselves?"

KONGRA-GEL's Legacy of Violence
KONGRA-GEL terrorists ended their ceasefire in June and resumed attacks on Turkey's armed forces in the southeast.
Amid global security concerns and domestic reforms, however, the group finds itself increasingly isolated and confused.

At the UN's 59th General Assembly earlier this month, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul discussed a number of key issues with his American counterpart, Colin Powell -- including the Kurdistan Freedom and Democracy Congress, or KONGRA-GEL.
During the talks, Gul asked Powell for further US assistance in dealing with the terrorist group, which ended a five-year ceasefire in June and resumed attacks on Turkey's armed forces in the mainly Kurdish-populated southeast.
Clashes in July and August reopened the bitter wounds of the last 20 years.
Abdullah Ocalan founded the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) as a Kurdish separatist movement in 1978. Captured in 1999 in Kenya and brought to Turkey, he was charged with killing thousands of people since the PKK began its campaign of violence in 1984.
The Supreme Court approved the death sentence for Ocalan in June 1999, but after the death penalty was abolished, his sentence was converted to life imprisonment.
He has been imprisoned for five years at Imrali Island.
In October 1997, the United States identified the PKK as one of the 30 main terrorist organisations in the world.
After Ocalan's capture, the group entered a period of disarray and attempted to shift to the political arena, changing its name first to the Kurdistan Freedom and Democracy Congress and then, last year, to KONGRA-GEL.
Both successor groups were placed immediately on the US terror list.
The EU placed them on its terror group list in March.
In addition to clashes with the Turkish military, KONGRA-GEL has carried out assassinations of well-known personalities and attacks on diplomatic, consular, commercial and tourist missions abroad.
According to official figures, 5,300 security personnel were killed and 10,600 were injured in attacks between 1984 and 1999.
The civilian casualties amount to 4,600 killed and 5,500 injured.
For years, Syria was the principal country supporting the PKK.
However, after the Adana Memorandum was signed on 20 October 1998, the Syrian connection ended.
The group has been active in other neighbouring countries, including Iraq and Iran, as well as in Europe.
Its main base in Europe was Germany, with its large Turkish and Kurdish populations.
However, Romania, Holland, Bulgaria, Italy, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Spain all once housed PKK information offices or related associations.
Proceeds from organised criminal activities -- mainly drug trafficking and arms smuggling -- have constituted the bulk of PKK's revenues.
According to British security services, the PKK has been responsible for as much as 40 per cent of the heroin sold in the EU.
Rising global security concerns and policy changes have marginalised the group, however.
Judicial reforms, especially in the area of human rights, have helped defuse tensions.
Turkish state television has begun broadcasting in Kurdish -- a move virtually inconceivable five years ago.
Kurdish activists are calling for peace and condemning the recent bloodshed.
Meanwhile, KONGRA-GEL appears to be divided about its own future and increasingly isolated from the Kurdish population for which it claims to be fighting.
Romania, South Korea to enhance ties
Romania and South Korea agreed on Wednesday to enhance bilateral co-operation, with visiting President Roh Moo-hyun expressing his country's interest in Romania's Cernavoda nuclear power plant.

South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun, in Bucharest on Wednesday (6 September), said his country is eyeing an investment in Romania's Cernavoda nuclear power plant.
"Cernavoda is one of the projects we are interested in," Romanian news agency Rompres quoted Roh as saying after a meeting with his Romanian counterpart, Traian Basescu. "I want to tell you that the Korean government will do its utmost for the Romanian people to reap advantages from this project."
Located in the country's southeast, Cernavoda -- Romania's only nuclear power plant, accounts for up to 12 per cent of the country's electricity output.
Canada's Atomic Energy of Canada Limited designed it in the 1980s.
The plant's first, 705.6-megawatt CANDU reactor was completed in 1996.
Unit 2 remains under construction and is expected to become operational early next year.
When Units 3 and 4, which are currently in the planning stage, are completed and become operational, the plant will produce up to 40 per cent of Romania's total electricity output.
South Korea's publicly owned Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Corporation is among 13 companies the Romanian economic ministry has put on a list of potential contractors for the construction of Units 3 and 4, Basescu said.
"At the same time, we see that Korea's large Doosan Group has acquired IMGB, a company that, apart from machines, has the capacity to produce the necessary equipment for nuclear reactors," he noted. "We are considering a serious involvement of Korean companies under the prospect of the construction of Cernavoda reactors 3 and 4."
South Korean businessmen were the first major foreign investors in Romania in the first two years after the fall of the communist regime in December 1989.
Just as Daewoo's investments in the Mangalia shipyard helped turn the country into a leader in naval constructions, South Korean investments could have a similar impact in other spheres of the economy, Basescu said.
In 2005, South Korean investment in Romania amounted to 188.4m euros, according to the AP.
Romanian exports to Seoul reached nearly 53m euros last year, while imports stood at nearly 432m euros, with electrical machinery, gadgets and equipments accounting for the biggest share.
Roh arrived on a three-day visit to Bucharest on Tuesday, the first South Korean president to visit Romania since the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1990.
He was accompanied by a business delegation and by the first lady.
Following their meeting at the Cotroceni Palace, Roh and Basescu signed a joint statement of friendship, partnership and co-operation, as well as protocols on investments and co-operation in the field of science, technological development and innovation, Rompres reported.
During the talks, they also agreed to boost bilateral co-operation in the fields of culture and education.
In Bucharest, Roh also held talks with Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu and parliamentary leaders, and attended a luncheon meeting of business leaders from South Korea and Romania.
Former US homeland security chief hired by Albania
Albanian Prime Minister Berisha has hired former US Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge to assist his government in meeting its goal of NATO membership.
By Erlis Selimaj for Southeast European Times in Tirana – 07/09/06

Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha announced on Monday (4 September) that he has hired former US Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge as an adviser to the government on issues including NATO membership, fighting corruption and tackling organised crime.
Ridge will begin work this month, said Berisha's spokesman, Neritan Sejamini.
Under the agreement, Ridge will make occasional visits to Albania, but will work primarily from the United States.
Albania applied for NATO membership in 1992 -- when Berisha, the country's first non-communist president, strengthened ties with Washington.
The momentum stalled, however, when Berisha refused US advice concerning a 1997 pyramid scheme crisis that led to his government's ouster.
Since becoming prime minister in July 2005, he has sought to rebuild the relationship.
Ridge's main priority will be to help Albania meet its goal of joining NATO in 2008, Berisha said.
"Ridge will assist and advise the Albanian government on the issues which are the top priority for every government in the world: the country's security," he explained.
Tirana signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU in June, but obstacles remain in areas such as the economy, infrastructure and the fight against crime.
Ridge, who was in Tirana Monday, said it would be a privilege to work for the Albanian government.
"I am ready to support the needed changes that Albania has to do in order to become a NATO member and a global partner in the international economy.
I believe these goals may be achieved and I am looking forward to starting to work together with you on their realisation," Ridge said.
In March, he held talks with Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu, Interior Minister Sokol Olldashi and Minister of Public Affairs, Transport and Telecommunications Lulzim Basha.
One of the issues discussed was the management and control of borders.
Ridge, 61, cut short his second term as Pennsylvania governor when US President George W. Bush appointed him to co-ordinate homeland security after the 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States.
Named head of the department a year later, he stepped down in February 2005.
Montenegro, regional police work together to bust counterfeiters
Montenegrin authorities say a recent counterfeiting sting -- carried out in co-operation with Interpol and other regional police -- shows that Europe's newest state is on the path to a modern police force.

A recent anticounterfeiting operation in Montenegro resulted in the largest confiscation of forged money ever in Southeast Europe, according to police.
Launched in January and concluded in August, Operation Trezor led to the seizure of 714,000 euros and $150,000 in forged banknotes, as well as several arrests.
Police began their investigation after obtaining information that an international criminal group was preparing to transfer a large quantity of forged money onto the Montenegrin market.
The notes were to be distributed through various channels to Albania, Kosovo and Italy, as well as to Western European countries via Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia.
On 12 August, a Lithuanian woman was arrested in Ulcinj while trying to use 200 forged euros.
Soon after that, seven other people were apprehended, and three more are being sought.
A police officer was among those detained.
Forged banknotes totalling150,000 euros and $100,000 were found in a car travelling from Podgorica to Bar.
After searching various apartments and other premises used by alleged members of the criminal group, another 564,000 euros and $500 were found.
The smugglers reportedly managed to put only a small amount of the counterfeit money into circulation.
Police said the notes were among the best forgeries they had seen, but were printed on thicker paper than genuine currency.
According to Central Bank Council President Ljubisa Krgovic, however, it would have been hard for criminals to successfully place millions of forged euros into circulation in Montenegro.
Employees at the Central Bank's regional centres and banks are trained to recognise forged banknotes, he said, citing the conversion to euros that took place in 2002.
At the time, only one irregular banknote was discovered -- and that wasn't a forgery, but two pieces of a banknote that had been taped together.
Operation Trezor was carried out in co-operation with Interpol as well as Bulgarian and Serbian police.
Its success is bound to have positive reverberations among other countries of the region and their police organisations, says police expert Marko Nicovic.
He says Montenegro attracts criminal groups due to its large inflow of tourists and foreigners.
As a result, it is especially important that the newly independent state work more closely with other police in the region as well as international police organisations such as the FBI and Scotland Yard, he added.
Police Administration Director Veselin Veljovic praised the operation.
Its successful conclusion shows that Montenegro is on the path to a modern police organisation, he said.
Greece, Turkey work to boost ties
Leaders speak of a "new vision" for bilateral relations, despite lingering tensions in the Aegean.

Neighbours and fellow NATO members Greece and Turkey are making another push to improve relations, even as disputes over the Aegean continue to make waves.
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan will visit Athens in mid-May for talks with Greek counterpart George Papandreou.
"We hope it will be an historic visit," Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said, seeking a "new vision in Greek-Turkish relations".
He and Greek Deputy Foreign Minister Dimitris Droutsas recently announced the launch of a high-level, Greek-Turkish strategic co-operation council.
Proposed by Erdogan, it includes ministers of foreign affairs, energy, the economy, EU affairs, transport, domestic affairs, education, the environment and tourism and culture.
It was also agreed that the two countries' presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers will meet on the sidelines of international conferences.
Meanwhile, exchange programmes for young diplomats will be implemented.
Greece and Turkey are seeking to develop a new vision based not on perceived threats, but on mutual interests, Davutoglu explained.
"When we succeed in building this common future together, defence requirements will mutually cease to exist," he said.
Such words sound bold on paper, but putting them into practice is a thornier task, analysts caution.
"These are all glaring decisions," wrote Sami Kohen, a veteran foreign policy columnist at the daily Milliyet. "However, two things are needed to implement them: first, the political will, and second, mutual confidence."
Ankara and Athens have long sparred over a number of Aegean issues, including territorial waters, airspace, oil drilling rights, Flight Information regions and sovereignty over islets.
The countries came close to war in 1987 and in 1996, and their navies and air forces still challenge each other regularly, despite confidence-building measures taken in order to halt dangerous military incidents.
A senior Turkish military source quoted by Hurriyet said the prospects for resolving the quarrel remain slim.
"It's not really possible to restructure a security settlement in the Aegean given the current conditions," the source said.
However, the countries may be able to make progress if they concentrate on areas of common ground.
Both, for instance, are under pressure to trim their bloated military budgets.
With Greece requiring a massive international bailout to save its economy, the EU has been urging the country to slash military spending.
In late March, German Chancellor Angela Merkel suggested as much to Turkey, raising hopes that the two long-standing regional rivals will stop spending so much on armaments.
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the total military expenditures of both Turkey and Greece exceeded 15 billion euros in 2008 -- 8.7 billion euros and 7.2 billion euros, respectively.
Greek entrepreneurs feel the pinch
At local factories, shops and markets, the massive bailout package for Greece is more than a sensational headline.

The plea rising from the ranks of battered entrepreneurs amid the crippling debt crisis is both singular and urgent: Do what it takes and do it now!
The situation on the ground is dire.
"Now you don't look at when a [post-dated] cheque expires, only if it will be paid," Yiannis Paretzoglou, the co-owner of a west Athens plant manufacturing women's footwear, told SETimes. "Our greatest problem is uncertainty."
His comments came on April 27th, nicknamed "Black Tuesday", the day Standard and Poor's downgraded Greek bonds to junk status.
Add to that a record high interest rate gap between Greek ten-year bonds and the benchmark German equivalent, as well as the Athens Stock Market's implosion by 6%, and you have near disaster.
"What I need is someone to tell me, unequivocally, that things will take a certain course; someone to make a solid prediction," said Paretzoglou.
He cited a decrease in his factory's revenue in the first three months of 2010, down nearly 20% from the same period last year.
An accountant in northern Athens calculated the decrease in business by retail companies and self-employed professionals at more than 25% so far this year.
When accounting executive Vangelis Katsiadakis was asked what he wanted to see the Papandreou government do to right the situation, he didn't mince words.
"They [business people] don't care about what specific measures are taken, just that measures are taken.
Whatever is going happen, let it happen now, don't have it drag on; this affects consumption," Katsiadakis said "A great deal of insecurity is created.
When IMF-mandated measures are taken, no matter what they are, after two or three months things will stabilise."
While most of his clients -- primarily firms and shop owners -- are still avoiding layoffs, Katsiadakis said the emphasis is on compressing operational costs, particularly in renegotiating commercial leases.
In terms of prices, he said increased VAT rates -- which, under the proposed bailout plan, will jump to 23% -- have mostly been absorbed by businesses and not passed on to consumers.
Stefanos Lekatsas is a mid-sized merchant and wholesaler with a handful of apparel boutiques in Athens, Patras and the western city of Agrinio.
He emphasised that the one thing government and politicians must absolutely do is avoid "terrorising and panicking the public".
"Consumer and investor confidence is paramount; if measures are necessary then take them immediately, this foot-dragging is lethal," Lekatsas told SETimes.
He said he managed to raise revenue in the first three months of the year compared to the same period in 2009, but only by doubling his merchandise and stock.
However, the 12% rise in revenue was below the corresponding increase in outlays, while an early Easter holiday boosted March sales.
"My main effort to keep [revenue] high, any way I can," Lekatsas said.
Lekatsas, who imports pret-a-porter (ready-to-wear) clothing from Italy, France and the United Kingdom, also warned that rents for stores in "prime areas" have not come down.
Additionally, the owners of smaller stores rely heavily on the rent they receive.
Because of the crisis, however, Lekatsas did not raise his rents even though he was legally eligible to do so.
In summing up the general consensus, Ian Gourley, president of the Hellenic Irish Business Association, said that regardless of which decisions are made "we need action yesterday, not tomorrow."
Pressed to come up with at least one measure that would directly and immediately benefit Greek exporters, Gourley noted the implementation of an electronic customs monitoring system.
He said the technology went online everywhere in the EU on April 1st, except for in Greece and Poland.
Two years ago, Gourley said, an IMF package for Romania did wonders in reversing an economic downturn.
If the same could help Greece, he said, then get on with it.
"Now there's a positive atmosphere [in Romania]," he said. "Business is up again and higher economic growth is projected."
Albania Fights Cash Economy
Albanian authorities are implementing a project aimed at cutting back the country's sizeable cash economy, curtailing informal activity and preventing fiscal evasion.

One of the continuing obstacles to Albania's economic growth has been the existence of a large informal economy.
According to the IMF, this accounts for as much as 50 per cent of economic activity in the country.
Officials at the Bank of Albania (BoA), meanwhile, estimate that up to 26 per cent of money in Albania circulates outside the banking system -- a figure which represents a decrease from past years, but remains high in comparison to international standards.
"This situation is the result of lack of information among the public regarding the banking system, and is also connected with economic and financial crime," explains BoA First Deputy Governor Fatos Ibrahimi.
As part of the effort to build a modern financial system, the government is working to curb informal economic activity.
One measure is to halt the practice of paying public employees in cash.
In June 2004, the BoA conducted a pilot project for distributing wages through bank accounts.
Authorities now plan to distribute the salaries of nearly ten thousand officials working in state administration through second-level banks.
These banks are participating in an intensive marketing process -- which includes opening new branches, lowering commissions, launching ATM machines and other services -- aimed at bringing people into the system.
Most of the banks already offer the payment of public services through customer accounts.
Under the government's new initiative, customers will soon also be able to pay their telephone, power and water bills this way.
Paying salaries through the banking system is expected to have a considerable impact.
Several studies by the BoA show that the percentage of Albanians who maintain bank accounts and use them for transactions remains modest.
That is likely to change, however, since many who were accustomed to receiving their wages in cash will now have to open an account to get paid.
After Fiat Write-Off, Serbia's Sole Carmaker Struggles On
Serbia's troubled car manufacturer Zastava finally received some good news in August when Italy's Fiat agreed to write off 72.5 per cent of its debt.
Even so, the future of the former Yugoslav industrial leader remains uncertain.
By Dusan Kosanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade – 12/10/04

Ever since the Yugo-America project failed in the late 1980s, plans have been devised to revamp Serbia's one-time industrial leader, carmaker Zastava.
Although the issue has figured in every election campaign, successive governments have proven unable to extricate the company from its huge debts and excessive labour costs.
The September municipal campaign was no different: only days before the vote, a mayoral candidate promised a write-off of Zastava's debts to the state.
However, the stalled carmaker did see one of its major burdens disappear in the rear-view window earlier this year.
In August, Italy's Fiat agreed to write off 72.5 per cent of Zastava's 41.5m euro debt, which had hindered the Kragujevac-based company's quest for a strategic partner.
Under the deal, modelled after the write-off granted to Serbia-Montenegro by the Paris Club of sovereign lenders, Zastava has 12 months to pay back the remaining 11.5m euros.
The state won't give any further guarantees for Zastava, according to Serbian Minister for International Economic Relations Predrag Bubalo, who led nearly two months of negotiations prior to Fiat's decision.
"Instead, we will assist the company in selling off some of its parts and receiving funds that will allow it to settle its liabilities on time," he said.
Are better days ahead for Serbia's sole producer of passenger vehicles?
It is hard to say.
The write-off came more than two years after the government split up Zastava Holding, spinning off more than 20 companies producing everything from guns to trucks.
Although the state has vowed to end handouts, it has continued to subsidise Zastava to the tune of nearly 66.5m euros over the past three years.
Prior to the deal with Fiat, the automaker's debts -- including those owed to the state, domestic creditors and employees -- reportedly exceeded the value of company assets by 20 per cent.
Previous government privatisation plans and talks with the Peugeot-Citroen Group, Toyota and Volkswagen flopped after Zastava opposed offers to be sold cheaply and receive investments for development. With 4,500 workers who produced 13,500 cars in 2003, the company hopes that a foreign producer would at least agree to sell a platform to Zastava to develop its own model, if not let it manufacture a foreign model.
But such an undertaking would require another huge government intervention: specifically, guarantees for a 240m euro loan with an eight-year repayment schedule.
The bold plan presented earlier this year by Zastava's management stipulates a twofold increase in workforce and an output of 40,000 cars in the first year alone.
In the first half of the year, the troubled factory managed to produce 5,500 units out of 18,000 planned for 2004.
Nevertheless, the president of parliament's industry committee, Veroljub Stevanovic, said he believes in the viability of the Zastava plan.
It remains uncertain, however, whether Serbia can afford such an expensive experiment.
US Defence Secretary Visits Romanian Black Sea Airbase
Romanian officials have taken US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on an inspection tour of a Black Sea military base which could become part of the Pentagon's plans for more flexible deployments.
US officials say a final decision is expected in 2005.

Kicking off a visit to Romania on Monday (11 October), US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld visited a Black Sea air base reportedly being considered for use by the US military.
While a final decision could be months away, a team of US experts is likely to visit Romania later this year to discuss the issue in greater detail.
Accompanied by Defence Minister Ioan Mircea Pascu, Rumsfeld visited the Mihail Kogalniceanu air base near the port of Constanta.
He also toured a nearby army installation, currently being used by a Romanian infantry brigade but likely vacated soon.
Kogalniceanu served as a temporary base for as many as 3,500 US military personnel during preparations for the start of the campaign in Iraq in early 2003.
About 7,000 US combat troops were reportedly flown through the air base on their way to northern Iraq in the early stages of the war.
In the face of new realities, US President George W. Bush announced a change in US military policy earlier this year, favouring smaller training facilities and quick deployments to crisis areas, rather than large permanent bases such as those currently maintained in Western Europe.
Under this plan, up to 70,000 US troops are to be relocated from Europe and Asia over the next ten years.
"The idea with our new global posture is to encircle hot spots where insurgents take sanctuary," one US official was quoted as saying Monday.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior US defence official said Romania's offer would be given serious consideration, as US funding worth over $3m has already been spent on upgrading the Kogalniceanu air base.
"If we were to come here, we could use it as a substantial training range," the Washington Post quoted the official as saying. Facilities in Bulgaria, he added, would likely be packaged with the two bases Romania is offering to forge a strong US presence in Eastern Europe.
Any renewed US military presence at the Kogalniceanu air base, or at the adjacent Romanian army base, would not entail a large military contingent, an official said, but would mostly involve the rotation of troops in and out of the facility for joint training exercises.
Experts from the US Defence and State Departments are expected to visit Romania and Bulgaria possibly in November "to get down to the nuts and bolts of what we really want to do," The New York Times quoted a senior defence official as saying.
Asked if he hoped that an arrangement would be reached, Pascu said: "Of course, I hope so, you know.
But it's not in our hands."
While in Romania, Rumsfeld is to meet senior officials, including President Ion Iliescu and Prime Minister Adrian Nastase, before attending an informal two-day meeting of NATO defence ministers.
Rumsfeld arrived in the country after a brief visit to Macedonia, where he warned that a referendum on recently adopted decentralisation laws presents a "clear choice between a future with NATO, in which stability and economic growth can flourish, or a return to the past".
He also signed an agreement on co-operation with Macedonia in preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
Skopje will receive $258,000 in equipment and training under the deal.
Cultural Roundup
A review of sports, entertainment and other cultural news from the Balkans since 8 January.
(Various sources -- 08/01/03 - 14/01/03)
A review of sports, entertainment and other cultural news from the Balkans since 8 January:
Romania's Tourism Ministry pledged to disclose the location of Dracula Park on 25 January when international financial consultant PriceWaterhouseCoopers finalises a feasibility study.
The largest amusement park in the region would open its doors in 2004, aiming to attract both foreign and domestic visitors.
Diyarbakir, Turkey will host a culture week from 17 January to 24 January.
The event will feature separate exhibits of the Istanbul Cervantes Institute and the Diyarbakir Art Centre, which will make a special presentation on Spain and Spanish culture.
The week will include a photo exhibit by Marian Mar and the screening of a few Spanish films in local movie theatres.
A two-day carnival took place in the Macedonian village of Vevcani.
The carnival is held each year on 13 January and 14 January - the eve and first day of the New Year, according to the old calendar.
The event is more than 1,400 years old.
Bulgarian Education and Science Minister Vladimir Atanassov inaugurated the 6th Framework Programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities on 13 January.
Funds will be equally shared among EU member states, associated members and candidate countries.
Days of the Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) cinema opened last week in Vienna, with the motto "Welcome to Sarajevo".
The seven-day film review was jointly organised by the BiH Embassy in Vienna and the Austrian Film Archive.
A committee in Republika Srpska has started work on a project to establish a museum and permanent exhibition featuring the works of sculptor Sreten Stojanovic (1898-1960), one of the most prominent artists of the former Yugoslavia.
An interim exhibit of his works is on display in his hometown, Prijedor.
The project has received support from the Serbian Academy of Science.
The first edition of the magazine Makedonia Utre (Macedonia Tomorrow) has appeared in Bucharest.
The magazine contains articles in both Macedonian and Vlah and is prepared by the Association of Macedonian Students in Romania.
The Austrian Ministry of Culture will finance the construction of the architectural museum Elias Canetti in Rousse, Bulgaria.
The museum will be established in the house where Canetti was born in 1905 and is expected to enhance cultural tourism in the city.
PACE urges resolution of Western Balkan issues
Northern Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania are political hotspots in the Balkans.
By Tzvetina Borisova for Southeast European Times -- 14/10/11
PACE's presidential committee "to intensify dialogue and overcome tension" in the region, the resolution says. [PACE]
The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) adopted a resolution last week outlining the need for solutions to the political situation in northern Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Albania.
"The issues for great concern are northern Kosovo -- getting security and free movement of people and merchandise; Bosnia and Herzegovina -- the political deadlock forming a national government; and Albania -- some signs of progress in the frozen and detrimental relation between the big parties," the document's author, Swedish PACE member Bjorn von Sydow told SETimes.
The October 7th resolution urges an immediate and objective investigation into an incident at Kosovo's administrative checkpoint with Serbia at Jarinje at the end of September, when six people were shot.
Problems in northern Kosovo are blocking progress in EU-mediated talks between Pristina and Belgrade, the resolution noted.
It proposes a mission for PACE's presidential committee "to intensify dialogue and overcome the tension" in the region.
This mission "can make visits to hotspots and try to get the parties involved to take steps in accordance with the principles of the Council of Europe", von Sydow said.
Analyst Ian Bancroft, co-founder of the organisation TransConflict, stresses that the north will remain a key issue and should be part of the talks.
"Without a solution to the challenges facing the north, the Kosovo-Serbia talks have little prospect of success," he told SETimes.
"For any talks to succeed, EU guarantees are essential.
Now that Serbia has obtained EU candidate status, the EU might have more leverage.
This means Serbia will have to really take seriously its commitments to the EU and its messages to improve relations with Kosovo, if it is to advance in negotiations with the EU," Kosovo political analyst Seb Bytyci told SETimes.
The on-going political stalemate in BiH is another area of concern.
According to the document, this stalemate "has had dire consequences -- the country has seen its credit ratings downgraded by international financial agencies; foreign direct investments have fallen 75% since 2009; unemployment is at over 43% of the working population."
Von Sydow sees the solution through "internal negotiations between the competing forces in order to avoid a looming stand-still in the national economy due to the absence of further international financial support".
Bancroft underlines the deep divisions plaguing BiH, which all bodes poorly for any resolution of the country's problems.
"Republika Srpska's opposition to strengthening the state-level of government means that the creation of new ministerial portfolios as a means of resolving the problem is not an option; whilst new elections would fail to solve the core problems and would instead only contribute to a widening of divisions," he told SETimes.
As for Albania, PACE praises the conclusion of the 2011 local elections and "encourages all parties to strengthen ... their internal democratic functioning, work towards normalising the political situation and start a political dialogue within the parliament on the priorities and necessary reforms to be carried out".
Analyst Genc Mlloja, however, says this progress is too little, too late.
"The two main political parties [the ruling Democratic Party and the main opposition Socialist Party] have remained stuck to their positions despite their declarations on the will to overcome the deep division between them," he told SETimes.
Thousands Pay Last Respects to Former Bosnian Leader
An estimated 150,000 people gathered in Sarajevo for the funeral of former Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) President Alija Izetbegovic, who led Bosnia and Herzegovina to independence and played a key role in ending the war that followed.

Thousands of mourners gathered in Sarajevo on Wednesday (22 October) to pay their last respects to former Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) President Alija Izetbegovic, who died Sunday at the age of 78.
Izetbegovic will be best remembered as the man who led the former Yugoslav republic to its independence and as one of the signers of the Dayton Peace Accords that ended the 1992-1995 war.
In the country's first postwar elections in 1996, he was chosen to represent the Muslim community in the first three-member multiethnic presidency and became its first chairman. Citing health problems, he resigned from his post and quit active politics in 2000.
"President Izetbegovic will be remembered for his historic role in preserving the unity of Bosnia and Herzegovina and establishing the Bosnian state," UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said in a statement of condolence.
"Izetbegovic was a very courageous leader for his people," EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said. "Under difficult circumstances in the Balkans, he played an important role in ending the war in his country."
Doctors at Sarajevo University's Clinical Centre said Izetbegovic's death was caused by a long period of heart problems, complicated by injuries he suffered recently during a fall at his home.
Police officials said they were expecting around 150,000 Bosnians and foreign officials, including Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, to attend the funeral in the BiH capital.
Special trains and dozens of buses have been arranged to bring mourners from BiH's Muslim-dominated areas to Sarajevo.
Police sources told the Agence France Presse they also expected about 50 buses with Muslims from Croatia and Slovenia.
Izetbegovic will be buried at the Kovaci Cemetery, alongside hundreds of Bosnian Muslim fighters killed during the 1992-1995 siege of Sarajevo by Serb forces.
In the morning, his body lay in state at the BiH presidency. The flag in front of the building was lowered to half-staff.
Organisers scheduled a formal prayer ceremony in downtown Sarajevo before the funeral procession headed for the cemetery along streets adorned with Bosnian state flags.
A day of mourning was being observed only in BiH's Muslim-Croat federation, however, and there was no official delegation representing the country's Serb-run entity, Republika Srpska.
But some Bosnian Serb officials were expected to attend the ceremony informally.
A lawyer by training and the founder of the Muslim Party for Democratic Action, Izetbegovic was elected president of the Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1990. He is the author of "Islam Between East and West", a book published in 1982 depicting the problems faced by Muslims living in a Slavic country.
Yugoslav authorities sentenced him to five years in prison for advocating "pan-Islamic activity".
IMF approves next tranche of Romania's loan
WASHINGTON, United States -- The IMF approved a 905m-euro instalment to Romania on Friday (January 7th) under the country's stand-by agreement with the Fund.
The tranche should have been disbursed around mid-December but was postponed pending approval of the 2011 state budget, public sector wage laws and the pension reform.
"Romania is now on a clear path to meeting its short- and medium-term fiscal goals.
The current challenge is to fully implement the approved reforms and maintain tight control over expenditures to assure that the budget parameters are observed," First Deputy Managing Director John Lipsky said after a meeting of the IMF Executive Board.

Kostunica: Serbia will not accept "imposed compromise" on Kosovo
The Kosovo issue and Serbia's EU integration bid were at the centre of talks in London on Tuesday between Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and his British counterpart, Tony Blair.

Serbia is ready for a compromise regarding Kosovo's future status, but not one that is imposed from outside, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said in London on Tuesday (27 June).
"An imposed compromise is not a compromise and Serbia cannot accept an imposed compromise," Kostunica told reporters following talks with British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
The 45-minute meeting between the two leaders, attended also by Serbia's interior and economy ministers and the head of its Co-ordinating Centre for Kosovo, Sanda Raskovic-Ivic, focused on a range of issues, including Kosovo and EU integration.
Britain is a member of the six-nation Contact Group, including also France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States, which plays a key role in the process of determining Kosovo's final status.
Discussing the Kosovo issue with Blair, Kostunica made it clear that his country views "substantial autonomy" as the only possible solution.
This, he explained, meant the province would be granted much greater autonomy than any other region in Europe currently enjoys, while Serbia's borders would remain unchanged and the rights of the Kosovo Serb minority would be protected.
Technically, Kosovo is still part of Serbia, but has been under UN administration since the end of the 1998-1999 conflict.
Serbian and Kosovo Albanian officials have been involved in direct, UN-led negotiations on the province's final status since February, but have made little progress so far, with the sides still wide apart in their positions.
The Kosovo Albanians, who make up about 90 per cent of the province's population of 2 million people, want Kosovo to become fully independent from Serbia.
The international community expects a solution by the end of this year, with some western powers reportedly backing the Kosovo Albanian majority's quest for independence.
Ruling out this as an option, Kostunica insisted on Tuesday that a move in that direction would destabilise the region.
If such a solution were to be imposed on Serbia, he said, it would "certainly be rejected by Serbia's Parliament", and "that would inevitably mark the turning point [for]… Serbia's relations with the rest of the world," the British daily Financial Times quoted him as saying.
On the issue of Serbia's EU integration bid, Blair reportedly urged Belgrade to step up its co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia to move on in the process.
In early May, the EU broke off talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Belgrade over its failure to meet a 30 April deadline for the arrest and handover of former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic to the UN tribunal in The Hague.
Brussels has since made it clear that the SAA negotiations, a major first step towards eventual EU membership, will resume once this obstacle has been cleared.
Croatian Journalist Wins Prize for Promoting Understanding
Last month, SEEMO presented its first prize: the "Dr Erhard Busek-SEEMO Award for Better Understanding in South East Europe" to Croatian journalist Denis Latin. [mediawatch.ljudmila.org] Being a journalist in the Balkans can be tough.
A good journalist should be totally objective at all times.
But that's not always easy when your stories provoke painful memories of ethnic conflict or challenge the power of politicians and mafia bosses.
By Liz Barrett for the Balkan Times - 18/11/02
Being a journalist in the Balkans can be tough.
A good journalist should be totally objective at all times and should investigate all angles of inquiry.
That is not easy, when the stories you cover provoke painful memories of recent ethnic conflict or challenge the power networks of tycoons and politicians.
Yet thousands of journalists in the Balkans survive these dilemmas and brave the consequences of their objective reporting.
Now, a new organisation, the South East Europe Media Organisation (SEEMO), has decided to recognise their efforts.
Last month, SEEMO presented its first prize: the "Dr Erhard Busek-SEEMO Award for Better Understanding in South East Europe". After considering over 400 nominations, a jury of media professionals from the region chose Croatian television presenter Denis Latin as this year's winner.
Latin's television programme, Latinica, has a reputation for tackling controversial issues, whether xenophobia, refugee return or the normalisation of relations between Croats and Serbs.
In one recent programme, he asked the question: "Should Serbian tourists be guests on Croatia's Adriatic coast?"
The issue struck a chord with the audience.
In former Yugoslavia, Serbs and Croats alike holidayed on the Croatian coast.
Both were proud of its long ragged coastline and hundreds of idyllic islands.
But since the 1991-1995 war in Croatia, few Serbs have taken their summer breaks to their favourite old haunts.
Only recently, with Serbia opening up to the West and some Serbs finding the money to travel, has swimming in Croatia's clear blue water seemed an option again.
And many Serbs who do make the trip have found hostility, which perhaps is not surprising, given that parts of the Dalmatian coast were the site of intense conflict.
Latin decided to confront the issue head on.
He brought both sides into his studio: moderates, arguing that it was time to make peace between Serbs and Croats; and ultra-nationalists, who wanted to prevent Serbs from setting foot on Croatian soil.
Tensions between the two groups reached boiling point, but the overall message was that it is time for reconciliation.
Oliver Vujovic, the secretary-general of SEEMO, says the jury was impressed by Latin's willingness to cover such sensitive issues, topics which are ignored by much of the rest of the Croatian media.
But Latin is just one of many journalists who is helping to promote better understanding between the people of the Balkans.
SEEMO received over 400 nominations and, says Vujovic, "the jury had to work hard to make a decision.In Mr Latin's case, one factor in his favour was that he employs several other journalists who were also nominated.He has a very good team working for him."
The new prize, supported personally by Erhard Busek, the special co-ordinator of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe, is just one small part of SEEMO's activities.The organisation also analyses the legal framework in which journalists operate, and lobbies national governments to bring laws into line with international standards.For example, SEEMO is encouraging the Serbian and Montenegrin governments to make defamation a civil -- rather than a criminal -- offence.
SEEMO has no problem in attracting publicity.Since its members are all top-ranking media professionals from Southeastern Europe, when SEEMO issues an opinion or statement, it can be sure that its voice will be heard.But the organisation prefers to take a diplomatic approach, aware that heavy-handed interference can inflame a tense situation.
SEEMO was recently informed that, in Tetovo, Macedonia, an ethnic Albanian political party banned a local Slav Macedonian television station from attending its press conference.
Vujovic responded by contacting the head of the party, and impressing upon him the importance of making press conferences open to all.
The party leader responded well: he immediately promised that the ban would not be imposed again, and formally apologised to the television station.
SEEMO also seeks to support journalists whose personal safety is endangered.
"The problems facing journalists vary from country to country," said Vujovic, "but perhaps the biggest problem across the region is the mafia and people with connections to the mafia."
But there is a limit to what SEEMO can do.Ultimately, journalists rely on better legal protection of their rights, greater awareness of their role in scrutinising government, and support from the police.And the police are often reluctant to get involved.Three years after Serbian journalist Slavko Curivija was gunned down outside his home, his killers have still not been found.
Journalists in the region are often paid poorly, and the media do not have enough resources for proper investigative journalism.
As Vujovic said, ". every journalist who is doing [their] job well has always to think, what will be the reaction to what I am writing?Will my family have to suffer the consequences?"
Serbia in Gazprom's embrace
Serbians are starting to question the benefits of their country's close relationship with Russia's Gazprom.
By Georgi Mitev-Shantek for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 13/04/09
Serbia is a priority for Gazprom in the South Stream venture. [Getty Images]
Russia's Gazprom is in the final stages of negotiations with partner countries on the South Stream pipeline, completion of which is expected in 2015.
Among the partners is Serbia, where public opinion and the political opposition are expressing concern over the implications of partnership with Gazprom.
Serbia had had great expectations of what South Stream could do.
It promises to yield fat gas transit fees for Serbia.
Gazprom Vice President Aleksandar Medvedev said Russia will guarantee Serbia 10 billion cubic metres of gas annually from the pipeline's anticipated 47-billion-cubic-metre capacity, a boon for an energy-poor country that suffered in the 2008-2009 winter when a Russian-Ukrainian dispute cut off natural gas to the Balkans.
But Serbian public opinion reacted unfavourably to the announcement that Srbijagas and Gazprom will form a second joint venture to build Serbia's 400km segment of the pipeline.
Raising even more questions, the joint venture's headquarters will be in Zug, Switzerland, out of reach of both Serbian and EU authorities.
Experts and opposition leaders wonder why an already-existing Serbian-Russian joint venture will not build the pipeline and question, given the Swiss location of the second venture, where the potential 200m euros in annual transit fees will end up.
In past months, successive Russian delegations increased the frequency of their visits to Belgrade.
Besides expressing bright hopes for Russo-Serbian energy co-operation, they reaffirmed their support for Serbia's stance on Kosovo.
Medvedev, in remarks quoted by Vecernje Novosti on March 28th, assured Serbians that a recent revision in the South Stream contract would mean "an increase in transit [of natural gas] through your territory".
Much of the Serbian public, though, was unmoved by such promises, believing instead that Belgrade sold NIS -- the Serbian state oil company -- to Gazprom for far too little money, in pursuit of Russian diplomatic backing.
Last December, Gazprom subsidiary Gazpromneft bought NIS for 400m euros, under an obligation to invest 500m euros by 2012.
Experts had placed the Serbian company's true value at 2.2 billion euros, which included two refineries and 400 gas stations and other considerable assets.
Now that Moscow is arguably in a position to dictate Serbia's energy future, the dark side of the bilateral partnership is slowly emerging.
After assuming ownership of NIS, the Russians published a 2008 financial report and claimed a loss of 47m euros, versus the previously declared profit of 28m euros.
The accounting firm KPMG will give the last word on the matter.
Adding to Serbian misgivings about the wisdom of partnering so closely with Russia, Gazpromneft is now demanding that a Belgrade court annul the write-off by previous NIS management of 100m euros of debt owed by state-owned companies as well as by Serbia's police and the military to NIS.
In addition, Gazpromneft is disputing an earlier sale by NIS of a 6.6m-euro stake in the Belgrade Hyatt Regency hotel.
Sarajevo's "Bebe" reopens
A pediatric centre has become the first to return to the newly rebuilt Jezero hospital complex, destroyed by shelling in 1992.

A hospital destroyed in the siege of Sarajevo is back in operation, thanks to a multimillion-euro renovation project.
Late last month, a pediatric clinic became the first department to return to the Jezero medical complex, site of the future Mother and Child Centre.
The Sarajevo University Clinical Centre's Pediatric Clinic, founded in 1947, was Bosnia and Herzegovina's first specialised institution for treatment of children. By 1991, it had grown from an original 60 beds to 250.
In 1992, however, shelling heavily damaged the Jezero complex, forcing the clinic to move.
Now Jezero, popularly known as "Bebe" (Babies) because of its maternity ward, has received repairs and renovation.
The upgraded complex has 11 departments and 160 beds. The 253 staff members include 46 doctors and 143 nurses.
The hospital has expanded from a cramped 2,500 sq m to 6,500 sq m, providing a more comfortable environment for patients and staff.
The reopening has considerable symbolic significance for a city once gutted by war.
In a display of enthusiasm and teamwork, Pediatric Centre staff accomplished the entire move -- patients and all -- in eight hours.
A volunteer group, "Muzika i boja za nadu i lijecenje" ["Music and colour for hope and healing"], delivered 100 gift boxes to the children, representing a donation from NATO, EUFOR, other organisations and individuals.
The same group equipped two playrooms and provided an aquarium.
Its members plan to visit at least once a month to cheer up the patients.
Nine-year-old Adnan Mevic, the official 6 billionth resident of the planet Earth, had the honour of re-opening the new facility.
Born in the clinic in October 1999, Mevic received the designation of "Baby 6 Billion" from then UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who became his godfather and made a donation to the clinic.
Reconstruction of Jezero started in 2003.
Sarajevo Canton allocated 6.3m euros for the project, and considerable financial and expert support -- amounting to 3m euros -- came from the Turkish government, with the promise of professional training and additional donations to follow.
A number of other companies and individuals also provided support for Jezero.
The entire project will cost an estimated 15.3m euros.
Investment to Provide Major Stimulation for Serbia's Economy
The US company Ball Packaging Europe started the construction of a tin can factory in the Belgrade suburb of Batajnica.
It is the first greenfield investment in the Serbian economy.

Ball Packaging Europe, a US company, started construction of a tin can factory earlier this month in the Belgrade suburb of Batajnica.
The first phase of construction will cost 50m euros.
This is the first greenfield investment in Serbia since the beginning of the transition process in 2000, and Serbian authorities believe it will stimulate the lagging economy.
Serbian Economy Minister Dragan Marsicanin, at a ceremony marking the launch of construction, said that the total investment in the factory would amount to $75m, and that it would increase Serbia's GDP by 0.5 per cent.
Ball Packaging Europe Executive Director Hanno Fiedler said can production would begin in May 2005.
The planned annual production is 650 million cans for alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.
The factory will operate in five shifts, seven days a week. About 120 people will be employed.
It is estimated that of Serbia's population of 10 million, around 1 million are unemployed.
Fiedler said that the annual investment after the construction of the factory is expected to total 20m euros.
Ball Packaging Europe will buy semi-finished products from Serbian companies and use local services.
Management hopes that, in addition to the Serbian market, the company will also become the chief supplier to markets in Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Macedonia, Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Ball Packaging Europe is the second largest tin can manufacturer in Europe, with 11 factories in Germany, England, France, Poland and the Netherlands, employing 2,500 people.
In 2002, it became a part of the US Ball Corporation, which produces 44 billion cans per year.
Croatia wins UN Security Council seat
Croats are celebrating their country's "biggest achievement since our independence".

Croatia won a non-permanent seat in the UN Security Council for 2008-2009 during the General Assembly vote last week.
The country's biggest rival for the position, the Czech Republic, withdrew its candidacy in the second round, allowing Croatia to easily win the two-thirds majority necessary.
Costa Rica, Libya, Vietnam and Burkina Faso also won non-permanent seats in the Council. The 15-member body has only five permanent members and the two-year term for the newly elected non-permanent members begins on January 1st.
"After the international recognition of the Republic of Croatia and ending of the Homeland War, this is the biggest achievement since our independence," Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said, returning from New York after the October 16th vote.
President Stipe Mesic played a vital part in the lobbying process, renewing Croatia’s relations with African and Asian states and members of the non-aligned movement, established with the former Yugoslavia.
The election was an "exceptional recognition of Croatia and its foreign policy", the president said.
For the first time since independence, Croatia now has the opportunity to take on a key role in global decision-making processes.
For a country that not long ago was struggling to emerge from isolation and war, the Security Council seat is another welcome sign of the dramatic progress made in recent years.
As the celebrations died down, Croatian officials began planning their agenda in New York.
Some issues are of direct national concern -- for example, the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague will be a regular topic on the Security Council's agenda for the next two years.
An exit strategy for wrapping up the court's work must be finalised.
Croatia is strongly against closing down the tribunal before the two top war crime fugitives -- Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic -- are brought to justice.
"We shall seek justice for all the victims," Sanader said.
Meanwhile, he stressed that Croatia will not use its position to put pressure on Slovenia over the two countries' rival territorial claims in the Adriatic.
The prime minister said the main mission of Council membership for Croatia will be to promote political stability in Southeast Europe -- with a focus on Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Turks vote for change
The government's bid to establish direct election of the president has succeeded at the polls, with 69% of voters giving the thumbs-up in Sunday's referendum.
Turnout, however, was comparatively low.

In a referendum Sunday (October 21st), Turkish voters approved a series of major constitutional changes, including one establishing direct election of the country's president.
Sixty-nine per cent of voters said yes to the changes, while 31% rejected them. Turnout, at 67%, was comparatively low for Turkey, where the figure is normally over 80%.
Until now, Turkish heads of state have been chosen by parliament.
They will now be elected by popular vote.
Other changes include allowing the president to serve two five-year terms instead of the current single seven-year term, and reducing the term of office for parliament and the government to four years instead of five.
In addition, parliamentary sessions can now be opened if at least l84 MPs -- out of the total 550 -- are present.
"I consider it very important for our country and our democracy that people take part in this referendum and express their preferences on the constitutional changes” regarding to referendum," President Abdullah Gul said of Sunday's vote.
Gul, who succeeded Ahmet Necdet Sezer in late August, will be the last president to have been selected by parliament.
Some experts, including the head of Turkey's Electoral Council, Muammer Aydin, have suggested that the referendum results could oblige Gul to stand for re-election, and could make it necessary to reduce the tenure of the current parliament by a year.
If Gul is not required to run, his mandate will continue for five more years.
After that, Turks will go to the polls to elect the next head of state.
Under the measures endorsed Sunday, the presidential vote must be held at least sixty days before the incumbent's term ends.
The opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) is unhappy with the referendum and says it will challenge its legitimacy at the Constitutional Court.
The court's president, however, has not welcomed the idea.
"I do not support such an attitude.
Negative or positive, ideas should be reflected at the ballot," Hasim Kilic said. "I do not know how it is possible to put the case to the Constitutional Court.
But we will do what's necessary if it does."
Meanwhile, the low turnout has triggered a discussion over whether voting requirements in Turkey should be enforced.
By law, every eligible voter is required to participate in elections and referenda or pay a fine of 19 lira (around 11 euros).
Around 14 million voters stayed away from the polls on Sunday.
CHP leader Deniz Baykal says he doesn't believe any citizens should be punished because they refused to vote.
It is their democratic right to choose whether to participate, he said.
Bulgarian teachers continue strike
More than a month after the official start of the academic year in Bulgaria, the classrooms in most of the country's schools are empty as teachers continue to strike, demanding higher pay.
(Vseki Den, News.bg, Darik Radio, Focus News Agency - 23/10/07; Sofia News Agency, Sofia Echo, Dnevnik, Mediapool - 22/10/07; BIRN - 18/10/07)

The chances for a quick end to the ongoing teachers' strike in Bulgaria appeared slim Tuesday (October 23rd), as a member of the strike committee denounced the government's latest proposal for a deal.
The government is trying to end the teachers' protest by using economic pressure, Nikolay Nikolov told the web-based daily Vseki Den daily, commenting on the agreement proposed by the education ministry late Monday.
The strike continues and teachers will hold a new rally in Sofia on Thursday, he said.
Nine days after the official start of the school year on September 15th, teachers launched a nationwide strike.
They are demanding a 100% increase in their salaries, which currently stand at less than 200 euros a month, below average for the country.
They also want the government to allocate 5% of GDP for education in the 2008 budget.
The government ruled out any chance for that demand being met, arguing that it would further push inflation above the record 13% it reached in August.
It also stressed the need for much delayed educational efficiency reforms and for reversing recent declines in the quality of education.
It said any move to increase teachers' salaries should be accompanied by a significant downsizing of the sector, which currently employs 120,000.
Following weeks of tense talks, the trade unions said Monday that the teachers would accept a deal that would see the average gross monthly salary for the entire sector, including auxiliary staff, reach about 325 euros as of July 1st, 2008.
The government's latest proposal for an agreement provides for an average gross salary of 325 euros in the second half of 2008, but for teachers only.
By proposing this, the government is trying to push through its earlier proposal that would raise wages in three steps, with a 10% increase each time, Nikolov said Tuesday.
The failure of the two sides to reach a compromise has left the classrooms empty for more than a month, with many parents voicing concern that students might not be able to receive grades for the first term.
The continuing crisis will have the worst impact on 7th and 12th graders, who face major exams after the end of the school year.
With little prospect for a quick solution, the opposition parties in parliament filed a no-confidence motion against the government last week.
During the parliamentary debate on the no-confidence motion on Monday, former Prime Minister Ivan Kostov, who heads the right-wing Democrats for Strong Bulgaria, blamed the government for the strike.
"It's the biggest strike in Bulgaria's history and it can't be blamed on the teachers, who have accepted 13 of the 15 reform proposals made by the cabinet," Kostov said.
He criticised the three-way coalition cabinet for its overall approach to the crisis and Stanishev's party for making pre-election promises for pay increases which have since been broken.
Given the comfortable 168-seat majority the government has in Bulgaria's 240-seat assembly, the cabinet is expected to survive the no-confidence vote on Tuesday.
Half of youth in Kosovo seek emigration
Kosovo has one of the most youthful populations in Europe -- more than half is under 25, and the figure is growing.
With little opportunity at home, many are pinning their hopes elsewhere.

Along with economic woes and continuing uncertainty about status, Kosovo faces another serious problem: most of its young people want to leave.
According to a UNDP report published last month, more than 50% of Kosovo's youth want to emigrate.
Given that youth make up more than half the overall population, that's a sobering figure.
The UNDP surveyed 1,200 persons between the ages of 15 and 29 -- including 800 Albanians, 200 Serbs and 200 other minorities.
"Youth in Kosovo encounter a large part of Kosovo's economic and social problems -- which explains to a large extent why they feel reluctant to participate or even live here," says the UNDP representative in Kosovo, Frode Mauring.
Kosovo's young will be crucial to building the future, Mauring says.
Currently, however, they are vulnerable, impoverished, disempowered and lacking good role models.
The UNDP report on the province is the third of its kind.
It analyzes youth problems and opportunities, the role of youth in the development processes in Kosovo, and issues related to education, employment, decision making, civil cohesion, and participation in society as a whole.
It provides data on such factors as youth poverty, levels of unemployment, and readiness to emigrate. The statistics are meant to be used by policymakers and development agencies as they seek to boost young people's chances of a better life.
"The report analyzes their problems and opportunities from a human development standpoint," Mauring says.
Individual stories demonstrate the sense of hopelessness that many of Kosovo's young feel when they look at the prospects around them.
"The government is responsible for working to ensure a development perspective and a better future for these young people who give a great joy to us," says Prime Minister Agim Ceku. [Getty Images]
"I am not working, because I don't have any opportunity," Milaim Bilalli, 24, of Pristina told Southeast European Times.
In his view, jobs in Kosovo are only available to those with the right connections. "My father is a teacher, and he doesn't have power like the parents of some others."
Lulzim Berisha, a 25-year-old mathematical sciences student, has a bleak view of the prospects ahead. "How can I be an optimistic man?" he asks.
"Maybe I can find a job as a teacher, for instance, but I'll get only 180 euros per month … what can I do with such a salary?"
Those working for UNMIK institutions are more hopeful, because they believe they will find a job in the future EU structures in Kosovo.
"UNMIK is going, but the EU is coming," said one young person who asked to remain anonymous.
"I believe that I can find a job."
Having worked for UNMIK since 1999, he is less inclined to be pessimistic. "I will not emigrate even if I get more money, because my Kosovo is my birthplace," he said.
His friend, who works for the OSCE, also says she feels more secure. "I believe the OSCE mission in Kosovo will stay, because Kosovars are not yet ready for democratisation and some other sectors where the OSCE is leading the way."
Not everyone, though, can land a job with an international organisation.
More common is the experience of someone like Mentor Gashi, a 27-year-old who says he has been looking for work, without success.
"If I can't find [a job], this summer I will try to go to my brother, who works in Germany," he told Southeast European Times
The figures in the UNDP report have alarmed Kosovo's political leadership, which sees mass numbers of Kosovars wanting to leave at the very time when the province's future is being decided.
Kosovo leaders are appealing to young persons to change their opinions, look at the long-term perspective and have hope that their outlook will improve.
"The government is responsible for working to ensure a development perspective and a better future for these young people who give a great joy to us," says Prime Minister Agim Ceku in a statement appended to the UNDP report.
"Youth employment, strengthening of youth NGOs, informal education, youth participation and integration, education and health prevention are some of the domains of our activities," he adds.
At the same time, Kosovo leaders say, the prospects for economic improvement cannot be separated from the political issue of status.
Until that is settled, Kosovo will face huge barriers to attracting investment, opportunities will remain scarce, and the region -- not to mention Europe as a whole -- will continue to face a pressure cooker in its midst.
CoE Countries Vow to Fight Terrorism
At a meeting of justice ministers from Council of Europe (CoE) member states and observer countries, CoE Secretary General Walter Schwimmer launched an initiative to establish a common legal platform for preventing, investigating and prosecuting terrorists.
By Emil Tsenkov for the Southeast Europe Times in Sofia - 21/10/03
Meeting in Sofia earlier this month, justice ministers from the 45 Council of Europe (CoE) member states and five observer countries agreed that terrorism is a crime that crosses national borders and must be tackled internationally.
CoE Secretary General Walter Schwimmer launched the initiative for a Comprehensive Convention on Terrorism during his remarks at the conference on 9 October and 10 October.
Such a convention would "provide a common legal platform to prevent, investigate and prosecute terrorist offenders more efficiently," Schwimmer said.
"Our message remains that the fight against terrorism must be carried out without concessions, but always respecting the values the Council of Europe stands for," he added.
Schwimmer's words were echoed by the European justice ministers, who emphasised the need for enhanced international co-operation.
Also stressed was the importance of adopting international standards on the protection of witnesses and informers, and on the use of special investigation techniques.
The ministers backed strengthening existing treaties on awarding compensation to terror victims and their families, as well as action against the financing of terrorist networks.
They also tasked the European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice to assess the response of national judicial systems to terrorism.
In recent years, the CoE -- the oldest pan-European organisation on the continent -- has devoted considerable attention to the emerging threat of cross-border terrorism, starting with the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism in 1977. The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 brought a renewed emphasis on this global problem.
A Multidisciplinary Group on International Action against Terrorism was formed to assess the existing instruments and to prepare a report on future activities of the organisation in fighting terrorism.
The UN General Assembly commended the CoE for its contribution to implementation of Security Council resolution 1373 in 2001 on preventing and suppressing the financing of terrorism, as well as criminalising the wilful provision or collection of funds for such acts.
Uncertainty over new Serbian government
Attempts to form a coalition in Serbia, already mired in dispute over the prime minister's post, have been further complicated by the Ahtisaari plan.

When UN special envoy for Kosovo Martti Ahtisaari unveiled his status proposal on Friday (February 2nd), Belgrade found itself in a difficult position. In the wake of the January 21st general elections, Serbia effectively has neither a parliament nor government.
Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, saying he no longer has the mandate to deal with the most important state issues, refused to meet with Ahtisaari during the envoy's visit to Belgrade.
Currently the sole legitimate representative of the Belgrade authorities is President Boris Tadic.
After receiving the proposal, he described it as paving the way to sovereignty for Kosovo, which has been under UN administration since 1999.
"Neither Serbia, nor I as its president, will ever accept the independence of Kosovo," he insisted.
Belgrade analysts say the Kosovo issue will put an additional strain on the forming of a new Serbian democratic government.
A coalition between Tadic and Kostunica's parties, with support from the pro-Western G17 Plus, would have a majority in parliament.
But the parties have not been able to agree on who will get the post of prime minister.
Moreover, Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DPS) has staked out a hardline position on Kosovo as a condition for its participation in any new cabinet.
DPS demanded that its coalition partners pledge never to recognise an independent Kosovo.
The party's platform states that relations between Serbia and any country that acknowledges Kosovo "would inevitably deteriorate".
In terms of domestic politics, some analysts interpreted DPS's move as a sign that it is drifting away from the democratic bloc and towards the far-right Serbian Radical Party (SRS), with which it could also form a majority in parliament.
However, the Radicals have so far dismissed the possibility of forming a government with Kostunica.
At the same time, the stakes are becoming higher.
Clear signals have been sent from the EU that the future democratic government would be offered the resumption of Stabilisation and Association talks with the EU.
They were interrupted last May due to Belgrade's lax co-operation with The Hague tribunal.
Kosovo Serbs, meanwhile, have put pressure on the parties in Belgrade to settle their differences.
Representatives of the Serb municipalities in Kosovo have demanded the urgent formation of a government that would fight Kosovo's potential independence.
At a Monday meeting with the president, the representatives of the parliamentary parties agreed on the urgency of constituting a new parliament that would take a stand on Ahtisaari's proposal, and of appointing a negotiating team that would try to win a more favourable settlement.
Spin doctors aiding election campaigns in Croatia
Both of Croatia's main political parties are hoping to boost their chances this year with the help of well-known campaign specialists.
By Natasa Radic for Southeast European Times – 07/02/07
Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader has been working with Ireland's P.J.
Mara.
With Croatia set to hold general elections this year, polls show that the two main political parties -- the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and the Social Liberal Party (SDP) -- are in a virtual dead heat.
This time around, both parties are counting on professional consultants to help them maximise their chances.
For the past four years, Irish political consultant and PR specialist P.J.
Mara has been advising Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader.
Mara, the principal political adviser to twice-elected Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, is one of the most sought-after campaign experts in his country.
Mara's efforts helped HDZ win the last round of elections, and the party is hoping his magic will do the trick again.
His approach is to focus on personality, keeping the party leader in the spotlight and making maximum use of that person's individual charisma.
The message sent to the voters is clear and simple: a person who makes political promises to a nation must be a democratic, skillful leader who fears no one and focuses on a single goal, the prosperity of the country.
However, HDZ's competitive edge could be dulled this time around, as the opposition has also decided to hire a recognised political campaign expert, Britain's David Evans.
He successfully oversaw the election campaign for the British Labour Party and in 2001 founded his own company, specialising in communications and political marketing.
He worked with Alistair Campbell, a controversial political figure and well-known political adviser who helped Tony Blair win two elections.
SDP hopes that Evans will help them achieve a similar outcome.
More specifically, the party is banking on enhanced communications and PR skills that will allow them to better get their message across.
Over 1,000 party members registered to attend the training sessions provided by Evans.
Now they are ready to take their new skills into the field, testing them against the strategies of their rivals in HDZ.
It is far too early to make any predictions, except one -- the style of Croatian politics has changed, perhaps forever.
EU Programme Allots 34.5m Euros for Macedonia
Macedonia is set to receive a substantial aid package from the EU under the CARDS programme.
On 5 July, Macedonian Deputy Prime Minister Radmila Sekerinska and the head of the European Commission's delegation to Skopje, Donato Chiarini, signed an agreement launching the assistance package, which will go towards four key areas: democracy stabilisation, good governance and institution building, economic and social development, and participation in European Community programmes.

Macedonian Deputy Prime Minister Radmila Sekerinska met with the head of the European Commission (EC) delegation to Skopje, Donato Chiarini, on 5 July, to sign a financial agreement launching 34.5m euros in EU aid to Macedonia under the CARDS programme.
The aid, initially announced in April, is meant to help Macedonia achieve key goals set forth under its Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Union, as well as to support implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement.
The funds will be used in four priority areas, identified by the EU and Macedonia: democracy stabilisation, good governance and institution building, economic and social development, and participation in European Community programmes.
A portion of the aid (1.4m euros) will go to the General Technical Assistance Facility, which supports the preparation and early implementation of activities as well as the planning process for future programmes.
The CARDS programme was developed by the EU in order to provide assistance to countries undergoing the Stabilisation and Association Process. [EU]
"In the area of democracy stabilisation, support for implementation of the Framework Agreement is continuing," Sekerinska said.
"In the good governance and institutional development areas, most funds are intended for supporting the public prosecution office, combating money laundering and organised crime as well as supporting the decentralisation process by developing the local infrastructure."
Efforts to stabilise democracy in the country through putting the Ohrid Accords into action will be assisted by approximately 2m euros in CARDS funds.
The emphasis will be placed on two areas: increasing the representation levels of minority ethnic communities in public administration, and developing a new government sector in charge of implementation of the agreement.
The area of good governance and institution building has been allotted a total of 18.5m euros.
From this amount, 15m euros are earmarked for public administration reform, with 6.7m euros going towards developing infrastructure in local self-government, 3m euros towards reform of the custom service and implementation of European standards, and 2m euros on the decentralisation process.
The remaining 3.5m euros' worth of institution building funds are earmarked for justice and home affairs reform, including reforms of the public prosecutor's office (1.5m euros), the fight against money laundering (1.5m euros), and strengthening capacity to combat organised crime and terrorism (0.5m euros).
Transportation infrastructure improvements will receive 2.4m euros of the CARDS aid package.
Around 7.6m euros will be allotted to economic and social development.
Of this, 1.2m euros will go towards improving the investment climate in Macedonia.
The development of small- and medium-sized enterprises will be assisted with 2.4m euros, while transportation infrastructure improvements and environmental protection will receive 2.4m euros and 2m euros, respectively.
The EC’s TEMPUS programme, aimed at improving higher education, will be continued, and further assistance will be provided to reform of employment policies.
Under the agenda decided on at the Thessaloniki Summit, European community programmes have been opened up to the Western Balkan countries, and CARDS assistance is available to cover most of the participation costs.
Macedonia is expected to participate in a few of these projects within the next year, and Brussels is making approximately 2m euros available for that purpose.
Experts say it is of great importance that 1.3m euros have been targeted for developing Macedonia's capacity to support a decentralised system for managing EU aid.
The European Commission will handle these funds, which are intended to help the country build its capacity to manage EU aid on its own.
Previously, the European Agency for Reconstruction (EAR) had this task.
But the EAR's mandate is ending in December, and the Instrument for Preaccession (IPA) starts as of January 2007.
If Macedonia receives candidate status, it will start to manage aid by itself and this requires development of institutions.
The process of development has already started.
The CARDS programme was developed by the EU in order to provide assistance to countries undergoing the Stabilisation and Association Process.
CARDS assistance has been allotted to all four potential candidate countries in the Western Balkans: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia and Serbia-Montenegro (including Kosovo).
Croatia, which has been granted candidate country status, will benefit from pre-accession financial assistance while remaining eligible for participation in the CARDS regional programme.
Nimetz upbeat on name talks
The UN mediator in the Greece-Macedonia name dispute says a solution could be reached before the end of this year.
By Marina Stojanovska and Christos Ringas for Southeast European Times in Skopje and Athens -- 09/07/09
"I believe that we are very close to finding a solution, and that is why I'm more optimistic than before," UN Envoy Matthew Nimetz said. [Tomislav Georgiev/SETimes]
Although he refused to set a specific timeframe, UN mediator Mathew Nimetz said on Wednesday (July 8th) that he is more optimistic than ever about finding a solution to the ongoing feud between the two countries.
A deal, he suggested, could even come within this year.
In Athens on Wednesday, Nimetz met with Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis and PASOK leader George Papandreou.
A day earlier, he met with Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov and Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski in Skopje.
Nimetz said he discussed a revised version of his October proposal.
It suggests changing the constitutional name Republic of Macedonia to "Republic of North Macedonia" for use internationally.
Domestically, it would remain Republic of Macedonia.
"I suggested specific changes to the October proposal and asked them to examine the total package along with the changes," said Nimitz.
Both sides have previously rejected the proposal.
Gruevski and then-President Branko Crvenkovski said an overhaul was needed.
Bakoyannis said it was "not satisfactory as it stands" and that several points were unacceptable, problematic, or unclear.
"Only after the necessary clarifications and corrections can this document become the basis for reaching a solution," Bakoyannis told the Greek parliament's defence and foreign affairs committee at the end of October.
Although Nimetz did not disclose any of the changes made to his previous proposal, he described the name dispute process as a complex issue, and said he aims to find a dignified solution for both sides.
"I believe in the talks for a mutually beneficial solution; I believe that we are very close to finding a solution, and that is why I'm more optimistic than before," Nimetz said.
In Skopje, the UN mediator also met with Foreign Affairs Minister Antonio Milososki, the ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration's (DUI) Xhevat Ademi and DUI Vice-President Rafiz Aliti.
"Our attitude is clear.
The solution acceptable for our Macedonian fellows will be acceptable for DUI too," Aliti said.
Census fails to start in northern Kosovo
PRISTINA, Kosovo -- The population and household census has failed to start in Serb-dominated northern Kosovo.
Majlinda Sinani-Lulaj, spokesperson for the State Census Commission, said on Monday (April 4th) that efforts are being made to convey the importance of the census to Kosovo north citizens.
This is the first census in 30 years.
Belgrade is encouraging the boycott, insisting a credible process can only be led by UN agencies, not by the government in Pristina. (TV 21, Klan Kosova, Kohavision - 04/04/11)
Miss Serbia crowned, heads to South Africa
Beauty and intellect could be a powerful combination for Serbia in the upcoming Miss World pageant.

Jelena Markovic, 20, won this year's Miss Serbia title on Monday (July 6th) and will go on to represent the country at the Miss World pageant in Johannesburg, South Africa, in December.
"I did not expect [to win] the title because many beautiful and smart women were competing," she said.
Markovic, a native of Pozhega, competed against contestants from across Serbia at Belgrade's Sava Centre.
Deputy Prime Minister Ivica Dacic and Sports Minister Snezana Samardzic-Markovic attended the event.
Vesna da Vinca, owner of the "Mis JU" company, which organises the Serbian pageant, responded to critics who suggested the new Miss Serbia may not measure up.
"We chose the right girl and I believe she has a great chance at the selection for Miss World.
She is highly polished and a wise woman," said da Vinca. "During the preparations … we assess according to different criteria."
Those preparations this year took place on Mount Kopaonik, one of Serbia's main tourist centres.
The contestants spent nearly a month there, practicing choreography and stage acts.
This year's pageant also followed a bit of a sports theme.
The University Olympics -- popularly named Universiad -- is concurrently taking place in Belgrade; student athletes from over 140 countries take part in the event.
The pageant jury also included some well-known Serbian sports personalities, including basketball player Vlade Divac and national soccer team coach Radomir Antic.
Contestants seemed to have the sports bug as well; most said tennis player Ana Ivanovic is their role model.
Markovic is currently attending Belgrade Law School, but is keeping her career options open.
She told the pageant jury that "judging by my schooling, one might think I will become a lawyer, [but] I would actually like to become a journalist."
Markovic is convinced she will be a good ambassador for Serbia at the Miss World pageant.
"I will justify the expectations of the citizens of Serbia, will think up an original presentation with which I will show that women in Serbia are beautiful and smart -- they have all the qualities of a complete woman."
However, organiser da Vinca added a dose of reality.
"Lobbying is needed, and the state should get involved.
The world's choice does not depend on beauty alone, and goes outside the framework of that which I as a private sector person can do."
Last year's Miss World pageant also took place in South Africa. Miss Russia, Ksenia Sukhinova, was crowned Miss World 2008 in the event that was televised to over 2 billion people in 130 countries.
Spend a night at BiH's grand Muslibegovic House
A family of nobles settled in Mostar following the fall of Herceg Novi to the Venetians in 1687.
Though still owned by the heirs, their house is open to visitors.

The Muslibegovic family established themselves in Mostar at the end of the 17th century.
Nestled in Mostar in the heart of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Muslibegovic House is a nifty getaway and national monument all rolled into one.
The noble Muslibegovic family established themselves in Mostar at the end of the 17th century following the fall of Herceg Novi to the Venetians in 1687.
The house has remained in the family for hundreds of years, and today is owned by Tadzudin and Zehra Muslibegovic.
The house showcases antiques from the Ottoman period such as old books -- printed in Turkish, Persian and Arabic -- Bosnian handkerchiefs, waistbands, napkins, purses, bed covers, socks, medallions, sofas, lamps, Anatolian kilims and tapestries.
A gate leads into a spacious garden outside the house, which is chock-full of various flowers, plants, herbs, palm, Japanese apple trees and medlar (musmula) trees.
The house showcases antiques from the Ottoman period.
Visitors can take a guided tour.
There are a lot of agricultural and historical treasures to explore in Mostar, so if you plan to spend a couple of days, and want to live like nobility, Muslibegovic is an ideal location.
After having a cup of coffee in the shady garden, head out on the cobbled streets to see what the city has to offer.
Overnight rates vary -- this summer a single room costs about 50 euros per night, a twin/double about 85 euros and a so-called pasha suite costs 95 euros.
Before you trek down to Muslibegovic, use their online tool to make sure they have a room available (Muslibegovic House).
The house is also set up to host weddings and conferences.
You can find Muslibegovic House near Stari Most, or the "Old Bridge", that crosses the Neretva River.
Every summer at the end of July there is a bridge diving competition there -- a tradition, according to legend, that has been going on for more than 440 years.
You might even want to document your trip, as did Turkish historian Evlija Celebija.
"The bridge looks like the arch of rainbow that rises to the Milky Way," he wrote
Olympic Business: The Cost of the Games
With an overall cost of 7.5 billion euros, the Olympic games will be the single most expensive event to take place in the Balkans next year.
But where will all the money come from?
By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 11/09/03
With less than a year remaining before the Summer Olympics, the projected budget for the 17-day event has climbed from 6.5 billion euros to 7.5 billion euros.
Who is picking up this enormous bill?
The Greek government is covering 12 per cent, plus the costs of support for the Games -- which includes all construction projects.
Sale of worldwide broadcast rights will pay for an estimated 37.5 per cent of the tab.
As many as 2 billion viewers from around the globe are expected to tune in.
Tickets, on the other hand, will only contribute 9.3 per cent, since prices for the qualifying events have been kept to as low as 10 euros.
Commemorative coins, stamps and donations will account for 13.5 per cent.
The Athens 2004 Organising Committee (ATHOC) worked hard to ensure that the Games have a large number of domestic sponsors.
The International Organising Committee, meanwhile, signed the global sponsors.
The Games have an official bank (Alpha), fuel (Shell), sportswear (Adidas), water (Ioli), airline (Olympic), travel agency (Jet Set Sports), and sports equipment company (Mondo).
On an international level, Coca-Cola is the main sponsor.
Other brands that we will be seeing during the Olympics on banners, billboards, flags and other available surface include John Hancock, Kodak, McDonald's, Panasonic, Samsung, Schlumberger, Sports Illustrated/Time, Swatch, VISA and Xerox.
Sponsorships have already raised 509m euros -- 37 per cent more than ATHOC's target.
Many sponsors will be providing goods or services, rather than contributing financially.
Mondo has given sports equipment; Swatch is taking care of the electronic stopwatches; Panasonic is providing the audiovisual equipment; and Samsung will handle the wireless communications.
Initially, the Olympics were expected to be fiscally justified for the government.
After all, they are placing Greece in the international spotlight, boosting tourism, spurring modernisation of the national infrastructure and enhancing development.
The biggest breakthrough was expected in the area of employment.
It was hoped that the Games would create 140,000 jobs.
It now appears that 35,000 is a more realistic figure.
Achieving government targets, however, is not ATHOC's primary focus.
Rather, it is to make the Games unforgettable.
Forest Fires: A Recurring Problem in Turkey
This summer's heat wave in Eastern Europe has sparked a number of forest fires across the region.
In Turkey, such fires are a yearly occurrence.
By Fatih Baran for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 01/09/03
Each year, forest fires in Turkey claim an average of 14,000 hectares, with negligence and carelessness often the culprit.
Arson is also seen as a major factor.
According to the General Directorate of Forestry, 1,183 forest fires broke out between January and August, and a total of 2,508 hectares were destroyed.
During the same period last year, 1,000 forest fires broke out and a total of 5,542 hectares were destroyed.
After the directorate released its report, another bout of fires ravaged forestlands near the popular tourist resort of Anatalya.
Meanwhile, fires were also reported in other Turkish provinces, including Istanbul, Kirklareli, Mersin, Denizli, Isparta, Izmir, Mugla, Fethiye, Bodrum and Marmaris.
Despite the thousands of hectares lost to fires, the amount of forestland in Turkey has actually increased, according to the directorate. Total forest area rose to 20,763,000 hectares by the end of 2002, up from 20,199,000 hectares in 1972.
The rate of forest fires has not increased abnormally, and burned areas continue to be reforested, the report said.
Meanwhile, fierce debate has been triggered by the ruling Justice and Development Party's (AKP) proposal to amend an article of the constitution concerning the sale and rent of deforested areas.
The current constitutional provision stipulates the immediate forestation of burnt forest areas and bans them from being used for other purposes.
The amendment proposed by AKP would allow the sale of about 500,000 hectares of destroyed forestland, in an effort to find funds for the budget.
NGOs have sharply criticised the proposal, saying it would lead to an increase in fires.
Last week, President Ahmet Necdet Sezer vetoed the legislation for the 2nd time.
"This move, if implemented, will encourage the total annihilation of forests and cause further forest destruction.
Placing priority to those using the areas excluded from forests, in selling these forests, will trigger the looting of forests and create hopes for those constructing illegal houses, for another amnesty," Sezer said.
The president warned the government that he would call a referendum if the proposed law is sent to him a 3rd time.
AKP, meanwhile, argues that there is no evidence to support the claim that a change in the law would lead to more fires.
The ruling party has announced it will call parliament for an extraordinary session on the issue.
Should a referendum be held together with local elections in April 2004, a failure by AKP to secure the majority could lead to a new general election.
Festival Takes BiH, Croatian and Serbian Films on the Road
The On the Road Film Festival, aiming to promote reconciliation through features, shorts and documentaries, toured Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Yugoslavia this month.
By Beth Kampschror for Balkan Times in Sarajevo - 28/11/02
In a scene from Serbian director Andrijana Stojkovic's documentary Muzej radi samo drzavnim praznicima (Museum Only Open on Public Holidays), three young people atop a hill outside Mostar discuss what's happened to them in the past ten years.
"It's too soon to talk about all of these things," one girl says.
But the philosophy behind the On the Road Film Festival, on tour throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia this month, is that now is the time to talk about these things.
Organised by the Nansen Dialogue Network in the Balkans and funded by the Norwegian Foreign Affairs Ministry, the festival has brought some 20 films from all three countries to local cinemas, based on the idea that dialogue isn't made up only of words.
"Film doesn't need words," said festival co-ordinator Ranko Milanovic-Blank.
You can see and more closely experience the other person's feelings without talking to them.
The first experience about the suffering of 'the other' is better through film."
Milanovic-Blank said the idea was to include more provocative short films and documentaries, like Stojkovic's, in the programme, along with more well-known feature films.
While large audiences in all three countries have seen Ademir Kenovic's Savrseni krug (Perfect Circle) and Danis Tanovic's Nicija Zemlja (No Man's Land), the shorts and documentaries have until now had select audiences.
"This was to offer an opportunity for wider audiences to see these short films.
They're more stimulating for discussion," he said.
Those discussions took place at a seminar and at question-and-answer sessions after some of the films.
Andrijana Stojkovic said after the screening of Muzej that her film was hard to make, because she asked her subjects in Belgrade, Mostar, Sarajevo and Zagreb questions about what their lives were like and what they feared.
"Those people are our friends, which was very important," she said. "But it wasn't easy, it was very difficult for them to discuss what we wanted to talk about."
The film was difficult to watch as well, with its scenes of destruction and sad commentary from the interviewees.
But not all of these war or war-aftermath films were completely without lightness.
Sjecas li se Sarajeva? (Do You Remember Sarajevo?), a documentary made from home videos during the war, mixed scenes of shelled, burning houses with scenes of teenagers skiing down the streets in winter.
"Oh, I need a Band-Aid," deadpans a young man who's just had a friend remove a bullet from his shoulder with pliers.
Yugoslav director Goran Paskaljevic's 1998 black comedy Bure baruta (Powder Keg), had the full cinema shrieking with laughter when one unhinged Belgrader, enraged over a city bus driver's endless Balkan coffee break, steals the bus for a wild ride.
"Conflict is not always black," Milanovic-Blank said.
"Even during the war we had some fun here sometimes.
It's not simple, this suffering, just like the war wasn't simple."
Croatians worry about their investments in Serbia
Recent business co-operation between Croatia and Serbia has become a success story in the Western Balkans, but members of the business community in both countries worry about Serbian reactions to Croatia's official recognition of Kosovo.
By Natasa Radic for Southeast European Times in Zagreb –20/03/08

Kosovo's declaration of independence and the subsequent protests in Belgrade have adversely affected the Croatian economy because more than 200 Croatian companies have investments in Serbia.
Economic co-operation between the two countries has been steadily on the rise.
The Croatian Chamber of Commerce says Croatian firms have invested more than 390m euros in Serbia, though they have kept a low profile.
But now Croatian firms worry their businesses and investments in Serbia will suffer a setback now that Croatia has officially recognised Kosovo.
On Wednesday (March 19th), the Croatian government – together with Bulgaria and Hungary -- announced it is recognising Kosovo's independence.
During last month's Belgrade riots, the Croatian embassy was attacked and the windows of a Croatian-owned shop in Uzice were broken.
Members of the business community, who spoke with the Croatian press off the record, said they hoped political leaders in Croatia would consider the position of Croatian investors in Serbia when deciding how to handle the Kosovo issue.
They worry that because of recognising Kosovo, not only will Croatian investments in Serbia suffer in the short term, but long-term business co-operation between the countries may be affected.
"We think the government chose the right position by not rushing into being among the first countries to recognise Kosovo," Croatian Entrepreneurs' Association director Djuro Popijac told the weekly Globus. "Our government should be aware that we cannot compare ourselves to Germany or the United States."
"Our business co-operation with Serbia has been on the rise, our trade exchange is solid and we export more than 400m euros annually on the Serbian market," he added.
For now, Croatian firms hope that the situation will quiet soon and Serbian consumers will not boycott Croatian products or companies.
Foreign direct investments on the rise in Albania
Albania is seeing more foreign investors then ever before and the government expects this trend to continue if the country is asked to join NATO following the April summit in Bucharest.

Experts expect investments in the energy sector this year. [Getty Images]
With fiscal reforms under way, progress in the fight against corruption, low inflation rates and a negative trade balance, Albania is attracting more foreign direct investments (FDIs) with high profitability and low labour costs.
Because of the ability of FDIs to generate jobs and contribute to long-term economic development, the government has made attracting them a priority.
Experts expect to see investments mainly in the energy sector this year, as well as the natural resources and tourism sectors.
Hydro and thermal power plant construction, along with the privatisation of the state-run electricity distribution division and oil and insurance companies, offer opportunities to foreign companies looking to invest in Albania.
A foreign investment incentive programme launched by the government is already yielding results.
Under the "Albania 1 euro" initiative -- which aims to attract investors by offering overseas firms entry to the Albanian market for 1 euro -- the Greek consortium Atermon SA - Roder & Blackwell Consulting won the tender to rehabilitate a six-unit thermal power station.
Although the consortium paid 1 euro to enter the market, it will invest at least 100m euros in the power station, which was built in 1966 by the Chinese and restructured in the 1980s with Czech technology.
Privatisation of state-run entities is also being used to lure investors.
Austrian, Czech and Italian companies have expressed interest in buying the distribution division of the state-owned electricity company, KESH.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Energy says the division will become the property of a large foreign energy company this year.
Additionally, the privatisation of the state-owned oil company, ARMO, has generated interest from at least 20 companies.
The sale could raise 84.7m euros.
The state insurance company, INSIG, is also planned for privatisation, while the three largest private insurance companies in Albania were purchased partially or entirely by international insurance groups.
Albania's natural resources are also attracting investors.
At the end of January, the Austrian power company EVN won the bid for a contract aimed at exploiting the hydropower potential of the Devoll River with an annual production of 985,400 mWh.
Austrian and Canadian consulting companies are studying exploration of mineral-rich areas in Albania following increased exports of chromium, according to government sources.
With a developing infrastructure, government promotion, and an increase in the number of tourists -- due in part to the rise in tourism in neighbouring Adriatic countries, Albanian tourism is becoming increasingly attractive to foreign companies.
For example, a 500m-euro railway system investment planned by China Railroad Construction Corporation is expected to boost travel opportunities.
Although low by regional standards -- attracting only 195m euros as of October 2007 -- investments in Albania have been increasing in recent years.
The Economist Conferences analyst Richard Eames has told journalists that if the government significantly improves the climate, investments would come.
It would appear the government is heeding that advice.
OSCE poll finds decentralisation successful in Macedonia, tax collection still a challenge
Mayors surveyed in a new poll by the OSCE monitoring mission say they are experiencing few difficulties in implementing decentralisation, except when it comes to collecting local taxes and fees.

Overall, decentralisation in Macedonia is being implemented successfully, without difficulties in most areas, according to mayors surveyed in a new poll by the OSCE monitoring mission. By a large majority, however, the mayors said fiscal decentralisation poses a big challenge.
The main difficulties in the financial area are administration of local taxes and fees, the survey found.
Since revenue collection is the basis for normal functioning of local self-government units, assistance in this area will be vital if decentralisation is to proceed.
The OSCE poll was aimed at determining the results of the transfer of authority from the central to local levels that began in July 2005.
It was conducted in Skopje, which functions as a separate unit of local self-government, and in 80 other municipalities.
Macedonia has a total of 84 municipalities, following the new law on territorial organisation that entered into force in 2004.
Before then, Macedonia was divided into 123 municipalities.
The poll focused on financial management, urban planning, education, inter municipal co-operation, local communities, relations between communities and equality of genders.
The results show significant progress in these areas.
"We have not only analysed and assessed the present conditions, but we offer recommendations for future activities of the local authorities that can be supported by the OSCE Mission and other members of the international community with the aim of better focusing and increasing the efficiency of the given aid," said Philip Stil, head of the Public Administration Reform Department with the OSCE Mission.
"Results of the poll and recommendations are an important guideline directing all the entities on the way of decentralisation.
As the main partner of the government, we will continue to serve the municipalities as the lobbyists for their interests and will continue to develop our members' capacities, said Andrej Petrov, the chairman of Local Self-Government Communities.
Decentralisation in Macedonia formally started on July 1st 2005 when most responsibilities were transferred from the central to local levels.
These include collection of property tax and a part of the VAT.
Under a decision made by the previous government, municipalities manage some sports facilities.
The municipalities of Ohrid and Struga were also given the management of the Lake Ohrid coast, with the aim of boosting tourism.
Romanian court says "happy news" bill is unconstitutional
Romania's constitutional court quashes a bill under which at least 50% of the items on domestic broadcasters' newscasts must be "positive".

Romania's constitutional court quashed a controversial media bill earlier this month, calling the law unconstitutional.
The Senate had passed the law, which stipulated that upbeat news should make up half of all newscasts on Romania's radio and television stations.
The opposition Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) appealed the July 9th ruling, arguing that the new legislation infringed on freedom of expression.
The authors of the bill, senators Gheorghe Funar of the far-right Greater Romania Party and Ioan Ghise of the ruling National Liberal Party, claimed its aim was to "improve the general climate" and to make sure that Romanians get "a well-balanced perception of everyday life".
Negative news, the Romanian English-language daily Nine o'clock quoted them as arguing, could have a dangerous impact on viewers' lives and health.
The aim of the bill was to "improve the general climate and to offer the public the chance to have balanced perceptions on daily life, mentally and emotionally".
"This bill is utterly unacceptable in an EU-member country," international media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said after Romania's 137-seat Senate adopted the controversial amendments to the country's audiovisual law.
The Paris-based group described the legislation as "retrograde and anachronistic".
It also warned that the enactment of a measure that is "completely subjective and devoid of meaning" would pose a threat to Romanian broadcasters' editorial freedom.
The amendments earlier fell short of passage in parliament's lower house, the Chamber of Deputies. Ahead of the vote on June 25th, the Senate's human rights commission voiced opposition to the bill, but the culture and mass media panel supported it.
Eventually, it won unanimous Senate approval before the constitutional court stepped in.
Under the bill, the state broadcast regulator, the National Audiovisual Council (CNA), would decide what was "positive" and what was "negative".
But CNA head Rasvan Popescu was obviously disenchanted with the Senate's move.
News, he said, "is neither negative, nor positive", as it reflects only reality and broadcasters cannot plan events.
"News is news," Popescu said, criticising also the parliament's upper house for failing to invite him or other CNA members to the debate on the legislation.
He stressed also that "a change regarding the balance of positive and negative news stories in TV and radio bulletins must be discussed."
Greek leaders fail to reach consensus on new austerity measures
ATHENS, Greece -- Prime Minister George Papandreou failed to convince the leaders of the opposition Friday (May 27th) to support his government's austerity measures necessary to help the country overcome its financial crisis.
Brussels has urged consensus among all political forces on the mid-term budget programme, which envisions cutting public costs by 14 billion euros and increasing tax revenues by 9 billion euros by 2015.
It also includes a privatisation plan expected to bring revenues of around 50 billion euros. Friday's meeting was called by President Karolos Papoulias in an effort to find consensus, but the four-hour discussions ended without any result.
The conservative New Democracy party has rejected the measures.
After the talks, the EU warned Athens that "it is running out of time" to adopt the new austerity programme. (ANA-MPA, SKAI, ERT - 27/05/11)

Muslims eagerly await mosque construction in Athens
The New Year will bring construction of a long-awaited house of worship.

Muslims welcomed Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou's recent announcement that plans are moving full steam ahead for the construction of the first mosque in Athens.
Among them is Egyptian-born Naim Elghandour, chairman of the Muslim Association of Greece (MAG). He migrated to Greece in 1972 at the age of 18. His role as head of MAG, established in 2003, keeps him busy.
"We have worked very hard to raise people's awareness of issues concerning Muslims, to demonstrate that we are moderates, we are not terrorists and that no one should fear us," he told SETimes.

Although the media often claims that Muslims in Athens have been waiting decades for a mosque to be built in the capital, Elghandour said MAG submitted a formal proposal to the education and religious affairs ministry in 2006.
It was approved, and a relevant law passed the same year.
Papandreou announced in parliament on December 10th that procedures for the mosque's construction had been accelerated, because the right to a place of worship is fundamental, the Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
It will be government-funded and built in the Votanikos district, near the city centre.
Although no official figure exists, Elghandour estimates there are close to one million Muslims in Greece, mostly from Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
Based on migrant residence permit figures, there are about 500,000 Muslims registered in the greater Athens area -- many of whom Elghandour says move to rural areas to find work.
There are about 250,000 Muslim asylum-seekers, about 120,000 Muslims in Thrace, as well as tens of thousands of undocumented migrants and children of Muslim migrants.

Muslims in Athens rent offices, shops, basement apartments and garages that they use as places of worship.
Elghandour commended the government's decision on the project. "I have a sense of both joy and anticipation.
I am eagerly waiting for this project to move forward," he said.
Elghandour's Greek wife, Anna Stamou, is also actively involved in the Muslim Association of Greece.
The pair met in 2003 while working as humanitarian aid volunteers for the Doctors of the World organisation during the Iraq war.
Stamou decided to adopt the Muslim faith two years after she married Elghandour. "There is no pressure for this.
The Koran forbids us from pressuring anyone to become a Muslim," he points out. Stamou was among more than 500 Muslims who participated in an open-air prayer for Islam's Eid al-Adha religious celebration, organised by MAG and held in front of the University of Athens.
The celebration, in the heart of Athens' business district, proved to be an unusual sight in a country where more than 90% of the population is Greek Orthodox.

A civil servant in his early forties, who had never witnessed a Muslim prayer celebration before, said it made him "happy", as he believes everyone should have the right to freely practice their religion.
An estimated 13,000 Muslims attended Eid celebrations held at 12 sites throughout greater Athens.
At another Eid prayer gathering, held at the inner-city Attiki Square, members of the extreme-right group Chrysi Avgi and a number of residents tried to disrupt proceedings by playing loud music and throwing eggs at the faithful kneeling on prayer mats.
Elghandour said he disagreed with holding the Attiki Square celebration, as he believed it would add to tensions that have arisen between residents and migrants who have gathered at Athens' Agios Pandeleimonos district over the past year.
"Today's show of strength by African and Asian Muslims in Athens on the occasion of their religious celebration is a matter that should be of major concern for… incoming [Athens] Mayor [George] Kaminis," Greek media reported the spokesperson for the ultra-nationalist Popular Orthodox Rally (LAOS) party, Kostis Aivaliotis, as saying.
The atmosphere was far different outside the university, says Elghandour, where many Greeks extended their wishes to those praying. "There was one priest, who lived in Jerusalem for 40 years, who embraced me and … told me he stands by us.
Now, when people like him, who are educated and civilised, act this way towards us, we are not concerned about a small number of right-wing extremists," he said.
He noted that the Greek people "have embraced us".
LAOS Chairman George Karatzaferis [Reuters]
Elghandour said that some politicians and extremist groups are cultivating fears and racist attitudes to gain political advantage "in an attempt to convince a despairing youth that migrants are to blame for the [economic] crisis Greece is experiencing".
"A Greek high school graduate will not go and work as a painter or baker or fisherman or construction worker … All families want their children to study and take an office job.
Therefore in practice, 90% of migrants have not taken the jobs of Greeks," he explains.
Speaking in parliament on the day of Papandreou's announcement regarding the mosque plans, LAOS Chairman George Karatzaferis referred to what he described as a "shocking" report on Islamic extremism in Greece, which charges that the majority of Muslim migrants in the country are obviously not terrorists, "yet they [fanatical Islamists] use this growing community to penetrate into societies", ANA reported.
Responding to a question tabled in parliament by Karatzaferis, who cited press reports of an alleged "mobilisation of Muslim extremist circles in Athens", Papandreou said "the absence of places of worship leads to the creation of semi-illegal spaces, or it forces the faithful to practice their religion outdoors, making what should be a normal event appear like an uprising or a protest," according to ANA.
Elghandour said that if Karatzaferis or anyone else has information concerning Muslims, they should give it to the police.
"If he is not certain, however, then he should remain silent because it is a disgrace for the leader of a political party to sell populism and influence the Greek on the street, who may not be well informed," Elghandour said.
He believes Greece is viewed differently than other Western countries as it has never been an "occupier" of other nations. "Greeks who lived around the world lived in peace with locals," he explained.
However, he said that right-wing elements in Greece attempt to "create a climate of hate so that Muslims abroad will think that Greece mistreats Muslims".
"We are aware of their plans, which were spoiled because we are here.
The image of Greece and its population of 11 million will not be ruined by two or three hundred who engage in these types of practices," Elghandour said.
As for Papandreou's support for places of worship for all individuals in Greece, Elghandour said "it is a matter of culture.
A civilised country must have places of worship for all faithful, of all religions."
Montenegro Sees Upswing in Summer Tourism
Whether because of aggressive marking, a better-prepared season or burgeoning interest in alternative holiday spots, Montenegro was a destination of choice for domestic and foreign vacationers alike.
The number of tourists during the first eight months of this year grew by 16.8 per cent compared to the same period last year, with a 30 per cent spike in revenues. The republic welcomed 49.7 per cent more foreign visitors than in 2004, and had more and better facilities to offer them.
While unregistered tourism remains high, the government is taking steps to bring more visitors and accommodation sites into the system.

Herceg Novi, site of the Mediterranean Health Centre for Recreation and Treatment, is a hub of Montenegrin tourism.
Over the summer, promotional videos entitled "Montenegro -- Wild Beauty" could be seen on CNN.
They were part of a campaign put together jointly by the tourism ministry and the Montenegro Tourist Organisation, in a bid to introduce more potential visitors to all the republic has to offer.
Indeed, whether because of aggressive marking, a better-prepared season or burgeoning interest in alternative holiday spots, Montenegro was a destination of choice both for domestic and foreign vacationers.
The season not only met, but exceeded expectations.
According to government statistics, the first eight months of this year saw a 16.8 per cent increase in the number of tourists and a 13.6 per cent rise in overnight stays, compared to the year before.
Revenues are 30 per cent higher than last year's, and the number of foreign visitors rose by 49.7 per cent -- although most of these continued to come from the former Yugoslav republics.
Among other visitors, the highest numbers -- 32,767, or 4.9 per cent -- were from Russia, followed by the Czech Republic -- 19,938 -- and Germany -- 13,088.
Certainly, Montenegro has a lot to offer them, with a gorgeous coastline, mountains and sun.
Blue flags -- the international symbol of recognition for high quality beaches -- adorn the coastline.
New hotels and villas are springing up, while many older ones have been renovated according to international standards.
More has been done to solve problems such as noise, traffic, pollution and tie-ups at the border.
Many of the improvements have resulted, directly or indirectly, from a Master Plan for the Development of Tourism in Montenegro to 2020, drawn up for the government by DEG, a specialist in long-term projects and corporate financing.
Herceg Novi, site of the Mediterranean Health Centre for Recreation and Treatment, is a hub of Montenegrin tourism.
It has also been the leading city in implementing at tourism ministry initiative called "Let it Be Legal," designed to encourage the registration and categorisation of private accommodations.
While unregistered tourism remains high, authorities expect the projected amount of collected tourist tax will be exceeded.
Herceg Novi enjoyed a banner summer season this year. Small luxury hotels, such as the Aleksander, Perla and Xanadu, were over 90 per cent full in August, while supersized ones such as the 560-bed Hotel Plaza were at least three-quarters booked.
Tourists in the peak season could enjoy such attractions as music galas, book events and the 19th Herceg Novi Film Festival.
Just after passing Herceg Novi on the way to the north, one arrives at the Debeli Brijeg border.
Here, a new, seagull-shaped border crossing was opened on 12 July, with the aim of offering visitors an appealing first impression of Montenegro.
The border crossing offers a range of services to tourists and executives coming via Croatia, including a police station, inspection office, post office, shipment office and tourist information booth.
It also speeds them through in record time; according to estimates, summer wait times at the border rarely exceeded 10 minutes, and on some days as many as 100 buses came through in a single day.
The new border crossing at Debeli Brijeg was opened on 12 July, with the aim of offering visitors an appealing first impression of Montenegro.
South of Herceg Novi, Budva, sometimes referred to as the City Theatre, saw a 25.9 per cent increase in the number of tourists and a 24.1 per cent rise in overnight stays.
In August, the top-rated hotel Maestral, owned by the Slovenian firm Hit Montenegro, marked 10,000 overnight stays, drawing guests from Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, Slovenia and the United States, among others.
Budva is also looking forward to a lively post-season, featuring a rich array of events to encourage tourists to stay longer, including a fish festival and an international festival of majorettes.
A number of hotels are to be open throughout October -- uncommon for coastal cities which normally close their hotels in that period in order to renovate, repair and prepare for the next season.
Despite the fierce competition coming from Albania, Macedonia, Turkey and Bulgaria,, tourists from Kosovo have flocked to the southernmost city of Ulcinj, according to Kosovo Tourist Centre director Skeljzen Rizaj.
Last year, they contributed almost 2 million overnight stays and spent about 1m euros.
One factor, Rizaj speculates, may be the fact that Montenegro remained comparatively free of the ethnic divisions and warfare that wracked the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s.
It is seen as having a good track record in respecting minority rights and promoting tolerance.
Two publications have given a vital boost to summer tourism. On 22 July, the tourism ministry of Tourism and the National Tourist Organisation launched "Montenegro Explorer", the first Montenegrin magazine intended for foreign tourists.
It is available in English, German, Czech and Russian languages. All hotels of three or higher category now feature this publication in their rooms.
Richly photographed, "Montenegro Explorer" offers a range of information on accommodations, activities, sightseeing, tourist organisations, restaurants, festivals and sports.
A few days later, on 27 July, the Tourist Organisation of Montenegro published the first issue of "Active & Extreme" magazine, listing all the extreme sports which a visitor can enjoy while in the republic, as well as information and contact information for sports clubs.
All data on tourism in Montenegro must be taken with a grain of salt.
Because of the high number of unregistered tourists -- comprising, according to some estimates, half the total number of tourists overall -- figures remain imprecise.
Only hotels and other official accommodations can keep accurate tabs.
In addition, it is possible to exaggerate the impact of tourism on the economy; tourists, in fact, have relatively low purchasing power.
Nevertheless, there is a general consensus among Montenegrin tourist authorities that things are looking up in a big way.
They are already anticipating the 2006 season, when the ongoing privatisation of Montenegrin tourism will be nearly complete, inaugurating a new chapter for the industry.
Serbia Suffers "Brain Drain" as Young and Educated Leave
Unemployment, low wages, and lack of opportunity are some of the forces causing young people to leave Serbia in increasing numbers.
Some organisations are attempting to stem the tide by providing scholarships.
By Davor Konjikusic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 22/02/05

According to the latest research conducted by the Centre for Alternative Studies, young people in Serbia face a series of difficulties, including unemployment, low wages, housing shortages, a worrisome economic outlook and obstacles to career development.
These factors are leading to a brain drain in the country.
In the past, around 300,000 young people left Serbia each year, including about 8 per cent of the top university students.
That figure rose significantly by 2003, while a new poll conducted among 3,200 young people between the ages of 16 and 35 found that as many as 43 per cent are ready to leave if they find the opportunity to do so.
In a bid to slow this trend, university students have established the Association of Serbia's Best Students, which helps young people obtain scholarships.
Another organisation, the Centre for Child Care, awarded 73 scholarships last year, with only two recipients later choosing to leave the country.
Next year, the Centre plans to sell advertising space on billboards along principal highways, using the proceeds to finance stipends for top students.
Branislav Aleksic, a student of electrical engineering, says he will not stay unless Serbia can provide him with a better life.
"In all other countries children are nurtured from the beginning and everything is invested in them," Aleksic says, adding that Serbs should expect no less from their country.
Similar sentiments are expressed by Andjelka Zecevic, a mathematics student.
Although she loves her city and her friends, Zecevic says, "Unless the climate changes, I will be forced to leave."
According to Srecko Mihajlovic, a prominent sociologist, young people in Serbia are often slow to become mature adults, becoming stuck instead in an "extended youth" as a result of absent opportunity and lack of encouragement.
"Society leaves them in diapers until the fourth decade," Mihajlovic says.
Another sociologist, Smiljka Tomanovic, has done extensive research into the situation of young people.
She concludes that the basic requirement for individualisation -- independence from parents -- is generally missing in Serbia.
As a result, many young people evolve a strategy of postponement, delaying everything from university studies to finding a job, getting married and having children.
Surveys have found that 77 per cent of unmarried young men and women live with their parents, and even those who do get married are likely to become part of extended parental family structures -- which, researchers say, are frequently burdened by conflicts and even violence.
Research into these issues is hampered by apathy and lack of funding, Tomanovic says, adding that she hopes the recent survey results will "inspire those who hold power in society to drop down from the ideological level to the practical level of doing something for young people".
Albania Seeks to Develop Domestic Air Transport
Establishing a domestic air travel system across Albania will help attract foreign investment and spur development, officials say.
A new airport is already being built in Kukes, and negotiations are under way on an agreement to construct facilities in Vlora and Saranda.

Authorities in Albania are working on re-establishing the country's domestic air transport network, as part of an overall strategy to encourage business and tourism.
In the northeast town of Kukes, the construction of a domestic airport is under way, with 13.6m euros in funding from the United Arab Emirates.
It is to be completed by June.
The Kukes airport will be used primarily for transportation of goods.
But authorities are negotiating with several international companies on a possible concessionary agreement to build two airports in the south, in the seaside cities of Vlora and Saranda, to be used mainly for tourism.
"We are seriously thinking about developing the domestic air transport, seeing it as a possibility to boost the development of economy in these particular areas of the country, not only with business activities but also cultural tourism," says Albanian Transport Minister Spartak Poci.
Currently, Mother Teresa Airport in Tirana is the sole airport in the country.
Over the next 20 years, it is expected to be expanded and modernised.
In November 2004, Albania signed a concessionary agreement worth 82m euros with the US-German consortium Tirana Airport Partners to undertake the task.
Poci says the ongoing project for Mother Teresa Airport is a good example of efforts to develop air transport.
Given the country's notoriously poor road network, domestic air travel is seen as crucial to attracting greater foreign investment.
Building airports in Vlora and Saranda will pave the way for the construction and development of facilities planned for Gjirokastra, Korca and Shkodra, officials say.
Air traffic in Albania started in the 1930s. By 1944, there were airports in Tirana, Vlora, and Kucova, while construction was in process in Korca, Kukes, Gjirokastra, and Shkodra.
At the time, domestic air traffic consisted of about three light planes -- all foreign-owned and operated -- capable of transporting up to ten passengers as well as mail.
During communism, domestic flights came to a halt, with the exception of military flights.
Today, Albania is connected with a number of European destinations -- Rome, Milan, Athens, Frankfurt, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Sofia, Istanbul -- offering connections to the rest of the world.
According to transport ministry data, last year passenger numbers increased by 13 per cent in comparison with 2003, and the number of flights rose by 18 per cent.
EU Stands Firm on Conditions for Croatia's Accession Talks
Urging Croatia again to hand over fugitive General Ante Gotovina to the UN war crimes tribunal as soon as possible, EU foreign ministers reiterated Monday that full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal remains an essential condition for the accession process.

Fugitive General Ante Gotovina must be extradited to the UN war crimes tribunal as soon as possible, EU foreign ministers said. [AFP]
Less than a month before the planned start of Croatia's EU accession talks, Zagreb came under pressure again Monday (21 February) to prove its full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and hand over a key war crimes suspect, retired General Ante Gotovina.
"Full and unconditional co-operation by the countries of the Western Balkans with the ICTY remains an essential requirement for their continuing movement towards the EU," the Union's foreign ministers said in a statement after their regular monthly meeting in Brussels, adding that "the last remaining indictee must be located and transferred to The Hague as soon as possible".
In December, EU leaders gave the green light for opening membership negotiations with Croatia on 17 March, provided it co-operates fully with the ICTY and extradites Gotovina.
One of the tribunal's three most-wanted indictees, he went into hiding in mid-2001, shortly after UN prosecutors charged him with war crimes over his alleged role in the killings of 150 Krajina Serbs and the expulsion of 150,000 others towards the close of the 1991-1995 conflict in Croatia.
In a letter to the EU presidency last week, chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte said authorities "simply have not done everything in their power" to capture him.
She also accused them of failing to break his support network, which she described as "alive, healthy and active".
As a result, del Ponte said, she is unable to certify that Croatia is fully co-operating with The Hague.
Senior officials in Brussels have stood by the December decision, emphasising that Croatia is welcome in the EU but must first meet the requirement for co-operation.
"There are no surprises here, this is a precondition for negotiations to start," said Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency
For their part, Croatian authorities says they have stepped up efforts to track down the fugitive, while insisting that none of the information gathered to date has proven that Gotovina is in the country.
"We have services doing their jobs with increased intensity and with the aid of international experts.
I am convinced we will step into his tracks," said President Stipe Mesic, who is scheduled to visit Brussels in the beginning of March.
"It is up to us to show that we are transparent, responsible and fully engaged on this case," Reuters quoted Croatian Foreign Minister Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic as telling reporters in Brussels on Monday. "I believe we shall persuade the EU we are making the maximum effort."
The EU foreign ministers' next regular meeting is scheduled for 16 March -- the last date for Brussels to decide whether negotiations with Croatia will begin the next day.

Albania's challenges in 2006
Election reform and fighting corruption are two major areas of concern for Albania as it seeks to conclude a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
By Erlis Selimaj for Southeast European Times in Tirana -- 20/01/06
Election reform will be a major hurdle for Albania this year. [AFP]
As the year 2006 gets under way, Albania is approaching a key milestone.
The European Commission has said it intends to conclude Stabilisation and Association (SAA) talks with the country this spring, paving the way for eventual EU membership.
However, it warned, an SAA agreement depends on the progress made in implementing required reforms.
The SAA process for Albania has been difficult in comparison to other countries of the region, according to Skender Minxhozi, director of the Tirana daily Gazeta Shqiptare.
"For more than three years Albania has been negotiating an agreement, which technically is considered concluded," Minxhozi told the Voice of America. "But there have been problems connected with internal political stability and election processes every year.
As a result, the EC reply has been conditioned."
Albania will also hold local elections this year, and these will be seen as a test of its ability to hold a free and fair vote in line with international standards.
Political parties are expected to begin negotiations this month on election reform, a thorny issue over the past decade.
Previous elections, Minxhozi said, have set a bad precedent: each time, after the process is organised, political parties rush to criticise it and make changes to the election code.
"The last local elections were held according to a 'set of rules', which now is considered by many actors as unacceptable.
Fair elections depend on political parties' ability to find a common language, but the role of the international community is also important.
Its role, I think, should be more qualified than it has been until now," Minxhozi said.
Another major area of concern is fighting corruption.
Prime Minister Sali Berisha came to power in 2005 on an anti-corruption platform, vowing to take decisive action against the problem.
According to analyst Andi Bushati, corruption can indeed be tackled, but the Berisha cabinet cannot do it alone.
"It depends on the political will to fight corruption so the authorities and the citizens can see its results.
I think that the government should not abuse this fight.
If the government wants to fight corruption, it cannot do it without being in the same line with other independent institutions," Bushati said.
Business Roundup

(Various sources -- 26/03/04 - 02/04/04)
At a roundtable organised by the Chamber of Commerce, Macedonia's power utility ESM said that it sees a capacity for building about 400 small hydropower plants in Macedonia.
According to experts, these could meet up to 92 per cent of the domestic demand for electricity.
Currently, there are only 22 small hydro facilities operating in the country.
A review of business and economic news from the Balkans since 26 March:
Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) obtained its first credit rating -- B3 with a positive outlook -- from the international rating agency Moody's on 29 March.
This is regarded as clear recognition of the country's progress since the war.
Moody's said it expected an upgrade of the rating in the next six to 18 months, but stressed the timing depends on the pace of economic reforms.
Bulgaria's contributions to the NATO budget in 2004 will total 2.2m euros, according to Finance Minister Milen Velchev.
The figure breaks down as follows: 410,000 euros for the civil budget, 1.34m euros for the military budget and 470,000 euros for the NATO Security Investment Programme.
Velchev said the country's annual contributions to the Alliance would grow to 3.38m euros in 2005 and 3.82m euros in 2006.
Turkey's GNP rose by 5.9 per cent in 2003, according to data released by the State Institute of Statistics. In 2003 Turkey's GNP totalled 220.45 billion euros.
Employees of Macedonia's railway system suspended their general strike after reaching agreement with the government.
The cabinet has pledged that downsizing measures will only take place after all issues related to redundancy payments have been settled.
Italy's Banca Intesa is expected to purchase a 40.05 per cent state in Turkey's Garanti Bank for 1.91 billion euros, a participant in partnership talks said on 30 March.
Banca Intesa will have the option of purchasing an additional 9.96 per cent share later.
The World Bank gave a green light to the Integrated Water and Ecosystems Management Project for Albania, which aims to upgrade the municipal waste water systems in the coastal cities of Durres, Saranda, and Lezha.
The Bank will provide $4.9m for the project; an additional $15.1m will come from the European Investment Bank and the project beneficiaries.
In other news, the World Bank and the Italian government said they had approved a 5.3m-euro grant for protection of the fishing sector in Shkoder Lake.
Tehno-pek, a private company in Bosnia and Herzegovina, opened a new forage production plant in the town of Bihac on 31 March. The Dutch government is assisting the 800,000-euro investment project.
The German company Praktiker will invest 50m euros in a chain of seven hypermarkets in Bulgaria over the next three years.
Company representatives outlined the plans during a meeting with Economy Minister Lydia Shuleva.
The Bulgarian-American Investment Fund is financing the project.
Romanian Capital Advisers, the company managing the Romanian-American Enterprise Fund, said it planned to launch a new 50m-euro investment fund this year.
The fund will initially invest in Romania and Bulgaria and then gradually expand into the rest of the Balkans.
Bulgaria's Olympic prospects
Bulgaria has won a total of 213 Olympic medals, almost all of them in the summer games held since the end of World War II.

Scores of Bulgarians joined officials at a July 20th ceremony in downtown Sofia to wish their Olympic team good luck.
"We hope to hear Bulgaria's national anthem all over the world," Prime Minister Sergei Stanishev said.
Among the officials attending the ceremony was Bulgarian Olympics Committee (BOC) Chairwoman Stefka Kostadinova, whose 2.09m world record in the women's high jump has remained unbroken since 1987.
She said self-confidence and a strong will to fight to the end are the keys to winning the title in a sport.
Bulgaria was among the 14 countries participating in the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896 and has won a total of 207 medals in summer games.
Its biggest success was in the Moscow 1980 Olympics, when it finished third with a total of 41 medals, including eight gold.
Bulgaria, however, took away only 12 medals from the Athens Olympics in 2004.
Maria Grozdeva is among the 73 Bulgarian athletes who will participate in 15 different events at the Beijing Games and is widely viewed as one of the possible medalists. She competes in the 25m pistol and the 10m air pistol events and is the only Bulgarian contestant with five medals from four Olympiads.
Another Bulgarian shooter, Tanyu Kiryakov, won gold in the 10m air pistol men's event in Seoul and Sydney.
Bulgaria's Olympic team includes 20 track-and-field athletes, among them Ivet Lalova and Tezdjan Naimova, both competing in the 100m and 200m dashes. Lalova, whose personal best in the 100m sprint is 10.77 seconds, finished fourth in Athens.
Naimova will make her Olympics debut this year.
Bulgaria is pinning medal hopes on its 13 wrestlers, including Stanka Zlateva and Yavor Yanakiev, respective female and male titlists at the 2007 World Championship in Baku.
Bulgarians also have high hopes that their men's volleyball team will be able to win a medal in Beijing.
Matei Kaziiski of the volleyball team, which returns to the Olympics after a 12-year break, believes he and his colleagues have "the strength to become champions".
Rhythmic gymnastics is another sport that could bring medals to Bulgaria, particularly in the team event.
The country's ensemble won the silver in Atlanta in 1996 and the bronze in Athens in 2004.
Other Olympic medalists on the team include Yordan Yovchev, competing in artistic gymnastics, and rower Rumiana Neikova, who won the silver in skiff at Sydney in 2000.
Bulgaria was supposed to participate in 16 sports in Beijing, but 11 weightlifters tested positive for steroids in June, forcing the country to withdraw its male and female lifters.
Serbian officials protest reconfiguration of UNMIK, but are ready to negotiate
Serbia's foreign minister and minister for Kosovo relayed their objections to reshaping the UN mission to Kosovo, which Serbia still regards as part of its territory.

New UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier was in Belgrade on Wednesday (July 23rd).
During the visit, his first since assuming the post, Serbian officials conveyed their dissatisfaction with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's decision to begin reconfiguring UNMIK without the Security Council's consent.
Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic and Minister for Kosovo and Metohija Goran Bogdanovic met with Zannier.
They agreed to go forward with negotiations between Serbia and UNMIK on reshaping the international presence in Kosovo, as Ban has proposed.
But the Serbian officials reiterated Belgrade's position that any takeover by the EU's EULEX mission of UNMIK duties must abide by Security Council Resolution 1244 and gain the approval of the council, where Belgrade enjoys strong support from permanent members Russia and China.
Last year, Security Council members were unable to agree on a "supervised independence" plan put forward by former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari.
Kosovo authorities, who declared independence unilaterally earlier this year, continue to use the plan as the basis for going forward, but Belgrade insists it cannot be implemented without council approval.
Serbia has ruled out any recognition of Kosovo's move, while also demanding that the authorities in Pristina ensure protection of the Serb minority's rights.
According to the Serbian foreign ministry, Zannier said UNMIK wishes to preserve peace and stability in Kosovo and that UNMIK will maintain its neutrality towards the status of Kosovo.
The conferees also agreed on the "urgent" need to discuss problems in the judiciary and police in Kosovo; hence, those issues will be reviewed "as soon as possible".
"There will be no confirmation by the Security Council of anything that is not completely acceptable to Belgrade," Jeremic said later on Belgrade's Pink TV.
He added that he received assurances of this stance during his recent visit to Russia, which has been a pro-Serbia voice in the UN.
Officials in Pristina played down the importance of Zannier's talks in Belgrade and said that any decisions concerning Kosovo would need their consent.
Kosovo Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci said Zannier's visit to Belgrade could be only "routine".
"We expect no significant changes or different approaches, but it must be said that two things are clear -- one, that only Kosovo and its officials can speak for Kosovo, and two, that status and political issues cannot be discussed. Those are closed issues," Kuci told the Pristina daily Zeri.
Bombings in Istanbul kill 17, wound dozens
Two bombs killed 17 and injured more than 150 on an Istanbul street Sunday evening.
Turkish officials are focusing their investigations on the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party.

Two co-ordinated bombs exploded on a crowded Istanbul street Sunday (July 27th), killing at least 17 people, five of them children, and wounding more than 150.
Sunday night's bombing targeted civilians in the crowded Gungoren district of Istanbul.
At the time of the explosion, pedestrians filled the street.
According to eyewitnesses, the first device was a small percussion bomb. A second bomb exploded 50m away, causing casualties among the crowd that had gathered around the site of the first explosion.
Experts consider such timing a common terrorist tactic.
No group immediately claimed responsibility, but security officials are focusing their investigations on the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has been pounded by an intensified Turkish air and ground offensive.
Istanbul Governor Muammer Guler told reporters Monday that the investigation was focusing on the PKK.
But journalist Namık Durukan of the daily Milliyet, who closely follows the activities of the PKK, said the bombings were not typical for the group.
Zubeyir Aydar of the PKK's successor organisation, Kongra Gel, denied in a statement any link to the attack, condemning violence against civilians
Turkish security officials suspect a young and more radical group operating under PKK auspices, Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (TAK), or another new radical group could be culpable.
In 2006, TAK took responsibility for attacks on civilians in Istanbul and Antalya.
Turkish press reports late last year quoted security officials who warned that TAK had received orders from the PKK to launch sensational blind-terror attacks inside Turkey.
The warning at that time said the group aimed to foment a Turkish-Kurdish civil war by striking at civilian targets as well as at prominent public figures.
Turkish police detained a PKK member with 3.5kg of A-4 explosive late last year before he could detonate it inside an Istanbul subway station.
The United States designated TAK as a terrorist group linked to the PKK in January.
The US Embassy in Ankara strongly condemned Sunday's attack in Istanbul.
""There is no justification for the killing of innocent people.
We continue to support our ally, Turkey, in the fight against terrorism," the embassy said in a written statement.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan cancelled Monday's cabinet meeting and visited the Gungoren district, where he called for national unity in order to further isolate the terrorists.
He also criticised Turkish media for publishing graphic photos, which he said would aid terrorist propaganda.
"We have been fighting terror for 30 to 35 years. ...
This fight will continue until we win it," he said.
Serbia's ruling coalition to decide on government reshuffle
BELGRADE, Serbia -- Labour Minister Rasim Ljajic confirmed on Wednesday (January 5th) that any final decision regarding a government reshuffle will be made by the end of January.
In an interview with RTS, he said the decision lies with leaders of the ruling coalition.
No date for any meeting has been set yet, Ljajic added.
Several politicians have hinted of a reshuffle recently, citing the need to reduce state administration and govern more efficiently. (RTS, Tanjug - 05/01/11)
Serbia's Tadic calls for reconciliation among Balkan nations
Serbia's president visits Republika Srpska with a message for the entire region.

Calling for reconciliation among all Balkan countries, Serbian President Boris Tadic said on Saturday (January 9th) that the future of the region lies within the EU.
People throughout the Balkans, he said, should follow a policy of respect for different identities and national interests if any progress is to be made.
Tadic made his remarks during a visit to Banja Luka, the second largest city in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
He was there to commemorate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the Republika Srpska (RS), the Serb-run republic established after the Dayton Peace Agreement ended the three-year conflict in the area.
At the same time, the accords established the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH).
"I think that after the conflicts in the 1990s our peoples need reconciliation and that this hand of reconciliation can be established as a symbol of our joint future and as a shared value," said Tadic after the ceremony.
"I am convinced that only this kind of policy can lead us to a future membership in the EU together, under whose roof we will live as good neighbours and good friends."
Tadic again acknowledged the crimes committed by Serbian forces and individuals during the Balkan conflicts in the 1990s, and said he wanted to "send a message of peace to the entire region".
He added that he would be pleased to see other countries follow Belgrade's example and apologise for their own part in war crimes.
Speaking to Radio Television Republika Srpska (RTRS), Tadic said that the Serbian parliament must adopt a resolution condemning the 1995 massacre in Srebrenica, where up to 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were methodically executed.
This would not only meet Serbia's obligation to the UN war crimes tribunal, but allow the country to defend its own victims.
A country that recognises the suffering of others and respects other nations' victims, he said, can gain credibility for its national policies on the international stage.
Tadic was quoted by the Belgrade-based B92 media outlet.
His call for a resolution on Srebrenica is supported in principle by Serbian opposition parties, according to Belgrade-based daily newspaper Blic.
Whether it will pass parliament or not, the paper noted, depends on the wording of the document.
Voicing support for the geographical and political integrity of the FBiH, Tadic stressed that his country will not interfere in its neighbour's internal affairs.
"I think that everyone needs to contribute to lowering political tensions in Bosnia and Herzegovina," Serbia's Beta news agency quoted Tadic as saying. "Serbia will never do anything to destabilise Bosnia."

Croatia's Mesic visits Pristina
Croatian President Stipe Mesic asks Serbia to stop encouraging Kosovo Serbs to boycott state institutions and elections.

Outgoing Croatian President Stipe Mesic is asking Serbia to stop fostering "unrealistic dreams" that the breakaway state of Kosovo will return to Serbian control.
In a visit to Pristina on Friday (January 8th) -- where he met with President Fatmir Sejdiu -- Mesic said it would "be good to stop stirring up unrealistic dreams".
In short, Kosovo's independence will not be reversed.
He also urged Belgrade to stop calling on the Serb minority in Kosovo -- which declared independence from Serbia in February of 2008 -- to boycott state institutions and elections.
"It would be good to stop suggesting [that] Kosovo citizens of Serb nationality refuse co-operation, and in that way, deprive themselves of the right to decide the way they live," Mesic said in a speech to parliament. "The recognition of the independent Kosovo was not an act against anyone but the recognition of the political reality in the region."
During his visit, the last before President-elect Ivo Josipovic takes office, Mesic stressed his goal to strengthen relations between the two countries while promoting stability throughout the region.
Mesic pointed to work that needs to be done in building democracy while fighting corruption and organised crime.
In Pristina, Sejdiu awarded Mesic the Golden Medal of Independence, given to those who have made a special contribution to the freedom and the independence of Kosovo.
Sejdiu said the Croatian president has been, and remains, a friend of Kosovo.
"I have had the special privilege to have President Mesic as a personal friend and closely co-operate with him in a very important period for our country," said Sejdiu. "That's why, in this solemn occassion, I want to express my appreciation and the appreciation of the people of the Republic of Kosovo."
Croatia recognised the independence of Kosovo on March 19th 2008, about a month after the nation declared itself independent of Serbia.
The acknowledgement threw Croatia's relations with Serbia into turmoil.

Ten East European Countries Back US Position on Iraq
Following US Secretary of State Colin Powell's presentation before the UN Security Council, ten East European countries -- once members of the communist bloc -- declared unequivocal support for Washington's stand on Iraq.
(International Herald Tribune, Electronic Telegraph, Times Online, CNN, AFP - 06/02/03; AP, Reuters, BBC, UN News Service - 05/02/03)
Ten East European countries issued a strongly worded statement following US Secretary of State Colin Powell's presentation before the UN Security Council on Wednesday (5 February).
The countries, known as the Vilnius Group, voiced unequivocal support for the US stand on Iraq and called for an adequate response to the threat the Baghdad regime poses to international peace and security.
In its statement, the group -- consisting of Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia -- said Powell had presented "compelling evidence" of Iraq's efforts to hide its arsenal of weapons of mass destruction and deceive UN arms inspectors, and of its links to international terrorism.
"Our countries understand the dangers posed by tyranny and the special responsibility of democracies to defend our shared values.
The trans-Atlantic community, of which we are a part, must stand together to face the threat posed by the nexus of terrorism and dictators with weapons of mass destruction," the former communist states said.
Seven of the signatories have already been invited to join NATO, while Albania, Croatia and Macedonia are hoping for an invitation.
The ten countries said they had thus far supported all efforts for a peaceful solution to the Iraqi crisis, but were now convinced that Baghdad was in "material breach" of Security Council Resolution 1441 and were ready to participate in international actions to ensure Iraq meets its obligations.
"The clear and present danger posed by Saddam Hussein's regime requires a united response from the community of democracies.
We call upon the UN Security Council to take the necessary and appropriate action in response to Iraq's continuing threat to international peace and security," the declaration said.
In a speech following Powell's presentation, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Solomon Passy said that Iraq should either comply with the resolution by 14 February, when the UN inspectors are due to brief the council again, or be forced to do so.
Bulgaria is the only Vilnius Group member currently sitting on the Security Council.
Although the ten countries have only a limited ability to contribute significantly to possible military action, the support they are likely to provide could include medical staff, anti-mine units and chemical protection gear.
Bulgaria and Romania have promised logistical support and use of their airspace.
Macedonian television reported Wednesday that Skopje is ready to join the US-led coalition.
The Vilnius Group's statement follows a similar initiative by eight other European countries.
Last week, EU members Britain, Denmark, Italy, Portugal and Spain -- along with EU invitees Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic -- published a letter expressing their support for Washington's stand on Iraq.
With the Netherlands also considered a staunch supporter, the number of European states now backing a military response has reached 19.
In Turkey, meanwhile, Prime Minister Abdullah Gul officially pledged support.
He told reporters Wednesday that there was nothing more his government could do to achieve a peaceful solution to the Iraq crisis. "We believe that in line with our national interests, we should act together with our strategic ally, the United States," he said.
Business: Albania's economic performance under review
IMF completes the first review of Albania's economic performance.
Also in business news: the EBRD extends a 50m-euro loan to Croatia, Serbia plans to put 440m euros into upgrading Belgrade and Kazakhstan eyes investment opportunities in Bulgaria.
"Albania's macroeconomic performance over the past year has been good, with strong growth, large inward remittances, and a significant reduction in poverty," said IMF First Deputy Managing Director Anne Krueger. [Getty Images]
The IMF board completed the first review of Albania's performance under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility arrangement and the Extended Fund Facility arrangement, which together total $24.7m.
According to the Fund, Albania's macroeconomic performance was good, but the government must step up structural reforms to ensure economic growth and attract high quality investments.
Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation will acquire a 56.5 per cent stake of the Turkish television channel TGRT TV.
The price reportedly amounts to 66m euros.
The EBRD said it will extend a 50m-euro loan to Croatia for modernisation of the Zagreb-Rijeka motorway.
The project, to be implemented by the company ARZ, seeks to improve access to Croatia's coastline and boost trade and tourism.
Kazakhstan is eyeing the investment opportunities offered by the Bulgarian energy sector.
According to Kazakh Prime Minister Daniyal Akhmetov, the country is particularly interested in the possibility of building oil refineries in Bulgaria.
Production would then be exported to the EU.
The F ederation of BiH (FBiH) Parliament's House of Peoples adopted amendments to the entity law on privatisation.
The changes suggested by the FBiH government would speed up the process and enable the sale of the "healthy" parts of troubled FBiH companies that cannot be sold as a whole.
Under a National Investment Plan presented in Serbia, some 440m euros will be invested in the development and upgrade of Belgrade's infrastructure over the next 18 months.
Loans from international financial institutions will provide 207m euros of the sum, while about 220m euros will come from privatisation revenues.
France's Credit Agricole, the only candidate in the tender for privatisation of the Greek government's 40 per cent stake in Emporiki Bank, presented on 26 July its improved, final offer.
According to Economy and Finance Minister Giorgos Alogoskoufis, Credit Agricole is now offering 3.3 billion euros for the stake, up from the initially suggested 3.1 billion euros.
A decision by Greek government is expected next week.

Serbian government divided over information bill
The new Public Information Bill has created a rift within the government, prompting one opposition party, the Serbian Progressive Party, to call for early elections.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 03/08/09
"Excessive fines can discourage investigative journalism and lead to auto-censorship and the closing down of some media companies," SEEMO said. [Getty Images]
The proposed Public Information Bill has caused a serious division within the ruling coalition, as the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), the third strongest coalition member, says it will not support it.
The biggest members of the ruling coalition -- the Democratic Party (DS) and G17 Plus -- believe the bill should be passed for the sake of introducing order in the Serbian media.
G17 Plus leader Deputy Prime Minister Mladjan Dinkic is often the target of local tabloids.
However, journalist associations across the country have spoken out against the bill, claiming it is not in line with European standards and that, if passed, officials will put pressure on journalists.
The South East Europe Media Organisation (SEEMO) said in a statement that a certain level of media regulation is necessary, but "excessive fines can discourage investigative journalism and lead to auto-censorship and the closing down of some media companies."
The bill was scheduled to be put before parliament on July 31st, but the date was pushed back when it became clear the SPS staunchly opposed it.
G17 Plus accused SPS leader and Deputy Prime Minister Ivica Dacic of sparking a government crisis.
"The government can only be toppled by Socialist Party leader Ivica Dacic with his unfair and hypocritical behaviour.
By undermining the adoption of a government bill and delaying the adoption of other, equally important, laws, Dacic has caused a potential crisis within the ruling coalition," G17 Plus said in a press release.
In an alleged attempt to sway the Socialist Party, the DS organised a meeting with the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has the same number of MPs as the SPS, and can replace it in the ruling coalition.
At the meeting, the DS, G17 Plus and LDP agreed to reach an agreement with journalist associations and European institutions by the end of the month.
"The Information Bill cannot jeopardise the Serbian government and the long-term partnership of the Socialist Party of Serbia and the Democratic Party," said SPS Vice -resident Zarko Obradovic.
EU-Russia summit jeopardised
With tension still high between Estonia and Russia, a summit scheduled for later this month may have to be put on ice.
(DPA, Euronews, New York Times, Washington Post, The Guardian, The Times, UPI - 03/05/07; AFP, AP, Reuters, BBC, FT, International Herald Tribune, RFE/RL, Euobserver, Stratfor, US Department of State - 02/05/07)

The almost weeklong quarrel between Estonia and Russia escalated on Wednesday (May 2nd), when pro-Kremlin youth activists attacked the Baltic country’s embassy and envoy to Moscow.
Estonian Ambassador Marina Kaljurand's bodyguards had to spray gas to protect her from assailants at a press conference she called to protest the lack of security around her country's embassy.
Estonia's diplomatic mission in Moscow has been besieged by members of the Russian youth organisation "Nashi" (Ours) and other groups since late last week.
Earlier Wednesday, demonstrators tried to prevent Kaljurand from leaving the embassy.
The same day, Swedish Ambassador Johan Molander came under attack on his way out of the building.
Demonstrators kicked his car and tore the Swedish flag off the vehicle, keeping him blockaded for some 15 minutes.
Expressing "grave concern" over Wednesday's incidents, Germany, which currently holds the Union's rotating presidency, urged Russia to meet its obligations under the Vienna Convention on the immunity of diplomatic staff and ensure proper security.
Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves sent a message urging Russian authorities to "remain civilised".
The Estonian consular service, which has already stopped issuing visas to Russians, was closed Wednesday for safety reasons.
Estonia has also begun evacuating the families of its diplomats in Moscow.
The tension began last week, after Estonia relocated a war memorial statue erected in 1947 and the remains of several Russian soldiers from Tallinn's centre to a military cemetery outside the capital.
The move sparked riots by ethnic Russians, who account for about a quarter of Estonia's population of 1.3 million people.
Dozens of protesters were injured, one person was killed and hundreds were arrested.
Tallinn has blamed Moscow for organising and sponsoring the riots.
Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet said in a statement Tuesday that the issue of the relocation of the Bronze Soldier statue and the vandalism that followed were internal matters, while "the co-ordinated activity of Russia against Estonia is a matter for the whole EU".
Cyber attacks against Estonian government websites have been launched from IP addresses registered to the Kremlin, he also claimed.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mikhail Kamynin says his country will meet its obligations, but he blamed Estonia for the rising tension.
"Passions have been brought to the boil and we believe the blame for that rests entirely with the Estonian side," he said on Wednesday.
The same day, Russia's state-owned railway company suddenly stopped oil deliveries to Estonian ports, attributing the move to railway repairs and a shortage of wagons.
Estonian ports, according to the Financial Times , handle about 25% of oil shipments from Russia to world markets.
Coal exports also may be disrupted.
The developments sparked calls during a Wednesday meeting of EU ambassadors in Brussels for the postponement of an EU-Russia summit, scheduled for May 18th.
"We are not excluding it" EUobserver quoted Eduards Stiprais, the Latvian ambassador to the EU, as saying after the meeting. "It depends on the Russian reaction."
Senior NATO and US officials have voiced concerns about the escalating crisis.
The Estonian president's office said Ilves had spoken by telephone with NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, who "condemned the anti-Estonian propaganda campaign initiated by Russia, as well as the interference of the Russian Federation in Estonia's internal affairs".
US State Department deputy spokesman Tom Casey expressed Washington's concerns "about continuing reports of violence and harassment, including harassment of Estonian diplomatic personnel and premises in Moscow".
He called on Moscow to observe its obligations regarding diplomatic missions and diplomats, and "avoid harsh words and escalation".

Republika Srpska cabinet under pressure from opposition
Following the defection of a coalition member and the rejection of the proposed budget for 2006, the outlook for the Serb Democratic Party-led cabinet looks dim.
By Vlatko Vukotic for Southeast European Times in Banja Luka – 09/01/06
"Do not expect the government to resign after these results.
That would be an irresponsible move that would help those who have made this crisis", said Prime Minister Pero Bukejlovic. [AFP]
Dragan Cavic, the president of Bosnia and Herzegovina's Serb entity, has insisted he will not withdraw the government's mandate despite its loss of parliamentary support.
Cavic, who heads the ruling Serb Democratic Party (SDS), also warned that his party would not participate in a new cabinet if the current one is removed.
The Republika Srpska (RS) government has been on shaky ground since the decision by the Party of Democratic Progress (PDP) -- led by Bosnian Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic -- to leave the ruling coalition and go into opposition ahead of autumn elections.
Following the rejection of its proposed budget for 2006, the SDS-led cabinet no longer appears to have enough strength to stay in power.
Nevertheless, Prime Minister Pero Bukejlovic has refused to resign, insisting that the budget impasse is the result of his fight against corruption.
"Do not expect the government to resign after these results.
That would be an irresponsible move that would help those who have made this crisis," Bukejlovic said.
The government, the entity's 10th since its formation, was elected 11 months ago.
It is composed of ministers from SDS and individual representatives of the Bosniak and Croatian communities.
Nine PDP parliament members had also supported Bukejlovic's cabinet.
Although the party did not have any ministers, it was given significant positions in public companies.
RS's strongest opposition party is the Union of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD).
Its leader, Milorad Dodik, has said a motion against the cabinet is imminent.
"We have enough votes to replace the current government and I expect that the new government will be elected by the end of this month," Dodik said.
Some analysts have argued that the political crisis was created ahead of the elections so that the cards could be dealt, in effect, before the vote.
Polls suggest that the SNSD stands a strong chance of gaining the mandate for a new government, provided it can obtain the support of PDP and several independent MPs who used to support Bukejlovic.
As a result of the budget impasse, RS institutions are now being financed according to the Resolution on Temporary Financing -- which is actually a copy of last year's budget.
Some 540m euros were planned for this year's budget, an increase of 9 per cent over last year.
Six years on, most Ohrid Accord provisions are met
Decentralisation and a double majority requirement for some legislation are among the key results of the August 2001 deal that ended interethnic fighting.

This month, Macedonia marked the sixth anniversary of the Ohrid Framework Agreement. Signed on August 13th, 2001, it put an end to several months of armed conflict in the country. It has since become an instrumental part of Macedonia's Euro-Atlantic integration process.
The accord led to constitutional changes introducing the so-called Badinter Principle.
Under it, certain types of legislation must win the approval of MPs representing minority communities in order to be adopted.
A parliamentary panel known as the Committee for Relations among Communities has been established.
Under constitutional amendments, the role of Ombudsman also has been broadened.
He now oversees implementation of the principle of adequate and just representation of small ethnic communities.
The single most important result of the agreement, however, was a new law on territorial reorganisation, which launched a two-year decentralisation process.
Marking the anniversary of the accord, US Ambassador Gillian Milovanovich said Macedonia has made significant progress since 2001.
"There is a political stability in the Republic of Macedonia. You had a fair and democratic election in 2006 and any ethnic community can take part freely in the democratic life of the country," she said.
Professor Ljubomir Frckovski, who helped draft the Agreement, says it has largely been implemented.
"A law on territorial division has been adopted.
It was a precondition for decentralisation that has now been implemented successfully.
The implementation of the principle of adequate and just representation was also successful," Frckovski said.
Vlado Popovski, also involved in drafting the accord, believes about 70% of the requirements have been implemented.
"A law on the use of flags has been adopted and large steps have been made in the part (regarding) just representation of almost every community except the Roma community.
The Agreement will be completely fulfilled with the adoption of a general law on use of languages," Popovski said.
Last year, President Branko Crvenkovski organised an official ceremony to mark the fifth anniversary.
By contrast, this year only the largest ethnic Albanian party, the Democratic Union of Integration, has organised an official celebration.
The president's office has announced plans for a roundtable discussion on the direction Macedonia has been taking since the signing of the Ohrid Agreement.
The roundtable will be held on August 30th, as part of a series of debates on the future of Macedonia.
Erdogan to Turkish army: stay out of politics
All institutions should act in line with their constitutional mandate, Turkey's prime minister said on Monday.

In the midst of a presidential election that is expected to be won by the ruling Justice and Development Party's (AKP) candidate, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has warned the country's military to stay out of politics.
"All institutions should act in line with the mandate they are given by the constitution," he said in an interview aired on Turkey's Kanal D, late on Monday (August 20th). "If we believe in democracy, we should not involve the Turkish armed forces in politics.
For us, the armed forces are sacred ...
They have their own place and politicians have another place in democracy."
The army has toppled four governments since 1960.
In recent months, it has voiced objections to the AKP's presidential candidate, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, because of his roots in political Islam.
Gul was first nominated in April, triggering a crisis that forced the government to call early parliamentary elections.
The AKP won those elections handily.
Claiming a popular mandate, it then decided to renominate Gul, whose earlier bid ran aground amid an opposition boycott.
On Monday, parliament began the presidential election process anew.
In the first-round vote, Gul won the support of 341 MPs, but fell short of the two-thirds majority required for outright victory.
The same rule applies to the second round, scheduled for Friday.
In the third and fourth rounds, however, a simple majority will suffice.
Most analysts expect Gul will be elected during the third round, on Monday.
In the first ballot, the other two presidential contenders -- Sebahattin Cakmakoglu of the Nationalist Action Party and Tayfun Icli of the Democratic Left Party -- finished well behind Gul, with 70 and 13 votes, respectively.
Seeking to allay the suspicions of Turkey's military and the secular elite, Erdogan and other AKP leaders have repeatedly pledged their commitment to secularism and democracy.
"If I am elected, the constitution will be my guide," Gul said following his renomination. "Protection of secularism is one of my basic principles.
Nobody should worry about this."
In his interview with Kanal D, Erdogan said that Gul's ties with the AKP will end with his election to the presidency.
"Once Mr. Gul is elected, his link with our party would be over," the AFP quoted the prime minister as saying. "From that moment on, he will be the president of the Turkish Republic."
The military has made no specific comments on Gul's fresh bid for the presidency.
However, Chief of General Staff General Yasar Buyukanit said last month that the person who takes the post must be secular not only in words but also in deeds.
On Tuesday, he denied press reports suggesting that he had held secret talks with Gul.
He said the army would never resort to bargaining on any issue.
"There are efforts to mislead the public through completely fictitious reports that the chief of staff met with certain politicians and reached an agreement," a statement posted on the general's website read.
"The chief of staff has no secret schedule and he holds all his meetings in line with the established traditions of the state."
Senior US Diplomat Visits Kosovo, Serbia
US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Marc Grossman is visiting Belgrade on Tuesday (30 March) after consultations with international and local officials in Kosovo.

"What comes next is to see what steps should be taken," US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Marc Grossman said Monday (29 March) in Pristina. [Laura Hasani]
US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Marc Grossman visits Belgrade Tuesday (30 March) after a day of consultations with international and local officials in Kosovo.
He is scheduled to meet with Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and other top officials.
Grossman's visit, the US Embassy in Belgrade said in a statement, "underscores the continuing commitment of the United States to Serbia-Montenegro as a partner for regional stability and its integration into the Euro-Atlantic community".
The situation in Kosovo and other issues of regional and bilateral importance are expected to be on the agenda.
Condemning the recent violence in Kosovo, Grossman said such developments were unacceptable and should not be repeated.
"What comes next is to see what steps should be taken," Belgrade-based Radio B92 quoted him as saying Monday after talks with UNMIK chief Harri Holkeri in Pristina.
The clashes between the province's Albanian and Serbian communities, which erupted on 17 March, left 28 dead and hundreds injured.
Grossman met with Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi, Parliament Speaker Nexhat Daci and other key Albanian politicians.
He also heard the complaints of the province's Serb minority.
Representatives of the Serb Return coalition requested that those behind the riots be brought to justice.
"His [Grossman's] promise that the culprits and organisers would be punished, together with all those who tried to make political mileage out of this, gives us some hope," said Serb leader Oliver Ivanovic.
Reiterating the international community's continued commitment to the policy of "standards before status" concerning Kosovo, the US diplomat said that the standards would soon be redefined to include new aspects, such as decentralisation and provisions to ensure the physical and legal safety of all people living in Kosovo.
"Decentralisation will soon find its way and then we'll get at least some kind of self-government in which Serbs can find a place for themselves and some kind of protections," said Grossman.
He says Holkeri plans to present next week a new strategy for meeting the standards set by the international community.
This would provide clear and transparent standards that can be assessed in 2005, Grossman said. He emphasised that the province's unresolved status cannot justify acts of violence, which only made the task "much harder".
His trip to Belgrade coincides with the visit of top foreign affairs officials from three of the six countries in the Contact Group for the former Yugoslavia.
Any resolution of the situation in Kosovo will need a go-ahead from the Contact Group, which includes the United States.
French, German and Italian representatives arrived on a two-day mission to Belgrade on Monday to discuss the situation in Kosovo with Serbian political leaders.
Grossman's visit also comes a day before Wednesday's deadline for US Secretary of State Colin Powell to certify before Congress that Serbia has co-operated with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
Lack of compliance could deprive Serbia of much needed US financial assistance, worth about 83m euros.
"We are talking to them about co-operation with the tribunal and we'll just have to see where we are when that moment comes," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said.

The Serbian government will prepare a new set of measures to mitigate the effects of the global economic crisis, Economy Minister Mladjan Dinkic said on Wednesday (February 25th).
Dinkic added that the government is mulling ways to help money-losing companies.
He also said an anti-crisis package approved by Belgrade last month is already helping.
The Romanian carmaker Dacia announced on Monday (February 23rd) it would begin marketing a new, cheaper Logan model.
It will cost 5,900 euros, which is 500 euros less than the MCV Logan, currently its cheapest Logan.
The global economic crisis and poor sales in January prompted Dacia's decision.
The German city of Essen will host the Turkish-German Economy Fair "EXPO Turkey 2009" from May 22nd to 24th, the Anadolu news agency reported on February 19th.
The fair will bring together Turkish entrepreneurs operating in different European countries.
Nearly 300 companies have so far confirmed their participation in the event.
Bulgaria and Romania agreed to build a gas pipeline connecting the Bulgarian city of Ruse and Romania's Giurgiu, Sofia news agency reported on February 19th.
Bulgaria's Bulgartransgaz and Romanian's Transgaz will jointly implement the project.
The two companies are seeking partial financing from the EU.
The Albanian economy can improve, but it can also stagnate or decline as a result of the global crisis, Gerwin Bell, former head of the IMF's office in Albania, warned on Tuesday (February 24th) during a visit to Tirana.
The country is at risk of currency devaluation and may also experience higher unemployment in 2009, Bell said.
The registered unemployment rate in Croatia reached 14.5% in January, according to preliminary figures the country's statistical bureau published on February 20th.
It soared from 13.7% in December 2008, marking the largest monthly increase since the beginning of 2002.
Macedonia signed financial agreements worth 40m euros with the EU on Tuesday (February 24th).
Deputy Prime Minister Ivica Bocevski said that the move is evidence that Macedonia has the expertise and capability to manage EU funds on its own.
The funds will finance institutional reforms and the implementation of European standards in various areas.

NATO chief wants Macedonia to join Alliance
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer visited Skopje on Monday for a briefing by the government.
Its highest-level officials stressed that Macedonia would remain in the negotiation process.

NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer was in Skopje on Monday (April 21st) to meet with President Branko Crvenkovski, Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki and Defence Minister Lazar Elenovski.
"My personal ambition is to see your country in NATO.
I believe that Euro-Atlantic integration is a key for stability of this region," de Hoop Scheffer said during the meeting, nearly three weeks after the country failed to win an invitation to join the Alliance at the summit in Bucharest.
He says he wants to focus on resolving the name dispute between Macedonia and Greece -- the hurdle Skopje must overcome before joining NATO.
"You can do two things -- look back in anger or look forward. I would like that on July 9th, when Albania and Croatia sign the accession protocol with NATO, we have a third nation -- yours," de Hoop Scheffer told officials.
NATO does not have a direct role in the process, which the UN is monitoring.
"I cannot be instrumental in that process, but I will help if I can," he added.
He expressed hope that the early parliamentary elections scheduled for June 1st would be free and fair and that the negotiations over the country's name would resume soon afterward.
Crvenkovski asked de Hoop Scheffer to convey to Brussels that Macedonia remains dedicated to becoming a full member of the Alliance as soon as possible, which he described as important to stability and the region.
But the president also said that Macedonia is not willing to do it at the expense of possible destabilisation.
Crvenkovski also stressed that despite early elections, Macedonia would continue the negotiations on the name issue.
De Hoop Scheffer also met with Gruevski, who said that Macedonia would remain an active and constructive participant in negotiations, according to government spokesman Ivica Bocevski.
He added that the government, on the name issue, would draw clear lines on national identity and the integrity of Macedonia.
EU intends to seal pact with Serbia before May elections
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn indicated on Monday that Brussels wants to sign a key accord with Serbia before the country's May elections, but Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica re-iterated his opposition.

The EU is planning to sign a major pre-accession pact with Serbia before its May 11th elections in order to keep the country proceeding towards Union membership, a top Brussels official said on Monday (April 21st).
"We don't want Serbia to give up its European integration," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn told the German daily Die Welt. "The Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) would be a strong signal that the European Union is committed to Serbia's European future."
The accord, which carries economic and trade benefits for nations hoping to join the bloc, would put Serbia closer to formal recognition of its candidacy and then to membership talks.
As both sides initialled the SAA last November, EU officials told Belgrade that full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) remains key.
The Hague court is pressuring Serbia to hand over four fugitives, including former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander, Ratko Mladic.
Nonetheless, most EU members advocate offering Serbia the SAA ahead of the May elections to strengthen its pro-European forces and to prevent nationalist parties, benefiting from discontent over Kosovo independence, from winning.
Early parliamentary elections were called after the coalition government collapsed last month.
It was split over whether Serbia should pursue closer EU ties following the recognition of Kosovo independence by the majority of EU members.
A recent survey indicated that the upcoming vote will be neck and neck.
President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party (DS) and the ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS) are each polling about 35%.
The DS supports signing the SAA, while the SRS and other nationalist parties, including outgoing Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia, view signing as tantamount to recognising Kosovo's independence.
That said, both sides could still seal the deal as early as April 29th during a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg.
However, Belgium and the Netherlands particularly resist signing the SAA as long as the fugitives remain free.
Citing sources in Brussels, Reuters suggested on Monday that the Dutch might accept the accord's conclusion now, if ultimate ratification depends on handing the men over later.
Kostunica, however, re-iterated his opposition, saying the pact undercuts Serbia's interests.
"Olli Rehn supports Kosovo's unilateral independence and supports signing the agreement," he said. "It is obviously not in Serbia's .. interest to sign an agreement that would tomorrow be interpreted as Serbia's signing off on an independent Kosovo."
Before a two-day visit to Belgrade, EU Regional Aid Commissioner Danuta Huebner warned on Monday that, without a signing, Serbia risks losing some of the 1 billion euros in aid the bloc has allocated until 2013.
Turkey's blocking of websites raises doubts about freedom of expression
Turkey has banned prominent British academic and evolutionist Richard Dawkins' website, the latest of hundreds of controversial internet bans that undermine freedom of expression in the EU candidate country.
By Ayhan Simsek for Southeast European Times -- 01/10/08

An Istanbul court ordered a ban on Turkish access to British author Richard Dawkins' site (www.richarddawkins.net) after controversial Islamist and creationist Adnan Oktar claimed the site libelled his character.
Oktar and his shadowy, well-funded group have been leading campaigners against Darwinism, publishing and distributing thousands of books for free, in Turkey and in more than 50 other countries.
Oktar's book Atlas of Creation received rough treatment on Dawkins' website, where the British academic pointed out errors in its content and attacked Oktar for manipulating facts.
"I am at a loss to reconcile the expensive and glossy production values of this book with the 'breathtaking inanity' of the content," the scientist wrote in July.
While Oktar and his followers won their legal case against Dawkins' website, they failed to ban his prominent book, The God Delusion.
The same Istanbul court that blocked his site last month upheld circulation of his book last April, citing freedom of expression.
Dawkins' website is not the only victim of the legal campaign by Oktar's group against Darwinist or atheist sites.
Oktar and his followers, exploiting loopholes in Turkish law, managed earlier to obtain temporary bans on leading internet sites, including Google Groups and WordPress blogs, citing alleged insults to Islamist authors.
Authorities have blocked access to Turkish evolutionist websites such as ateizm.org as well.
In late September, they also banned the website of a major trade union, the Union of Turkish Educators (Egitim Sen), for publishing criticism 19 months ago of Atlas of Creation.
The controversial Oktar received a three-year prison sentence last May for founding an illegal organisation for personal gain and with criminal intent.
He remains free on appeal.
His group's considerable financial backing is mysterious, and the Turkish press often accuses it of secretive, cult-like practices and financial exploitation of its followers.
Turkish media have reacted with outrage to the vaguely justified internet bans.
"Take your hands off our internet," the leftist daily Radikal headlined on Tuesday.
The daily denounced the blocking of the websites and emphasised that most of the bans did not even result from court rulings, rather from decrees by the country's Telecommunications Directorate.
Turkey's ruling Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party (AKP) has announced its commitment to the EU accession process and pledged to revive reforms.
But recent restrictions on the internet raise significant doubts about that commitment.
The AKP rejects charges of a hidden Islamist political agenda and describes itself as a conservative democratic party.
Some leading AKP members have publicly disputed evolutionist ideas in the past, but the party has no direct link to Oktar and tries to distance itself from his group.

ICTY Indictee Milan Lukic Arrested in Argentina
Bosnian Serb Milan Lukic, wanted for the brutal murders of as many as 150 civilians, has been arrested in Argentina.
He has declined to contest his extradition to The Hague.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade – 10/08/05

Milan Lukic, indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal for murdering scores of non-Serb civilians, appeared before a judge in Buenos Aires on Tuesday (9 August), one day after his arrest by Argentinean police.
He declared that he would not contest his extradition to The Hague.
Under a November 2000 indictment by the tribunal, Lukic stands charged -- along with his cousin Sredoje Lukic and Mitar Vasiljevic -- with torturing, terrorising and killing as many as 150 people in the area of Visegrad, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
In May 1992, Lukic and his associates allegedly launched a series of violent attacks targeting non-Serb civilians, including women, children, the elderly, and workers on their way to their jobs.
According to the indictment, Milan Lukic, Vasiljevic and other individuals killed five Bosnian Muslims on the banks of the Drina River on 7 June 1992.
Three days later, Lukic allegedly participated in the murder of seven employees of the Visegrad-based furniture factory Varda.
On 14 June 1992, Milan Lukic, Sredoje Lukic and Mitar Vasiljevic allegedly caused the death of around 70 people in the village of Bikavac.
The victims were forced to enter a house that was then set on fire.
Only one person escaped.
Just last month, the Belgrade District court sentenced Lukic in absentia to 20 years in prison for the 1992 kidnapping and killing 16 Muslims from the village of Sjeverin, Serbia.
Co-defendants Oliver Krsmanovic and Dragutin Dragicevic were also sentenced to 20 years, while Djordje Sevic received a 15-year sentence.
Lukic was born in Foca, southeastern BiH in 1967. Until 1985 he lived in the village of Ruiste, in the Visegrad municipality, and then in the Serbian town of Obrenovac until 1992.
He returned to Visegrad in 1992 as a member of the Serbian paramilitary unit Beli Orlovi (White Eagles), which systematically expelled Muslims from the area.
The head of Serbia-Montenegro's National Council for Co-operation with the UN tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, says Lukic's arrest in Argentina was the result of "intensive operations carried out by Serbian security services over the past nine months".
He added that the defendant would probably be extradited directly to the tribunal.
So far it has not been revealed how Lukic had arrived in Argentina or where he has been hiding.
His arrest leaves another eight indictees that Serbia and Republika Srpska (RS) must hand over to the Hague-based tribunal, chief among them Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic.
Serbian and RS authorities claim no knowledge of Karadzic and Mladic's whereabouts, adding that some indictees are hiding in Russia.
EU's Georgia observer mission kicks off
Six weeks after the conflict between Russia and Georgia, an EU mission aimed at stabilising the region and ensuring the parties' compliance with an August cease-fire kicked off on Wednesday.

An EU mission, aimed at contributing to stability in Georgia, began operations Wednesday (October 1st), as unarmed observers from the 27-nation bloc started monitoring a cease-fire that ended the country's five-day conflict with Russia this summer.
More than 200 unarmed monitors from 22 EU member nations have gone to Georgia to oversee the withdrawal of Russian forces from two buffer zones adjacent to the former Soviet republic's breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
On August 7th, the Georgian Army launched an offensive to regain control of South Ossetia.
Russia reacted immediately with massive military action, including air raids deep inside Georgian territory, well beyond the borders of the disputed province.
An EU-brokered agreement Moscow and Tbilisi signed on August 12th called on both sides to pull their troops to their pre-conflict positions.
Russia nonetheless set up "security zones" around South Ossetia and Abkhazia and recognised the two regions as independent states on August 26th, prompting strong Western condemnation.
Under an updated peace plan of September 8th, Russian forces must fully withdraw from the two buffer zones within ten days of the deployment of EU monitors.
Speaking on the eve of the launch of the EU Monitoring Mission (EUMM), EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana voiced optimism that both sides will comply with the treaty and that Moscow will pull back its troops within the agreed deadline.
"We hope very much and we are sure that before October 10th that part of the mission will be completed," he said in Tbilisi on Tuesday.
Earlier in the day, the Russian military indicated it would block EU observers from entering the buffer zones.
But the monitors reportedly entered the zone around South Ossetia without incident as they began work Wednesday.
Reports Wednesday suggest the EU patrols were able to visit a number of villages within the buffer zone and talk to residents before returning to their bases.
But Russian forces blocked reporters from following the observers.
The EUMM, headed by German diplomat Hansjoerg Haber, has its headquarters in Tbilisi.
The EU monitors have four field offices -- near Lake Basaleti, about 20km north of the Georgian capital, and in Gori, Poti and Zugdidi.
Haber urged the monitors to "show the flag, be friendly, show confidence".
Russia is planning to keep nearly 8,000 troops in South Ossetia and Abkhazia and has repeatedly refused to allow the EU monitors access to the two regions.
Observers expect the issue to arise again during a new round of talks between EU and Russian officials, scheduled in Geneva later this month.

The EU is Albania's largest trading partner with 65.3% of all trade.
The World Bank's Board of Executive Directors has approved a new Country Partnership Strategy of the World Bank Group with Turkey that covers 2008 to 2011.
According to a statement published by the Bank on Friday (February 29th), the strategy outlines Bank financing for programmes of the government, or guaranteed by the government, of up to $6.2 billion.
Greece has invested about 14 billion euros in the Balkans, according to recent data by the Greek Ministry of Economy and Finance.
About 4,000 Greek companies with 200,000 employees are operating in the region.
Greece is the biggest foreign investor in Macedonia, Albania and Serbia, and is the third largest foreign investor in Bulgaria.
Montenegro and Norway signed a memorandum of understanding for bilateral economic co-operation on Friday (February 29th).
Norway will support Montenegrin projects in fields such as water supply, energy, education and defence.
Slovenia's largest fuel retailer Petrol said on Friday (February 29th) that it plans to invest about 17m euros in its retail network in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
Petrol BiH Oil Company director Aleksander Malakovsky explained that the company wants to double its 26 petrol stations by 2010.
Last year, Petrol's BiH branch posted 670,000 euros in net profit.

Serbia aims to end fan violence, foster youth
Sports fans are becoming hostages of violence, Serbian Youth and Sports Minister Snezana Samardzic-Markovic said.

Serbian Youth and Sports Minister Snezana Samardzic-Markovic has announced a number of measures that the state will use to deal with the increasing incidents of violence surrounding sports fans in the country.
In order to improve conditions for the training of top athletes, the state will invest significant funds in sports infrastructure.
In an exclusive interview with Southeast European Times correspondent Bojana Milovanovic, Samardzic-Markovic discusses the recent incidents, the steps the government is taking and the future of the country's youth.
SETimes: Violence among sports fan groups sent shockwaves through the Serbian public after French football fan Brice Taton was beaten to death in Belgrade.
How will Serbia handle that problem?
Snezana Samardzic-Markovic: We are handling it in different ways.
My ministry primarily handles it through prevention and education, since we do not have the instruments of force the interior and justice ministries have.
One of the recent, very important, things that has happened is the [establishment] of a government council against violence in sports led by the Serbian prime minister and comprising representatives of the judiciary, sports associations and journalists.
The signal is that only together and through institutions can we successfully combat violence in sports.
One should distinguish real sports fans from hooligans, the fans love their club, whereas the hooligans love violence.
The real fans are hostages of violence… Certain actions are already being taken, an initiative has been launched to ban sports fan groups, which are known to have called for the destruction of constitutional order and violence, that process is now being handled by the Constitutional Court of Serbia.
We are also to adopt an action plan that envisages a number of anti-violence measures.
There is also a working group researching the applicability of the so-called British model in Serbia.
SETimes: Serbia is famous for achievements in athletes, but the conditions in which top athletes train are often much worse than the results achieved.
How will Serbia help its best athletes and ensure that they have the best training conditions?
Serbia's youth offices solve key problems identified by young people themselves. [File]
Samardzic-Markovic: The root of the problem lies in the fact that sports facilities in our country are in very poor condition.
Over the past two and a half years, 170 open courts have been built or reconstructed in all of Serbia, 40 sports halls in schools have also been either opened or reconstructed, and four swimming pools and an ice skating rink have also been fixed.
The National Training Centre at the Serbian Sports Bureau has been reopened after 20 years of deterioration.
The gym was completely moldy, the swimming pool was ruined, I was ashamed to even imagine any top athlete training there.
Now it is a facility to be proud of.
Soccer is a very important sport for Serbia and, in association with international sports organisations, we will open the House of Soccer next year.
By the end of the year, over 50 mini sports fields with artificial grass will also open throughout Serbia.
The state has also launched a scholarship program for athletes ranging from [250 to 600 euros] for successful athletes such as swimmer Milorad Cavic.
SETimes: In your opinion, what is the biggest problem facing Serbia’s youth and what is the ministry doing to solve it?
Samardzic-Markovic: When I became the youth and sports minister, Serbia was the only country in the region without a national youth strategy.
It is not merely about the document, but also about a political signal, because before it meant that Serbia was a country without any idea of what to do with its youth, a country that did not recognise young people systemically.
I am very happy that we changed that and as of May 9th 2008, Serbia is no longer the only country in the region without a strategic document concerning the youth.
When I arrived at the ministry's helm I identified another symptom -- out of 167 municipalities in Serbia, just five had local youth offices.
That was a reflection of the situation in our society.
What has changed? Well, on November 9th we will open the 100th youth office.
The purpose of such offices is to solve the key problems identified by young people themselves.
The first problem is unemployment, the second is lack of information, and the third is a lack of quality contents of free time.
Youth offices have the instrument to help young people reach the mayor or head of a municipality, to force the local government to see them, plan and respect their activism.
Sport venues in Serbia are in poor condition, Serbian Youth and Sports Minister Snezana Samardzic-Markovic says. [Nikola Barbutov/SETimes]
The offices are also obligated to inform young people on events and activities.
Two youth entrepreneurship programs are also being implemented with the assistance of youth offices.
Eighty percent of young people in Serbia work for someone else, and I would like them to start their own business and work for themselves.
We have educated 500 users and there are already about 80 companies founded by young people, who now employ others.
SETimes: How can we compare the quality of life of young people in Serbia with other countries in the region?
Samardzic-Markovic: At the moment, we are ahead of the rest of the region, or at least that is how we are identified by the Council of Europe, as the only European multi-lateral body that at least has a youth policy.
This boom sparked by the National Youth Strategy has caused a great deal of enthusiasm among this population.
We are now an example of good practice and 46 other countries, members of the Council of Europe, look up to us.
SETimes: During the 1990s, many educated young people left Serbia.
That trend is now somewhat lower, but still existent.
How can young people be persuaded to stay in Serbia and how can those who have already left be convinced to return?
Samardzic-Markovic: In 2007, we measured the tendencies of young people to transfer from smaller to larger environments and to leave Serbia.
We compared that research now in 2009, and the tendency is down 10%. One of the means to not completely prevent, but at least conspicuously reduce the problem of "brain drain" is the Youth Talent Fund.
It has so far given away 2,200 scholarships and prizes.
Those scholarships are given to the best students in Serbia, as well as those who wish to further enhance their skills abroad, but under the obligation of returning to Serbia and working here for at least five years after graduation.
Part of the Youth Talent Fund is also the Career Guidance and Counseling Centre, as another way to help young educated people to make use of their capabilities in the best possible manner.
Discord among EU members over enlargement
Although member states reaffirmed their commitment to enlargement, the EU summit in June gave Western Balkan countries some reasons to worry.
Analysis by Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade – 13/07/06
"It's obvious that we need, more than ever, to change some rules of decision-making inside the EU," said EC President Jose Manuel Barroso. [Getty Images]
At their most recent summit, held in mid-June, the presidents and prime ministers of EU member states instructed the European Commission (EC) to make an assessment of the EU's "absorbing power" concerning new members by December 2006.
At the same time, they postponed debate on an amended European Constitution, which many analysts see as necessary for further enlargement.
Germany, Spain and Italy advocate smaller amendments to the existing text, while France, the Netherlands and Great Britain call for an all new Constitution.
Britain is against the overt transfer of authority from the member states to the institutions in Brussels.
Failure to adopt the constitution would have serious implications for the hopes of aspiring members.
Among the first to be affected would be Croatia, which is hoping to join the bloc by 2010.
It is not inconceivable that Croatia could meet all the conditions for membership and still face an obstacle -- if the members still have not reconstructed the institutions and policies governing the admission of new states.
While the European future of the Western Balkans has never been disputed, it is clear that the countries from the region will have to wait for the EU to solve its internal problems.
"We need, more than ever, to change some rules of decision-making inside the EU," said EC President Jose Manuel Barroso.
The conclusions from the session stress that the EC's analysis of the EU's "absorbing power" must include an explanation of the process to European citizens.
This is considered a key requirement in light of the rejection, by Dutch and French citizens, of the draft constitution -- in part, out of concerns that enlargement poses a threat to the jobs and living standards of "old Europe".
The summit participants did, at least in general, reaffirm their commitment to the enlargement process.
"The entry of new members has been confirmed as a historic opportunity to contribute to peace, security, stability, democracy, the rule of law, and the growth and well-being of the EU as a whole," they declared.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn also struck an optimistic note, saying the summit had paved the way for a "new consensus".
This consensus should "strengthen our interest in forming a zone of peace, democracy and prosperity in Europe, while on the other hand ensure that we function efficiently and accept new members," he said.
The Western Balkan countries were promised membership at the summit in Thessaloniki in 2003, a move confirmed in several documents since then.
Last fall, Croatia and Turkey launched membership talks, while Macedonia has candidate status.
Albania recently signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, whereas Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia andHerzegovina have yet to do so.
Croats, Serbs put aside differences to honour Tesla
Marking the 150th anniversary of Nikola Tesla's birth, Croatia and Serbia organised a joint commemoration of the great scientist -- an ethnic Serb who was born in Croatia.

UNESCO couldn't have been more correct when it proclaimed 2006 to be the Year of Nikola Tesla.
Events throughout the world have been commemorating his achievements.
In April, Columbia University hosted a symposium.
The UN sponsored a June exhibition in Graz, where Tesla studied from 1875 to 1878.
The same month, every household in western Australia found a letter about Nikola Tesla included in their electricity bill.
More recently, on 9 July, the Nikola Tesla Memorial was unveiled at Niagara Falls, where the scientist built his celebrated hydropower plant.
Not to be outdone, Croatia and Serbia organised a special joint celebration at Tesla's home village of Smiljan.
Hundreds of Serbs and Croats put aside their history and came together to commemorate the great man.
Festitivies included the inauguration of a newly built multimedia centre, enabling guests to view Tesla's scientific works and patents.
Croatian President Stipe Mesic, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, Serbian President Boris Tadic, and US Ambassador to Croatia Robert Bradtke were among the many officials attending the opening of the centre.
"He is our common heritage, a Serb born in Croatia who did not want ethnic conflicts," Tadic said. "But our past was not always glorious.
Today we have a common responsibility to offer our citizens a new vision."
"Tesla is a lighthouse whose light started shining 150 years ago in Smiljan and continues to shine today throughout the whole world, beyond limits and time," said Mesic.
In this way, Croatia and Serbia both paid tribute to an inventor who highlighted the century of industrial revolution and showed that genius goes far beyond religion or nationality.
Also as part of the celebrations, the Serbian central bank published special coins and postmarks for the occasion, and Belgrade's airport was renamed in honour of "the man who invented the 20th century," as some have called him.
Tesla (1856-1943) is credited with the rotating magnetic field principle, induction motors, wireless communication, florescent lights, and over 700 other patents.
He became the only scientist from the Balkans whose name is used as a unit in the international measurement system.
When Tesla spoke to a journalist over a hundred years ago and said that in the near future every person would own a little box which would allow them to communicate to anyone else, he was ridiculed.
Today, with everyone from businesspeople to high school students making use of sophisticated cell phone technology, his prediction rings true.
Kosovo's Sejdiu to address Security Council in New York
Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu's presentation on the sidelines of the UN Security Council session is expected to include a call for independence.

Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu was expected to address the UN Security Council Thursday (13 July) during an informal meeting.
"I will call for support of Kosovo's independence in the Security Council," Sejdiu said before flying to New York on Tuesday. "It is a very important moment that I have a chance to address the representatives of the Security Council and to present the aspects of our political vision."
Although Sejdiu's presentation was to be given at a sideline session, rather than a formal meeting in the Security Council room, it nevertheless marks the first time a Kosovo official has addressed the body.
Prime Minister Agim Ceku and his predecessor, Bajram Kosumi, have attended Security Council sessions but did not have the right to address members.
Following talks with Kosovo's delegation to the status talks in Vienna, Sejdiu termed independence a "non-negotiable" demand for his side, and suggested that a sovereign Kosovo should be given a permanent seat in the UN.
"Each independent state … wants to be an important factor in the international community, no matter if this state is small or big," he said.
While formally part of Serbia, Kosovo has been run as a de facto UN protectorate since 1999, when NATO action forced the regime of Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw from the province.
Most of its predominantly Albanian population favours independence, while Serbia wants to retain sovereignty and is offering "essential autonomy" instead.
Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, who reiterated his side's position during talks with US officials this week, will also address the Security Council.
He is not expected to meet with Sejdiu.
"Kosovo's independence would lead the region to serious instability," he said at a news conference Tuesday after talks with US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.
The same day, Serbian President Boris Tadic said in an interview on state television that Belgrade is making an all-out effort to retain some form of sovereignty over Kosovo.
However, he warned, its negotiating position is weak because of the legacy of the Milosevic years.
Milosevic's policies have left Serbia without much room to manoeuvre, Tadic said, adding that the government would nevertheless "fight until the last minute using the legitimate means" of diplomacy.
BiH clears key hurdle on EU accession path
Bosnia and Herzegovina could see a major accord with the EU finalised within weeks, after police reform laws that Brussels has long advocated earned the central parliament's final approval on Wednesday.

"Better days are ahead of us and also much work related to signing the SAA," BiH Prime Minister Nikola Spiric said. [AFP]
The upper house of Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) state-level parliament adopted two police reform laws Wednesday (April 16th), opening the door for the country's Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU.
The bill on oversight of BiH police and the bill on co-ordination of police departments and support agencies were approved by a 10-4 vote of the 15-member House of Peoples.
Approval came about a week after the bills cleared the 42-seat lower house.
The breakthrough came after more than three years of talks on police re-organisation in the country, where each of its entities -- Republika Srpska (RS) and the Federation of BiH -- has its own police.
Attempts to reach a deal were blocked mainly by Bosnian Serb parties fearing that the EU-required police reforms eventually would doom the RS.
They finally accepted a compromise proposal offered by High Representative Miroslav Lajcak and envisioning the creation of seven state-level co-ordination bodies that will assume authority over the country's ethnically divided police forces within a year after the adoption of constitutional reform.
Favouring more centralisation of police, the ruling Bosniak Party of Democratic Action and the Serb Democratic Party are criticising the legislation, claiming it offers only "cosmetic" changes that will not improve security in BiH.
Although the approved plan deviates from the EU's original demand for a single police force nationwide, Brussels signalled that it would accept any deal under which police operate professionally and eschew ethnic bias.
EU officials praised BiH politicians on Wednesday for removing the final obstacle to the signing of the SAA, a major step towards eventual EU membership.
The accord was initialled in December, but Brussels said it would be finalised only after an agreement on police restructuring.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Wednesday that the accord would not only "bring practical benefits in trade" but would also bring BiH closer to candidate status.
Characterising Wednesday's move as a "decisive step" for BiH, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana voiced hope that the SAA could be signed "soon".
It could happen as early as April 29th, during a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg.
"If there are technical difficulties, the next date for the signing will be May 26th," Slovenian Ambassador to BiH Natasa Vodusek, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said on Wednesday.
If problems do occur, finalisation could take place during the EU foreign ministers' subsequent meeting on June 16th.
"Once embarked on this road, no country has failed to become a member of the EU," Lajcak said as he welcomed the police re-organisation, which "sends a strong signal to the EU and to investors that BiH … is open for business".
Ohrid shines with summer festival
The annual Ohrid Summer Festival opened last week with a programme featuring such performers such as Roxy Music, the Imperial Russian Ballet, and Leb i Sol.

The Ohrid Summer Festival offers the public a chance to see many prominent names in the areas of music, ballet, opera and theatre.
This year's festival, the 46th, began on 12 July and runs through 20 August.
Actors, musicians, and artists from all over the world come to Macedonia to participate in this world-renowned cultural event.
Many are from Europe, but countries as Australia, China, Israel and the United States are also represented.
"The Ohrid Summer Festival, with its long-standing tradition, is the best example of the necessity of such cultural exchange, an example that communication between world-ranked artists and ensembles puts Ohrid and Macedonia on the map of world events," said Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski.
The event opened spectacularly this year with two famous Spanish ballets, "Carmen" and "Bolero", performed by the Imperial Russian Ballet.
In between the performances, the Macedonian National Theatre Ballet unveiled "Tango", a series of interlocked Latin American dances.
The legendary British band Roxy Music and its leader Bryan Ferry performed on 14 July for an audience of 1,000, kicking off an exciting lineup of musical events.
One of the most famous bands from the former Yugoslavia, Leb i Sol, has reunited after a ten-year break and will be playing at the festival.
Concerts by Rade Serbedzija, Miroslav Tadic and Lidio Morosini are also scheduled, and the Macedonian Philharmonic will be performing Mozart's masterpiece "Requiem" to honour the 250th anniversary of the composer's death.
Notable theatre productions include the classical Greek drama "Electra" by the Grand Theatre of Amsterdam, Tennessee Williams' "A Streetcar named Desire" by the Theatre of the Army of Bulgaria, Emilio Carballido's "Two Odours of the Rose" by Belgrade's Terazije Theatre and "Who, When, Who With?" by the Istanbul City Theatre.
Macedonia's National Theatre will launch its new production of Moliere's "The Skilled Women", the Albanian Theatre will perform Refet Abazi's "Aquarium", while the Bitola Theatre will be staging "Macbeth".
The cultural festival will wrap up with "Verona, Verona", a production by the newly established Ohrid Theatre.
Bulgarian, Romanian and US troops hold joint training exercise
The "Immediate Response 06" military exercise is giving troops from three NATO member states an opportunity to improve their capabilities and interoperability.

Bulgarian, Romanian and US military forces are set to wind up a nearly two week-long joint training exercise on Saturday (29 July) in Romania.
The drill, dubbed Immediate Response 2006 (IR06), officially kicked off at the Novo Selo training area in southern Bulgaria on 17 July.
It involves about 800 Bulgarian, Romanian and American soldiers and hundreds of others providing logistical and other necessary support.
The aim of the exercise, first developed by the United States Army Europe and 7th Army Command in 2002, is to increase interoperability among the armies of the three NATO member states.
According to Colonel Iurie Tanase, chief of office at the Romanian Land Forces Command and the Romanian co-ordinator of the exercises, the goal was also to improve the Romanian troops' combat capabilities at the level of platoon, company and General Staff.
Soldiers are conducting weapons familiarisation live-fires, Military Operations in Urban Terrain, air assault operations and cross border convoy manoeuvres.
"It is not the first time we are firing with an M16 and probably not the last time," said Romanian Platoon Commander Lieutenant Constantin Paraschivu. "Here, on the firing field or the tactical field, we establish the basis of our interoperability.
A military that has trained together, observing the same standards, is much more effective in real situations.
We are training for this."
Colonel Petar Petrov, chief of staff of Bulgaria's 61st Mechanised Infantry Brigade, said his soldiers wanted to take part in the drill, as they have not fought with Western forces yet.
"We want to be certified as part of NATO forces," he said. "We want to conduct expeditionary exercises as part of NATO."
The Bulgarian and Romanian militaries mastered new tactics for blocking, neutralising and disarming terrorist groups and their leaders, commanders said.
A key aspect of the drill has been the use of the Deployable Instrumentation System Europe (DISE).
With the DISE gear strapped on their vests and helmets, and with their weapons equipped with lasers, soldiers can monitor everything that is happening on the battlefield.
After the action is over, soldiers can then review it on a TV screen.
While it would be unlikely to see an American, Bulgarian and Romanian soldier in the same vehicle during a real combat operation, as occurred during the exercise, what this does is help boost mutual confidence, said Colonel James Shumway, 1st Armored Division's Engineer Brigade commander and exercise director for IR06.
"There's no better way for our [nations'] soldiers to develop confidence and understanding in each other," the US newspaper Stars and Stripes quoted him as saying. "If we kept separate platoons and squads, we wouldn't get that same level of immersion."
A Romanian captain involved in the exercise echoed his words.
"If we have to work and fight together again, we know each other and have trained with each other; we are friends," said Captain Cristian Reducu of Romania's 26th Infantry Brigade.
EU pledges to help overstretched Cyprus cope with influx of evacuees
Cyprus has become the main transit point for people fleeing Lebanon by sea, and officials there say its capacities are being exceeded.
(AP, AFP, Reuters, DPA, International Herald Tribune, The Scotsman, Spiegel Online, Xinhua, Cyprus News Agency, Financial Mirror, Turkish Press, Turkish Daily News - 25/07/06)

The EU will help Cyprus cope with the influx of evacuees from Lebanon, EU Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas indicated on Tuesday (25 July) during a visit to the Mediterranean island.
Located less than 250km to the West, Cyprus has become the main transit point for people fleeing the violence in Lebanon by sea, and authorities say the country's resources are overstretched.
The combined Greek and Turkish Cypriot populations on the island number less than 800,000 people.
According to the EU, some 40,000 people have been transferred to Cyprus over the past two weeks, though 30,000 of them have already left.
At the weekend, the EU activated a civil protection programme to help co-ordinate logistics support from member states.
Dimas, who is in charge of the programme, said his visit would allow him "to get a better idea of what is still needed on the ground and to discuss how we can further improve the situation through the civil protection mechanism".
The commissioner's visit followed an appeal by Nicosia for urgent practical assistance from the international community, and the EU in particular.
Greek Cypriot Interior Minister Andreas Christou, who met with Dimas on Tuesday, said the government's main request was for the prompt arrival of planes so that evacuees arriving by sea can be transported without delay to their final destinations.
Cyprus has proved that it can handle crises in the region, but its capabilities are limited, the minister told Dimas.
"We have not simply reached our limits, we have surpassed them," said Cypriot government spokesman Christodoulos Pashiardis.
In a telephone interview with the AP, he later said Cyprus could face the prospect of multitudes arriving on the island with "no means, no money".
"We have to cope with this possibility in case it becomes a reality," Pashiardis noted. "Where are we going to house them all?
And for how long?
We are not talking about a few, we're talking about thousands.
The problem concerns Europe and the international community, which cannot distance itself from the obligation and responsibility towards thousands of people seeking refuge."
Relieving some of the burden on Cyprus, Turkey has opened its Mediterranean port of Mersin to ships carrying evacuees from Lebanon.
According to a Turkish foreign ministry statement Tuesday, a total of 6,575 foreign nationals and 1,322 Turkish citizens fleeing the fighting in Lebanon have arrived in the country so far.
Nine countries -- Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Mexico, Moldova, Sweden and the United States -- are arranging for the evacuation of their citizens from Lebanon via Turkey.
The evacuees arriving in Mersin are being transported to the nearby city of Adana for flights home.
Gasoline Industry Calls for Price Hike in Serbia
Serbian government officials have criticised a call by the country's gas industry for an 8 per cent increase in gas prices.
The industry says the hike is necessary to prevent losses and guarantee supply.

Following the price increase of crude oil on the world market, Serbia's Ministry of Energy and Mining sent a request to the finance ministry demanding an 8 per cent price increase for gasoline.
The current price corresponds to a price of around $33 per barrel of crude oil.
However, the price of oil on the New York Stock Exchange now exceeds $50 per barrel.
NIS officials say that an increase in the price of derivatives is necessary for importers to be able to buy new quantities of crude oil.
According to Nebojsa Atanackovic, president of the association of private traders Nafta AD, a large number of importers are now registering losses.
That could affect the supply of derivatives, especially diesel fuel.
"In the event that the price hike does take place, it will represent only 50 per cent of the required price hike, and then we could expect that there won't be any shortages," Atanackovic says.
Attempts by authorities to prevent gasoline price increases to maintain the projected inflation rate of 8.5 per cent are untenable, argues Miroslav Prokopijevic, director of the Centre for the Free Market.
"The solution proposed by the government, to freeze everything, will destroy NIS and will destroy the gasoline industry," he warns. "Who is going to come here and invest under such conditions?
Instead of such solutions that are dragging us back into the past, there are two markets: when prices are formed freely and when prices on the domestic market are formed on the basis of world market prices."
National Bank of Serbia Governor Radovan Jelasic, however, insists that NIS has other options available besides passing costs onto consumers.
"Just as the banking system does not exist just because of the National Bank of Serbia, so the entire economy does not exist just to be able to provide sufficient income for NIS.
It is the job of NIS to see what can be done through internal restructuring and internal reforms from the perspective of efficiency and productivity," Jelasic says.
UN Security Council discusses human organ trafficking in Kosovo
NEW YORK, United States -- Members of the UN Security Council agreed on Thursday (May 12th) that a thorough investigation should be made into allegations of human organ trafficking in Kosovo, mentioned in a report by Council of Europe (CoE) rapporteur Dick Marty late last year.
However, they fell short of specifying who should lead this investigation.
UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier reiterated that EULEX has said it is capable of conducting the investigation and offered UNMIK's co-operation.
Kosovo Foreign Minister Enver Hoxhaj also attended the session and said that EULEX is able to independently investigate Marty's report.
He urged everyone to hand over any evidence to EULEX prosecutors.
Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic, whose country has insisted the UN should lead the investigation, demanded the full truth about events in Kosovo during the 1999 conflict. (Radio Free Europe, B92, Zeri, Koha Ditore - 13/05/11; RTK, Kohavision - 12/05/11)
Albania to Open Three More Universities
Responding to the labour market's need for a skilled workforce, Albanian authorities have decided to open three new universities.
Starting this autumn, students can enroll at the universities of Berati, Durres and Fieri

Starting in the 2005-2006 academic year, Albania will have three more universities.
Earlier this month, the government approved legislation paving the way for the opening of institutions of higher learning in Berati, Durres and Fieri.
The Council of Ministers passed the draft-law to open three new universities in Berati, Durres and Fieri to create new possibilities and development spaces for the higher education in universities according to the European standards, according to a press release from the government's Department of Information.
All three universities will have education departments, helping to meet a demand for pre-elementary and elementary school teachers.
Berati's university will also offer diplomas in public administration, tourism management and nursing.
Students at the university in Durres can take courses in foreign languages, naval engineering, the social sciences and tourism management, while the Fieri university's department of applied sciences will offer training in agriculture, engineering and social work.
The government's decision brings the total number of universities in Albania to nine.
Authorities are in the process of finding physical locations for the universities, while the ministry of education and science has begun recruiting staff.
Liberalisation of higher education is a major topic of discussion in Albanian academia.
As reforms are enacted and more institutions established, it may soon become possible for any Albanian wishing to pursue a university degree to do so, provided he or she passes the entrance exam.
IMF ready to offer additional aid to Greece
BERLIN, Germany -- The IMF is ready to offer additional aid to Greece should Athens ask for it, Antonio Borges, director of the Fund's European department, told a press conference in Frankfurt on Thursday (May 12th).
"The Greeks have to take the initiative, and so far they have not approached us," Borges said while presenting the new six-month report on Europe's economic perspectives.
He reiterated there is no need to restructure Greece's debt.
Separately Thursday, IMF spokesperson Caroline Atkinson said the Fund has been considering extending the repayment schedule of the 110 billion-euro bailout package Greece received a year ago from the IMF and the EU, if Athens needs more time. (Imerisia, To Vima, Sigma Live - 13/05/11)
Dozens die in Turkish flash floods
With more torrential rains expected this week, the death toll is likely to rise.
(Zaman, Turk.net, Washington Times, Focus News Agency - 10/09/09; AP, Reuters, AFP, DPA, FT, BBC, Times Online, New York Times, Euronews, Hurriyet, Sabah, Turk.net - 09/09/09)

More than 30 people have died in northwestern Turkey after two days of torrential rains triggered flash floods that turned roads into rivers and left hundreds of houses, offices and vehicles submerged.
Floods in the centre of Istanbul and the city's districts of Catalca, Silivri and Ikitelli claimed 26 lives, the Anadolu news agency quoted Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan as saying Wednesday (September 9th).
Another "five citizens died in the northwestern province of Tekirdag. Currently, nine people are reported missing", he told reporters in Istanbul.
The city has not seen this much rain in about 80 years.
Turkish daily Hurriyet quoted Erdogan as saying that the government would provide nearly 1.4m euros in emergency aid to deal with damage caused by the floods.
Hundreds of rescue workers and firefighters, six military helicopters and 30 inflatable dinghies took part in a major operation to save lives in and around Istanbul on Wednesday.
In the industrial Ikitelli district, about 20km from the Bosporus Strait that divides the European and Asian parts of Turkey, some people had to be picked off rooftops.
Others had sought refuge atop stranded cars.
At least seven of the victims in Istanbul were said to be truck drivers, asleep inside their vehicles in a parking lot, when floodwaters swept past.
The dead also included seven women who drowned inside a shuttle service van that had just brought them to work at a textile factory in the Halkali district.
"There was no escape other than the back door, and it was stuck by the pressure of the flooding water," Istanbul Governor Muammer Guler told reporters.
According to him, in addition to those killed or missing in Istanbul, 20 people were injured as a result of the floods.
Bulgarian Foreign Ministry spokesman Dragovest Goranov said on Thursday that a Bulgarian hitchhiker had died in the floods and that Sofia remains unaware of the fate of a truck driver who went missing.
The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF-Turkey) said in a statement Wednesday that the floods were the result of global warming, but criticised authorities for failing to take preventive measures.
"Despite the fact that we [Turkey] are among the countries most affected by climate change, the relevant authorities are not taking the necessary precautions precipitated by this change onto their agendas," Turkish daily Zaman quoted the NGO as saying in a statement.
Other experts and government officials cited infrastructure problems as the reason for the heavy damage and casualties.
But recently the municipality also began to construct under and over the ground," Mucella Yapici, an architect from the Chamber of Architects' Istanbul branch, told Hurriyet.
She also called on Istanbul Mayor Kadir Topbas to take immediate steps to ensure that all policies and construction plans that do not protect the land are cancelled.
Some insurers estimate the cost of the damage in Istanbul at between 48m euros and 55m euros -- others believe it could exceed 100m euros.
"There is huge damage to infrastructure," Procurement Minister Mustafa Demir said. "We need to be more careful when designing infrastructure and cities."
Meanwhile, meteorologists predict more powerful rains for northwestern Turkey this week, which could raise the death toll.
Interns Bring Energy and Skills to Serbian Parliament
Student interns are now helping to inject enthusiasm and energy into the parliamentary process.
The result is a healthier democratic process for all.
By Liz Barrett for Southeast European Times - 07/07/03
At the heart of every democracy are its elected representatives -- the members of parliament (MPs).
But MPs rely heavily on a hidden support network of parliamentary staff with the time and skills to research issues, maintain contacts with voters and handle administrative tasks.
Unfortunately, parliaments across Southeast Europe lack resources in this area.
They lack good libraries or computer networks and are often staffed by an older generation that spent most of its working life during the communist era, when parliaments had a very different role.
One innovative project set up by the OSCE seeks to overcome these problems.
The secret is to bring in new skills and energy in the form of student interns, who help out MPs and committees for a few hours a week in between their studies.
This is a common model in Western Europe, where jobs as research assistants to MPs -- even on a voluntary basis -- are highly competitive.
The project benefits all those involved.
MPs gain access to staff who can use the Internet and are enthusiastic about research. Existing parliamentary staff, who are often overstretched, get help with their day-to-day tasks.
Interns learn how parliament really works, helping them in their studies and providing valuable feedback to university courses.
And society benefits from a more efficient parliament and the emergence of a body of young people committed to democratic parliamentary processes.
Of course not everybody welcomes the initiative.
Vojin Kovacevic, a law student at Belgrade University and an intern for the DSS parliamentary group, says some of the current parliamentary staff view the interns as a threat -- competition for their own jobs.
"Some of the staff are like dinosaurs, they worked under Tito and Milosevic and now the new government.
Many of them don't know how to turn on a computer." Although many of the new generation of MPs are very committed to their jobs, other deputies are barely interested, rarely attending plenary sessions and making little effort to research issues or represent voters.
Overall, the project is a big success.
Kovacevic goes in to parliament around three times a week, spending an average of 10 to 15 hours in all.
One particular MP, a lawyer, immediately spotted the law student and asked him to help research the laws of neighbouring and EU countries.
Kovacevic tracks down the laws and briefs the MP on the main differences with Serbian law, hence feeding in to the process of harmonising Serbian laws with European models.
Kovacevic says that of the 55 students working at the Serbian and federal parliaments, almost all are very satisfied and have developed good professional relationships with the deputies - regardless of their political affiliations.
In fact, the project is such a success that it is to be extended to the Vojvodina Assembly next year.
Greece, IOC Dismiss Criticism of 2004 Olympics Security Arrangements
Security for the Olympics is a top priority and all necessary measures are being taken to ensure safety, officials said in response to a newspaper report alleging serious lapses.
(AFP, ANA - 28/09/03; Washington Post, Reuters - 27/09/08)
Officials from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Athens 2004 Organising Committee (ATHOC) have rejected criticism of the security arrangements for the Summer Games.
"The reports that I am receiving about the security issue are positive," IOC President Jacques Rogge told Greek media on Sunday (28 September).
His statement came a day after the Washington Post reported that undercover agents had found serious lapses in security.
According to the report, an agent disguised as a pregnant woman managed to pass through a checkpoint with a mock bomb.
Another agent was able to plant a fake device on a ferry, the Post said.
"All the big stuff got through," a US security-planning official was quoted as saying.
"If you can get the big stuff through, getting chemical and biological stuff through is no problem." Citing intelligence reports, the paper said disorganised police forces and breakdowns in maritime patrols were hampering efforts to provide security for the thousands of athletes and spectators expected to arrive in Athens in less than a year.
It also pointed to delays in establishing a command and control centre for the Olympics, which would allow police to exchange and have immediate access to information.
Greek officials, however, have dismissed the claims.
Security for the Games is a top priority for organisers, who are taking all necessary measures to ensure safety, ATHOC said in a press release Sunday.
''Beyond any fantastic scenarios and hyperbole there is only one reality: Greece is preparing with great effort to organise a totally safe Olympic games in 2004,'' the release said.
Echoing the organisers' words, Greek government spokesman Christos Protopappas said the criticism had "nothing to do with reality".
"There are interests who believe they can put pressure on us, but naturally we ignore them and press ahead with organising the safest Olympics ever," he added.
Greece has budgeted 640m euros for security arrangements.
In the biggest security operation in the history of the Olympics, over 45,000 police, military and special forces will be on guard.
That number, according to Reuters, is three times as many as at 2000 Olympics in Sydney.
In addition, an Olympics security advisory group, including Australia, Britain, France, Germany, Israel, Spain and the United States, has been set up to exchange expertise.
"No one can give 100 per cent guarantees on security issues," Rogge said, voicing confidence that the Greek government "has, without doubt, made the best possible security arrangements".
Romania embroiled in new political controversy
Accusations by a former presidential counsellor have ignited new suspicions of Romanian secret services' involvement in domestic politics.
By Paul Ciocoiu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest -- 10/02/09
Laws bar the SIE from tapping phone calls in Romania. [File]
A phone call late last month from former Romanian Foreign Intelligence Service (SIE) chief Claudiu Saftoiu to a TV talk show has renewed an ongoing debate about the interference of Romanian secret services in politics.
Saftoiu said that, during his term as presidential counsellor, President Traian Basescu disclosed he knew the content of phone conversations between opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD) leader Mircea Geoana and former head of state Ion Iliescu.
"I found out about political interventions from illegal interceptions a year or two ago from the president of Romania, who said that he knew what Iliescu and Geoana were talking about," said the former head of SIE.
Amid the ensuing uproar, Saftoiu tried to modify his statements and said the president did not reveal this information directly to him but that he deduced it from Basescu's statements to the media.
The president's office reacted quickly.
Basescu's spokesman, Valeriu Turcan, denied the allegations and said Basescu would sue Saftoiu for his "untrue and irresponsible statements".
"If there are persons who maintain they received information concerning the political or private life of Romanian citizens, the president's position is the following: those persons are guilty of [concealing the commission of a crime]," said the spokesman, underlining that Basescu was the first president to name opposition leaders to head both the SIE and Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI).
Both agencies also denied bugging such calls.
"Shame on them," commented Iliescu.
"I hope Mr. Saftoiu is wrong," said Geoana.
It is not Saftoiu's first statement that intelligence agencies violate citizens' privacy. A year ago, as head of the SIE, he testified to a parliamentary commission that his agency was intercepting phone calls on the basis of a warrant issued by a prosecutor's office.
Laws bar the SIE from tapping phone calls in Romania, except through its domestic counterpart, SRI, and only with a judge's warrant, not a prosecutor's.
Though Saftoiu retracted his claim, the ensuing scandal ended his close relationship with Basescu and forced his resignation.
The recent scandal comes amid a public debate on Law 298/2008 concerning telephone calls, text messages and e-mails.
According to the law, starting on January 20th, all phone companies must retain the following data for six months: the identities of the caller and recipient of the call, their locations, the time of the phone call and its duration.
Starting on March 15th, internet service providers will have to retain analogous data concerning all e-mails.
Government agencies can access the statistics in investigating a crime.
Critics worry the law will undermine civil liberties.
Security forces co-operate to contain inter-ethnic tensions in Mitrovica
Mitrovica Mayor Bajram Rexhepi says the multi-ethnic patrols that began working in the northern divided town last month "create trust in the population".

Two houses stand atop a hill in northern Kosovo.
These otherwise ordinary homes represent the boundary between the Albanian and Serb populations in the village of Suhadoll, on the northern part of the Iber River in the divided town of Mitrovica.
The Albanian owner of one house finds it impossible to rebuild, since local Serbs object to his plans.
Police and KFOR have had to keep them and his Albanian neighbours from coming to blows more than once.
The ongoing confrontation over a single house epitomises the instability and tension plaguing Mitrovica, where a series of inter-ethnic incidents -- such as the torching of Albanian shops and the stabbing of a Serb man -- began in late 2008.
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci has promised that law and order will prevail in every part of Kosovo, pointedly including Mitrovica in his vow.
Mitrovica Mayor Bajram Rexhepi says he fully supports stepped-up enforcement by the police, EULEX and KFOR.
According to him, the multi-ethnic patrols, which began several weeks ago, "create trust in the population.
And as such, we support them, in order to create a safe and secure environment for everyone". Interior Minister Zenun Pajaziti also praised the patrols for increasing security.
On January 23rd, Mitrovica region police spokesman Besim Hoti announced some progress by telling the Pristina daily Express that police had arrested two local Serbs for vandalism.
"Police arrested [them] for breaking car windows," Hoti said, referring to a spree that damaged more than 50 cars belonging to ethnic Albanians.
While northern Kosovo remains volatile, some now see reason for cautious optimism, such as Elizabeth Pond of the Christian Science Monitor.
She argues that Serbia and the EU have begun "tacit co-operation" in pacifying northern Kosovo, since Belgrade covets membership in the Union.
According to Pond, Serbian agents have kept "Serb troublemakers" from escalating their activities, while Kosovo police, EULEX police and KFOR peacekeepers have in turn held back "Albanian hotheads".
In another sign of tentative progress, some journalists in Serbia and Kosovo, as well as officials like Pajaziti, see more than simple ethnic hatred as a motive for the turmoil and are beginning to note the self-interest of both Serbian and Albanian crime rings in prolonging it.
The opposition Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK), though, accuses the government of not doing enough for the north's beleaguered ethnic Albanians.
AAK chairman and former Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj said on Sunday (February 8th) he would be able to integrate the divided town of Mitrovica within three months of taking power.
Kosovo holds local elections in November.
Schwarz-Schilling tells BiH lawmakers "the ball is in your court"
Bosnia and Herzegovina is in a serious political crisis and its path to Europe is currently blocked, the High Representative said on Wednesday.

It is time to reopen dialogue on constitutional reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), High Representative and EU Special Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling told members of the state parliament on Wednesday (June 13th).
In his final speech to lawmakers before his mandate ends, Schwarz-Schilling said BiH is in a serious political crisis because of lack of progress in reforms, a growing lack of confidence in politicians, and negative rhetoric from public figures.
"I have heard politicians making arguments and formulating policies that only exploit fears among the public, instead of building trust between all sides and making concrete progress on real-life issues," the top international envoy said.
"Is it acceptable to use radical rhetoric about referenda and about abolition of entities in order to gain more votes?
Is it acceptable to stir up concerns about other events in the region to spread fear amongst the citizens of this country?
I say this is not acceptable," he added.
Over the last few days, political leaders in BiH have met separately with Schwarz-Schilling and the US and German ambassadors, in a bid to jumpstart the reform process.
Bosnian Presidency member Haris Silajdzic and Republika Srpksa Prime Minister Milorad Dodik visited Washington for talks at the US State Department, but the discussions ended with no shift in their stances.
Since then, Schwarz-Schilling's office has attempted to take the lead.
Last year, a constitutional reform package failed to win approval in Parliament.
Following the last elections, parliamentary support is still below the two-thirds majority needed to push the document through.
"We support the previous package of constitutional reforms, but because of the lack of political will we probably have to start new negotiations," Dodik said after meeting with international representatives.
The key area of disagreement concerns the entity vote in Parliament.
Most Bosniak representatives oppose instituting a requirement under which a certain number of MPs from each entity must approve any bill before it can be adopted.
Bosniak legislators say this would slow progress.
But their RS counterparts are determined to retain the provision, arguing that its elimination would lead to their constantly being outvoted.
International officials warn that the political crisis is blocking BiH's path towards EU accession, and that this in turn feeds public discouragement and lack of trust in politicians.
BiH has been within an arm's reach of initialling a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU for months, yet it has not been able to take the final step and agree on police reform, Schwarz-Schilling said on Wednesday.
Because of the situation in BiH and the region, he noted, the Peace Implementation Council has decided not to close the Office of the High Representative (OHR) as previously planned.
"That is a step back," Schwarz-Schilling said. "The OHR is staying to ensure that peace and stability continue, even during this difficult time of political instability."
Cyprus a sticking point in EU-NATO co-operation
Turkey does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus, which joined the EU in 2004 and is demanding inclusion in a new strategic co-operation agreement between the bloc and NATO.
The dispute could affect plans for maintaining peace in Kosovo.

Disputes between Turkey and the EU that have hampered efforts to boost defence co-operation were high on the agenda of NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer's talks with officials in Ankara this week.
He heard from Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul that Turkey does not oppose improved defence ties between NATO and the EU, but that this should be done through existing co-operation mechanisms instead of new ones.
Under the existing "Berlin Plus" Agreement, reached in 2002, Cyprus -- which is not a member of NATO or the Partnership for Peace -- was excluded from strategic co-operation between the two organisations.
But the country, minus its Turkish-run north, has since joined the EU and insists that it should take part, along with the other new EU members that joined in 2004.
This is a major sticking point for Turkey, which does not recognise the Greek Cypriot administration in the south.
Until a comprehensive solution on the decades-old Cyprus problem is reached, Ankara argues, Nicosia should not be allowed a seat at the table when joint EU-NATO missions are discussed.
Turkey also wants Cyprus to stop blocking its bid to become an associate member of the European Defence Agency, a panel established to bolster the European arms industry.
"Parameters were already set in 2002.
You shouldn't expect further flexibility from Turkey, a country that has introduced major contributions to NATO as an ally, on this issue," the daily Zaman quoted Gul as telling de Hoop Scheffer. "It shouldn't solely be Turkey that is expected to be flexible.
Like NATO does in these kinds of situations, the EU should find a solution to this issue itself, without using its form of a decision mechanism as an excuse."
It could also affect plans for expanded co-operation between NATO troops and a future police mission in Kosovo.
If the status plan currently before the UN Security Council is passed, the EU would take over policing in Kosovo from the UN later this year.
The planned takeover involves 1,500 EU staff working alongside 16,000 NATO peacekeepers.
However, the framework for future NATO-EU co-operation in Kosovo must first be ironed out.
Turkey has been a significant contributor to the NATO and EU's peace and stability operations in conflict zones around the world, including Afghanistan.
But Ankara decided last week to withdraw its commitment to the EU for future peacekeeping missions.
As a NATO member, Turkey had earlier pledged to contribute a brigade to Headline Goal 2010, a military target set under the EU's security and defence strategy.
But the EU's decision to list the proposed Turkish brigade as part of "reserve forces" rather than "active forces" frustrated Turkish generals and diplomats, who have long sought a major role.
Turkey is also frustrated about being excluded from command and control structures in EU-led operations that take place in the framework of NATO-EU co-operation, even though it has made significant contributions.
While in Ankara, de Hoop Scheffer told reporters that talks among the partners would continue in a constructive manner.
He then headed for the NATO defence ministers' meeting in Brussels.
Interview: UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier
SETimes recently sat down with UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier to discuss the mission's current role in the country, its relationship with Belgrade and the future of UNMIK.
"With Belgrade, of course, it is easier for UNMIK officials to meet formally at the highest levels," said Zannier. [File]
SETimes: In light of the reconfiguration of the UN mission in Kosovo, Kosovo's independence, the current deployment of international peacekeepers and the structure of the EU Mission -- how would you describe the UN's current role in Kosovo?
Zannier: UNMIK continues to operate under its mandate based on Security Council Resolution 1244.
However, the events of last year … including the deployment of the EU's rule of law mission in December -- necessitated the reconfiguration of the mission.
The result is that the mission now emphasises its political role.
This includes monitoring and reporting, a greater focus on engagement with all of Kosovo's communities, facilitation of external representation, and promoting processes that lead to the resolution of practical issues between Pristina and Belgrade.
The mission also continues to play roles in areas where others do not.
An example of this includes the mission's administration role in north Mitrovica -- which is the only municipality in which we still exercise such authority.
Another example is facilitation of Kosovo's representation in Interpol.
SETimes: What kind of relations do you have with EULEX, the EU Special Representative and the International Civilian Representative (ICO)?
In what areas do you most co-operate?
Zannier: The international missions in Kosovo are here with different mandates.
As you know, EULEX is in Kosovo under the overall framework of resolution 1244.
Since becoming operational, EULEX complements our work, as does the OSCE.
Co-operation has been very good with EULEX.
Earlier this year, UNMIK and EULEX signed a number of technical agreements to facilitate, for instance, the handover of case files, premises and assets by UNMIK.
The relationship now is marked by consultation at many levels, including my regular meetings with the head of mission, Yves de Kermabon.
Of course EULEX, which operates under UN authority, also submits a report that is included in the secretary-general's regular reports to the security council.
As you know, the UN Security Council never adopted the Ahtisaari Plan, so there is not formal co-operation between UNMIK and the ICO.
This is not problematic for us because we see ICO's role really as advising the government.
However, I meet regularly with Pieter Feith in his capacity as EU special representative, so that there is a good two-way flow of information.
SETimes: What kind of relations do you have with Pristina and Belgrade?
On a day-to-day basis, what issues do you find yourself involved in with Pristina and Belgrade?
"UNMIK Administration Mitrovica is indeed the sole legal authority in north Mitrovica." [File]
Zannier: As the secretary-general noted in his latest report to the security council, there has been less direct contact between the Kosovo authorities and myself.
This is in part because Pristina prefers to work with other international actors.
However, there is practical co-operation between Pristina and the mission, and have opportunities to meet with Pristina officials less formally, for instance on the margins of security council sessions and in other international settings.
UNMIK has more interaction with authorities in Kosovo outside of Pristina where we work with all sides to solve practical issues, especially those involving communities like the issue of return of IDPs in the north.
With Belgrade, of course, it is easier for UNMIK officials to meet formally at the highest levels.
We discuss a broad range of issues at various levels, including in meetings between the Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG) and the government and also through the UN Office in Belgrade.
The topics can range from an exchange of views on general political trends to more specific technical discussions.
SETimes: Are you the only legal authority still in northern Kosovo and why?
Zannier: I think our role in the north is sometimes misrepresented in the media so I am glad you asked that question.
UNMIK Administration Mitrovica (UAM) is indeed the sole legal authority in north Mitrovica, but it is the only place in the north -- and indeed anywhere in Kosovo -- where our administration role is accepted by all sides.
UNMIK retains this role to prevent an administrative vacuum to ensure that practical needs can be addressed, such as checking cadastral records.
Therefore, for now, all sides recognise UAM and, most importantly, we have the support of the people who live there.
SETimes: With regard to the six-point plan, is it being implemented in its original form, or in a revised form and what does that mean for the region?
Zannier: The talks on the practical issues that you are referring to took place last year and were covered by the Secretary-General's November report on Kosovo.
We now have a much broader agenda, based on that report, and this includes issues such as returns or missing persons.
A number of other international actors are also involved in this process.
UNMIK continues to pragmatically support engagement to find practical solutions that will benefit all sides.
It is regrettable that this issue has been politicised because what we need to do is to make progress on this broader range of practical issues.
Getting bogged down in political labels hurts all sides.
SETimes: What can we expect to see in the future with regard to the UN Mission in Kosovo, and what will be the agenda for that mission?
Zannier: The mission will continue to work to fulfill its mandate.
For now the political role, especially involving community relations, that I explained in response to your first question, will continue to be the focus of our work.
I do not foresee any great shifts in the mission's role in the near future.
As you know, however, the mission has always adapted to evolving circumstances and we will continue to evaluate the situation on the ground and make any changes in the future in consultation with UN headquarters.
EU vexed over Turkish media group fine
A fine totaling more than 2 billion euros against the country's largest media group could put Turkey in hot water with Brussels.
By Erol Izmirli for Southeast European Times in Ankara -- 16/09/09
Turkey's decision to slap a huge fine on mogul Aydin Dogan's media group has raised questions about freedom of the press. [AFP]
In an unprecedented action earlier this month, the Turkish government levied about a 1.7 billion-euro tax penalty against the country's largest media group, Dogan, which had already been fined 340m euros in February.
The penalties -- the largest ever imposed on a Turkish company -- could become a hurdle for the country's EU bid.
Dogan Media Group, which owns dozens of newspapers, magazines and TV channels, says it is being targeted because of an ongoing dispute with the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP).
In March, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged the public to boycott the Dogan's newspapers, for allegedly smearing the AKP's reputation through "baseless" corruption stories.
The articles contained allegations of government involvement in the defrauding of Lighthouse e.V., a charity founded in Germany by Turks.
According to the media, millions of donated euros were embezzled and transferred to Turkey in 2007.
A German court charged three Turkish citizens with corruption, and sent all of the documents to Turkey's judicial sector for further investigation.
The court also said that some members of the AKP could be tied to the corruption, including Zahid Akman, a close friend of Erdogan's.
The Dogan group claims the money that was illegally transferred to Turkey went to establishing pro-government news channels, such as Channel 7.
Despite constant coverage and public pressure, these claims have not yet been submitted to a court.
An investigation is said to be in progress.
Erdogan denies that the fines against Dogan are politically motivated, saying the tax authority is independent.
The Dogan Group owns nearly 50% of the Turkish media sector, including dailies like Hurriyet, Milliyet and Radikal, TV channels Kanal D and Star TV and CNNTurk, in partnership with Time-Warner.
The other half of the sector, except for a few independent outlets, is in the hands of pro-government businesses.
Under Turkish law, the Dogan group now has two options.
It can acknowledge the alleged tax irregularities and demand that the fine be reduced, or it can take the case to the tax court, after providing a substantial amount of collateral to the treasury.
The EU is now voicing concern.
A Union spokesperson said the penalties could affect Turkey's membership progress report due next month.
"I still really worry about freedom of expression and the rights of independent associations to form and say unpopular things. And as part of being a modern European democratic and pluralistic country ...
I still think that is a lesson [Turkey has to learn]," British European Parliament member Richard Howitt told Voice of America.
Take two: Serbia's JAT back on the market
The Serbian government has called a new tender for the sale of national flag carrier JAT Airways, but some economists are not optimistic about the outcome.

Serbia will once again attempt to sell national air carrier JAT Airways, a company whose debts are now estimated at about 300m euros.
The first tender for the sale of a 51% stake in the firm in 2008 fell through -- no company was interested in paying the set price of 51m euros.
Now the state has decided to change its strategy and offer potential partners a newly founded company that would be free from debt.
The condition for participation in the tender is that the bidding company must have transported at least 1.5 million passengers in 2010, and posted a balance of 200m euros.
The new company has been given the symbolic name NewCo.
Applications for participation in the tender will be accepted through September 30th.
Government representatives believe this time the offer will be much more attractive to potential investors.
"The partner is getting a wholly new company in which it will invest together with the state of Serbia, while also getting what is currently the healthiest in JAT -- the existing fleet, pilots, slots at the most attractive locations and with the most attractive dates, at the best airports in the world and Europe," State Secretary in Charge of Air Traffic Miodrag Miljkovic said.
But Belgrade economist Mahmut Busatlija worries about the success of JAT's sale.
"The tender was called at a time when the global economic crisis looks set to gain momentum again.
If that happens, people will first give up on travelling.
It is completely unclear who will enter a deal with the Serbian air carrier under such conditions," Busatlija told SETimes.
He finds another decision by the government controversial: writing off JAT's debt, by placing it on the backs of Serbia's tax payers.
"Instead of calling the tender, the state should have tried to restructure JAT, cut down its debts, and make the company more functional.
However, in such situations in Serbia, there is always too much politics and too little professionalism," Busatlija said.
Economist Milan Kovacevic says JAT's top asset is its exclusive flying rights to some destinations.
But even that does not guarantee the tender's success.
"The right to fly to attractive destinations is JAT's real value.
That is the trump card for finding a buyer, but with the prerequisite of the company previously shrugging off the weight of debts and excess employees," Kovacevic said.
In Belgrade, the political opposition also objected to the tender.
The Serbian Radical Party said JAT's property was worth 220m euros, and that the government wants to sell it below price.
"The Serbian government's decision to sell JAT through the strategic partnership model is a plan to give the company's property to foreigners for practically nothing, and to transfer JAT's debt to the state and Serbian citizens," the Radical Party insists.
The once powerful airline has seen a decline in operations over the past two decades.
According to official data, the JAT fleet currently only has 14 outdated airplanes -- ten Boeing 737-300s and four ATR72-200s.
Albanian Chrome in trouble
At the weekend, police removed hunger striking miners from the chrome mine in Bulqiza, Albania.
The Austrian mining company involved says it has retaken control of the mine.
By Linda Karadaku for Southeast European Times in Tirana -- 24/08/11
The strike at the chrome mine in northern Albania has lasted about a month. [Reuters]
Rohtraut Skatche-Depich, director of Deco-Metal (DCM), the parent company of Albanian Chrome (ACR), says she blames union representatives for the work stoppage, saying they have "their own agendas".
On Tuesday (August 22nd), the miners and the company reached an agreement, and the almost month-long strike came to an end.
DCM took control of the mine.
Skatche-Depich spoke with SETimes about the strike and Albania's chrome reserves.
SETimes : Why the interest in Albanian chrome?
It is because of its rich reserves, the increasing price in the European markets, or because Albania offers very good conditions for foreign investments?
Rohtraut Skatche-Depich: Well, it's probably a mixture.
Let me tell you that our company did business with Albanian chrome 20 years ago.
We are a company specialised in chrome and magnite, and we purchased chrome from Albania in the old days.
What I am trying to say is that we were aware of Albanian chrome as a source, we were aware of the quality, and our company specialised in marketing and mining chrome.
We already have a chrome mine in South Africa, we are even bringing South African chrome to Albania; we are blending this chrome, smelting it in the Elbasan plant and producing a very good, high value final product.
We have our own smelter in Elbasan, a processing plant, a ferrochrome processing plant with three furnaces in which we have invested a considerable amount of money.
In total, the DCM invested 32m euros in Albanian chrome [since 2007].
SETimes : So it seems you have important business interests in Albania?
Skatche-Depich: Yes, we do, we do. We have been in the chrome business for over 50 years.
We are doing chrome business not only in Albania, but also in South Africa and other regions of the world, so we are very specialised in the product.
SETimes : How much do you produce per year?
Skatche-Depich: We are producing about 3,000 tonnes of ferrochrome per month, which is used in the steel industry.
The ferrochrome that we are producing in Elbasan, we are exporting to the United States, to very big companies, like US Steel, Nuclear Steel and UCOR.
These are the biggest.
SETimes : So, you are saying that Albanian chrome that you are producing in Albania is worth exporting to different countries?
Skatche-Depich: Yes.
Canada, Germany ... exporting it all over really.
SETimes : Why do you have problems in the Bulqiza mine?
You have been blaming the union leaders for the situation.
Skatche-Depich: In my mind, this is very irresponsible, negative behaviour [by the Union representatives], damaging the workers there, their families, and even the interests of their country [when] Albania is trying to attract foreign investments to it.
SETimes : How important is Bulqiza mine for the region?
Skatche-Depich: Bulqiza mine is very important for Albania and especially for this region.
Of course, to us it is important because it has rich minerals, it does have good miners, it does have qualified, well-trained technicians.
I have great respect for the work that has been done there ... and I feel an obligation to develop the mine and the region there.
Turkey solidifies key role in Libya
Turkey's policy in Libya raises questions about how patient it will be with neighbouring Syria.
By Chase Winter for Southeast European Times -- 24/08/11

In an effort to show Turkey's leading role in Libya, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu arrived in Benghazi on Tuesday (August 23rd), to meet with the leaders of the National Transitional Council (NTC), becoming the first foreign minister to visit Libya since the rebels entered Tripoli.
Davutoglu pledged continued NATO support until security is established, underlining the need for a free, democratic, secure, stable, and united Libya.
He also pledged financial and material support, issues he said would be taken up at a meeting of the Libyan Contact Group political directors on Thursday in Istanbul.
"This is precisely why Turkish foreign policy is so clever," says Joshua Walker, a Transatlantic Fellow at the German Marshall Fund. "He is speaking on behalf of the international community and reaping the political benefits of being the first leader that will be covered extensively beyond just the Turkish media and further extends influence in Libya."

When the uprising against Colonel Muammar Qaddafi began in February, Turkey looked coolly on sanctions and NATO intervention.
Turkey was accused of "flip-flopping", following an ambiguous policy that was unable to balance interests and ideology.
Turkey's hesitation to turn on Qaddafi was largely driven by economic interests, centred on a burgeoning contracting and construction business.
Nearly 25,000 Turkish citizens were employed in Libya and contracting firms had undertaken over $20 billion in projects.
However, in May, Turkey called on Qaddafi to step down and recognised the rebel NTC in early July.
It has since played a proactive role in support of the rebels.
In July Turkey hosted the fourth Libya Contact Group meeting in Istanbul and over the past few weeks it has been providing the rebels with large quantities of fuel and money as they made their final push to Tripoli.
By recognising the rebels Turkey fell in line with the international community and calculated the rebels would eventually prevail.
Given its friendly relations with the NTC, Turkey has now set itself up to play a major economic and political role in Libya.
"Turkey will continue engaging Libya economically as it had done prior to the Arab Spring, but now, as Libya undergoes political transition, Turkey will also tout its democratic credentials to further engage the region," says Daphne McCurdy, a senior research associate at the Project on Middle East Democracy (POMED).
"In many ways Turkey is one of the rebels' most important allies now, since Ankara has the ability to bring regional clout and support to them.
And given its NATO membership and chairmanship of the OIC, it can truly bridge East and West for the rebels as they seek international support for a unified Libya," observes Walker.
What looks like the eminent fall of Qaddafi has also drawn parallels with the brutal crackdown unfolding in Syria, where Turkey has called on the regime to initiate reform and cease violence against demonstrators.
"What is happening in Libya is a lesson for the leaders of the region.
It shows that leaders who do not listen to their people cannot stay in power," Davutoglu warned on Monday.
Syrian promises of reform amid continued crackdown aren't viewed as credible by Turkey, with Davutoglu going so far as to say there is nothing more to talk to Assad about -- although Turkey has stopped short of breaking ties or calling for Assad to step down.
Yet the Libyan experience has shown Turkey can change its position very quickly -- something the Assad regime may be beginning to recognise.
"If anyone in Syria thought that 'brotherly love' between Assad and [Prime Minister] Erdogan would sustain this relationship, they are sorely mistaken.
Turkey has already made a rhetorical turn on Syria like it did on Libya, the question is when will there be concrete action, either individually or in concert with the international community, with Turkey leading," says Walker.
Merkel delivers tough messages to Belgrade
Although some say Serbia's European integration and Kosovo are not connected issues, Germany's Angela Merkel brought a different view to Belgrade.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 24/08/11
During a news conference in Belgrade on Tuesday (August 23rd), Merkel linked Serbia’s EU integration to events in Kosovo. [Nikola Barbutov/SETimes]
German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrived in Serbia on Tuesday (August 23rd) amid 35 degree Celsius temperatures, and her message to President Boris Tadic did nothing to stem the heat.
During the meetings, Merkel linked the continuation of Serbia's European integration with Kosovo.
That was the last message Serbian officials wanted to hear, as they were certain that European integration and Kosovo were two separate processes.
Merkel's message was different: Germany wants Serbia in the EU, but to that end, apart from reforms in the country, progress must be made in the dialog with Pristina, EULEX should be enabled to operate in the entire territory of Kosovo and Serbia's "parallel structures" in Kosovo should be abolished.
"Germany had recognised Kosovo, while Serbia has not.
That is the situation in which progress needs to be made," Merkel said.
She did not, however, demand that Belgrade formally recognise Pristina's independence.
Belgrade does not see those structures as parallel, rather as its own state bodies that operate in Kosovo, the independence of which Belgrade refuses to acknowledge.
Merkel also said that resolving the matter of Kosovo is a long process, but stressed that it must be immediately clear to Belgrade what is expected from it on the path to the EU.
"That is why it is better to resolve difficult issues today, instead of leaving them for tomorrow," she said.
Tadic did not react to allegations of "parallel structures" but said that Serbia has its principles and "has no illusion" that it could bring conflict into the EU.
"Serbia has its principles in resolving conflicts and we want to find a very practical way with our German friends to preserve the dignity of all peoples in the region," Tadic said.
He promised that Serbia would continue the dialog with Pristina authorities.
Professor at Belgrade's Faculty of Political Sciences Predrag Simic said that Merkel's message is that Serbian authorities should accept the Ahtisaari plan for Kosovo.
"Belgrade will have to accept the implementation of the Ahtisaari plan, and the price of its refusal to do so will be the blocking of EU integration," Simic told SETimes.
Serbia dismissed the Ahtisaari plan, because the country's allies in the UN Security Council -- Russia and China -- blocked its adoption in the UN.
The plan envisions the independence of Kosovo, with a certain level of autonomy for the Serb community.
Belgrade has supported the Serbs in northern Kosovo, where Pristina's institutions are not operative.
"The potential abolition of these institutions would be very bad for the Serbian community in Kosovo, but also for the interests of Serbia in the province," Kosovo Compromise Project Director Aleksandar Mitic told SETimes.
Pristina officials lauded Merkel's messages.
Kosovo Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci said Belgrade had received "clear and just messages".
But analysts suggest that Merkel's visit had a deeper dimension.
Simic said it was the first by the leader of a G7 member since the declaration of Serbia's independence from its union with Montenegro in 2006.
"That importance is all the greater, because Germany is probably the most stable economy and the backbone of the entire eurozone at a time of deep economic crisis," Simic said.
Since 2000, Germany has invested 1.27 billion euros in Serbia.
Last year Serbia exported goods worth 760m euros to Germany, while German exports to Serbia totalled 1.3 billion euros.
Corridor 8: A Way to Bring People Together
Representatives of the countries involved in Pan-European Transport Corridor 8 discussed accelerated construction of this road and railway route during a recent meeting in Tirana.
By Valentin Nesovski for Southeast European Times in Skopje - 15/07/03
Pan-European Transport Corridor 8, which passes through Bulgaria, Macedonia and Albania and connects Turkish and Italian ports, provides an opportunity to enhance regional co-operation, according to a declaration of officials from countries involved in the project.
They met in Tirana on 30 June.
Plans include a highway and rail routes, oil and gas pipelines, a long-distance power grid and, in a later phase, telecommunication cables. The corridor starts in the Black Sea ports of Varna and Burgas, passes through Sofia, Skopje and Tirana, and ends in the Albanian Adriatic port of Durres.
The Italian ports of Bari and Brindisi are seen as the gates to the EU, while Turkish ports connect the corridor with the Caucasus Basin in Asia.
Many expect that the costs of transporting oil to the EU could be significantly lowered by construction of an oil pipeline through the corridor.
The project is in different phases of construction.
In Macedonia, the Skopje-Gostivar highway is not yet complete.
Railway track has been completed in the stretch from Skopje to the Albanian border, and construction of the stretch to the Bulgarian border is under way.
In Bulgaria, there is no highway from Sofia to the Macedonian border, whereas the railway line only needs a junction with the Macedonian side.
Albania has yet to invest in the project.
Experts are calling for reconstruction and modernisation of the ports in Bulgaria and Albania, to achieve better service capacity.
The EU and Stability Pact have funded construction of parts of the corridor.
Participants in the Tirana meeting expressed satisfaction with the intensified co-operation among countries in the region and with the reform programmes of their respective governments.
"The corridor is not only intended as a transport connection between the countries but a means of getting peoples, cultures, and economies in the region closer to each other so that the region can completely integrate itself into the Euro-Atlantic structures," said Macedonian Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva.
She added that co-ordination would be more efficient if every country assigns a group of experts to monitor activities in technical and financial terms.
The meeting launched an initiative to open a Secretariat of Corridor 8 in Bari, Italy.
Officials would be tasked with intensifying intergovernmental co-operation.
Parties jockey for support well ahead of Serbia's elections
Although the general election won't take place until the first half of 2012, campaigns are well under way.

Campaigning ahead of Serbia's general election next year is already in full swing, as political parties work to attract voters and posters and billboards endorsing various parties pepper Belgrade.
The ruling coalition, led by President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party, has cited job creation and progress in the EU integration process as examples of successful policies.
The opposition, however, criticises the ruling coalition's unfulfilled promises, as well as the low standard of living and pervasive corruption.
Public opinion analyst Srdjan Bogosavljevic emphasises that public dissatisfaction with the standard of living could have a major impact on voter turnout in the next election.
"Citizens are very unhappy.
The average net salary in Serbia has been constantly decreasing over the past three years.
There is a great desire for change, but the citizens simply don't know who to vote for from the current pool of candidates," Bogosavljevic says.
He believes that the public expected much more from the political changes of 2000, and that their disappointment is beginning to show.
Bogosavljevic expects representatives of the ruling coalition to highlight "how no one would have been able to handle the economic crisis better than they would, and that political change would destabilise Serbia" in the upcoming election.
On the other hand, Bogosavljevic predicts the opposition will focus on the poor economic situation to bolster their campaign.
He says that the public's desire for change can be the opposition's trump card, in addition to "stoking nationalist sentiment" over the Kosovo issue.
"Kosovo is a topic that can be used in times of serious tension … if nothing is happening there, and the situation is calm, then the economy and corruption take precedence."
Spokeswoman for the Democratic Party Jelena Trivan tells SETimes "it will be much easier for the opposition in the upcoming campaign, because all it has to do is be loud in its criticism, while the authorities have to explain their actions and what they have done to improve the lives of citizens."
Trivan says the government can boast that signs of an economic recovery are beginning to appear.
Unlike some EU countries, Serbia has not faced bankruptcy or excessive indebtedness to international financial institutions.
"We will also highlight the progress made in European integration, as well as our successes in fighting organised crime and implementing judicial reform," Trivan says.
Many opinion polls put the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), headed by Tomislav Nikolic, in the lead.
Marko Djuric, an SNS official, says "deep and thorough change" will be the focus of the party's campaign.
He adds that the ruling coalition contributes to the increasing wealth of the privileged classes and the impoverishment of the majority of citizens.
"We will offer a concrete programme in each field and for each segment of society.
We have already unveiled our anti-corruption platform, and we will present to the citizens our plans for all other areas, especially the economy," Djuric tells SETimes.
He expects the coming campaign to be "a competition of ideas" and sees Tadic's Democratic Party as the Progressive's greatest political opponent.
Bulgaria's census data shows aging population
Census data sparks worry over demographic trends and disagreement on country's ethnic makeup.

The census registered 7.3 million people live in Bulgaria, more than half-a-million less than in 2001.
"We have one of the worst situations in Europe in terms of aging and a very serious share of the people are in their third [late elderly] age.
As a result, birth rates are going down," Bulgarian Academy of Science demography expert Elitsa Dimitrova told SETimes.
Census data show the greatest growth in the number of people over 65 -- from 16.8% in 2001 to 18.5% today.
Experts say the drop in the population is a decades-long trend mostly due to a negative birth rate, but in a third of the cases external migration is a factor.
At the current rate, the country's population will be less than 5.4 million by 2060.
More resources are needed to reverse the trend, but Dimitrova argues "it will continue to be aggravated because there will be less economically active people".
Almost a quarter of the population, or 1.7 million, are above "working age".
The part of the census concerning ethnicity proved most controversial and disparate political groups questioned whether the results reflect reality.
Many are surprised that the number of Roma decreased, given their traditionally high birth rates, though their relative share inched up 0.2% to 4.9% compared to 2001.
Dimitrova said the probable reason is that answering the question about ethnicity was optional; many Roma probably declared themselves as Bulgarians or belonging to other ethnic groups.
The Roma remain the third most numerous ethnicity.
"It's not true that the number of Roma has dropped," United Roma Union Chairman Zarko Chankov told SETimes.
"Many Roma hide their ethnicity because they are afraid of discrimination, especially the ones who are better educated and have managed to integrate in society," Chankov said.
He insists migration abroad -- the other likely reason offered by experts – did not have a great impact because Roma could participate in the census online.
Every Roma family had at least one member remain in Bulgaria who could register them while officials visited citizens' homes.
Sociologist Tzvetozar Tomov also doubts the official figures.
"There are various assessments and some of them suggest the number of Roma is actually double what was reported," Tomov told SETimes.
Census results showed the number of Turks, the second biggest ethnic group, declined by 0.6% to 8.8% of the population.
A civil society representative from "Together for Hope", who requested anonymity, disagreed with the census data.
"If there is such a trend, it is probably due to factors such as migration and people with dual citizenship.
We have many such people in our municipality and some of them were probably not in Bulgaria during the census," the representative told SETimes.
"Another factor is aging.
There are many villages in Kardzhali that are mostly inhabited by old people," she added.
Macedonian community representatives issued a statement claiming that the number of Macedonians is grossly understated at 1,600 people, adding that the community does not recognise the results.
The census reveals that a fifth of Bulgarians have attained higher education.
"This is a positive trend," Dimitrova said, though noting that education quality is a different issue.
Various surveys suggest the standard of education has fallen dramatically in the past 20 years.
For the first time, the census included a category of people --1.2% of the population or 81,000 -- who have never set foot in school.
Turkey's arms manufacturers target the Middle East
Turkey seeks to add arms exports as a component of its diplomacy and economic policy.
By Aaron Stein for Southeast European Times in Istanbul -- 09/08/11

Turkey's bustling domestic arms industry has set its sights on the lucrative Middle Eastern export market.
For now, arms exports to the region are limited, but Turkey's private sector ambitions to become a major arms exporter may have larger geopolitical and strategic implications.
The AKP made developing the country's indigenous defence industry a national priority and initiated a policy to increase government investment in local research and development spending in 2004.
The strategy appears to have paid off -- Turkey exported nearly $1 billion worth of arms in 2010, up from $200 million in the early 2000s.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan campaigned on transforming Ankara into a hub for the defence industry.
The ambitious centerpiece of this policy is the AKP's determination to produce high-tech military equipment -- fighter aircraft, helicopters, and drones -- which it could then market abroad.
According to Birol Baskan, at Georgetown University's Qatar campus, "Turkey has a thriving defence industry and it is now in a position to look for foreign markets.
Turkey's deepening military relations will not only help this industry expand further, but also increase Turkey's soft power and influence in the region."
Ankara is actively seeking to deepen economic ties with neighbours across a host of areas such as tourism, agriculture, husbandry, manufacturing, construction, health and transportation.
This is part of a wider belief that economic interdependence and regional stability will benefit Turkey's economic and security situation.
"Turkey made a true transition to an export-oriented economic growth model under the AKP," says Baskan, adding that the Arab world and Iran are attractive markets for Turkey.
"AKP's conservative background helped in gaining access to these markets dominated by the US, European and the East Asian giants," he says.
Yet Turkey's military relationship with the Middle East is still in its infancy and Turkish firms have encountered difficulties competing against major exporters like the United States and European countries.
However, Baskan believes that "in the coming years Turkey will invest more in this relationship."
A primary motivation for deepening military co-operation with the Gulf States is a desire to expand Turkey's "immediate and regional sphere of influence, in part to make itself as indispensable a player as possible to powers outside the region, such as the US but chiefly the EU", argues Aram Nerguizian, a visiting fellow in strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Security.
"If Turkey could consolidate its role and leadership in the Middle East, this could present the EU with a compelling reason to consider Turkey's accession to the EU.
Middle East countries, in turn, could consider a growing role for a new Sunni bulwark in the region, potentially against Shiite Iran," he says.
Baskan disagrees, arguing that "Turkey has its own reasons to engage the Middle East and it does not seem to care too much about how the US and the EU views Turkey's deepening relations with the Middle East."
However, the turmoil engulfing the region could complicate Ankara's efforts to penetrate the Middle Eastern market.
Turkey's rapprochement with Syria is unraveling and business interest by Turkish entrepreneurs appears to be faltering.
Meanwhile, poor relations with Israel -- a significant arms producer -- have impacted the countries' military co-operation.
According to Nerguizian, events unfolding in the Middle East leave "many unanswered questions as to what Turkey's role will look like at a time when the conservative Arab monarchies are so focused on internal stability and mutual survival".
Greek regulator bans short selling until October
The panic that has hit global markets in recent days saw stocks falling across the world, including in several Balkan countries.
(Various sources -- 05/08/11 - 09/08/11)
Shares on the Athens Stock Exchange plunged to their lowest level in more than 14 years. [Reuters]
A two-month ban on short selling on the Athens Stock Exchange entered into force on Tuesday (August 9th) morning, after the bourse's main index sank to its lowest level in more than 14 years at the start of the week.
Announcing its decision following the end of Monday's session, Greece's securities regulator, the Hellenic Capital Markets Commission, said the move was prompted by extraordinary circumstances and would be effective until October 7th.
"The board of the capital market commission, after considering the urgent circumstances on the Greek market, has decided to ban short selling in listed stocks on the Athens bourse," Reuters quoted the commission as saying.
In short selling, the seller does not own the stock, but borrows it and sells it, expecting that its value will decrease, when he or she can buy it back at a lower price and keep the difference.
The Greek regulator decided to impose a ban on the practice after the Athens general index dropped 6% during Monday's session, ending at 998.24 points, thus slipping to a level below the psychologically important 1,000-point mark for the first time since January 1997.
It is the third time since the global financial crisis broke out in late 2008 that the body has resorted to such a measure.
According to commission officials, it was primarily foreign investors that conducted most of the short-selling activity on Monday.
"We saw a continuing increase in short-selling positions and marginal sell orders coming from short positions were really having an effect on the market," Financial Times quoted the regulator's chairman, Anastassios Gabrielides, as saying.
He also suggested that the ban could be lifted before October 7th.
Monday's decline reflected a host of recent unfavourable developments, the latest being the one-notch downgrade of the US debt's top AAA rating by Standard and Poor's (S&P) rating agency last week.
It came amid a spiralling crisis in the Eurozone that has further fuelled concerns that other debt-laden members of the 17-nation club, aside from the already bailed out Greece, Ireland and Portugal, might need rescue aid to avoid default.
Just days after the July 21st deal on a fresh 109-billion-euro bailout for Greece, fears grew that Italy and Spain, the third- and the fourth-largest economies among the 17 EU nations using the euro, could be dragged into the area's widening debt crisis.
A set of measures aimed at convincing markets that the Eurozone can deal with the ongoing crisis have failed to produce that effect.
The panic sparked by S&P's announcement last week hit not only the Greek bourse, but spread also to many other stock markets on Monday, including those of Bulgaria, Serbia and Turkey.
Of the three countries, Bulgaria appeared to be least hit with its main SOFIX blue chips index dropping 2.32% to 390.07 points at the close of the session.
Meanwhile, Serbian and Turkish stocks each fell the most in the course of the past about three years.
Serbia's Belex15 index slumped nearly 5.9%, ending at 639.33 points at close Monday.
Investors' shaken confidence also saw Turkey's benchmark Istanbul stock index fall by 7.1%, the largest decline since October 2008, to 52,284 points -- the lowest level recorded since March last year.
Despite Apology, RS War Crimes Co-operation Still Falls Short
The RS government's acknowledgment of the Srebrenica massacre was welcomed as a positive step, but doubts remain about its commitment to complying with international obligations.
By Antonio Prlenda for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo – 02/12/04

After years of foot-dragging, Republika Srpska last month officially acknowledged the Srebrenica massacre, publishing a formal apology to victims' families on the government Web site.
However, authorities in the Bosnian Serb-run entity have failed to convince the international community of their readiness to co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal.
"The government of the RS commiserates with the pain of the relatives of [the victims] of Srebrenica, and truly regrets and apologise for the tragedy they experienced," the apology read.
It was part of the official response to a report by the entity government's Srebrenica Commission.
"The report doubtlessly demonstrates that, in the area of Srebrenica in July 1995, crimes of huge extent were committed by means of rude violation of the international humanitarian law.
The government of the RS is committed to, and it assumes decisive measures to, bring to the justice all persons who committed war crimes," authorities said.
The Srebrenica Commission was established when the Human Rights Chamber for BiH accepted 49 lawsuit applications filed by Srebrenica victims' families against the RS government for its failure to provide and disclose information about missing family members.
In its decision on 7 March 2003, the Chamber ordered RS to provide the necessary response.
The final report came after several extensions of deadlines, pressure from the international Office of the High Representative (OHR) and re-establishment of the commission -- adding a Bosniak and international expert.
Victims' families expressed moderate satisfaction with the RS government's statement, but said it had come grudgingly and fell well short of fulfilling the entity's obligations.
"We do not need an apology that came based on the pressure of the international community. The report did not mention genocide.
We need to see those responsible for the crime to be brought to justice," said Nura Begovic from the Organisation of Srebrenica Women.
While welcoming the report, the OHR and the heads of EU missions in BiH also called on RS authorities to arrest war crimes indictees, as well as to take further steps to locate mass graves and identify victims.
In her report to the UN Security Council last month, chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte criticised RS authorities for their failure to apprehend a single indictee in the nine years since the 1992-1995 conflict ended.
According to del Ponte, war crimes fugitives hiding in RS continue to enjoy the protection of powerful networks.
On Tuesday (30 November) a Sarajevo newspaper published evidence suggesting that top war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic -- who led the forces that over-ran Srebrenica, and is believed to have ordered the massacre -- remained on Bosnian Serb Army rolls until 2002, and may even have drawn pay.
Serbia-Montenegro Ministers' Council Introduces Civil Army Service
Under a new decree, conscientious objectors will have the opportunity to complete their military service by working for civil organisations.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 29/09/03
A decree establishing civil military service in Serbia-Montenegro will go into effect on 15 October.
The Minister's Council adopted the measure in response to a two-year deadline set by the Council of Europe (CoE), which Serbia-Montenegro joined earlier this year.
The regulation will be valid until a new law is passed, most likely in 2004.
Conscientious objectors will now have the opportunity to complete their military service by working for health organisations, institutions for the disabled, or other institutions of general interest, as determined by the Serbia-Montenegro defence minister.
However, the regulation falls short of meeting international standards.
The CoE has recommended that civil and armed services be synchronised, but under the regulation, conscientious objectors will have to serve 13 months, while only nine months are required for those serving in the army.
Out of around 33,000 soldiers in the Serbia-Montenegro Army, only 44 recruits have so far refused to serve.
Military authorities say they have determined that introducing civil service will not endanger the armed forces' need for recruits.
According to army sources, the number of conscientious objectors has increased slightly in the past few years, but remains only a small percentage of those obliged to complete their military service.
Under the new system, requests for civil service will not be accepted automatically.
Instead, they must be granted by special commissions appointed by the defence minister.
The panels would include a psychologist, theologian, physician, and two army representatives.
Their purpose will be to check the sincerity of the conscientious objector.
For example, they will inquire whether the recruit truly belongs to a religious community that prohibits the carrying and use of weapons, or whether he really has an aversion towards weapons.
This will be determined by checking whether the recruit has ever applied for a license to own a weapon.
According to his preferences, the recruit will be sent to serve in a civil institution.
He will have the status of a civilian, with the obligation to follow the rules of the institution to which he is appointed.
EU renews trade preferences for Balkan countries

The EU decided on Friday (December 30th) to renew trade preferences for Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Kosovo until 2015.
The preferences, which expired at the end of December 2010, will allow duty-free access of nearly all products from the region to the bloc.
All exporters will be able to claim compensation for the duties they paid in 2011.
Greeks ushered in the New Year with new higher electricity prices as the state-controlled electricity company PPC increased rates by 9.2%.
The hike was lower than the 17% the company had requested and the 12.7% the country's energy regulator had recommended in order to bring prices into line with the true cost of energy under the EU/IMF bailout terms.
Turkey gave Russia a green light to start the building of the South Stream gas pipeline under the Black Sea, Gazprom announced on December 28th. South Stream, which is due to become operational in 2015, will bring up to 63b cubic metres of Russian gas annually to Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary, Slovenia, Austria and Italy in one leg, and to Croatia, Macedonia, Greece and Turkey in a second one.
Bosnia and Herzegovina's parliament passed the state budget for 2011 in an emergency procedure on Saturday (December 31st), shortly after the three main leaders in the country agreed on forming a state-level government.
Without the move, all payments to state institutions would have stalled on January 1st.
The budget was set at 500m euros.
Romania will increase mining royalties for gold and other precious metals from 4 to 8%, the government announced on December 28th.
The measure, along with a previous hike in royalties for silver and platinum, is expected to bring an additional 65m euros to the state budget this year.
Telecom giant Deutsche Telecom reached a settlement with US authorities last week on charges of paying more than $95m in bribes to government officials in Macedonia and Montenegro.
The accusations against the company and its Hungarian subsidiary Magyar Telekom had to do with illegal payments made in 2005 and 2006 to secure favourable contracts in Montenegro, and to keep rivals out of the market in Macedonia.
Kosovo ended 2011 with economic growth of 5.3% compared to 3.9% in 2010, Economic Development Minister Besim Beqai announced on Friday (December 30th).
He noted the figure is higher than previous estimates, and slightly below the IMF's projections of 5.5%.
Serbia and Russian state-controlled gas giant Gazprom have reached an agreement to lower the price for natural gas deliveries to the Balkan state by 12%, Srbijagas announced on December 27th.
Under the deal, due to be signed in March, Belgrade will be paying $478 instead of $545 per 1,000 cubic metres of natural gas until the two sides agree on a new long-term contract.
Turkey registered a record increase in exports in 2011, Economy Minister Zafer Caglayan said on Monday (January 2nd.) According to him, exports last year rose by 18.2% reaching the historic high of $134.6 billion.

Trade with Serbia-Montenegro highlighted at forums in Washington, Podgorica
Two recent conferences in the United States and Montenegro highlighted prospects for increased trade and investment in Serbia-Montenegro.

Economic relations between Serbia-Montenegro and the United States are improving, Serbia-Montenegro Ambassador Ivan Vujacic told a trade and investment conference held in Washington last month.
The event was organised by the SCG-US Business Council in partnership with the US Embassy in Belgrade. More than 20 companies from the telecommunications, banking, construction, infrastructure, production and air transport industries were represented.
The SCG-US Business Council was established in April 2004 with the goal of promoting the export of Serbia-Montenegro's products.
Its chairman, John Sailor, expressed satisfaction with the success of the conference, adding that this was only the beginning of an intensive business dialogue between businesspeople and institutions from the United States and Serbia-Montenegro.
According to Sailor, American businesses have demonstrated a clear interest in trading and investing in Serbia-Montenegro.
In a taped video message played at the conference, US Ambassador Michael Polt said the current macroeconomic and relative political stability presents an opportunity for investment.
The region is recovering and making progress in accomplishing reforms, and the business environment keeps improving, Polt said.
Vojin Vlahovic, Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic's adviser for international economic relations and privatisation, briefed attendees on the privatisation progress in Montenegro and the outlook for 2006.
The Montenegrin delegation included Agriculture Minister Milutin Simovic, Agency for Foreign Investment Promotion director Petar Ivanovic, Road Infrastructure Directorate chief Ratko Ivanovic, Port of Bar executive director Miodrag Gvozdenovic, and Vesna Maras, a representative of Plantaze Company.
Also in November, a business forum on strengthening economic relations between Montenegro and the Czech Republic took place at the Chamber of Commerce in Podgorica.
Djukanovic and his Czech counterpart, Jiri Paroubek, were present.
The Czech leader said his country stood ready to assist Serbia-Montenegro on its path towards the EU and Euro-Atlantic institutions, adding that he shared
Djukanovic's optimism about future bilateral ties. Djukanovic, meanwhile, said that Czechs were among the increasing number of foreign investors interested in Montenegro.
The rise in interest confirms that Montenegro is establishing a favourable and secure investment environment, thus creating a modern state and economy, the prime minister added.
Paroubek also met with President Filip Vujanovic, who expressed his satisfaction with ever improving economic relations.
They agreed there is room for expanding co-operation, particularly in the economic area.
During the forum, a co-operation agreement between the Czech and Montenegrin chambers of commerce was signed.
Croatia's Journey Towards EU Membership
EC President Romano Prodi presented a questionnaire to be answered by the Croatian government as part of the country's bid for EU membership.
By Natasa Radic for Southeast European Times in Zagreb - 14/07/03
European Commission President Romano Prodi visited Zagreb on 10 July to present the government with a special document containing more than 2,500 questions.
The answers that Croatian authorities provide in the next 100 days will form the basis for the Commission's opinion concerning the start of accession negotiations with Croatia.
The task is an enormous one for Croatian institutions involved in the process.
Due to the strict deadlines, a significant number of ministries will not have summer holidays this year.
"Our journey together starts today and in a few years it will take Croatia into the EU.
And today I am here to share the emotion, the expectation and anticipation this great journey evokes," Prodi told the Croatian Parliament, asking the representatives to stay united on the path to Europe.
By applying to join the Union, he said, Croatia has reaffirmed its European vocation and has declared that the long and trying period of war, division and nationalism is truly over.
During his one-day visit, Prodi met with President Stipe Mesic and Prime Minister Ivica Racan. He also met briefly with the leaders of the main opposition parties.
With the approach of parliamentary elections, expected in November, Prodi sought to confirm that all the possible election winners share the same European ambitions.
The 150-page document Prodi brought with him from Brussels includes questions related to the political, economic and administrative situation in the country.
The chapter dealing with co-operation with The Hague tribunal has approximately 30 detailed questions.
The answers must be sent back to Brussels by the end of October, and will form the basis of the comprehensive report delivered by Commission experts.
After the answers are delivered, the Council of Ministers must make a political decision to formally invite Croatia to start accession negotiations.
In the best-case scenario, Croatia could get its invitation for negotiations next spring.
During his short stay in Zagreb, Prodi emphasised that each country will be assessed individually, but added that he strongly supports regional co-operation in the Western Balkans.
"The process of enlargement for the Balkan countries is one and indivisible.
And ulitimately the region as a whole must be fully integrated into the Union," he said.
Meanwhile, a new poll published by the daily Vecernji list found that 70.9 per cent of Croatian citizens favour joining the EU, 80 per cent back regional co-operation, and nearly 60 per cent believe Croatia should co-operate with The Hague tribunal.
Asked about the refugee return process, 49.1 per cent said they support the return of Serb refugees, while 32.9 per cent oppose the idea.
The results were almost identical to those of another survey conducted in February, which also found strong support for the EU integration process.
Serbia, EU sign SAA
Serbia and the EU signed the Stabilisation and Association Agreement on Tuesday, but implementation will occur only after Serbia achieves full co-operation with the ICTY.
The EU fast-tracked Serbia's signing to boost pro-Western parties' prospects ahead of May 11th elections.

Top Serbian and EU representatives signed the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), the first step by Western Balkan countries towards full integration with the EU, in Luxembourg on Tuesday (April 29th).
Ratification will occur only after the EU Council of Ministers has found Serbia to be fully co-operating with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
The tribunal wants Serbia to extradite four more indictees, including Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic and Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic.
Signing the pact were Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn and the EU's 27 foreign ministers.
Serbian President Boris Tadic and EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana attended the ceremony.
Rehn said the signing sent a clear signal to all Serbs that they had a future in Europe.
He called the SAA signing a turning point in relations between Serbia and the EU.
Solana said that the EU would be incomplete without the Western Balkan countries.
"This [the EU] is your home; this is where you belong," he said.
Tadic voiced hope that Serbia would become an EU membership candidate by the end of the year, which would give the country access to more funds from the Union budget.
He also shrugged off accusations that signing the SAA meant recognising the independence of Kosovo.
"Serbia has both the right and obligation to defend its own integrity and identity, and there I am primarily talking about Kosovo and Metohija.
And Serbia at the same time has every right to demand its European future," Tadic said.
He promised that the state would fulfill all obligations to the ICTY, despite significant disappointment over the release of former Kosovo Liberation Army Commander Ramush Haradinaj, who was acquitted earlier this month of charges of crimes against Serbs and ethnic Albanian collaborators.
However, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and Serbian Radical Party officials denounced the signing, claiming that it meant acceptance of Kosovo's independence.
Kostunica described it as "an unconstitutional and anti-state act", which does not obligate Serbia.
"We will never let anyone certify Kosovo's independence on behalf of Serbia, and that is why Tadic's signature is absolutely worthless," Kostunica said.
Rehn, however, dismissed any links between the SAA and the status of Kosovo.
He noted that the agreement states that Kosovo is under UN administration, which makes it "neutral" concerning the issue of Kosovo's status.
However, Kosovo so far has been recognised by as many as 18 EU members.

Croatia's government and banks reached an agreement August 17th to fix the exchange rate of local housing loans denominated in Swiss francs in an effort to ease the situation of borrowers amid the sharp hike in the Swiss currency's exchange rate against the kuna.
Under the deal, the exchange rate for the loans will be fixed at 5.80 kuna for one franc and will be valid for five years.
IMF Resident Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Milan Cuc said on Friday (August 19th) that he believes the country's 1.2 billion-euro arrangement with the Fund should be thoroughly overhauled in light of the significant delay in meeting the conditions set in it.
In an interview with the Dnevni Avaz newspaper, Cuc warned that any slowdown in the global economy would also affect BiH, where the political situation is far from stable.
Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha and Kosovo Minister of Economic Development Besim Beqai discussed ways to boost co-operation in the field of economy and energy Monday (August 22nd) in Tirana.
Beqai presented a plan to expand bilateral ties, especially after the embargo on Serbian imports.
Around 700 Bulgarian companies are taking their first steps on the Kosovo market after the Pristina-imposed embargo on Serbian goods.
A Bulgarian delegation led by Agriculture and Foods Minister Miroslav Naydenov visited Kosovo last week to study opportunities to export Bulgarian foods.
Macedonian Transport and Communications Minister Mile Janakieski and Turkish counterpart Binali Yildirim signed an agreement in Skopje on Friday (August 19th) to set up regular flights between their countries.
The deal also marked the entrance of Turkish low-cost air carrier Pegasus to the Macedonian market.
Pegasus will fly direct from Skopje to Istanbul on Mondays and Fridays and to the Aegean province of Izmir on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays at prices starting from 30 euros.
Montenegro's Central Bank said that the latest turmoil on global financial markets will mostly affect the country's retail sector.
Bank official Zorica Kalezic told the Atlas TV channel that the US debt crisis and the eurozone woes will affect exports, the overall market situation and the inflow of foreign direct investments.
Turkey is planning to replace the country's Free Trade Zone concept with Economic Free Trade Zones, which will include residences, offices, production facilities and even tourism facilities, Economy Minister Zafer Caglayan told Anadolu news agency on Monday (August 22nd).
"These projects will help us decrease the current account deficit and draw more foreign direct investments," he explained, adding that "we will build places like Dubai, Singapore, Rotterdam and Los Angeles."
The Romanian government on August 17th approved the technical and economic parameters of a plan to build 1,400 flats under the Homes for Youth programme.
A total of 68m euros will be invested in the project, which aims to secure affordable housing for the young.
IMF officials began talks with Serbia on a precautionary agreement Monday (August 22nd).
Talks will focus on the parameters of a deal, which, if reached, would last 18 months and would give Serbia access to 200% of its IMF quota of around 1 billion euros.
The precautionary agreement gives a country the right to draw funds, but only if a need arises.

Turkey Urged to Ensure Irreversibility of Reforms
Turkey has received considerable praise for its reform progress.
However, the country is being urged to ensure that the reforms, both political and economic, are irreversible.

"The talks will be difficult and will last long, and Ankara's reforms will determine the course of talks," German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told the Turkish daily Milliyet. [AFP]
Turkey must change its way of thinking if it wants to succeed in its EU membership bid, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told the Turkish daily Milliyet in an interview published Monday (2 May), on the eve of his two-day visit to the country.
Accession talks between Ankara and the EU are due to begin on 3 October.
Brussels has made it clear that the country will only be able to join the 25-nation bloc after it has met all requirements for membership, particularly the political criteria.
The measures Turkey must implement before entering the Union include improving freedom of expression, religious freedom and minority rights, and eradication of torture and ill treatment.
Noting that the negotiations would neither be short nor easy, the German leader stressed that their outcome would hinge on Ankara's efforts to ensure that the required reforms are effective and lasting.
While praised for its progress in passing the required legislation, Turkey has been criticised for dragging its feet in terms of effective implementation.
"Turkey has taken important steps since last December's EU summit, when it was decided to begin Ankara's accession talks on 3 October," said Schroeder, whose government supports Turkey's EU bid. "The talks will be difficult and will last long, and Ankara's reforms will determine the course of talks."
Human rights and other basic freedoms must be guaranteed, Deutsche Press Agentur quoted the German leader as saying.
To ensure that the reform process is irreversible, the new legislation must become part of the daily lives of ordinary people, he added.
Schroeder arrives in Ankara late Tuesday, after a brief stop in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
He is scheduled to meet with President Ahmet Necdet Sezer and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday before proceeding to Istanbul to attend a Turkish-German economic forum.
Last week, IMF Managing Director Rodrigo Rato also called for ensuring the irreversibility of Turkish reforms, saying this is a key step the country must take for the expansion of foreign direct investment to be sustained.
"Turkey needs to entrench its economic reforms," Rato said Friday at a meeting of Turkey's Investment Advisory Council -- a high-powered group that includes foreign business leaders, heads of international institutions and senior Turkish government officials and business executives. "In this regard, I am encouraged by the government's resolve to put in place landmark banking and social security laws.
Delivering on the promise of EU accession and successfully implementing the government's new policy agenda should help make the reform process irreversible."
US, Montenegro sign military co-operation agreement
Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic hopes that the military co-operation agreement he and US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice signed on Tuesday will help his country attract more foreign investment.

The United States and Montenegro signed an agreement Tuesday (May 1st), paving the way for enhanced bilateral military co-operation.
The pact, known as Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), was signed by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic, less than nine months after the formal establishment of diplomatic ties last August.
Montenegro declared independence on June 3rd, 2006.
Two weeks earlier, the majority of voters in the Adriatic republic of just over 630,000 people supported its secession from the loose union established with Serbia in 2003.
"The United States welcomes Montenegro as a friend and a partner, a partner in the increasing stability in the Balkans," Rice said at a joint press conference with Vujanovic.
The military co-operation agreement, she added, "establishes a basis for United States military personnel to operate in Montenegro for mutually agreed activities".
A statement issued by the US Defence Department on Tuesday, further explains that SOFAs define the legal status of US military personnel and their property in the territory of the host nation.
They also delineate rights and responsibilities between the governments of the two countries "regarding criminal and civil jurisdiction, tax and customs matters, entry and exit of personal property, and resolving damage claims".
The pact, Rice said, will allow the Montenegrin and US armed forces to carry out regular exchanges, training exercises and other co-operation activities.
Vujanovic, who heads a delegation that includes Montenegro's foreign and defence ministers, Milan Rocen and Boro Vucinic, signed the agreement during his first official visit to the United States since his country became independent.
The conclusion of the deal "is a confirmation of the friendship between Montenegro and the United States and a major step towards enhancement of these relations," he said in remarks at the signing ceremony. "I wish to thank the US administration and the US citizens for the assistance they have provided to Montenegro in building democratic institutions, in affirming democratic values, and in reforming our economy."
Montenegro is seeking entry into the EU and NATO.
In December, Vujanovic signed the framework document for his country's accession to the Alliance's Partnership for Peace programme, a major first step towards eventual membership.
Voicing support for Euro-Atlantic integration, Rice pledged on Tuesday that her country would work with Montenegro to achieve that goal.
Vujanovic expressed hope that Tuesday's deal would encourage more US companies to invest in his country, participate in its privatisation process and establish partnerships with Montenegrin businesses.
"The signing of the SOFA agreement sets a new basis for our relations in securities here and it is indeed fresh proof, evidence that Montenegro is a safe environment and thereby, this is a new additional invitation for new economic partnerships."
In Montenegro, which adopted the deutschmark in 1999 and then the euro in 2002, almost all banks and nearly 90% of state-owned enterprises and property have already been privatised.
Tourism, particularly along the Adriatic coast, is booming and the country is ranked among the fastest growing tourist destinations in the world.
Romanian Programme Targets Older Vehicles
Cars on the road in Romania have an average age of 13.5 years, and many fall short of Western safety and emissions standards.
Authorities have launched a national programme to encourage residents to upgrade to newer vehicles, but critics say more is needed to comply with EU rules.

About 1.6 million vehicles in Romania are more than 12 years old, posing potential threats to traffic safety and the environment. [File]
Almost one half of the 3.8 million cars registered in Romania were produced more than 12 years ago.
Most were manufactured by the local Dacia, Oltcit and Aro factories, which at the time fell considerably short of meeting Western safety and emissions standards.
Some of the older cars are imports brought in from Western Europe after the end of the communist era, but these are often not well maintained.
About 350,000 cars on the road are more than 20 years old.
These 1.6 million vehicles are widely seen as potential threats to traffic safety, as well as a major source of air pollution.
"The average age of the cars in circulation is 13.5 years.
We can't ban them, as such a decision would have important social consequences.
But we need to protect the air quality," the daily Evenimentul Zilei quoted Romanian Environment Minister Sulfina Barbu as saying.
Authorities have begun taking steps.
Under a scrappage programme launched by the ministry, owners of cars that are more than 12 years old can turn them in to scrap iron collectors in exchange for 930 euros.
That money can be only used as a deposit on a new car.
However, the programme is not without its problems.
The deposit money it provides is nowhere near the amount needed to buy a new car -- the cheapest of which costs more than 4,000 euros.
In a country where the average monthly wage is 185 euros, and the average pension is 62 euros, many simply cannot afford to buy one.
Most who drive older vehicles do so because it is their only option.
Some have turned to selling their older cars to individuals who then exploit the government programme.
The result has been a significant increase in the prices of old cars.
"A few months ago, I would have gotten only about $100 for this 15-year-old Oltcit, but now I'm selling it to an acquaintance for $500.
I'm happy and he gets a Renault Clio for $700 cheaper," said Bucharest resident Radu Marinescu.
Critics of the programme say it uses public money to boost new car sales, rather than creating a modern system of waste recovery and recycling that Romania lacks. "It's an action that doesn't comply with the EU rules.
The impact on air quality will be insignificant, but large quantities of wastes, some toxic, will be generated," former environmental ministry expert Catalin Gurau told the weekly Capital.
Another hurdle is insufficient funding.
Only 12m euros were allocated, which means that only about 14,000 old cars will be eliminated this year -- less than 1 per cent of targeted vehicles.
Nevertheless, officials have said the programme will be continued next year if it proves successful.
EUFOR, BiH Authorities Launch Fight Against Organised Crime
EUFOR and local law enforcement authorities have launched a joint operation targeting cross-border smugglers as well as those who destroy forests.

EUFOR has launched a joint operation with local authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) to counter some elements of border-related organised crime.
The peacekeeping force's commander, Major General David Leakey, announced on 15 April in Sarajevo that his troops have mounted an operation against smugglers and those who destroy forests in BiH.
"This week, EUFOR began an operation together with local law enforcement agencies, the Indirect Tax Authority, the State Border Service, the police and other government agencies to tackle organised crime," Leakey said. "Amongst other objectives, the operation is targeted against people who smuggle goods across the borders and those who destroy Bosnian forests illegally, so they can line their own pockets instead of generating revenue for investing in education, health and infrastructure for the good of BiH citizens."
The announcement came at a EUFOR helicopter demonstration, organised for the media at Camp Butmir.
Ten transport and utility helicopters from Belgium, Italy, Romania and the United Kingdom performed basic assault manoeuvres and disembarked soldiers of Italy's 3rd Alpini Regiment.
The soldiers were deployed to BiH a week before, as part of the "over-the-horizon" reserve forces, moving vehicles, equipment and weapons from Italy within just a few days.
The manoeuvres were the second rehearsal that EUFOR conducted this year.
An earlier one involved four battalions whose command teams came to conduct familiarisation and planning as a contingency in case they should be required on short notice.
"EUFOR has 23 helicopters, which can quickly transport up to a battalion in one lift," said Leakey. "These helicopters also have a wider utility than just transport: most of them have a variety of high technology surveillance devices; they can operate by day and night and, of course, many mount weapons as well.
They are not just an air taxi for troops or an air ambulance."
Leakey said some of the EUFOR helicopters fly near the BiH border to provide video images of different organised crime activities.
Most of the EUFOR operations are carried out in close conjunction with local law enforcement agencies.
"Organised crime and corruption is a problem which affects every person in this country," said Leakey. "Criminal networks and their parallel structures undermine the stability, confidence, growth and prosperity of BiH.
They risk jeopardising this country's progress towards integration with Europe."
He also cited the role these networks have played in preventing alleged war criminals from being brought to justice, noting that BiH will not be able to enjoy the benefits of EU and NATO membership until there is full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
"Full co-operation means all indicted war criminals are delivered to The Hague, including Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic," Leakey said.
Macedonian Government to Sell Majority Stake in State-Owned Utility
The government has announced plans to sell Elektrostopanstvo na Makedonija, the Macedonian electric power utility, to a foreign investor.
A tender will be announced in May and the entire procedure should be completed by the end of the year.

The Macedonian government has decided to sell the most valuable state-owned enterprise, Elektrostopanstvo na Makedonija (ESM), to a foreign investor.
The utility will be sold without a prior initial price, although its current value has been estimated at 1.3 billion euros.
The tender procedure should start in May and the bid is expected to be selected by the end of the year.
"Fifty-one per cent of the ESM value will be sold to a foreign investor in one package," Economy Minister Fatmir Besimi said, adding that the sale is intended to make the enterprise more attractive and avoid a monopoly position.
"The government has decided not to sell ESM at prior determined price, but to allow a foreign investor to create the price in a tender," Besimi said. "The maximum price should be achieved.
In this, we are following the suit of European countries that have exercised the same model in selling their power-supply public utilities."
The government is planning to use the proceeds from the sale of ESM to fund different economic development projects.
The enterprise was transformed into two companies -- ESM Joint Stock Company and Macedonian Electro-Transmission System Operator (MEPSO) on 1 January.
The first of these will be sold, while MEPSO will remain state-owed.
Besimi said the state will keep around 30 per cent of the ESM shares so that the Energy Regulatory Commission is able to supervise all financial transactions of the two entities, and also to prevent the new owner from forming a monopoly. The EBRD, which will turn its 45m euro worth of pre-privatisation credit into shares, will own around 20 per cent of the enterprise.
The ESM privatisation is in line with the EU directives, and is one of the preconditions Macedonia must meet before it can sign an agreement establishing a common energy market with other Southeast European countries -- a document considered essential for the country's bid to join the EU.
Serbian, Kosovo Officials Discuss Refugee Returns
Serbian and Kosovo Albanian officials met in Belgrade on Thursday for their first face-to-face talks on the return of refugees to the UN-run province.
The group's next meeting is expected in Pristina next week.

Serbian and Kosovo Albanian officials met in Belgrade on Thursday (12 May) for their first face-to-face talks on the return of thousands of refugees to the UN-run province.
"I think the process took off well and we are looking forward within the next few weeks to have a second meeting," the AFP quoted Gottfried Koefner, a representative of the UNHCR, who chaired the meeting, as saying.
During a high-level meeting in Vienna in October 2003, Serbian and Kosovo Albanian leaders agreed to launch working-group talks on technical matters of mutual concern, such as energy, missing people and refugee returns.
The ensuing expert talks largely focused on the question of missing persons and were fairly successful.
Interrupted in March 2004, when Kosovo saw its worst outbreak of interethnic violence in the last five years, the meetings resumed earlier this year.
"We are not here to talk politics but to focus on a humanitarian problem which needs to be resolved quickly so that the displaced can return home," Koefner said without offering any details.
"This is just the beginning of a long process."
The agenda for the next meeting will be defined in the next few days, the Serbian government said in a statement Thursday, citing Koefner.
Both the Serbian and Kosovo Albanian representatives have singled out the issue of property as a question of particular importance, so Koefner expects detailed discussions on it during subsequent meetings.
The number of Serbs who fled Kosovo following the 1998-1999 conflict has been estimated at 200,000.
Kosovo Albanian officials dispute that figure, however, insisting the actual number is closer to 70,000.
Only about 12,500 refugees have since returned to the province, which is under UN administration though technically still part of Serbia.
Negotiations on its final status could begin this autumn, if an upcoming review finds that enough progress has been made in meeting UN-set benchmarks -- including refugee returns.
"Members of all communities must be able to participate fully in the economic, political and social life of Kosovo, and must not face threats to their security and well-being based on their ethnicity.
All refugees and displaced persons who wish to return to Kosovo must be able to do so in safety and dignity," reads the Kosovo Standards Implementation Plan, released on 31 March 2004.
In Thursday's talks, Vladimir Cucic, a representative of Serbia's Kosovo co-ordination centre, led the Belgrade delegation.
The Pristina delegation included representatives of UNMIK and of the Kosovo provisional institutions.
New Panel Formed to Fight Corruption in Greek Public Sector
A new agency of fiscal investigators will have the authority to look into mismanagement of funds and corruption cases involving public organisations.

Greece will soon have a Fiscal Investigators Force (FIF), a panel that will work independently and with full authority to investigate financial matters without going through the usual bureaucratic channels.
The FIF will report directly to the Finance Ministry, bypassing all intermediary services.
The FIF will audit all public organisations that are financed by the government -- including ministries, local NGOs, public utility companies, the church and parliament.
According to Deputy Finance Minister Petros Doukas, the agency will have the ability to suspend anyone who refuses to produce documents establishing that their service or organisation is being run in a financially transparent and responsible manner.
The same applies to civil employees at all levels who refuse to provide evidence and information for active investigations.
The FIF will only need circumstantial evidence of fraud, gross negligence, mismanagement or insufficient documentation of past transactions in order temporarily suspend employees.
Should it find a basis for bringing criminal charges against an employee, it will submit the evidence to the Fraud Prosecution Directorate.
Auditors will have the power to investigate past as well as current activities.
One area that is almost certain to come under scrutiny is the 2004 Summer Olympics, and especially Olympic-related construction projects.
Many of them were not completed until the last minute.
In this rushed atmosphere, contractors frequently asked for higher fees to complete projects on time.
If the state had failed to provide the necessary licenses in time for the project deadline, these additional fees could be justified.
However, there were instances in which contractors submitted requests for more money even if the state had provided the licenses.
Cases where these costs were approved and paid will become the primary target of the FIF -- and those responsible will have to account for their actions.
Also subject to investigation will be cases in which public organisations held up the issuing of licenses or other key decisions affecting projects under their management.
Because contractor agreements usually include a penalty clause for delays, corrupt officials may have had an incentive to intentionally slow progress.
The FIF will review projects that were not completed on time and cost the state revenue.
Finally, the FIF will be empowered to investigate organisations under liquidation, members of management boards that may or may not be civil employees, the management of property in the hands of trusts and public utility companies, lapsed debts that favoured the state, and bank accounts of private individuals
Romania to Reinforce Earthquake-Endangered Buildings
Romania has high exposure to seismic activity, but many of its urban structures are incapable of withstanding a powerful earthquake.
With the help of the World Bank, authorities hope to address the problem before catastrophe strikes.

Between 1992 and 2000, more than 3,400 buildings across Romania were examined by construction experts, evaluating their readiness to withstand earthquakes.
The experts placed 578 buildings in the highest category of seismic risk, meaning that they could collapse in a quake measuring more than 6.0 on the Richter scale.
Most of the high-risk buildings are apartment blocks, while some are home to restaurants, theatres and stores.
Furthermore, no fewer than 67 hospitals in 55 cities -- among them, three out of the four emergency hospitals in Bucharest -- are on the list.
That leaves many wondering where the victims would be treated in case of a major catastrophe.
In Timisoara, one of Romania's largest cities, the potentially endangered buildings include not only five hospitals but also the fire department headquarters and the emergency situations inspectorate.
Romania's vulnerability to seismic activity makes the problem especially urgent.
"According to our prognosis, the next big quake -- measuring over 6.5 --will happen in Romania in the next two or three years," said Gheorghe Marmureanu, chief of the Earth Physics Institute in Magurele.
The daily Gardianul, meanwhile, quoted World Bank expert Gabriel Ionita as saying Bucharest is "the European capital most exposed to seismic damage and one of the top ten large cities in the world that is endangered by earthquakes."
More than 1,000 people died in the capital during a 1977 quake, when dozens of blocks built before World War II collapsed.
Specialists believe as many as 17,000 people living in the so-called "red circle" buildings -- named for a mark that used to be placed on collapse-prone structures -- are at risk.
For the past 13 years, the government has promised to take action.
But so far only 26 high-risk buildings have been reinforced -- less than one out of 20.
This year, authorities allocated the money necessary for another 47 consolidations, including 40 in downtown Bucharest.
Work should start on the remaining 500 buildings by the end of next year, the government says.
"Reinforcing all the buildings on the list needs about 150m euros," said Minister of the Public Works Laszlo Borbely.
A 155m-euro loan from the World Bank is expected to cover the bulk of the costs.
However, the owners of the at-risk buildings are also expected to chip in.
By law, the public budget can only provide support for families with a monthly income of under 165 euros.
The others must pay their part over 25 years, in installments without interest.
Many people are reluctant to pay, despite the constant danger they face.
Documentation of Accords
Negotiated in November 1995 and signed the following month, the Dayton Accords brought an end to three years of brutal interethnic conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It set forth the present political divisions and structure of government of the country, and mandated a wide range of international organisations to monitor, oversee and implement elements of the agreement.
The Dayton Peace Accords
Text of documents related to the Dayton Peace Agreement which was initialed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio on November 21, 1995 and signed in Paris on December 14, 1995.
The agreement is known as the Dayton Peace Accords.
An official print version of the accords will be made available in the U.S. Department of State Dispatch Supplement, Volume 7, Number 1.

Dayton Peace Accords
Following Slovenia and Croatia's secession from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) in 1990 and 1991, respectively, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) held a referendum on independence on 29 February and 1 March 1992.
The Bosnian Muslims and Croats, who mostly participated in the plebiscite, supported the republic's breakaway from the federation, while the majority of Bosnian Serbs boycotted the vote. On 5 April 1992, the national parliament declared BiH's independence from the FRY.
The conflict which followed was the bloodiest in European history since the end of World War II, killing hundreds of thousands of people and displacing millions.
About three and a half years after the outbreak of violence, and following several failed international efforts for a peace deal, the United States launched a new initiative in the autumn of 1995.
Proximity negotiations between the warring parties, represented by then Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, and Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, opened at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio on 1 November 1995.
The talks were led by Richard Holbrooke, who was serving at the time as US assistant secretary of state.
Representatives of the EU and the Contact Group -- Britain, France, Germany and Russia -- also participated in the highly tense negotiations at the US air base.
Three weeks after the launch of the talks, Milosevic, Tudjman and Izetbegovic finally reached a deal and initialled a General Framework Agreement for Peace in BiH on 21 November.
The document, which eventually became known as the Dayton Peace Agreement or the Dayton Peace Accords (DPA), was formally signed by the three Balkan presidents on 14 December 1995 in Paris.
International leaders attending the signing ceremony included UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, US President Bill Clinton, French President Jacques Chirac, British Prime Minister John Major, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
The EU was represented by former Swedish prime minister and co-chairman of the Dayton peace conference, Carl Bildt.
"In this chorus for peace today we also hear the hallowed voices of the victims -- the children whose playgrounds were shelled in the killing fields, the young girls brutalised by rape, the men shot down in mass graves, those who starved in the camps, those who died in battle, the millions taken from their homes and torn from their families," Clinton said in remarks at the ceremony.
"Even from beyond the grave, there are victims singing the song of peace today.
May their voices be in our minds and hearts forever."
The DPA comprises 11 annexes covering the military, political and civilian aspects of the peace settlement, as well as those of regional stabilisation.
The Agreement created BiH as a sovereign state composed of two largely autonomous entities -- a Muslim-Croat federation, called the Federation of BiH, and a slightly smaller Bosnian Serb-run mini-state, called Republika Srpska. It also delineated the country's international and inter-entity borders.
BiH's constitution was included in the DPA, as Annex 4.
The DPA obliged BiH, Croatia and what was left of the FRY to fully respect each other's sovereign equality and to settle disputes by peaceful means.
By signing the Accords, the parties also undertook the commitment to respect human rights and the rights of refugees and displaced persons.
They further agreed to co-operate fully with all relevant entities and organisations in implementing the peace settlement and investigating and prosecuting war crimes and other violations of international humanitarian law.
A day after the formal signing of the DPA in Paris, the UN Security Council issued Resolution 1031, giving NATO the mandate to implement the military aspects of the Agreement. On 20 December 1995, a 60,000-strong NATO-led multinational force, called the Implementation Force (IFOR), was deployed in BiH as part of the Alliance's largest-ever military operation, dubbed Operation Joint Endeavour.
IFOR, which was given a one-year mandate, was replaced in December 1996 by a Stabilisation Force (SFOR).
Initially numbering around 32,000, SFOR was downsized over time to about 7,000 troops as of early December 2004, when the mission to implement the military aspects passed to a European Union-led force, EUFOR.
The implementation of the civilian aspects of the DPA was assigned to the Office of the High Representative (OHR) in BiH.
Operating under a United Nations Security Council mandate, the High Representative serves as the international community's top envoy in the Balkan country and has overarching powers, including the authority to fire officials and enact laws.
His tasks include facilitating and co-ordinating the activities of the organisations and agencies involved in the civilian aspects of the peace settlement.
The Dayton Accords succeeded in achieving the immediate aim of halting the bloodshed in BiH and re-establishing peace.
In doing so, however, they also established one of the world's most complex governmental structures -- an arrangement which many inside and outside of BiH see as unsustainable over the long term.
With weak central institutions, a continuing divide between the two entities, and a dependence on international governance, the country cannot yet be described as a functioning state. On 22 November, during Dayton commemorations in Washington, D.C, representatives of BiH's three constituent groups made a historic pledge to move forward, vowing to undertake comprehensive reforms aimed at laying the groundwork for future peace and prosperity.

(Various sources -- 11/07/03 - 18/07/03)
A review of business and economic news from the Balkans since 11 July:
Croatia's industrial production increased by 6 per cent year-on-year in the first half of 2003, according to the latest data released by the National Statistics Office.
Industrial output was 7.1 per cent higher year-on-year in June alone.
Foreign investments in Romania totaled $9.5 billion at the end of May, up $420m since the beginning of the year, according to data from the Foreign Investment Agency.
Turkey's current account deficit reached $3.5 billion during the period from January to May, according to data released by the central bank.
In May alone, the deficit widened by $578m, despite a seasonal increase in tourism revenues.
The Bulgarian Parliament ratified a 31.9m euro loan agreement with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Funds are to be used for financing tax and social insurance administration reform.
Bulgaria's gross external debt fell to 10.1 billion euros at the end of May.
The figure reflects the repayment of public debt to foreign creditors.
The Macedonian government and the EBRD signed a 40m euro loan agreement.
Funds are earmarked for building the Skopje bypass, which is part of Corridor 8, and the Smokvica-Gevgelija road segment, part of Corridor 10.
Macedonia and Norway launched a joint programme for co-operation between the small and medium-sized business sectors in the two countries.
The programme focuses on enterprises operating in the fields of mechanical and electrical engineering, furniture, textiles and food processing.
Representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and the European Commission signed an agreement on 63m euros in assistance for BiH under the EU Community Assistance for Reconstruction, Development and Stabilisation programme for this year.
The largest portion of the funds will go towards facilitating refugee returns.
The Federation of BiH's (FBiH) GDP stood at about 4 billion euros in 2002, according to data from the entity's statistical bureau.
The bureau also reported that FBiH's foreign trade deficit reached nearly $1 billion in the 1st six months of 2003.
Albania's government approved a $2m extension for wrapping up the Rrogozhine-Elbasan road reconstruction project.
The segment is part of Pan-European Corridor 8.
Privatisation in Kosovo kicked off with the selling of several public companies.
Some 4.1m euros was collected in the first round of the process.
UNMIK has earmarked 410 state companies to sell.
The Albanian Finance Ministry completed talks with the EBRD and the World Bank's International Finance Corporation on selling 40 per cent of INSIG, the state-owned insurer.
No details were revealed. The remaining 60 per cent of INSIG would likely be offered to a strategic investor.
Turkey celebrates Muslim feast of sacrifice
Kurban Bayrami, also known as Eid al-Adha, finds common threads in all three monotheistic religions.

A four day religious festival known as Kurban Bayrami was celebrated in Turkey this week.
Thousands of sheep, ram and oxen are slaughtered during the feast of the sacrifice.
It is a time to commemorate the sacrifice of the Prophet Abraham.
Abraham's complete submission to God's will is reflected in the faith in all three monotheistic religions, also known as Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam.
The Holy Qur'an tells the same story of exemplary faith in which Abraham is willing to sacrifice his son at God's command.
Yet, the name of his son, Isaac, is a detail that is not agreed upon among the major religions.
In Turkey, the name Ishmael is traditionally accepted.
The story ends with God sending a ram to Abraham to sacrifice instead of his son.
Muslims continue the tradition and celebrate it in an annual feast.
Packett: SFOR Shutting Down Karadzic's Support Network
SFOR Commander Major General Virgil L. Packett says the NATO-led force in Bosnia and Herzegovina is beginning to shut down networks supporting fugitives wanted for war crimes, including Radovan Karadzic.

SFOR Commander Major General Virgil L. Packett said Monday (12 July) that the NATO-led force was beginning to "strangle" networks supporting fugitives wanted for war crime, including wartime Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.
"We've shut down six or seven businesses that have been known to support Karadzic," the US general said in Washington during a House Armed Services Committee briefing on Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). "We are hearing them squeal a bit."
As part of renewed and strengthened efforts to arrest suspects wanted by the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague, the international community has acted against those helping the fugitives evade capture, imposing travel bans and freezing their assets.
"They no longer have freedom of action, they can't move through Europe, they can no longer continue to move money back and forth," Packett was quoted as saying at Monday's meeting.
Two days earlier, in an interview with the independent Bosnian daily Nezavisne Novine, Packett said SFOR would do "everything within our power and mandate that Karadzic be arrested or surrenders," before SFOR leaves BiH at the end of this year to be replaced by an EU-led force.
Without offering further details, the AFP also quoted the general as saying that Karadzic, 59, appeared to be having "certain health problems" that require attention.
"Karadzic is not getting any younger, he is nearing an end," Packett said.
Karadzic and wartime Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic top the UN war crimes tribunal's list of wanted indictees.
Both have been charged with genocide for their roles in the 1992-1995 war in BiH.
Despite numerous SFOR-led attempts at their capture, they have managed to remain at large in the nine years since the war ended.
"Karadzic is holding this country hostage," Packett said Monday. "They have to choose Karadzic or Europe."
During its Istanbul summit last month, NATO decided to postpone an invitation for BiH to join its Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme because of the country's lack of full co-operation with the UN tribunal.
BiH's Serb-run entity, Republika Srpska, has failed to arrest even a single war crimes indictee.
Following NATO's decision, High Representative Paddy Ashdown imposed a series of wide-ranging measures against the Serb Democratic Party, founded by Karadzic, and against individuals believed to be helping the fugitive and obstructing co-operation with The Hague-based court.
In an article published Monday in The Wall Street Journal , Ashdown wrote "I could not allow the whole country's future to be held to ransom by a few who believe corruption and keeping war criminals free is more important than jobs, security and peace for all."
Meanwhile, in a speech at the European Policy Centre on Monday, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said the Alliance was still looking forward to welcoming BiH into the PfP.
That would happen, he said, after it has met the conditions for membership, including full co-operation with the UN tribunal.
Verheugen Says Romania Making EU Accession Progress, But 2003 Critical
Romania has a good chance of meeting its accession goals, EU Commissioner for Enlargement Guenter Verheugen said during a two-day visit to Bucharest.
But entry into the EU in 2007 depends on addressing existing weaknesses, including corruption and the need for judicial reform.
(EUobserver.com, Seeurope.net, Rompres - 21/02/03; Rompres - 20/02/03)
EU Commissioner for Enlargement Guenter Verheugen has commended Romanian authorities for the progress the country has made on its EU bid in the past two years. Expressing support for Romania's plans to complete accession negotiations by late 2004, ahead of a possible EU membership in 2007, Verheugen stressed this year would be critical.
Verheugen, who arrived on a two-day visit to Bucharest on Thursday (20 February), said Romania must demonstrate significant progress in fighting corruption and judicial reform before the end of this year.
While acknowledging the authorities' efforts to tackle corruption, Verheugen said much remained to be done.
One concrete measure the European Commission (EC) has been pressing for is the adoption of an anti-corruption package that would disallow politicians from sitting on company managing boards.
"We judge a high level of corruption as a political problem," Verheugen said "and not only as a judicial problem".
The EC has been for the past two years voicing concern over the level of judicial independence in Romania.
It is now urging the authorities to act as quickly as possible to ensure that the judicial system is free from political pressure.
Verheugen assured Romanian President Ion Iliescu that the EU stands by the enlargement decisions announced at the Copenhagen Summit last December.
He was quoted as saying that Romania has a good chance of meeting its accession goals, but must address existing weaknesses before the EC's next progress report, scheduled for October.
The EC supports Romania's intentions to step up its accession talks in view of their possible finalisation in late 2004, Verheugen said, but stressed that this would largely depend on the country's preparations.
He said Romania would probably be recognised as a functioning market economy in the EC's report this year.
In other news, the IMF completed its ten-day mission in Romania Thursday, reporting encouraging economic progress in the country.
The IMF team reached an understanding with state authorities on a supplementary letter of intent and welcomed the government's decision to continue discussions on privatisation of the largest Romanian bank, BCR.
The IMF executive board is expected to confirm positively the third performance review under the standby agreement in the second half of April.
However, the confirmation is conditioned on several prior actions, aiming to improve financial discipline in state-owned enterprises and to retain the downward inflation trend.
The government is also expected to file additional documents on near-term economic priorities.
US urges Albanians to participate in local elections
TIRANA, Albania -- The United States is urging Albanians to participate in the May 8th local elections, and encouraging political parties to engage in a political race.
Ambassador Alexander Arvizu said on Wednesday (February 23rd) that his country has allocated about 260,000 euros for a coalition of civil society organisations to monitor the process.
He told representatives of the organisations, "your work will be very important in helping to ensure that these elections are successful and that they represent the will of the Albanian people."
In other news Wednesday, President Bamir Topi said that the country urgently needs to overcome the political crisis and return to its EU accession course.
In a letter to the heads of political parties, he asked them to find a long-term solution and show willingness to co-operate for the sake of Albania's future. (Balkan Web, VoA, Telegrafi, Top Channel, Top News, Ora News - 23/02/11)
Business Roundup
A review of business and economic news from the Balkans since 23 January.
(Various sources -- 23/01/04 - 30/01/04)
A review of business and economic news from the Balkans since 23 January:
Croatia's largest pension fund AZ, owned by Allianz and Zagrebacka Banka, increased its assets to 272m euros as of the end of 2003. It now has 42.4 per cent of all assets in the sector.
In November 2003, the fund completed the acquisition of HA1, one of the smallest players on the pension insurance market.
The Romanian Economy Ministry received 26 letters of intent for the privatisation of three energy holdings management companies from the mining and electricity sectors.
The US companies Bechtel and AES, Italy's Enel and the Greek Public Power Corporation are among the key competitors in the tender.
Turkey will not sign a new agreement with the IMF at the end of this year, Industry Minister Ali Coskun said on 25 January.
Turkey's current stand-by agreement with the Fund expires in December and Coskun believes the country will not need its direct support after that.
Greece's Piraeus Bank Group announced on 26 January that two of its members have merged.
Marathon Banking Corporation, a Piraeus Bank subsidiary based in New York, acquired Interbank NY in a $600m deal.
Macedonian Economy Minister Stevco Jakimovski and Swiss Ambassador to Macedonia Stephan Nelen signed an agreement on a 7.8m euro donation by the Swiss government for a project to improve the electricity network in Macedonia.
The funds will go towards purchase and installation of new equipment. A portion also will be spent on anti-pollution measures.
The EBRD is planning to finance a project to establish a regional air carrier based in, Sofia, according to the Stability Pact co-ordinator in Bulgaria, Milen Keremedchiev.
According to reports, the transport ministry has discussed the idea with Croatia, Romania and Serbia-Montenegro but no arrangements have been signed so far.
EU Ambassador to Albania Lutz Salzman announced on 26 January that the European Commission-funded water supply project in the southern city of Saranda is complete.
A new water supply and sewer lines were established, a pumping station was rehabilitated and new chlorinisation equipment was installed.
Britain's Miliband visits Belgrade and Pristina, vows EULEX will deploy throughout Kosovo
British Foreign Secretary David Miliband swung through Belgrade and Pristina while crucial negotiations on the deployment of EULEX to Kosovo were underway.

As part of a diplomatic push, British Foreign Secretary David Miliband visited Belgrade and Pristina on Wednesday (November 5th).
The UN Security Council session on Kosovo is scheduled for November 11th, and Belgrade and EU representatives have confirmed that talks are under way on the deployment of the EU mission to Kosovo.
Belgrade initially fought the mission's deployment but now says it is possible on three conditions -- that the UN Security Council approves the mission, that it be neutral on the status of Kosovo and that it does not implement the plan of former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari, which envisions Pristina's independence from Serbia.
Serbian officials told Miliband that Belgrade wants to join the EU but would not abandon its terms regarding Kosovo.
"I think there is room for co-operation even though [our differences on Kosovo] are fundamentally large," Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said after conferring with his British counterpart.
Jeremic said Serbia would block any potential agreement in the UN that fails to meets its conditions.
Russia has backed it at the world body.
Miliband said Britain supports Serbia's EU aspirations but added that a solution on the deployment of EULEX is essential.
He said it was up to EU members to decide individually on the status of Kosovo and pointed out EULEX sought to "protect the people, all people, not to decide on the status"; hence, the mission's deployment would be in Belgrade's interest as well.
The British diplomat's visit came as the Serbian opposition, led by former Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, accused the government of conducting secret talks on EULEX that would aid Kosovo's independence.
However, the opposition lacks a majority in parliament and should be unable to pass a no-confidence motion.
Visiting Pristina later in the day, Miliband vowed that the international community would help Kosovo in its transition to democracy and that EULEX would deploy throughout Kosovo.
Britain was among the first countries to recognise Kosovo after it declared independence from Serbia on February 17th.
After a meeting with Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu and Prime Minister Hashim Thaci, Miliband said London would not ask Pristina to sign "any document that violates its 'red lines'", conditions Kosovo would find absolutely unacceptable.
Miliband added, "The international community needs to be with you every step of the way.
The next step is the full deployment of EULEX throughout the territory of Kosovo, and that will happen."
Sejdiu said the people of Kosovo wanted to see the end of the UNMIK mission and the beginning of a EULEX deployment throughout Kosovo "very soon".
Police in BiH battle arms traffickers
International smuggling rings are the target of a major police operation conducted over the past several months.

Through a large-scale international operation, police in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) have been making a concerted effort to suppress organised crime rings smuggling weapons via its territory to other rings operating in the EU countries.
Operation West was conducted over the past several months in BiH and in some of its neighbours.
Police from the Federation of BiH and Republika Srpska co-operated with counterparts in neighbouring countries and in some EU member states, including Slovenia, France, Austria and Croatia.
The State Information and Protection Agency (SIPA) was also involved.
Since January, when investigations began, police have netted a large quantity of arms and other lethal materials, such as automatic rifles, rocket launchers, handguns, automatic weapons, hand grenades, various munitions, detonators and spare parts for weapons.
The seized material includes pentrite, an explosive more powerful than TNT.
Factories in the former Yugoslavia produced it for that country's army.
Traffickers intended to resell those munitions in the Western European countries at a much higher price than available in the Balkans or for potential terrorist acts.
During September, police arrested six people allegedly involved in the crime ring, four in BiH and two in Slovenia.
They issued arrest warrants for two other suspects living in France.
In this sting, police seized 62kg of pentrite, as well as a large number of automatic weapons, antitank rockets, detonators and ammunition.
At a press conference in Ljubljana, Slovenia, spokesmen explained that the ring was very well organised and gave each member specific tasks.
Its intention was to smuggle a large quantity of weapons and explosives into other EU states and reap huge profits.
During the months-long investigation, authorities identified Slovenia as a transit country for illegal arms being smuggled from the Western Balkan countries into the EU states.
Around mid-October, in another part of the sting, the SIPA raided many locations in central Bosnia and in the metropolitan areas of Sarajevo, Banja Luka and Zenica.
It arrested six people, whom it handed over to the State Prosecutorial Office for further processing.
Police discovered during the investigation a number of weapon "shipments" had already gone undetected to the EU countries, where traffickers sold them.
At a press conference in Sarajevo, Dragan Lukac, deputy director of the SIPA, disputed the accuracy of some international reports alleging links between the arms-trafficking rackets and al-Qaeda.
The six suspects arrested in October came from different backgrounds, Lukac said, describing them as a "multi-ethnic group of criminals".
EC says pace of accession hinges on reform progress
Next year will be crucial for Turkey and the seven Western Balkan countries seeking to join the EU, according to the European Commission's annual reports on their progress towards accession, published on Wednesday.

The European Commission (EC) issued on Wednesday (November 5th) its annual reports on eight Southeast European countries' accession progress, saying Croatia could complete its entry talks with the Union next year, if it meets the requirements.
It also urged six other Western Balkan countries and Turkey to speed up the implementation of political, economic and legislative reforms in order to gain membership sooner.
Croatia, one of the three official EU candidates, along with Turkey and Macedonia, began its accession talks with Brussels in October 2005.
Of the 35 chapters, or policy areas, that form part of the negotiation process, negotiators have opened 21 thus far, closing four of them provisionally.
"Based on the progress made by Croatia, it should be possible to reach the final stage of the accession negotiations by the end of 2009," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said.
Turkey, which also began its talks in October 2005, however, is far behind, with only eight of the negotiation chapters opened so far and one of them provisionally closed.
The EC, while critical of Turkey's pace of political reform, for the first time recognised the country as a "functioning market economy," a key economic benchmark.
It also praised Ankara for its active and "constructive" foreign policy, e.g., in the Caucasus.
Macedonia, which became an official EU candidate in December 2005, again failed to receive a green light for starting accession talks.
The country still needs to ensure free and fair elections and to improve dialogue among major political parties and figures, it noted.
The EC reports urged the aforementioned candidate countries and the five potential candidates -- Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia -- to take bold action against corruption, which remains widespread across the region.
Serbia made some progress in this area and in developing a comprehensive anti-corruption policy during the reporting period, said the EC.
The country could win recognition as an official EU candidate next year if it makes tangible progress in priority political and economic reforms, as well as full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
"Serbia needs to do everything in its powers to arrest the remaining ICTY indictees, including Ratko Mladic," Rehn said.
Albania, BiH and Montenegro are moving ahead with the implementation of their respective Interim Agreements, the EC said.
They still need to consolidate the rule of law and administrative enforcement capacities.
The EC called on Albania to conduct its 2009 elections in line with international standards and on Montenegro to pursue aggressive judicial reform.
The EC also voiced concern over the rise of nationalism in BiH in recent months.
The EC report on Kosovo noted its widespread corruption and organised crime, saying the country's European integration was generally "at an early stage".
Still no consensus on Montenegrin constitution
After 88 years with Serbia, Montenegro's people chose independence in a referendum last May.
Now, however, drafting a new constitution is posing a challenge.

The parliamentary commission working to draft a new constitution for Montenegro finally met on Tuesday (January 16th), after members of the opposition agreed to participate.
However, there is still no sign of a broad consensus.
The ruling and opposition parties disagree over a long list of issues, including the country's official language, whether Montenegrins living abroad should have voting rights, and whether Montenegro should be defined as a civic state or a "state of nations".
The ruling Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) wants the constitution to prohibit any initiative that could result in Montenegro losing its statehood again, while the pro-Serbian opposition wants to retain the possibility of a future referendum on rejoining a state union with Serbia.
"The government is trying to cement the current situation by ruling out the possibility of citizens deciding differently," says Velizar Kaludjerovic, a senior official of the Socialist People's Party of Montenegro (SNP).
His party also seeks voting rights for Montenegrin citizens living in Serbia, most of whom opposed ending the state union.
The government also faces resistance to calling the official language "Montenegrin", again, mostly from the pro-Serbian opposition.
It argues that 63% of citizens said during a 2003 census that they speak Serbian, while only 26% said they speak Montenegrin.
Bosniak parties, meanwhile, want the coat of arms and flag to be changed in order to include elements of the Islamic tradition.
"We do not agree that state symbols should be defined in a manner that doesn't allow minorities to see them as their own.
Some symbols are irritating to our faith," said Kemal Purisic, a Bosniak MP.
While the DPS and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) are pushing to preserve a "pure civic" concept and keep Montenegro as a community of sovereign citizens, Bosniak and Serb MPs say the new constitution must define Montenegro as a community of nations.
They say the constitution should include Bosniaks and Serbs as founding nations of the Montenegrin state.
The DPS says, however, that this could lead to a bid for secession.
By law, the new constitution will be adopted if it receives two-thirds of the majority vote in parliament.
If it gets only a simple majority -- which the ruling parties have -- it has to be confirmed by a referendum.
"Broad agreement on the constitution is necessary.
You cannot achieve your goal if the new constitution is not the product of debate by political forces, NGOs and citizens," said Karlo Tuori, a legal expert from the Council of Europe's (CoE) Venice Commission.
Montenegro is seeking to join the CoE, but must first resolve the constitutional impasse.
A report Wednesday in the Podgorica daily Vijesti said the CoE is demanding that Montenegro be "defined as a civic state and adopt legislation providing for civil control over the armed and security forces," and be boosting judicial independence.
Political analyst Milos Besic says he expects a consensus will eventually be achieved, but some degree of EU intervention may be needed.
"There is a possibility that some European institutions will apply some kind of mediation under the principle of imposed compromise.
Some kind of latent intervention could come during the negotiations," he said.
Albanian parties to participate in Serbian elections
Two Albanian parties from southern Serbia have submitted a joint candidate list for Sunday's parliamentary vote.
It could mark the beginning of a return by ethnic Albanians to Serbia's political life.

Two of the four Albanian parties from southern Serbia -- the Democratic Action Party and the Democratic Union of the Valley -- submitted a joint list of candidates to the Election Commission to run in Sunday's (January 21st) parliamentary elections.
It is the first time since 1993 that Albanians from the southern Serbian municipalities of Presevo, Bujanovac and Medvedja will take part in parliamentary elections.
The two parties will run as a coalition of Albanians from the Presevo Valley, as the Albanians call southern Serbia.
Leader Riza Halimi said that he expects the coalition to win two of the 250 seats in parliament.
"We will advocate a better life for the Albanians by raising the level of security, developing the economy and the Albanians' legal and political status in the Presevo Valley," he said.
The representative of Albanian parties not participating in the elections, Jonuz Musliu, said he feels conditions are not yet ripe.
Serbia still has not achieved a sufficient degree of decentralisation, he said.
According to Musliu, a May 2001 agreement between the Albanians and the Serbian authorities, reached following armed clashes in Presevo and Bujanovac, has not been fully implemented.
Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku last month called on his compatriots in southern Serbia to vote.
"You should take part in all the processes that aid the introduction of democracy, including the January elections," Ceku said.
Analysts say Albanian participation could increase pressure on Belgrade to advise Kosovo Serbs to take part in the Kosovo institutions.
International officials have, on several occasions, criticised Belgrade for failing to encourage this.
Leading Serbian politicians welcomed the Albanians' decision to participate.
Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said that the inclusion of the Albanian ethnic minority in parliament would benefit the entire country, just as the inclusion of other ethnic minorities would.
The Democratic Party (DP), led by Serbian President Boris Tadic, hailed the Albanians' decision.
"We want them to partner with the majority political parties in the government, various institutions, executive power -- to be integrated in the same manner they have been integrated in southern Serbia," DP spokeswoman Jelena Markovic said.
About 58,000 Albanians live in three municipalities in southern Serbia.
Most reside in Presevo, where they account for 90% of the population.
West urges Serbia to vote for European future
Voicing support for Serbia's EU membership bid, a number of senior Western officials expressed hope this week that the country's democratic forces will win Sunday's parliamentary elections.

A chorus of senior EU officials voiced hope this week that the parliamentary elections in Serbia on Sunday (January 21st) will produce a pro-reform government that can place the country firmly on the road to European integration.
"It will be up to the new government in Serbia to set the pace," EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana told the Belgrade-based Beta new agency. "Serbia has shown that it has the capacity to quickly proceed once the political obstacles have been removed."
Sunday's vote pits Western-oriented political parties -- including Serbian President Boris Tadic's reformist Democratic Party (DS) and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's moderately conservative Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS). -- against parties associated with the regime of Slobodan Milosevic.
The most recent polls suggest that Tadic's DS has taken a lead over the ultra nationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS), nominally still led by Hague war crimes indictee Vojislav Seselj.
According to the Centre for Free Elections and Democracy, support for the DS has reached 29%, making them the most popular party in the country.
The SRS is in second place with 26%, and the DSS is third with 19%.
Four days before the election, Austrian Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik and Romanian President Traian Basescu became the latest EU officials to express their support for Serbia's bid to join the Union and to offer assistance in achieving that goal.
"Austria believes in Serbia, and we are ready to continue to support and encourage Serbia," Plassnik told reporters Wednesday after her meeting with Tadic.
"We would like to see the democratic forces win the upcoming election so that Serbia's road to the EU and NATO can continue," Basescu said.
Speaking at a conference in Rome on Tuesday, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said he expects that "a new reform-oriented and pro-European government in Belgrade will make rapid progress towards the EU".
Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt and Slovakian Foreign Minister Jan Kubiswill, who visited Belgrade earlier this week, also voiced support for Serbia's EU bid.
"We will respect the decision of the voters of Serbia, but we hope from our point of view that it will be a government with which we can engage very fast, very deep and very constructive talks on all of the integration issues," the AP quoted Bildt as saying Monday.
In Washington, State Department Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs Daniel Fried voiced hope that Serbia's pro-European parties will win.
"We would like to see a Serbia that chooses Europe, that chooses a European future for itself," Fried said in an interview with the VOA. "Serbia deserves this.
The Serbian people deserve a future in Europe no less than any other people in Europe."
EC proposes new energy package
The European Commission has unveiled a new, wide-ranging energy plan that outlines six priority projects as essential for the EU's energy security and for reducing its dependence on energy imports from Russia.
(FT, Euobserver, EurActiv, Guardian - 14/11/08; AFP, DPA, BBC, Euobserver, The Times, European Commission - 13/11/08)
"We must shield European citizens from the risks that external suppliers cannot honour their commitments," EC President Jose Manuel Barroso said. [Getty Images]
The European Commission (EC) has put forward an ambitious plan, envisioning measures aimed at boosting EU energy security and efficiency and reducing the 27-nation bloc's dependence on oil and gas imports from Russia.
Currently, the EU relies on foreign sources to secure almost 54% of its energy needs.
It imports 61% of its gas, 42% of it from Russia.
With indigenous gas production expected to continue to decline, the EC estimates that gas imports will increase to 73% by 2020.
At this year's prices, energy imports represent an estimated 350 billion euros, the commission said in its Second Strategic Energy Review, released on November 13th. This amount translates to about 700 euros per year for every EU citizen, it noted.
Presenting the package, EC President Jose Manuel Barroso stressed that last year alone, energy prices went up by an average of 15% within the 27-nation bloc.
"We must break the vicious energy cycle of increased energy consumption and increased imports," he said.
The fact that eight EU states are totally dependent on Russia for their gas is a problem the Union must address, according to Barroso.
"We must shield European citizens from the risks that external suppliers cannot honour their commitments," the EC president said.
A gas price dispute between Russia and Ukraine caused a brief disruption of gas supplies to some EU states in the winter of 2006, prompting calls for the bloc to move towards a greater diversification of energy sources and supply routes.
The conflict in the Caucusus in August undermined further Europe's confidence in the reliability of Russian supplies.
The EU must take urgent measures to increase its energy efficiency and reduce its dependence on imports, Barroso said, calling on member nations to agree to the EC's new proposals.
"We have to invest and diversify," he said.

In the plan, the EC stressed the need for a stronger focus on the bloc's infrastructure needs and the diversification of energy supplies, an increase of oil and gas stocks, the establishment of crisis response mechanisms to respond to possible gas disruptions, better use of indigenous energy resources and stronger efforts to improve energy efficiency.
The first priority of the Strategic Energy Review package is to adopt and implement the measures that will help the bloc meet its so-called 20-20-20 climate change targets, according to an EC statement.
The EU's goal is to reach a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, a 20% share of wind, solar and other renewable sources in final energy consumption and a 20% increase in energy efficiency, all by 2020.
"In order to meet the EU's 20-20-20 objectives in a manner guaranteeing electricity and gas supply to all the EU's citizens, major changes in the EU's internal energy infrastructure will be necessary over the coming years and decades," the EC statement said.
The review outlined six strategic projects as essential for the EU's energy security: a Baltic Interconnection Plan, a southern gas corridor, a Mediterranean energy ring, adequate North-South gas and electricity interconnections with Central and Southeast Europe, a North Sea offshore grid and effective liquefied natural gas supplies for Europe.
If the member states' governments and the European Parliament agree to the package, the development of the proposed Baltic Interconnection Plan will begin next year.
Covering gas, electricity and storage, the project will connect the networks of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania with the rest of the EU.
The three Baltic nations are currently connected to the Russian energy networks and are among the bloc's eight members that get 100% of their gas from Russia.
Describing the southern gas corridor as "one of the EU's highest energy security priorities", the EC said the project would include the construction of the pipelines necessary to transport supplies from Caspian and Middle Eastern sources, bypassing Russia.
The Mediterranean energy ring designed to link Europe with the Southern Mediterranean through electricity and gas interconnections "now needs to be completed", said the EC, noting the project's importance for the development of the region's "vast solar and wind energy potential".

The EU executive arm also called for the development of a a Blueprint for a North Sea offshore grid to interconnect the national electricity grids of countries in Northwest Europe and plug-in the numerous planned offshore wind projects.
Together with the Baltic interconnection project and the Mediterranean ring, it should become "one of the building blocks of a future European supergrid", the EC said.
Vowing to use its existing instruments to make rapid progress on the six projects, it also noted that all parties involved would have to make considerable efforts to mobilise the needed funding for their implementation, including from entities from third countries.
"This work appears as a key element of the EU response to the current financial crisis and thus should be accelerated … inter alia to support employment and contribute to offsetting the fall in demand," the Commission said.
It also tabled a set of new energy efficiency proposals, including for a revision of the bloc's legislation on the energy efficiency of buildings and energy-using products.
The EC wants new efficiency standards to be introduced for all new buildings and existing buildings undergoing a major renovation, arguing that this could contribute to energy savings of 5% to 6% by 2020.
It called for the inclusion of a broader range of energy-using products -- not only household appliances -- in the bloc's rules on energy labelling.
Under a separate legal instrument, a new energy label will be introduced for car tyres, grading them for their fuel efficiency.
By choosing better tyres, consumers could see their petrol bills drop by up to 10%, the commission believes.
It is also planning to adopt minimum requirements for light bulbs, street and office lighting equipment and other electrical devices, as well to table a proposal to bring the bloc's Energy Tax Directive fully in line with its energy and climate change goals.
US welcomes progress in Cyprus talks
WASHINGTON, United States/NICOSIA, Cyprus -- US State Department spokesperson Philip Crowley on Friday (April 2nd) hailed progress made in the Cypriot reunification talks and promised Washington's support for a "just and lasting" settlement.
Crowley said the US was "encouraged" by a statement of progress following the latest meeting of Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat.
The meeting was the last before a break for the April 18th presidential vote in the northern, Turkish-run part of the island.
In an interview with the AP on Friday, Talat warned that reunification talks may collapse if he loses the forthcoming vote to hardline rival Dervis Eroglu.
According to Talat, who is behind in the polls, such an outcome would also harm Turkey's EU bid and relations between Athens and Ankara, as well as hamper Cyprus's economic growth.
Eroglu said on Thursday that if he wins the vote, he will continue reunification talks to achieve an accord that would protect the rights of Turkish Cypriots. (AFP, AP - 02/04/10)

Serbia gets green light for EU candidacy
EU leaders granted Serbia candidate status Thursday after the decision was postponed in December due to tensions in Kosovo.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 02/03/12

When Serbia signed the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU before the parliamentary elections in April 2008, officials in Belgrade did not expect four years to pass before candidate status was granted.
The ruling coalition, led by Serbian President Boris Tadic, laid accelerated European integration down as a goal, but Kosovo -- which Belgrade considers a province of Serbia despite it having declared independence in February 2008 -- posed a problem on Serbia's path.
Serbia removed the last obstacle to the candidacy just hours before the EU decision on Thursday (March 1st).
Serbian and Romanian officials reached an agreement concerning the Vlach minority in Serbia, which was sufficient for Bucharest to withdraw its conditions for Belgrade.
The details of the agreement, which covers about 30,000 people living in communities along the Romanian border, have not been disclosed.
The European Council President Herman Van Rompuy announced the decision.
"I hope it will encourage Serbia to undertake further efforts in order to meet the political and economic criteria for EU membership.
It is also my hope that Belgrade will continue to support regional co-operation and good neighbourly relations in the Western Balkans," he said.
Serbian officials welcomed the status.
Tadic said that the candidacy would "open the door" for economic progress, but that there is a "lot of work" ahead of Serbia regarding future steps towards the EU.
Laslo Varga, the president of the Serbian Parliament's European Integration Committee said, the decision is a message to the international community and foreign investors that Serbia is "on the way to becoming an orderly European country".
"Besides this, candidate status will stop the trend of declining support for joining the EU in the country, and will also open up new opportunities to use money from European pre-accession funds," Varga told SETimes.
However, Vladimir Radomirović from the Centre for Strategic Alternatives said that Serbia will not get much from the candidacy itself, because the money from European funds can only be used for specific kinds of projects.
"Serbia has gained practically nothing from EU candidate status, just like Macedonia and Montenegro have received nothing.
Candidate status cannot fix the bad economic situation and it cannot prevent political corruption," Radomirović told SETimes.
Not all parties in Serbia think that joining the EU is a good concept.
Former Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica's opposition Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) said that it would be best for Serbia to proclaim political neutrality, stop European integration and nurture solely economic relations with the Union.
DSS Spokesperson Petar Petković told SETimes that Serbia has lost more than 500m euros by implementing the SAA.
"Instead of losing out because of EU membership, Serbia -- through political neutrality -- should forge developed economic co-operation with all countries in the world," said Petković.
Receiving a date for the start of EU accession talks is the next step on Serbia's path, and everyone agrees that this means new, difficult compromises.
Varga believes that is realistic to expect that date to be set in December for Serbia, both because of the difficult tasks ahead and because of the economic problems inside the EU itself.
"Belgrade will be asked to fulfil all agreements with Pristina, and there is also the demand that institutions in northern Kosovo are abolished.
I don't think our next step towards the EU will be easy," said Varga.
Radomirović agrees.
"According to statements by EU officials, Serbia can receive a date for the start of talks in December.
Until then, the leading EU countries will surely demand that Belgrade continues to act constructively towards Kosovo, i.e. to abolish Serbian institutions, particularly those in northern Kosovo."
Citizens also have differing thoughts on Serbia's EU candidacy.
Belgrade trader Milovan Brkić, 33, said the candidacy is good news.
"We are closer to the EU, that can only be good both economically and politically," he told SETimes.
Lawyer Milena Srdić, 30, disagrees.
"Will we now live better?
Have bigger wages, more work?
I don't believe we will, the EU itself has large financial problems," she said.
With the granting of candidate status, Serbia has caught up with Macedonia and Montenegro, who have had candidate status since 2005 and 2010.
Croatia should become a member of the Union in mid-2013, while Bosnia and Herzegovina signed the SAA in 2008.
The Union gave the green light this week for a feasibility study to be done for Kosovo.
Ashdown: Next Six Months Critical for BiH
With the recent European Commission's approval of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Feasibility Study and NATO's readiness to invite the country to join the Partnership for Peace programme, BiH must fulfil 16 conditions before the end of June 2004.
By Antonio Prlenda for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 26/12/03
High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Paddy Ashdown recently stressed the crucial importance of the next six months for the country's possible future in EU and NATO.
"If, by the second half of next year, insufficient progress has been achieved, Europe would have to say 'no, you are not ready', however reluctantly.
The European Commission would not be in a position to recommend proceeding with a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA).
The Feasibility Study makes that point explicitly.
And one certain way to fail next June is to misunderstand that point today.
Which is why the next months are so crucial," Ashdown said.
Last month, the European Commission (EC) approved a Feasibility Study to assess the readiness of BiH to take its next steps towards European integration, by opening negotiations for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA).
The Feasibility Study found that BiH has made important progress since the 1990s, but still battles significant weaknesses.
The EC said it hopes to be able to recommend the opening of SAA negotiations next year -- on the condition that BiH makes significant progress in 16 areas identified as priorities for action: compliance with existing international obligations; more effective governance; more effective public administration; European integration; effective human rights provisions; an effective judiciary; tackling crime, especially organised crime; managing asylum and migration; customs and taxation reform; budget legislation; budget practice; reliable statistics; consistent trade policy; integrated energy market; BiH single economic space and public broadcasting.
In the 16 conditions, there are several areas of economic reform -- four on the rule of law, three on issues of governance, one on the media and one on the co-operation with the war crimes tribunal at The Hague.
"It would give me great pleasure to be able, next year, to recommend to the member states that we should start SAA negotiations with BiH," said EU Commissioner for External Relations Chris Patten. "I will only be able to do so if BiH makes significant and rapid progress in the areas that we have identified.
Given sufficient political will, there is no reason why BiH should not meet this target."
Simultaneously, at its ministerial meeting on 4 December, NATO welcomed the progress that BiH made recently with parliamentary approval of the State Defence Law and acceptance of the defence reform that puts the BiH Armed Forces under state command and control.
The Alliance stressed that BiH now must implement the Defence Law to be invited to join the Partnership for Peace programme (PfP) at the Istanbul summit in June 2004.
The arrest of the indicted war criminal Radovan Karadzic remains an important precondition for PfP membership.
"As you can see, there are a lot of big decisions, and a huge amount of work, ahead of us," Ashdown said during a recent diplomatic forum at Sarajevo. "What this means is no more delay to some painful steps that have been put off for far too long.
This country is running out of time.
BiH would be foolish to miss the opportunity by failing to meet the conditions that have been set."

RS under fire over decision to pull out of state power company
International officials and diplomats have urged the government of Republika Srpska to rescind a decision to withdraw from Bosnia and Herzegovina's state power transmission company, warning that such a move could damage the country's credibility and its EU bid.

Republika Srpska (RS) authorities have come under strong criticism over their decision to pull out of the state power transmission company and establish their own operator instead.
International officials warn that such an "illegal" move would harm Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) interests and are urging Banja Luka to rescind that decision.
"The conclusion by the RS government to proceed towards unilateral withdrawal from the energy transmission corporation would be damaging to the country and its European goals," High Representative Miroslav Lajcak said in Bratislava on Saturday (September 13th).
Echoing a statement issued by the Steering Board of the Peace Implementation Council (PIC) the previous day, he urged the RS government "to revoke its conclusion and continue to work within the established institutions and laws" of BiH.
The RS government "must understand that when it makes an agreement, it must honour it".
His remarks came two days after RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik's cabinet decided on Thursday to pull out of Elektroprenos BiH, citing the company's failure to adopt a business and investment plan for 2008 as one of its motives.
Elektroprenos came into existence as part of a 2006 agreement.
RS holds a 41% stake in the company, while the Federation of BiH holds the remaining 59%.
Local and international experts have stressed that neither of the two entities can legally pull out of the company, whose establishment rests on legislation approved by the state parliament in 2004.
"An entity cannot withdraw unilaterally from a previously agreed reform," the PIC Steering Board ambassadors said in their statement Friday.
Lajcak's deputy, Raffi Gregorian, warned at the weekend that the PIC, which oversees implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement, would use "all mechanisms necessary" if RS does not revoke its decision.
"The RS government entered into an open conflict with the international community that may have long-reaching consequences," he told the Sarajevo-based daily Dnevni Avaz.
Dimitris Kourkoulas, the head of the European Commission delegation in BiH, warned that Banja Luka's decision would undermine reforms in the electricity sector implemented with "substantial" support from the EU and other donors, as well as the country's SAA process.
The French and US embassies in Sarajevo also expressed their governments' concerns over the RS authorities' act.
It "raises profound constitutional questions ... and is politically reckless," the US Embassy said on Friday.
Turkish scholar acquitted of inciting religious hatred
A 92-year-old scholar, the latest of a number of Turkish intellectuals to face trial for expressing their opinions, was acquitted by an Istanbul court on Wednesday.

It took an Istanbul court only about half-an-hour on Wednesday (November 1st) to acquit a 92-year-old historian, tried on charges of insulting Muslim women and inciting religious hatred.
The accusations against Muazzez Ilmiye Cig stemmed from a book the retired expert on Sumerian civilisation wrote last year.
The veteran researcher claimed that the headscarf was first used about 5,000 years ago by Sumerian priestesses initiating young men into sex.
They wore the veil to distinguish themselves from other priestesses in the temple, according to the author.
Offended by Cig's assertion, Izmir-based lawyer Yusuf Akin filed a complaint against her.
Charges of "insulting a certain group of people on the basis of religion" were then brought against the scholar and her publisher, Ismet Ogutcu.
"I am a person of the Ataturk revolution, and as a Turkish woman I try to bring people together," Cig told the court during the first trial hearing on the case Wednesday, referring to Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the modern Turkish republic. "I'm not someone who is trying to incite hatred."
Shortly afterwards the three-judge panel ruled that Cig's statements did not constitute a crime and the charges were dropped.
Had they been convicted, both Cig and her publisher faced up to 18 months in prison.
Headscarves are common in predominantly Muslim, but secular, Turkey.
However, they are banned from many public places, including government offices and universities.
Cig, who retired more than 30 years ago and is the author of 13 books, is the latest of many Turkish intellectuals to have been brought to trial over their views, or because of remarks they have made.
Others include Nobel Prize winner Orhan Pamuk and novelist Elif Shafak.
The latest trial opened shortly before the European Commission is due to release a critical report on Turkey's progress towards EU accession on November 8th.
The Cig case reportedly has been criticised by Brussels.
It also drew fire from the International Association for Assyriology (IAA).
"A veteran researcher who, throughout a long career, has contributed to the recovery of the ancient past, Dr. Cig is a model representative of Turkish contribution to scholarship," the IAA said in a statement on Tuesday, appealing for the dismissal of the charges.
Mixed signals regarding timetable for Kosovo
International officials appear undecided over whether a decision on Kosovo status should be put off due to the upcoming elections in Serbia.
Meanwhile, media have been reporting some of the ideas being put forward by UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari.

Postponing a decision on Kosovo's status "would contribute nothing", US special envoy Frank Wisner said in Belgrade on Tuesday (October 31st).
"The issue should be resolved as soon as possible, so that the region is not left in a vacuum," he said.
He also pledged that Serbs would be ensured a future in Kosovo.
"The rights of no people in the Balkans will be as strongly protected as will the rights of Serbs and their churches and monasteries in Kosovo," Wisner told reporters after talks with Serbian President Boris Tadic, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic.
Asked about the possibility of deferring a decision on Kosovo because of upcoming elections in Serbia, Wisner said he could not "speak hypothetically, as the date of the vote in Serbia has not been set".
The same day, however, EU security chief Javier Solana suggested that UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari should delay presenting his final proposal on status until after the Serbian elections, if the vote is held this year.
"If this were the case, I think that [former Finnish] President Ahtisaari and those who are helping him, should wait," Solana told reporters in Madrid.
Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Ahtisaari downplayed media reports this week that leaked details of the envoy's draft proposal.
Citing Western diplomatic sources, the reports said it does not stipulate independence outright, but rather sets out benchmarks leading to "conditional independence".
Kosovo would initially be a state without a chair in the UN, a foreign ministry or an army, the reports said.
After a period of 12 to 18 months, however, the Kosovo Assembly would adopt a new constitution, declare independence, and gain the right to request full membership in the UN.
But Ahtisaari's spokesperson, Hua Jiang, stressed that the envoy has neither finished his proposal nor presented anything to UN officials in New York other than initial ideas.
"We are still working on it, talking with the Contact Group members, and the future status of Kosovo cannot be determined in this stage," Jiang told the Belgrade based Beta news agency.
Leaders in Belgrade and Pristina have reacted critically to the reported details.
Serbian Prime Minister Kostunica said the proposal would be "doomed to failure" if it violates Serbian territorial integrity, while Kosovo counterpart Agim Ceku told visiting EU envoy Stephan Lehne that "there will be a problem" if Ahtisaari's document does not refer to Kosovo independence.
"The majority of Kosovo's people are waiting for independence.
It is very important that Ahtisaari's report mentions Kosovo's independence," Ceku said.
For his part, Lehne highlighted the need to push ahead with the implementation of UN-set standards for Kosovo.
While the Kosovo institutions have achieved much progress, they "still have much work to do", Lehne said.
Declining to comment on any specific solution for Kosovo's future, he said the timetable should become clearer after the Contact Group meeting scheduled for November 10th.
"I think that on November 10th, we will know more clearly the agenda," Lehne said. "Until now there has been no clear decision, even though we have seen individual statements."
Viewers choose "Greatest Romanian"
The late Stephen the Great has triumphed over nine other finalists in a popular TV production held over the past several months.
He now heads to the international arena to compete against other personalities from around the world.

Romanians have had their say about who is their country's greatest figure, digging deep into the past to choose Stefan cel Mare (Stephen the Great).
On October 21st, after six months of public discussion, nearly 363,000 citizens chose among ten candidates who made it to the finals of a show organised by Romania's state television, TVR.
Stephen the Great (1433-1504) won a landslide victory, receiving 77.5% of the votes. Ruler of Moldova, one of the three historic provinces that were to unite in 1918 to form Romania, he remains popular among Romanians due to the 44 monasteries and churches he built throughout his reign, the second longest in Romanian history.
Vanquisher of Sultan Mohamed II in the battle of Vaslui (1475), Stephen the Great gained the respect of European leaders, who saw him as a gifted military strategist.
Pope Sextus IV dubbed him "Christ's Athlete", and the Romanian Orthodox Church sanctified him in 1992.
The goal of the TV production was to single out, through the eyes of a people, outstanding persons who, by means of their deeds and accomplishments, remained in the collective memory of a nation across centuries and even millenniums -- embodying, to the highest degree, the values of humanity, knowledge and action.
Some critics, though, argue that the show is simply entertainment.
It is meaningless, they say, to single out one special character among the many personalities who left their mark on Romanian history, society and culture.
"Great Romanians" was an adaptation of a BBC production.
The idea has been a success in many other countries around the world.
Romania's winner will now compete in an international match up of personalities.
The contest is structured in two phases -- nominations and the voting. The nomination process started on May 27th and ended on July 8th, assembling 100 distinguished Romanian personalities on a single list.
The ten who qualified for the final were each honoured with a documentary featuring a current celebrity who pleaded to the viewers on behalf of his or her "client".
The evaluation criteria were courage, genius, greatness, leadership abilities and spiritual legacy.
The other nine finalists were, in descending order according to the number of votes, King Carol I; poet Mihai Eminescu; the ruler Mihai Viteazu (Michael the Brave); evangelical Christian minister Richard Wurmbrand; dictator Ion Antonescu; writer, philosopher and religious historian Mircea Eliade; ruler Alexandru Ioan Cuza; sculptor Constantin Brancusi; and gymnast Nadia Comaneci.
UNMIK deputy chief, Belgrade officials discuss Kosovo refugee returns
UNMIK deputy chief Steven Schook and Serbian officials have expressed satisfaction with their discussions Wednesday in Belgrade on a number of Kosovo-related issues, including refugee returns.

UNMIK deputy chief Steven Schook voiced optimism Wednesday (14 June) following what he described as "sincere" talks with Serbian officials on a number of important Kosovo-related issues.
"The purpose of these meetings was to start an honest and direct dialogue with the leaders in Belgrade with respect to returns, returnees and property," Schook told reporters. "I am very optimistic.
We agreed to have follow-up meetings at the technical level.
We began a sincere dialogue in the best interest of all the displaced persons and truly in the best interest of the economic development of Kosovo."
The return of people displaced by the 1998-1999 ethnic conflict in Kosovo, particularly of Serb refugees, is a critical factor for determining the future status of the province. Over 200,000 members of the Kosovo Serb and other minority groups have fled since 1999, fearing revenge attacks by ethnic Albanians, following the Milosevic regime's bloody crackdown and its subsequent withdrawal from the province after a NATO air campaign.
Some 100,000 ethnic Serbs remain.
Belgrade claims that only some 10,000 Serb refugees have returned to their homes over the past seven years, accusing UNMIK of failing to ensure the protection of that community.
Schook's visit came days after Serbian and Kosovo officials and UNMIK's outgoing head, Soren Jessen-Petersen, signed a protocol on 6 June, pledging to speed up the return of people displaced by the 1998-1999 conflict.
The sides agreed that ensuring the safety of returnees, returning property to the displaced and rebuilding their houses, and creating an environment that sustains returns are critical factors for the success of the process.
Schook's visit also coincided with the release of UN Secretary general Kofi Annan's latest report on Kosovo, which concludes that the Serbs and the Kosovo Albanians remain far apart in their positions.
Annan stressed that "flexibility, generosity and a spirit of compromise" on both sides are essential to progress in the negotiations.
Among the officials Schook talked to in Belgrade were the president of Serbia's Co-ordination Centre for Kosovo, Sanda Raskovic-Ivic, Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic, Serbian presidential adviser Dusan Batakovic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's political and foreign policy advisers.
Schook briefed them about the privatisation process in Kosovo and how private property issues are handled.
Raskovic-Ivic described her meeting with Schook as "very good and useful," adding that besides the privatisation and property issues, the two had discussed "the public transportation problem" in Kosovo.
Draskovic told Schook that Serbian authorities were ready to show "maximum flexibility" in the Kosovo status talks, Belgrade-based daily Blic reported on Thursday.
Half a million Croats live below the social minimum

By Kristina Cuk for Southeast European Times in Zagreb -- 15/06/06
Despite Croatia's rising GNP, the number of people living in poverty has changed little over the past decade.
The number of people below the poverty line in Croatia basically has remained unchanged since 1999, even though the country's GNP has doubled over the past ten years.
The Croatian economy has grown faster than the EU member-country average, but the number of people living in poverty remains the same, according to government data.
Those who receive permanent social help in Croatia receive just 55 euros a month due to limited resources.
Due to low pension funds and unstable salaries, almost 500,000 Croats are under the social minimum, a term that refers to the level of income needed for a person or family to live without major deprivation.
Most of those below the threshold live in rural areas, and make their living working the land.
Many are not eligible for assistance under the regulations.
Half of the government funding for social assistance -- about 2 per cent of the GNP -- is spent on single households.
One third of the remainder goes to families with children and single parent families.
Almost half of social help recipients are over 40 years old.
More than 40 per cent of the recipients did not finish elementary school, one-third have an elementary school education and one-fourth have finished high school.
Regionally, south and eastern Croatia are poorer than the north and western parts of the country.
More than 70 per cent of those who are considered poor are concentrated in central and eastern Croatia.
The largest numbers reside in areas damaged in the 1990s conflict.
The government is currently working to develop a National Strategy of Health and a project that will redevelop the social welfare system as a measure against poverty and social exclusivity.
The new criteria link financial help from the state to income and property status and close loopholes existing under the current system.
For example, a person who owns a hotel or a company, but registers an income of only 214 euros a month, may currently be eligible for aid even though they are not in need of it.
"That is why an asset census is one of the possible models for new social politics" said Health and Social Care Minister Neven Ljubicic.
Under the planned reform, every citizen will receive an asset card from the government.
On this card, they must record all profits and properties they own.
The authorities will use this information to determine who will receive financial assistance.
Croatia has a GNP of 7,000 euros per capita.
Despite those figures, Croatia is still far from having a stable social policy structure.
Many hope an infusion of EU assistance, now that Croatia is a candidate country, will help tackle the problem.
IMF to assess pace of change in Serbia
As part of its deal with the IMF, Serbia pledged to trim inflation, pursue stricter monetary and fiscal policies, and restructure public enterprises.
A mission from the Fund is now in Belgrade to see how much progress has been achieved.

An IMF mission, headed by Peter Doyle, is on a two-week visit to Belgrade.
The goal is to see how far the Serbian government has progressed in completing its existing deal with the Fund, under which it committed to trimming inflation -- currently at around 15.5 per cent, the highest level in Europe -- pursuing stricter monetary and fiscal policies, and accelerating structural reforms.
All that was set forth in the monitoring programme after the three-year arrangement was concluded.
In return for a 700m debt write-off from the Paris Club of creditors, Belgrade agreed to embark on major reforms -- namely, restructuring of public enterprises and privatising (or closing down) what remains of the inefficient socially-owned sector.
Such changes, according to the Fund, are a precondition for creating a more favourable investment climate.
However, a new arrangement with the Fund is not on the agenda for this visit, as Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic agree, "the time is not right."
Such statements worry economists.
They are concerned that the current government -- which is about halfway through its mandate -- is seeking to gain manoeuvering space when it comes to implementation of reforms.
Financial experts at the IMF are unlikely to view such an effort favourably.
A few months ago, Dinkic suggested that a new arrangement should not be proposed until after Montenegro's status was decided.
The referendum was held in May and Montenegro is now independent, but there is no letter from Belgrade.
"It's still not clear to me why a letter has not been sent," said Central Bank Governor Radovan Jelasic.
Bozidar Delic, a former finance minister, believes that the uncompromising IMF is very much needed.
"What we need more than money now are responsible policies and monitoring.
In the foreseeable future Serbia will have fragile coalition governments, labouring under daily pressures, that will not be able to prepare the country for the 21st century," Delic said.
In such an environment, pressure from the international financial institutions may be crucial to getting anything done.
Michael Steiner Leaves Kosovo
UNMIK chief Michael Steiner holds a briefing with the leader of the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK), Hashim Thaci (right) at PDK headquarters in Pristina 7 July.
Steiner left his post in Kosovo as head of the UN mission after an 18 month term on 8 July. [AFP] As outgoing UNMIK head Michael Steiner prepared to leave Kosovo, he expressed pride in the multiethnic climate that has begun to develop during his tenure.
By Seremb Gjergji for Southeast European Times in Pristina - 14/07/03
UNMIK head Michael Steiner left Kosovo on 8 July, and the key question now is who his replacement will be.
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has not yet named his choice for a new Special Representative.
In the interim, UNMIK deputy chief Charles Brayshaw, of the United States, will become acting head of the mission.
Two days before his departure, Steiner surprised invitees to his farewell party by making a humorous confession of his true feelings concerning Kosovo's status.
"You all know it by heart, what my motto is: 'First Status Then Standards'," Steiner joked.
During his tenure, the outgoing UNMIK chief asserted that Kosovo must meet standards of democracy and establish functioning institutions before the question of its final status could be addressed.
"The climate in Kosovo has completely changed," Steiner said. "When I arrived I did not find this climate.
The proof is the open letter of the Kosovo leaders addressing all displaced people in Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro to return to their homes."
"When you work, you do not realise that the end is coming.
But now I realise it is getting serious and the clock is ticking," Steiner said.
Many names have emerged as possible replacements for Steiner.
The list includes Portuguese diplomat Jose Cutiliero; Dutch politicians Jan Ponk and Eveline Herfkens; Finnish diplomat Elizabeth Rehn; and Italian diplomat Antonio Armellini.
However, analysts believe Annan could ultimately choose another candidate, as yet unknown to the public.
Steiner came to Kosovo 17 months ago.
While some have criticised his approach as too autocratic, others have praised him for being straightforward, independent and rigorous.
As chief administrator, he worked toward building a functioning multiethnic government, cracking down on smuggling, and establishing the Kosovo Trust Agency, with a special chamber that launched the privatisation process.
Steiner also promulgated the Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure Code of Kosovo, and initiated dialogue between Kosovo leaders and the Serbian government.
But unresolved issues remain, including refugee returns as well as tensions in the ethnically divided town of Mitrovica.
According to Steiner, politicians in both Belgrade and Pristina often proved unable to see that Kosovo "had begun living a normal life as a multiethnic environment. And I am proud of the multiethnic climate I have developed during my mission here."
Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova has a different assessment.
"My opinion is the formal recognition of the independence of Kosovo would accelerate the economic development and interethnic relations which would advance Kosovo," he said.
"We expect further help from you and your respected country in the future, too," Rugova told Steiner at the farewell reception, where he honoured Steiner with the Presidential Medal for Civil Service.
Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi also had praise for Steiner.
Despite occasional friction, "most of the time we co-operated and worked very well together," Rexhepi told reporters.
Brayshaw, meanwhile, said Steiner "arrived on Valentine's Day and finished on the Fourth of July. He started on the day of love and finished on the day where all men are created equal, live in liberty and pursue happiness."
Enver Hoxhaj, a professor at the political science department at Pristina University, believes Steiner's first big success was the movement toward creating the first multiethnic government based on the Constitutional Framework of Kosovo.
"Steiner's approach to the situation at that time helped on the relaxation of tensions between internationals and locals," he says.
But since Kosovo's leaders, as well as Serbs and other minorities, often failed to work closely with Steiner to achieve their goals, the UNMIK head was constrained in many situations, Hoxhaj adds.
"From the oppression, humiliation and tragedy of 1999, Kosovo has embarked on the road towards a liberated, functioning, democratic society," Steiner said in his final report to the Security Council on 1 July.
"Participation for all has not yet been achieved. The dream has not yet been realised. But the groundwork has been laid."
Bulgaria Extends Customs Reform Contract
Bulgaria has extended its contract with the British-based consultants Crown Agents, which was first hired in 2001 to help the country implement a comprehensive customs reform.

Stepping into a new phase in its customs reform programme, Bulgaria has decided to extend its contract with international consultants Crown Agents.
The British-based company was first hired in November 2001 to assist the government in streamlining the customs administration, meeting EU requirements and raising customs revenue collection.
Some of the most important tasks of the programme have included stemming corruption in the customs system and facilitating and stimulating legal trade, Bulgarian Finance Minister Milen Velchev said in July as he announced the extension of the 12.3m-euro contract.
In its Corruption Assessment Report for 2002, Bulgaria's Centre for the Study of Democracy think tank noted that while the results of Crown Agents' work during the first year of its contract appeared "modest", there were also signs suggesting a decrease in corruption in the customs system.
Those included a 70 per cent year-on-year increase in customs fraud detection and the fact that contraband channels had lost political protection.
In July 2002, Bulgaria closed the Customs Union chapter in its accession talks with the EU.
Customs revenue collection also experienced a boost, increasing from less than 1.4 billion euros in 2002 to 1.6 billion euros in 2003.
With nearly 166m euros collected in June 2004, projections for the full year are set at nearly 1.8 billion euros.
"Comparing the last four months of 2003 to the last four months of 2001, the cumulative increase was approximately 43 per cent," said Velchev.
In real terms, the minister noted, the increase in customs revenue collection has translated into an additional 250m euros for the government's social reform programme.
The new, 16.2m-euro contract took effect on 1 August and will expire in December 2006 -- on the eve of Bulgaria's expected EU entry on 1 January 2007.
"The emphasis of the new contract will be on the movement of high risk goods such as alcohol, cigarettes and fuels," said Velchev.
Provisions have also been made for the introduction of new control mechanisms linked to requirements Bulgaria must meet as a new external border of the EU, and for improvements in already established mechanisms.
During the second phase of the programme, the number of mobile teams introduced in the first stage will be increased from ten to 15 to further strengthen inland control.
"The benefit from the consultancy is obvious.
The return rate of the investment in Crown Agents' programme has already been over 50:1," Velchev said. "There is hardly another contract within the system of the civil service that is such a success."
New Conditions Seen for Investments in Serbia
Serbia's Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus says investment conditions have improved, largely because of economic and political developments.
By Davor Konjikusic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade – 18/08/04
Investment risk has dropped over the past four months due to improved economic and political conditions in Serbia, including the election of a reform-minded president, said Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus. [AFP]
Serbian government officials in charge of the economy are pointing to new and improved conditions for investing in the republic.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus, 566m euros of investments are expected this year, of which 242m will be direct investments.
Investment risk has dropped over the past four months due to improved economic and political conditions, including the election of reform-minded President Boris Tadic.
According to Labus, "Today we are ranked as a country of highest risk, with a ranking of seven.
That is the highest risk.
For instance, Bulgaria and Romania are ranked five, Croatia is ranked four.
We believe that Serbia is far more secure than this ranking indicates." Corruption remains the most serious barrier to investments, he added.
Meanwhile, the head of the agency for foreign investment and import promotion, Jasna Matic, announced that a recent investment conference held in Vienna gave an award for the largest Greenfield investment to Ball Packaging Europe, for its investment in the construction of an aluminium can factory in Serbia.
Matic also said that the Del-jug company, which is part of Delta Holding, has been named the biggest investor in Serbia, while the Hemofarm concern from Vrsac is the biggest investor in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
According to the OECD's regional co-ordinator, Antoine Kurineri Millet, the Vienna conference's award sends a "positive message to investors and encourages the government to continue economic reforms, because that is the only way to attract new investments.
The economic development of Serbia is in the common interest of the government and investors, and we are planning to remain devoted to this large market."
Improving the investment climate, fostering dialogue between the government and investors and reaching an investing agreement should be priorities for Belgrade. Millet says.
With around 200 euros of Foreign Direct Investment per capita, Serbia-Montenegro still occupies the last place among countries in the region, data from the Serbian Chamber of Commerce indicates.
Croatia Holds Parliamentary Elections Sunday
Croatia's two main political parties will dominate Sunday's parliamentary elections.
Whatever the outcome, the next government will be a coalition and its main task will be negotiating Croatia's entry into the EU.
By Ivana Erceg for Southeast European Times in Zagreb - 20/11/03
The two most influential political parties in Croatia, Prime Minister Ivica Racan's Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), are locked in a tight race as Sunday's (23 November) parliamentary elections approach.
Both parties stress that they will guide the country into the EU.
Opinion polls put HDZ ahead of SDP, the leading force of the incumbent centre-left coalition.
According to recent surveys, HDZ leads with 20 per cent to 28 per cent support, 2 per cent to 9 per cent more than SDP.
Analysts say that the centre-left coalition needs high voter turnout in the election and the ongoing support of its main coalition partner, the Croatian Peasants' Party, which is keeping its cards close to its chest.
Meanwhile, another coalition member -- the Croatian Peoples' Party (HNS) -- has made it clear it would prefer a post-election coalition with SDP.
Because it wants to check its political power independently, however, HNS has decided to go into the elections together with some minor political parties.
That could result in a dispersion of votes.
Regardless of which party emerges the strongest after the election, the next government will be a coalition and its main task will be negotiating the Balkan country's entry into the EU.
Croatia applied for EU membership in February, hoping to start negotiations next year and join the bloc along with Bulgaria and Romania in 2007.
But the opportunity to realise that goal has been jeopardised because Croatia didn't arrest fugitive retired General Ante Gotovina, who is wanted by the UN war crimes court at The Hague for allegedly massacring at least 150 ethnic Serbs during the 1991-1995 war.
The key condition for Croatia's EU membership is full co-operation with The Hague tribunal.
The EU has repeatedly made it clear that it expects Croatia to arrest and extradite Gotovina to The Hague.
HDZ President Ivo Sanader said his party is very different from the one that led the country during the war, and would fully co-operate with the UN court "even in the case of General Gotovina".
He also called on Serbs to return, another important EU demand.
Opponents dismiss the HDZ's moves as electioneering ploys.
Some, recalling the party's past record, warn that nationalistic voters remain its base.
In general, the electorate views the two sides differently -- judging HDZ by what it did while in power, and the current ruling coalition by what it has not done.
The centre-left coalition's landslide election victory against HDZ in January 2000 marked a turning point in the country's political life.
Racan and his coalition partners pledged to transform Croatia into an economically stable democracy fully integrated with Europe.
But after coming to power, the coalition was exhausted by constant internal bickering.
It has been criticised for failing to address corruption left over from the previous regime, and for not reducing unemployment, which stood at 18.3 per cent in September.
Racan's government has lost some favour among the people of Croatia, leading to erosion of the centre-left coalition support base.
Meanwhile, the HDZ has had time to regroup and consolidate.
Macedonian businesses chafe at smoking ban
Lighting up in public will lead to a stiff fine under new restrictions that went into effect this month.
Restaurant owners say the new rules are too tight.

As promised, Macedonian authorities have been strictly enforcing a prohibition on smoking in public places since January 1st, drawing the ire of local businesses that are afraid for the bottom line.
"For the time being, the patrons respect the law because of the high fines…But turnover has gone down," the owner of popular Skopje cafe-bar Play told Southeast European Times.
Lower earnings could lead to fewer jobs, restaurateurs warn.
An estimated 17,000 people out of 2.1 million in Macedonia either work directly or are dependent on the restaurant/cafe business.
On Friday, many establishments plan to shut down for a 24-hour protest, said Ognen Cigovski, president of the Macedonian Chamber of Cafe Bar and Restaurant Owners.
His association wants the law amended to allow smoking and non-smoking sections, and is seeking to meet with officials to find a solution.
The government, however, is standing firm.
"Macedonia is not the first and will not be the last country to decide on complete implementation of a smoking ban in public places," said Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Pesevski.
Members of the public appear to be complying.
The government conducted 1,350 inspections of restaurants, cafe bars, pubs and clubs across the country and found only two violations, in the towns of Kumanovo and Gostivar.
The individuals involved were fined on the spot and the businesses received citations.
Fines range between 150 and 300 euros for individuals and 2,500 to 4,500 euros for businesses.
Businesses that repeatedly breach the law can be closed for up to 30 days.
Inspectors also conducted 208 inspections in public enterprises and local government offices and did not find a single violation.
However, they issued 19 citations for failure to put up "smoking prohibited" signs.
"The law is good and shouldn't be changed," Skopje resident Zoran Stefanovski told SETimes. "Several days ago I was having lunch with my family at a restaurant, and we really enjoyed it because there was no smoke.
Smoking should not be allowed in places where people eat."
Smokers believe the law is too strict.
Olivera Pankova believes "European laws" should be adapted to the local mentality, and the government must now allow smoking-only cafes.
"If there are cafe bars for smokers, then non-smokers could decide to enter such bars or not," she said.
Opposition MPs Vlado Buckovski and Gorgji Orovcanec began collecting signatures in parliament to initiate a procedure to amend the law.
"We don't have anything against this law but we think that it is too restrictive and that Macedonia should apply the Austrian model," said Buckovski, referring to the model by which cafe bars of over 100 square meters can secure smoking sections for smokers, and owners can apply for a license if they decide their establishment should include smokers.
New northern Kosovo strategy draws fire
A strategic document outlining a new approach for northern Kosovo has been criticised by Serb representatives.
By Linda Karadaku for Southeast European Times in Pristina -- 18/01/10
"The strong, fair and multiethnic rule-of-law institutions for all communities are the only option," said EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon. [Getty Images]
A newly drafted plan by the Kosovo government and the International Civilian Presence (ICO) that outlines a new approach and strategy for Kosovo's volatile north, has drawn fire from Serb representatives, according to local media reports.
The strategy envisions the creation of a Northern Mitrovica municipality by mid-year.
It also stipulates that the Kosovo government organise local elections this year in three northern municipalities -- Zvecan, Leposavic and Zubin Potok.
According to Pristina, the new approach will help marginalise the structures of Serbia, which are operating in that part of Kosovo, and foresees an increased EULEX presence.
"The strong, fair and multiethnic rule-of-law institutions for all communities are the only option.
This will be a guarantee for a fair justice and will make the so-called parallel structures irrelevant," EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon said.
He said that EULEX's top priority is to get Kosovo Serb and Kosovo Albanian judges and prosecutors back to the Mitrovica District Court, so that justice can be delivered by a local, multiethnic and single judiciary.
"Nowhere else in Europe have we two judicial systems operating at the same time and in the same place.
Two jurisdictions would result in no justice being delivered, but trigger conflicting decisions that would go against the rights of the people.
There can be only one judicial system in Kosovo," he said.
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci expressed support for the new strategy.
"The establishment of the rule of law in the entire territory of Kosovo also means the disbanding of the structures or the avoidance of the obstacles coming from individuals who do not recognise the institutions and the laws of Kosovo," Thaci said.
He added that the new plan also aims to improve the economic situation in the area.
"The strategy has four main fields: strengthening the rule of law on the entire territory of Kosovo, decentralisation and the formation of new municipalities in northern Mitrovica, the issue of municipal governments in the three northern municipalities and improving the social-economic situation in this part of Kosovo."
However, according to Serb National Council for Northern Kosovo President Milan Ivanovic, Serbs wish to remain under Belgrade's constitutional and legal system.
The new plan, therefore, would lead to a destabilisation in the north.
"This intended strategy to expel UNMIK, which is supposed to work in the spirit of Resolution 1244, from Kosovo, and that EULEX should take its place -- an organisation which comes from the countries that created that independent Kosovo -- is certainly not beneficial for the final solution, just as the elections in [Mitrovica] will not succeed, " he said.
Serbian President Boris Tadic told radio Glas Srbije that the Kosovo question is not over for Serbia.
Belgrade wants to negotiate with the Kosovo Albanians to find a compromise, "which entails Serbia" in Kosovo.
He insisted that while Serbia "would never recognise Kosovo independence", it "has no intention to run lives of the Kosovo Albanians".
On January 12th, Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu told the World Affairs Council in San Francisco that Kosovo has challenges in the north, "where we have more of a concentration of the parallel structures, which are financed from the official Belgrade".
"There are a lot of people in these structures who owe a lot to justice.
Their leaders are people with a criminal past, who have committed crimes in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo.
Without having put these people in front of justice, it is difficult to think of stability in that part of Kosovo, which, unfortunately, has been transformed in an area where smuggling also flourishes," Sejdiu said.
Israel, Turkey seek to mend strained relations

Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak held talks with senior Turkish officials in Ankara on Sunday (January 17th) aimed at easing recent tensions between the two allies.
The two countries formed an alliance in the mid-1990s that resulted in more than 20 bilateral military agreements, stronger bilateral co-operation and joint exercises.
But those ties grew strained following Israel's offensive in Palestinian-ruled Gaza last year and the clash between Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan and Israeli President Shimon Peres over the matter at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 2009.
A new diplomatic row was sparked last week when Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon publicly humiliated Ankara's envoy to Tel Aviv over a Turkish TV-series portraying Israeli agents as child abductors.
The Israeli official, who summoned Ambassador Ahmet Oguz Celikkol to express his country's protest against the show, denied the Turkish diplomat a handshake before the press and arranged for Celikkol to be photographed on a low couch, while he sat in a higher chair.
Outraged, Turkey threatened to withdraw its envoy from Israel.
The diplomatic crisis ended when Israel sent a letter to Ankara, apologising for the incident.
Barak, who became the highest-level Israeli official to visit Turkey since last year's confrontation between Erdogan and Peres, called Ayalon's actions "a mistake".
"I believe it was a mistake, and the right step was taken according to the norms of diplomacy," he said at a joint news conference with his official host, Turkish Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul. "It is appropriate that all the ups and downs in our relationship over the years should be solved and put behind us."
Gonul said that Turkey wanted to co-operate with Israel and that the two countries remain allies, making it clear however that their relations would be interest-driven.
"As long as we have the same interests, we work together, to fix the common problems," Reuters quoted the minister's remarks in English. "Also we are allies, we are strategic allies as long as our interests force us to do so."
According to Israeli daily Ha'aretz, the focus of talks at the Turkish defence ministry was on bilateral co-operation in the military industry.
The paper reported Gonul as saying that the dispute over a $180m deal for the purchase of ten Israeli-made Heron drones would be resolved by the end of this year.
Barak also met with Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu during the visit.
No statements were made after the talks.

The EBRD announced on February 27th that it extended a 10m-euro loan to Erste & Steiermarkische S-Leasing, Croatia's biggest leasing company, to support micro businesses in the country.
The credit will be designated to help S-Leasing expand its systems and enable more access by small firms.
The IMF Executive Board said on February 27th that it has concluded the 2006 Article IV consultation with Croatia, as a last step to finalising the $141.3 m stand-by programme, which expired last year.
The IMF's conclusions were mostly favourable, commending prudent fiscal policy and robust economic growth.
The consortium between the Slovenian Telekom Slovenija and Kosovo Internet provider Ipko Net -- which won the license for a second mobile operator in Kosovo -- announced late last week that they transferred the price of 75m euros into the provincial budget.
The Kosovo telecom regulator decided to grant the license to the consortium, second-ranked in the wireless tender, after the first-ranked bidder failed to pay the pledged price.
Russian Gazprom said on Wednesday (February 28th) that it will export 250m cubic meters of gas to Turkey annually until 2021, under an agreement reached between Gazprom and the Turkish subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell, Shell Enerji.
Russian gas deliveries to Turkey stood at around 20m cubic metres last year.

Romanian Power Plant to Remain Closed for Weeks
The reactor at Cernavoda provides more than 10 per cent of Romania's energy output.
Authorities closed the unit at the weekend, given the plummeting level of the Danube.
(Rompres, International Herald Tribune, Seeurope.net - 25/08/03; Washington Times - 24/08/03; Reuters, AFP - 23/08/03)
As the Danube continues to recede, Romania has shut down Unit 1 of its Cernavoda nuclear power plant, blocking further operation of the reactor's cooling system.
The 706.5 megawatt reactor is expected to remain closed for another four to six weeks.
"The reactor will remain closed until the Danube level reaches 2-2.5 metres, and its restarting will depend upon the existence of a sufficient debit of the river, which could ensure a normal running for the plant", Romanian Minister of Economy and Trade Dan Ioan Popescu said Sunday (24 August).
His statement came a day after the water level dropped below the 2 metre mark, the lowest in the last 160 years, while the debit fell under 1,600 cubic metres per second, slightly more than a third of the river's usual August debit of 4,400-4,600 cubic metres per second.
The reactor, the first of five planned units at the Cernavoda plant, has been in use since 1996.
It has been supplying about 680 megawatts of electricity, accounting for more than 10 per cent of Romania's energy output.
"The unprecedented dropping of water levels in the Danube in recent days made us decide to close the reactor at Cernavoda," Popescu said.
On Friday, State Secretary for Economy and Trade Andrei Grigorescu, who also heads the economy ministry department that monitors the Cernavoda plant, had told reporters that Unit 1 would continue operating within its nominal parameters and would be shut down only if the level of the Danube was to recede by another 70cm.
Several hours later, the temporary closure of the reactor was ordered as temperatures remained high, leading to a sudden drop of the water level in the plant's aspiration reservoir.
The level of the Danube dropped another 5cm overnight.
"The level of the Danube dropped from one day to the next from 125cm to 120cm, which as a result meant a drop in the quantity of water needed for cooling the reactor," AFP quoted Secretary of State for Energy Iulian Iancu as saying.
The government has already announced its plans for an increase of between 12 per cent and 22 per cent in electricity, heating and natural gas prices as of 1 September.
News of the Cernavoda shutdown sparked concerns about a new electricity price hike.
Popescu has dismissed such speculation, saying the government would boost the output of thermal power stations to compensate for the loss of capacity.
The unprecedented drought this summer has also caused some hydroelectric power stations to run at a lower capacity, while hydro-meteorological forecasts suggest the level of the Danube will likely continue to recede over the next few days.
The river, which shapes the Bulgarian-Romanian border, has dried up in some places, revealing the riverbed.
Many are saying that if the drought continues, one will soon be able to cross from one country into the other on foot.
Kosovo team split ahead of negotiations
Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova's negotiating team for upcoming talks on Kosovo's status is off to a rocky start, with infighting among members and threatening emails from extremists

Despite repeated pledges of unity over the past months, the Kosovo delegation for upcoming status talks faces serious internal disputes as individual members vied for authority.
The team consists of President Ibrahim Rugova, Prime Minister Bajram Kosumi, Parliament Speaker Nexhat Daci, Democratic Party of Kosovo head Hashim Thaci, and ORA leader Veton Surroi.
All but Daci participated in the Ramboulliet negotiations that preceded NATO's action in Kosovo in 1999.
According to local press reports, the trouble started at a meeting with US Deputy Secretary of State Nicholas Burns.
Co-ordinator Blerim Shala -- appointed by Rugova -- was the first to speak, jumping in ahead of Daci.
A furious Daci later dismissed Shala's proposal for the composition of working groups.
Thaci then joined in, charging that Shala "lacks the legitimacy needed to be a policymaker".
Shala, publisher of the daily newspaper Zeri, fought back in his publication, writing that Daci and Thaci are sabotaging the negotiating team.
He made similar comments on the television channel KTV, owned by another team member, ORA party leader Veton Surroi.
Some speculated that Surroi and Shala have joined in an alliance against Daci and Thaci.
Not longer afterwards, however, Surroi and Thaci were seen drinking tea together at a local bar.
"At this moment the drinking of tea is from a very big importance," said Ylber Hysa, an aide to Surroi.
Rugova has since moved to calm the waters, affirming that the "working group will be institutional".
That amounts to an endorsement of a strong role for the parliament speaker.
However, the team now faces a new conflict over whether the negotiating strategy should be based on expert-based proposals or drawn up by the political institutions.
As if the internal feuding wasn't enough, Kosovo's negotiators have also had to deal with threats from an extremist formation, the "Army for Independence of Kosova".
An e-mail from the group demanded that the Rugova-led team unilaterally declare Kosovo's independence prior to the negotiations and challenge Belgrade's sovereignty in the Presheva Valley, a mainly Albanian-populated region in south Serbia. "
If members of parliament don't behave in accordance with the mandate they got from the voters, they would face a very difficult period," the e-mail from a "Commander Luigji" threatened.
The email message came just in time for the Contact Group's closed-door meeting on Wednesday, at which a plan for conducting the status talks was to be approved, as well as a date for launching the discussions.
In response to the email, KFOR spokesman Pio Sabetta said the new paramilitary formation could not jeopardise security in the province, adding that KFOR, UNMIK and local police are investigating who is behind the effort.
Serbia's Central Bank puts brakes on leasing market
Leasing companies have enjoyed a brisk business in Serbia during recent years, offering short-term convenience -- though at a steep cost in the long run.
New regulations by the National Bank of Serbia are expected to dampen the boom.

Over the past several years, leasing companies have expanded their business in Serbia at lightning speed.
So much so, in fact, that the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) is having to cool them down with new regulations.
The leasing industry has become a lifeline for individuals and companies alike.
The most frequent items purchased through leasing in Serbia are commercial and passenger vehicles, consumer goods such as television sets and appliances, and manufacturing equipment and machines.
Serbs, who have developed a sharp appetitite for such goods over the years of disintegration and economic stagnation, are drawn to the short-term convenience of leasing -- and often indifferent to the long-term expense.
According to official data, turnover in the Serbian leasing market amounted to as much as 220m euros during the first ten months of 2004.
That is four times the amount registered in the first six months of 2003, when this type of financing was introduced.
Under the new regulations, leasing companies will be obliged to deposit reserve funds with the NBS, while the cost of financial leasing will have to be expressed uniformly.
The Central Bank will conduct licensing of all participants in the market, and leasing firms will be required to have at least 100,000 euros of equity capital, a serious plan for future business activities and adequate staff.
To the dismay of many consumers, leasing will be allowed only for items worth at least 2,000 euros -- a sum close to the average annual salary in Serbia -- and will not be allowed for general consumer products, including cars and home appliances.
The transportation sector will likely be the first to feel the pinch.
In Serbia, the average automobile or commercial vehicle is over ten years old, while the demand for newer vehicles will increase with the opening of the economy towards the EU.
However, NBS officials insist the new rules are not aimed at inconveniencing citizens, but motivated by micro-financial logic.
In addition, officials say, consumers are often vulnerable to questionable leasing schemes, signing up for arrangements without knowing all of the terms.
"We will insist that leasing companies will be required to present all the expenses that a consumer will have during the five to six years, just as we have done with bank credits," says NBS Vice Governor Dejan Simic.
Leasing companies claim that this will increase the price of their services.
It was precisely because no Central Bank deposit was necessary, they argue, that better leasing terms could be offered to customers.
Greece ratifies Bulgaria, Romania's accession treaty with EU
Bulgaria and Romania's entry into the EU will ensure that the voice of the Balkans is better heard in Europe and will help enhance regional co-operation, Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis said Wednesday, as Greek lawmakers ratified the two countries' accession treaty.
(Xinhua - 03/11/05; AP, Athens News Agency, Macedonian Press Agency, Reporter.gr, SEE Security Monitor, Sofia News Agency, Rompres, Mediapool, Dnevnik - 02/11/05)

The Greek Parliament on Wednesday (2 November) ratified Bulgaria and Romania's accession treaty with the EU, under which the two Balkan countries are to join the bloc in January 2007.
The assembly's special session was attended by the Bulgarian and Romanian presidents, Georgi Parvanov and Traian Basescu, as well as by their Greek counterpart, Karolos Papoulias.
An overwhelming majority of lawmakers in the 300-seat parliament supported the two countries' treaty.
Only the Communist Party voted against, for the same reasons it opposed Greece's own entry into the EU about 30 years ago.
Greece thus became the fifth EU member after Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia and Cyprus to approve the agreement, signed in Luxembourg on 25 April.
The document, which must be ratified by all EU nations by 31 December 2006 for Bulgaria and Romania to be able to enter the Union on schedule, is expected to be approved also by the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania by the end of this year.
Last month, the European Commission (EC) warned Bulgaria and Romania that they must speed up implementation of required reforms to avoid accession being delayed by one year.
The EC is due to decide whether the two countries are prepared to meet the obligations of EU membership in April or May next year.
Thanking Greece for ratifying the treaty, Parvanov voiced confidence that, despite difficulties, Bulgaria will meet its EU commitments.
Basescu made a similar statement.
"Bulgaria and Romania's EU accession will boost the voice of the Balkans in Europe," Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis said in an address to MPs. "This opens new prospects for strengthening regional co-operation."
Voicing hope that the other Balkan countries will also move forward on the path to EU membership, Karamanlis said this would "secure regional peace, stability and democracy".
Later in the day, Karamanlis, Parvanov and Basescu met for their 4th tripartite co-operation summit.
They discussed a range of issues, including the European prospects of the Balkans, the status of Kosovo, and the establishment of a Regional Situational Centre to co-ordinate responses to natural disasters.
During their visit to Athens, Parvanov and Basescu also held separate meetings with Papoulias and George Papandreou, the leader of the main opposition PASOK party.
On Thursday, Parvanov travels to Bucharest for a two-day official visit at Basescu's invitation.
Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina balk at CEFTA deal
Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia have less than a month to sign an agreement that will make them members of the South European Free Trade Zone.
If they decline, they could lose out on a market of 40 million consumers.

Two countries -- Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Serbia -- declined to initial an agreement on a Southeast European free trade zone at a conference in Brussels on November 9th.
They now have until December 19th to resolve the remaining areas of disagreement, or risk losing out on a market of 40 million people.
The agreement, which would expand the existing Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) to include Albania, BiH, Croatia, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro and Kosovo, is meant to replace a labyrinth of 31 bilateral deals.
It is considered crucial to prospects for EU enlargement in the region.
"Cross-border co-operation is not optional, it is the precondition for success," Stability Pact head Erhard Busek said last week. "What matters is not the size of the market, but the quality of its development.
If you wish to compete outside your region, you need to reach the European markets via regional co-operation."
BiH and Serbia have raised different objections to the treaty in its present form.
Sarajevo wants to include a provision allowing for the temporary introduction of tariffs on products from Croatia and Serbia.
In this way, it seeks to legalise its earlier, unilateral break with bilateral contracts signed with the two countries.
After Croatia and Serbia mutually agreed on some level of customs protection for meat and milk manufacturers, BiH found itself unprotected.
Under strong pressure from farmers, the authorities decided to impose restrictions.
Serbia's main point of contention relates to a dispute with Croatia over the tobacco industry.
Both states, for all practical purposes, have closed markets.
Croatia protects its manufacturer, the Rovinj tobacco plant, with a 38% customs tax.
Serbia, meanwhile, has a small (15%) tax on imported cigarettes, but its factories at Nis (owned by Philip Morris) and Vranje (owned by British American Tobacco) are protected with high excise duties.
Foreign Economic Relations Minister Milan Parivodic says the ministry's state secretary, Vlatko Sekulovic, will travel to Zagreb soon to hash out a solution.
Protection of markets with customs barriers is fundamentally contrary to the principles behind CEFTA, and free-trade advocates say they are more likely to harm than help countries in the long run.
The economies of BiH and Serbia are barely competitive in the regional market, which will be completely liberalised by 2010.
That will expose both to the pressures of global competition.
Croatia's Mesic opposes sending new troops to Afghanistan
Croatian President Stipe Mesic and the majority of the opposition parties in parliament oppose sending additional armed forces to Afghanistan to participate in the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission.

Since February 2003, Croatia has been part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan, which assists authorities in the war-torn country and helps provide a secure environment within Kabul and surrounding areas.
Since the mission started, the number of Croatian soldiers has increased.
Including the latest contingent of 69 soldiers that deployed in June, there are now 150.
However, there is a constant need for new troops.
At the September meeting of the NATO foreign ministers in Portoroz, Slovenia, a request was made for Croatia to double its forces within the ISAF.
However, President Stipe Mesic and the majority of the opposition parties reject the idea.
Parliament is expected to vote on the plan by the end of the year.
Presidential advisers say the main concern is the lack of sufficient time to equip and train soldiers for this dangerous field mission.
It was the same issue brought up when authorities were asked about their readiness to send military police troops to Lebanon.
Adding to the confusion is a recent change in the deployment of Croatia's contingent in Afghanistan.
In September, part of the contingent was moved from the relatively safe north to the turbulent south, near the city of Kandahar.
The city is a centre of Taliban activity and a very dangerous place.
Authorities in Croatia have decided to conduct an investigation to determine why and under what circumstances the location of the Croatian contingent was changed.
Every incident that involves Croatian soldiers in Afghanistan raises new debates and questions back home.
Since the beginning of the Croatian mission in 2003, Croatian soldiers have been involved in four armed incidents in Afghanistan.
So far, all the incidents have resulted in minor injuries.
In all, more than 18,000 troops make up the ISAF, with contributions from 37 nations.
The number of soldiers from each country changes on a regular basis due to the rotation of troops.
ISAF conducts patrols throughout the different police districts and is grouped under three commands: the northern headquarters in Mazar-e-Sharif, the western headquarters in Herat and the southern headquarters in Kandahar.
Croatian soldiers have been serving under the northern regional command.
Gul: Turkey won't yield to EU pressure on Cyprus trade issue
Setting deadlines for the opening of Turkish ports and airports to traffic from Cyprus will not help solve the issue, Turkish officials said on Tuesday.
(AFP, AP, International Herald Tribune, VOA, Zaman, Turkish Daily News - 21/11/06)
"Issues like Cyprus cannot be solved by blackmail or setting deadlines," Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said in Ankara. [Getty Images]
Turkey made it clear on Tuesday (November 21st) that it was not planning to move towards opening its ports and airports to traffic from Cyprus before December 6th, as the EU demanded a day earlier.
"Issues like Cyprus cannot be solved by blackmail or setting deadlines," Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul was quoted as telling reporters in Ankara after a meeting with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Ankara's chief EU negotiator, Ali Babacan.
His statement came a day after Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, warned that Turkey's membership talks with the Union could be derailed if the country fails to honour its trade commitments to Cyprus within the next two weeks.
"If they put unacceptable conditions before us, it will not be possible to make progress," the AFP quoted Erdogan as saying Tuesday.
Several months before the official launch of its membership talks with Brussels in October 2005, Ankara signed a protocol extending its 1963 customs union agreement with the EU to cover all of the bloc's new members, including Cyprus.
The internationally recognised, Greek-run part of Cyprus, whose government the EU views as representing the entire island, joined the bloc in May 2004 -- only days after Greek Cypriot voters overwhelmingly rejected a UN-proposed plan to reunite them with the Turkish Cypriots in the north.
Although the deal was approved by the majority of the Turkish Cypriots, whose breakaway state is recognised by Ankara alone, they were not admitted into the 25-nation club.
Despite its obligations under the customs protocol, Turkey has been refusing to allow Greek Cypriot vessels and planes to enter its ports and airports.
It has insisted instead that the EU make good on a promise to ease the economic isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community.
Seeking to end the stalemate, Finland has proposed a compromise, under which Turkey would allow Greek Cypriot ships and planes to enter its ports and airports, while the port of Famagusta in northern Cyprus would be opened for trade with the 25-nation bloc.
At the same time, the former Greek Cypriot residents of neighbouring Varosha would be allowed to return and live there.
According to the Turkish Daily News, however, the Finnish proposal does not provide for the opening of the Ercan airport in the Turkish-run part of Cyprus to international flights.
If the ruling Justice and Development Party were to accept the deal, it would be taking huge political risks in view of next year's general elections, the English-language daily said.
Gul, who is scheduled to go to Finland on Sunday, noted that Ankara had not rejected the Finnish plan and that it was "still under discussion".
"The Finnish presidency is making efforts (for a solution) and we support those efforts," he said on Tuesday. "We still have time."
Romania most successful Balkan country at Beijing Olympics
BEIJING, China -- Romania is so far the most successful Balkan country at the Beijing Olympics, ranking 14th in medals.
It has a total of eight, four of them gold medals won by women -- Sandra Izbasa in the individual gymnastics floor event, Constantina Tomescu-Dita in the marathon, Alina Alexandra Dumitru in judo (48 kg) and Georgeta Andrunache and Viorica Susanu in paired rowing.
Bulgaria, meanwhile, has one gold -- won by female rower Rumyana Neykova.
The country now ranks 27th among the Olympic nations.
Turkey is 42nd with two silver medals (in weightlifting and track and field) and one bronze in wrestling. Greece, the 2004 Olympics host, has so far won only a silver medal (in rowing) and a bronze (in sailing).
Serbian swimmer Milorad Cavic came close to a gold medal Saturday, finishing 0.01 seconds behind Michael Phelps in the 100m butterfly.
Another Serb, tennis star Novak Djokovic, has won bronze.
Neighboring Croatia has a bronze in women's shooting. (Beijing 2008 Olympics official website - 17/08/08)
Romania's Cuprom buys Serbian mine complex
Serbia hopes the sale and subsequent modernisation of the Bor copper works will spur an economic revival in one of the country's poorest towns.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade – 15/03/07

On March 5th, the Romanian company Cuprom became the new owner of Serbia's largest copper mines, having purchased the RTB Bor complex for a price of 303m euros -- the largest privatisation deal of 2007.
Cuprom will invest an additional 137m euros in the company, while the Serbian government plans to pump in 60m euros to repair damage at the facilities, as well as another 60m euros for new, environmentally friendly equipment.
If solving the pollution problem requires more than that amount, the Romanian company is contractually obliged to absorb the cost.
"The purchase of the Bor copper mines is one of the biggest transactions in the Balkans, and with our Romanian capacities we will create an important participant in the European copper industry," Cuprom managing board director Horia Simu said. "The Serbian government has been given the highest possible price and it made a good move in deciding to sell Bor at a time when the price of copper is at its highest."
Serbian Minister of Economy Predrag Bubalo said World Bank experts had proposed that the copper mines be shut down, but the government instead decided to give them a chance on the market.
However, the sale has generated controversy.
Zoran Drakulic, owner of second-place bidder East Point Holdings, says his firm is considering an appeal.
He claims the Serbian government may have eased some of the conditions in the tender to unfairly benefit Cuprom.
Bor Mayor Branislav Rankic, a member of the ultra nationalist Serbian Radical Party, accused the government of selling the mines at an unrealistically low price.
Company management also opposed the Romanian firm's bid.
After the January general election, the Serbian government announced that it would halt privatisations until the formation of a new government.
The Bor sale was brought to a close, however, because the procedure started before the election.
The government hopes that privatising the mines will spur an economic revival in Bor, one of Serbia's poorest towns.
Cuprom has pledged not to dismiss any of the current 4,500 workers over the next three years.
Personnel cut after that will receive 400 euros severance pay for each year spent with the company.
Gotovina, Cermak and Markac case gets a starting date in The Hague
The three generals, jointly indicted for crimes against humanity committed in the Krajina region in 1995, await the launch of their trial.

The trial against three Croatian generals indicted for their role in war crimes during 1995's Operation Storm is set to begin on May 7th at the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
The indictees -- Ante Gotovina, Mladen Markac and Ivan Cermak -- attended a status conference in early February and have appeared together in court for the first time.
Gotovina was arrested in Spain in 2005, while Cermak and Markac surrendered in March 2004.
The three stand accused of taking part in a "joint criminal enterprise" with the intention of persecuting local Serbs.
The charges are based on their command responsibility.
The authorities in Croatia have objected to the indictment, terming it biased and flawed, while at the same time attempting to gain "friend of the court" status.
The trial has garnered much media attention, not only because these are the highest-ranking Croatian military officials to have appeared at The Hague, but also because of the defence team.
Markac's lawyer, Miroslav Separovic, is a former justice minister who was serving in the government during Operation Storm.
Both in Zagreb and at The Hague, many are debating whether he should resign from the defence team, since a conflict of interest could emerge.
But Separovic has declined to do so, saying it would damage his client.
Gotovina's defence lawyer is a former prosecutor at The Hague, Gregory Kehoe, who switched sides a couple of months ago.
During the status conference, he voiced complaints about the work of the prosecutors' office, saying he had not received pre-trial evidence and that the failure to provide it makes crafting a defence strategy more difficult.
Meanwhile, one of the defendants, Cermak, faced tough questions during the status conference.
The chamber demanded that he clarify his actions after being released provisionally in 2004 along with Markac.
Cermak failed to comply with requirements that he stay out of the public eye.
Photographers from the Croatian weekly Globus caught him at various public events and celebrations that he was barred from attending while under provisional release.
When the pictures were published, the tribunal reacted quickly and decisively.
It suspended the provisional release of both Cermak and Markac, demanding that Croatian authorities transfer them immediately to The Hague.
Since then, the court has ruled that Markac can still enjoy his provisional freedom as he did not break the rules, while Cermak remains at the Scheveningen detention unit.
NATO sends 600 soldiers to Kosovo for rehearsal
Six hundred German soldiers will arrive in Kosovo by the end of this week to take part in a planned rehearsal, KFOR said on Wednesday, stressing that the operation was not in anticipation of a change in the situation on the ground.

A 600-strong German battalion assigned to NATO will deploy to Kosovo by the end of this week to take part in regular operational exercises, KFOR announced on Wednesday (March 14th).
One of the purposes of the rehearsal, scheduled last autumn, is to familiarise NATO troops and Reserves with the environment on the ground.
It is part of a series of operational rehearsals, dubbed Determined Effort 2007, planned for this year.
The first exercises under this programme, again involving German reserve troops, took place in Kosovo from September to December 2006, KFOR explained in a statement.
The announcement came days before UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari is due to submit his proposal for a settlement to the Kosovo status issue to the Security Council, which is then expected to decide on the province's future later this year.
The proposed solution includes granting internationally supervised statehood to Kosovo, which, although technically still part of Serbia, has been a de facto UN protectorate since the end of the 1998-1999 conflict.
The plan also envisions broad rights for the approximately 100,000 Kosovo Serbs living in the province.
Serbia, which insists on retaining some sovereignty over Kosovo, is firmly opposed to the proposed settlement.
Although it does not provide for the outright independence their community has been demanding, the Kosovo Albanian leaders have accepted Ahtisaari's blueprint.
KFOR stressed on Wednesday that the upcoming rehearsal was "not in response to, or in preparation for, any current situation either on-going or expected" on the ground.
Tasked with establishing and maintaining security in Kosovo, NATO peacekeepers entered the province in June 1999.
KFOR currently numbers some 16,500 troops from 36 nations, including 24 NATO member states.
Germany has a 2,700-strong contingent stationed in Kosovo.
During the past eight years, the Alliance has conducted a number of different operational exercises in the province.
"Like those … this rehearsal sends a renewed clear message of NATO's and the international community's strong resolve and commitment to maintaining peace and stability in the overall Balkans region," KFOR said on Wednesday.
"It also demonstrates NATO's ability to reinforce already in-theatre NATO-led forces at very short notice with so-called Reserve Forces."

Nabucco should be a EU priority, Bulgaria says
The EU should give countries participating in the Nabucco gas pipeline financial incentives to speed up the project, Bulgaria said Tuesday.
(BTA, Sega, Standart, Europe.bg, Oil & Gas Eurasia - 01/12/10; Reuters, BTA, Sofia News Agency, Dnevnik.bg, Mediapool, The Banker, Publics.bg, ANSA, Xinhua, Official Website of the Government of Bulgaria - 30/11/10)

Bulgaria urged the EU on Tuesday (November 30th) to allow member states involved in the Nabucco gas pipeline to leave the bank guarantees they will have to provide out of their budget deficits to demonstrate that it truly considers it a key project for the Union.
Sofia has always cited Nabucco as one of its priorities, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov said at the opening of a conference on the energy sector in Southeast Europe.
"But, I have many, many remarks on the speed of work and on its actual, real position as a priority for the EU," he said. "My proposal is that the bank guarantees member states in Nabucco will give to the European Investment Bank, or the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ... be written off the deficits of these countries."
The 8-billion-euro pipeline is a flagship project in the EU's Southern Gas Corridor initiative, and is aimed at reducing the 27-nation bloc's dependence on Russian supplies.
It will run from eastern Turkey to the Baumgarten gas hub in Austria via Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary, bringing natural gas from the Caspian region and the Middle East to Europe.
The six-company Nabucco consortium to develop, construct and operate the Nabucco pipeline includes Austrian oil and gas firm OMV, Bulgaria and Romania's state-run companies, Bulgarian Energy Holding and Transgaz, Hungary's MOL, Turkey's Botas and Germany's RWE.
Each of the six shareholders must provide about 2 billion euros in bank guarantees, Nabucco Managing Director Reinhard Mitschek said.
That, according to Borisov, would immediately push up the budget deficits of the countries that will have to provide state guarantees for Nabucco.
"I will not halt the project, but we all must understand it would lead us to a deficit," the Bulgarian prime minister warned.
Bulgaria has not included the bank guarantees for Nabucco in its 2011 budget, envisioning a deficit of 2.5% of GDP.
Thus, if the EU turns down Sofia's request for giving a fiscal leeway to the member states involved in the project, the Balkan country would see its budget gap overshoot the 3% of GDP limit set for the nations in the bloc.
In a separate move, members of the European Parliament (MEPs) from Borisov's centre-right Citizens for the European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) also stressed Tuesday the need for Nabucco to be made a true EU priority.
"Nabucco must be considered a priority because it is an alternative for the diversification of energy resources in Europe," the GERB MEPs said in a declaration distributed in Brussels.
"It would guarantee significant gas supplies and encourage competition on the European gas market; it would lead to lower gas prices for the EU citizens and eliminate energy deficits in Bulgaria and the EU."
Meanwhile, Bulgarian Energy Minister Traicho Traikov called Tuesday for the development of a common energy plan for Southeast Europe, which "used to be the periphery of an area, but now it is a centre in terms of energy along with the Caspian region".
That, according to the minister implied "huge opportunities".
Also on Tuesday, Traikov and Romanian Economy, Trade and Business Environment Minister Ion Ariton signed a memorandum of understanding to integrate the two countries' energy markets.
The move is expected to help improve the reliability of the two Balkan neighbours' energy systems and economic efficiency in the region, according to the Bulgarian minister.
"There are many areas in which we will derive more benefits if we co-operate," said Traikov.
He also announced an agreement between BEH and Greek company IGI Poseidon on the establishment of a joint company to build the first gas interconnector between the two nations.
The 170km-long pipeline, which will run from Komotini in northern Greece to Stara Zagora in Bulgaria, will have the capacity to transport up to 5 billion cubic metres of gas annually from the Southern Gas Corridor to Bulgaria and other Balkan countries. The 160m-euro project is due to be completed in 2013.
"This was the final step before beginning the construction of this pipeline," Traikov said after the signing ceremony Tuesday.
Schengen hurdles for Romania, Bulgaria
The two countries are being urged to boost judicial reforms and strengthen their borders before they get the OK to join the EU's visa-free zone
By Paul Ciocoiu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest – 01/12/10

European officials are demanding that Romania and Bulgaria prove they have made real progress in reforming their justice systems, under scrutiny from the European Commission (EC) through the Co-operation and Verification Mechanism (MCV), before getting the green light to join the 25-member Schengen zone.
The latest and the clearest warning came from the French President Nicolas Sarkozy.
"I know the Commission is still working with Romania and Bulgaria who are making considerable progress.
Let's wait for this process to end before establishing the accession date," Sarkozy said at a press conference during NATO's November summit in Lisbon.
He said France's position is shared by Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany.
"We are simply saying they will join [Schengen] when the problems are settled," he said.
The French leader also urged the two countries to secure their frontiers before joining the visa-free zone.
"If the two countries become Schengen members, they also become the guardians of Europe's borders … That means their border problems must be solved before their accession.
If this border problem is not settled -- for instance the one concerning the Romanians and the Moldovans -- the issue becomes the problem of all the Schengen member states," Sarkozy said, referring to the citizenship Romania has been granting to Moldovans.
Sarkozy's words echoed in other circles across Europe.
The new Dutch ruling coalition between the liberals and the Christian Democrats also linked Romania and Bulgaria's Schengen accession with progress in the field of justice.
"In the context of Europe, the government will argue for the inclusion of the two-yearly reports on corruption and legal reform in Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen evaluation of these two countries.
If these reports show that they do not meet the strict criteria, the Netherlands will not support the full accession of Romania and Bulgaria to Schengen and abolition of the internal border controls in the EU, and Bulgaria and Romania will not be admitted to Schengen," the coalition agreement reads.
Another warning came from Martin Schultz, leader of the Socialist group in the European Parliament, who said France and Germany might object to the two countries' accession because of issues surrounding migrant Roma, and because of concerns that a flood of workers would emigrate to other parts of the EU in a search for jobs.
"Let's be honest, when there is opposition from two big countries, it is unlikely the accession will be submitted for a vote in 2011," Schultz said, according to Bulgarian public radio.
Faced with a change in tone in Europe, Romanian Justice Minister Catalin Predoiu urged more sustained efforts on the part of Bucharest.
"We believe Romania has to proactively, firmly and persuasively promote its arguments in order to keep the Schengen accession calendar.
The accession crucially depends on convincing the European partners we have the capacity to manage the Schengen procedures without distortions in border controls due to corruption phenomena," he said.
The EC, meanwhile, says Schengen accession is being evaluated according to strictly predefined criteria.
MCV and the accession talks are two parallel processes, Cecilia Malmstrom, European commissioner for Home Affairs, said last week.
Romanian analysts are reading between the lines.
"Bucharest has been very eager lately to get rid of the MCV, but the latest EC report on justice shows there are slim chances of getting to that point since the document was very critical of Romania's performance in the field of justice," Romania Libera justice editor Cristian Ciuperca told SETimes.
"By linking the Schengen accession to the end of the MCV, Sarkozy takes the two countries' objective to the remote future and postpones it for an indefinite period of time.
His statements are even more serious than what his government used to warn us about, that the Schengen accession could be decided only next summer when the next EC report is out."
"Hope" controversy: did Crvenkovski's PR effort go too far?
Questions surround former Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski's use of state funds for a controversial PR strategy.
The public prosecutor is investigating.
By Goran Trajkov for Southeast European Times in Skopje -- 01/12/10

Macedonia's public prosecutor is investigating whether former President Branko Crvenkovski misused public funds when he hired Slovenian experts to help craft a PR strategy dubbed "Hope".
Crvenkovski, who currently heads the opposition SDSM, allegedly spent 340,000 euros worth of taxpayer money on the plan, which provided strategic advice on grooming the then-president's image.
Critics say that he failed to follow the proper legal procedures in hiring the Slovenian experts, and that "Hope" went far beyond normal PR purposes.
The plan is said to have included tactics for attacking the government of Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, with whom Crvenkovski was at frequent odds.
"We took the case because of the specific nature of the act which falls under the purview of organised crime," said Prosecutor's Office Organised Crime Department head Jovan Ilievski. "We haven't discarded the possibility of extending the investigation to members of his [then] cabinet as well."
The investigation is expected to last about a month.
Prosecutors will seek to determine whether Crvenkovski violated Article 353 of the Criminal Code, which requires public bids to procure services, and determine whether to press charges.
If indicted and convicted, Crvenkovski could face up to four years in prison.
The case has taken on a regional dimension, with Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor denying allegations that he played a role.
The president of the SDSM's central committee, Ana Daneva, earlier claimed that Pahor personally suggested the experts to Crvenkovski.
Not so, Pahor fired back.
"We never sent advisers to the former Macedonian President Crvenkovski, and expect an explanation from Macedonian Social Democratic Union," he said.
Crvenkovski immediately issued a public apology, saying he was sorry that the Slovenian prime minister's name had been "mentioned without any basis".
He called the matter a "provoked affair".
The SDSM has denied any wrongdoing on the part of the ex-head of state.
"It is a complete lie that President Branko Crvenkovski spent taxpayers' money for personal and party gain.
The funds were spent on consulting regarding public communications, public opinion research and strategies for promoting Macedonia in the EU and NATO," the party said in a statement.
It also announced it would sue the local network Sitel TV, which broadcast various allegations about Crvenkovski -- including the claim that he had been paying the Slovenian experts since as far back as 1996.
Professor and analyst Dimitar Mircev told SETimes he is worried less about the legal aspects of Hope and more about the kind of advice Crvenkovski received.
"Crvenkovski tried to score points against the current government in a way that is inappropriate and immoral.
It would be enough if the 'Hope' suggestions were used to advance the state and her international prestige, but unfortunately they concerned only his personal image," Mircev said.
Blanka Vlasic: Golden girl from Split lands major award
A champion high jumper from Split has been named athlete of the year.

At a gala ceremony in Monte Carlo late last month, Croatian high jump phenom Blanka Vlasic was named female athlete of the year by the track and field organisation International Association of Athletics Federation.
Kenyan 800m runner David Rudisha was named best male athlete.
Headlines trumpeting "Blanka at the top of the world" splashed across the front pages of Croatian media, praising the talent and accomplishments of the Split-born athlete.
Best in her sport, the only thing eluding her is the world record.
Vlasic, 27, has to jump 210cm to achieve that.
The closest she's come is 208cm, in front of an ecstatic Zagreb crowd in August 2009.
She chose to sidestep the issue almost entirely in Monte Carlo, except to say "The world record for me is like a pair of perfect shoes in the store when you are a little child, and you want them so much."
Her results this year have been stunning, winning 18 out of 20 competitions.
Her home is full of medals, including the silver medal from the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
She breathes the rarified air of Croatia's other superstar female athlete, skier Janica Kostelic, who is now retired from competition.
"We love her; she is such a great girl.
Did you see how she engages the crowd before she jumps with the dancing and cheering?" says Zeljka Matic, a saleswoman also from Split.
And what she says rings true.
The athlete holds nothing back, clearly showing her emotions, both when she wins and loses.
When she is not at the track, she shows a very elegant and fun-loving side, a young woman who enjoys life.
And she has a champion boyfriend, too -- Nikola Karabatic -- one of the best handball players in the world, whose origins are Serbian.
This latest honour means the world to Vasic.
"This is one of my dreams, to be the best athlete of the season, not only in the high jump.
This victory means a lot to me," she wrote on her website.
Vlasic is the eldest child in a sports-oriented family.
Her mother, Venera, was a cross-country athlete, a basketball player and a gymnast, and father Josko was a decathlon athlete.
She was named after the Moroccan city Casablanca, where her father won the gold medal at the 1983 Mediterranean games.
He was the one who recognised her talent and worked with her since she was little.
So it was no surprise that she called him after winning the award.
"My father will be the first to know," Vlasic said.
Business: Jobless rate climbing in Croatia
Croatia's unemployment rate is expected to keep rising this year.
Also in business news: Greece has reduced its deficit and foreign direct investment in Serbia is expected to reach 4 billion euros this year.

The number of registered unemployed in Croatia rose to 319,845 in late December, its highest level since April 2005, according to data the state employment agency HZZ released on Tuesday (January 11th).
Analysts expect the jobless rate to keep rising for the first half of this year.
Greece reduced its budget deficit by 36.5% in 2010 due to cost-cutting measures, according to preliminary data published by the finance ministry Tuesday (January 11th).
The drop is higher than the government-set target of 33.2%.
The deficit also dropped -- to 19.6 billion euros from 30.8 billion euros in 2009, the ministry said.
Serbia's Investment and Export Promotion Agency (SIEPA) Director Bozidar Laganin said on January 9th that foreign direct investment (FDI) in Serbia is expected to reach 4 billion euros this year.
Most of the foreign capital will come from Italy and Germany, while South Korea has emerged as the third most important foreign investor.
Apart from investment in the automotive industry, significant inflows are also expected in the textile industry and tourism.
Croatian oil and gas company INA announced that it has discovered a satellite oil field near its Zutica oil field.
Initial studies showed a daily flow of 30 cubic metres of oil and more than 30,000 cubic metres of natural gas.
A more precise estimate of the commercial reserve base, however, will require further analysis.
The Zutica field is about 40km south of Zagreb and has been in operation since 1966.
Macedonia will receive 50m euros from the World Bank this year, Finance Minister Zoran Stavrevski said on Wednesday (January 12th) after meeting with Bank Managing Director Ngozi Ikonjo-Iweala in Skopje.
Stavrevski said the funds will be used for budgetary support, regional projects for insurance against natural disasters, support for implementation of an energy project, continuation of a cadastre project and other investments.
World Bank Managing Director Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala advised Albania to be cautious in its fiscal policies.
The country's public debt currently amounts to 60% of its GDP, and need to be reduced, Okonjo-Iweala said during a visit to Tirana last week.
Romania's Regional Development Ministry has announced auctions worth 3.3 billion euros for infrastructure projects, according to an official advertisement on January 9th.
The projects include constructing 10,000km of roads, modernising rural areas and building water sewage and water supply networks.
Bulgaria will seek compensation from the European Commission (EC) for losses suffered by local meat and dairy producers after a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in the southeast part of the country, Agriculture Minister Miroslav Naydenov said on Tuesday (January 11th).
All cattle in the village of Kosti where the outbreak was discovered have been slaughtered.
Under EC rules, in case of foot-and-mouth disease the EU provides 60% of the total compensation due to farmers.

PASOK win has regional implications
Greece's prime minister-elect has a global outlook and will likely seek to enhance his country's role in Southeast Europe and the EU, analysts say.
Analysis by Harry Tzanis for Southeast European Times in Athens – 06/10/09

PASOK pummeled the ruling centre-right New Democracy (ND) party led by Costas Karamanlis in Sunday's (October 4th) snap election.
Now PASOK, led by George Papandreou, must turn its attention to relations with two of its neighbours -- Turkey and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as Greece calls it.
"Papandreou has a much more global outlook and wants a bigger role [for Greece] in the EU," political analyst Giorgos Kyrtsos said on Monday.
PASOK will most likely stay the course with the former government's agenda regarding the name dispute with Macedonia, according to Kyrtsos.
Athens has been pressing for its neighbour to add a geographical qualifier, such as "north", to its name in all international relations.
According to Kathimerini columnist Paschos Mandravelis, however, the Macedonian government is unlikely to accept this demand.
Some experts believe the thorny and often esoteric name issue could become the fly in the ointment as far as the region's European integration is concerned.
Kyrtsos also said that there will be no major shift in the country's policy towards another EU hopeful, Turkey.
The emphasis will remain on making sure Ankara meets its accession requirements.
Papandreou has sharply criticised Greece's former government, pointing a finger at former Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis for "relinquishing" Greece's veto power to halt Turkey's EU bid after the country refused to meet certain criteria.
However, Kyrtsos believes that Papandreou's government will continue to say "yes" to Turkey's EU journey, knowing that others in the European community are saying "no".
In reality, accession for Turkey is not expected anytime soon, and Greece has little to lose by taking a conciliatory stance.
Asked about PASOK's landslide victory, Kyrtsos said he and other analysts were surprised the party won by such a large margin.
"Greek voters sent a message that they want a fast-paced and effective government," he said.
In terms of other parties, the biggest winner was the right-of-centre Popular Orthodox Rally (LAOS) party (5.63% and 15 MPs), which is known for taking tough stances on national issues.
Kyrtsos noted that whereas the party and its founder, former ND deputy and one-time MEP Giorgos Karatzaferis, include certain "ultra-conservative" elements, it is a mostly populist, flexible and opportunistic political vehicle.
Former Kosovo Liberation Army trio sentenced for war crimes
"A wrong was done today within the justice system.
It is an external intervention, one we did not expect," said defendant Rrustem Mustafa-Remi.

The EULEX Court on Friday (October 2nd) sentenced three members of the so-called Llapi Group -- Latif Gashi, Nazif Mehmeti and Rrustem Mustafa-Remi -- to prison terms ranging from three to six years for war crimes committed in the 1998-1999 conflict in Kosovo.
The three were found guilty of inhumane treatment of civilian detainees, beating and torture, said EULEX.
This latest trial against the three opened on July 7th in Pristina District Court, with a EULEX prosecutor.
This was only the latest chapter, however.
The original investigation into the case lasted from 2001 to 2002.
It first went to trial in 2003 and all three were convicted and sentenced.
But in 2005, the Supreme Court of Kosovo ordered a new trial.
Now that it too has ended with convictions, the government is angry.
"The war of the Kosovo Liberation Army was a liberation war, just and supported by all Kosovo citizens," the administration said in a press release after Friday's verdict.
On Saturday, EULEX responded.
"EULEX would like to underline that the verdict issued yesterday in the District Court of Pristina, by a mixed panel -- a Kosovo judge and two EULEX judges -- is based on an independent judiciary and each individual's equal treatment before the law.
EULEX supports and shares the Kosovo government's engagement and dedication to the rule of law and unbiased justice.
This commitment is crucial in ensuring that Kosovo's judiciary meets the European standards."
Mustafa-Remi, a lawmaker from the Democratic Party of Kosovo and chairman of parliament's Commission on Security and Internal Affairs, held a press conference immediately after the sentencing, declaring his innocence.
"A wrong was done today within the justice system.
It is an external intervention, one we did not expect.
We do not feel guilty, not I, not Latif Gashi, who is on his way to serve his sentence today, not Nazif Mehmeti," Mustafa-Remi told local media.
He said he trusts that the Supreme Court will overturn the decision.
The Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) also condemned the verdict, describing it as another stain on the handicapped and disfunctional Kosovo justice system.
"AAK is engaged in establishing a real justice system in the Republic of Kosovo and, at the same time, remains firm in the overall protection of our joint values, and the protection of the values of Kosovo Liberation Army," said Ramush Haradinaj of the AAK.
Croatian government severely tightens budget belt
Sharp budget cuts, salary reductions and mass layoffs demonstrate tough times for Croatians.
By Drazen Remikovic for Southeast European Times in Zagreb -- 06/03/12
Croatians face tough times ahead as food cost and VAT rate reach all-time highs. [Reuters]
The first effects of austerity measures in Croatia hit on March 1st when the government applied the higher VAT rate of 25%, an increase of 2%.
Only Hungary and Iceland have a higher VAT in Europe.
Food prices also increased, and the price of oil and gas is going up 3% on Tuesday (March 6th), reaching record highs.
Minister of Finance Slavko Linic said the VAT increase may be painful, but necessary.
"It is important that citizens understand that the VAT increase will not be wasted on government and its administration, but to create jobs," Linic told reporters in Zagreb earlier this month.
A higher VAT rate is just one of the government-proposed saving measures for the 2012 state budget, adopted in February as "rational and realistic", but it caused countrywide discontent.
The Croatian state budget for 2012 is 14.6 billion euros, while the expenditures will amount to 15.5 billion euros, even with public sector wage cuts and layoffs.
Fitch Ratings this week affirmed Croatia's credit rating at BBB-, the lowest investment grade, and gave it a negative outlook because of its budget deficit.
Darko Solic, 28, from Zagreb, said that the government's decision to save on wages and workers was expected.
"People certainly can't expect that politicians will cut their own salaries.
We just need to accept that every saving measure will be directed against the citizens and the workers," Solic told SETimes.
Although the government announced savings of more than 660m euros, the amount was reduced to 440m euros.
Economic analysts are not happy with the decision, saying that the government should commit to the savings all the way.
Sandra Svaljek, the director of the Zagreb Institute of Economics, said that the government's announcement of major investment in public enterprises is unrealistic.
"You cannot save from something that you do not have.
The government also predicted a GDP growth rate to 0.8% for this year, but our analyses show that Croatia will have a negative GDP growth between 0.5 and 1.5%.
Even when the savings are implemented, Croatia will continue with a high budget deficit," Svaljek told SETimes.
Many ministries received less money than last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture received nearly 60m euros less, and the same amount is cut off from the state railways company budget.
The government announced layoffs from the railway company, and 180 workers received dismissals at the daily state-funded newspaper Vjesnik as the government decided to halt funding.
At the Social Council meeting in late February, Mladen Novosel, the president of the Croatian Workers Union, challenged the government representatives who announced savings of around 260m euros with public sector cuts, by reducing employee benefits, and layoffs of about 5,000 freelance workers.
"I asked the government representatives at the meeting if the 5,000 people in the public sector are a surplus, why were these people hired to work.
I did not get a direct answer.
In the last few years in Croatia, more than 100,000 lost their jobs in the industry," Novosel told SETimes.
The Croatian Employers' Association said the reduction in government state spending by 440m euros is surprising, and recalls the original plan of more than 700m euros in savings.
"We are definitely dissatisfied with the deadline for harmonisation of the new VAT rate.
The period in which the government announced the raise in GDP till March 1st, the date when it's put to effect, is simply too short, and sends a negative message to potential investors in Croatia," the Association's spokesperson Ljiljana Hecimovic told SETimes.
Zlatko Tusak, Labour Party MP, said that the reactions to the new budget cuts are justified.
"The proposed budget caused many negative reactions, but if the savings are done in the right places, improvements will be visible in a few months.
The rights of workers in Croatia, however, are right now far from the European average," Tusak told SETimes.
UNMIK Chief Welcomes Kosovo Government Coalition Deal
Kosovo's next government will be dominated by the Democratic League of Kosovo and the Alliance for the Future in Kosovo.
Under the deal, several other small parties will also join the coalition.

UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen has welcomed an agreement between the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) and the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) on forming a coalition government.
"Immediately after the elections, I urged the political parties to act on the voices of the voters by moving quickly, and they have done so, without international involvement," Jessen-Petersen said Wednesday (17 November) after LDK spokesman Lulzim Zeneli announced the deal.
The UNMIK chief voiced confidence "that the new custodians of the provisional institutions will honour their commitment to work closely with the representatives of minority communities, and towards our common goal of building a stable multiethnic society".
The agreement was reached more than three weeks after Kosovo held the second parliamentary elections since it came under UN administration in 1999.
According to Zeneli, several other smaller parties would join the coalition.
Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova's LDK won the 23 October poll with 45 per cent of the vote, but failed to muster an outright majority.
The AAK finished third with 8 per cent of the vote.
According to the AP, some international officials had suggested they would prefer a broader coalition, including the second-largest Kosovo Albanian party -- Hashim Thaci's Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK), which won 29 per cent of the vote.
Instead, it will join the opposition parties. "
The PDK has proposed its leader Hashim Thaci for the post of prime minister, and in case this offer isn't accepted, we will go in the opposition," Xhavit Haliti, a member of the PDK chairmanship told a Kosovo daily earlier this month.
The AAK delivered a similar message, insisting it would not enter a government coalition unless it was given the prime minister post.
Although Wednesday's announcement did not confirm this, Haradinaj is widely expected to head the cabinet, while Rugova is likely to continue as president.
The new coalition government is expected to be in office during talks on Kosovo's final status, which could begin in mid-2005 if the province achieves substantial progress in meeting UN-set benchmarks in areas such as the rule of law, minority rights and dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade.
As prime minister, Haradinaj -- a former KLA commander -- would represent the province in status negotiations.
Last week, however, he was interviewed by investigators with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague about his role in the 1998-1999 conflict in the province.
Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte has said she will issue new indictments against members of the now-disbanded KLA by the end of the year.
An indictment against Haradinaj could lead to a government crisis, analysts say.
Albania exploring use of renewable energy sources
As temperatures plummet, Albanians can expect energy restrictions and blackouts.
In an effort to alleviate the country's chronic energy crises, the government is looking into new options

Albania receives 95% of its electricity from hydroelectric power plants (HPP), but a drought this year affected reservoirs levels and the plants cannot meet continually rising energy demands.
As in previous winters, restrictions, blackouts and various stopgap measures are expected.
The country once produced enough energy not only to meet its needs but to export to neighbouring countries.
Since the early 1990s, however, demand has risen fourfold, reaching 6,800 GWh. At the same time, electricity output has shrunk by half, to around 4,000 GWh. Scant rainfall and the antiquated state of the HPPs are to blame.
The power supply in Tirana and other cities has been interrupted up to eight hours a day, while some rural areas are cut off for as long as 15 hours a day.
Each winter, the situation deteriorates further.
Prompted by the crisis, renewable energy resource projects have become a priority.
Prime Minister Sali Berisha said on November 7th that the government will support any project that contributes to the diversification of energy resources.
Representatives from Camozzi Holding SpA and Westinghouse met with Berisha in late October to discuss possible investments in nuclear energy production.
The companies have expressed interest in building a nuclear spare parts plant in Durres.
"We aim to turn Albania into a production and exporting centre for energy in the region," Berisha said.
Opposition politicians, however, were less enthusiastic.
The vice chairman of the Socialist parliamentary group, Erion Brace, said the disadvantages must be taken into consideration.
"The operation of a nuclear power plant requires our country to transport and store nuclear material.
Nuclear operations result in harmful radioactive wastes that threaten the health of the public," he said, calling for the idea to be put before the general public.
The Berisha administration has said it may call a referendum on nuclear energy in the future.
At the same time, it is exploring other, less controversial, renewable energy sources.
In late October, two major European companies proposed large projects to the government.
One firm, Italgest, proposed building a large wind power plant near Kryevidhi -- 50km from Tirana. The facility would have a capacity of 150mw and the company's investment would be 200m euros.
The second company, Naanovo, proposed a solar energy project that would include building a solar plant near Durres, 40km from Tirana.
During the next few months, administration officials will review the various proposals and move forward on the projects they think are most likely to end the energy crisis.
Greece Focuses on Revamping Education
Authorities in Greece are looking for ways to modernise the country's education system, which currently is last among education indices in the EU.
By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens – 18/11/04

The Greek government is calling for dialogue on ways to improve the educational system, which currently holds last place among education indices in the eurozone.
This year's EU report indicated Greece, in comparison to the rest of the countries in the Union, has been left behind in realising the goals of the Lisbon Strategy -- a programme to transform Europe into a knowledge economy by 2010.
Greece has yet to establish a system for equipping young people to respond to the challenges and needs of the globalisation era, officials say.
Nor does the existing system provide a solid general education.
To address these problems, the education ministry is studying educational systems and reforms in other countries, and has chosen the Finnish system -- which has enjoyed great success in implementation -- as a working model.
According to officials, the Finnish system provides both a general foundation of knowledge and the specific professional skills needed to compete in the marketplace.
Overhauling Greek education will require a number of interventions, experts say.
Curricula must be modernised, with new textbooks and concepts.
The latest technology must be introduced.
Foreign language education should be introduced.
Finally, the education system needs a reliable method for testing results and getting feedback.
Every stage -- be it a nursery, primary or secondary school -- should be continuously evaluated.
One of the thorniest issues is mandatory education, which must be expanded from 9 to 12 years to meet international criteria.
This is not a problem for urban areas.
In rural parts of Greece, however, many children do not stay in school for more than six years, in order to help their families.
Greece needs to adopt an effective system of educational administration and control, the ministry says.
At the same time, the government plans to introduce changes gradually, to make the transition process less disruptive.
US Business Delegation Visits Belgrade for Investment Talks
A delegation of US company representatives recently visited Belgrade to discuss investment deals.
US companies have become the leading foreign investors in Serbia, and the trend is likely to continue.

Ten US companies have shown interest in investing in Serbia and participating in the privatisation of Serbian companies.
Representatives of the firms -- all based in Illinois -- visited Belgrade in late October and early November, holding talks with Serbian President Boris Tadic, government representatives, the mayor of Belgrade, and numerous members of the business community.
Vladimir Petrovic, deputy director of the Illinois trade mission, said the Americans were very satisfied with the visit, and that several joint investment ventures would soon be realised.
The largest company in the delegation was the air traffic firm AAR, which is discussing joint investment deals with JAT Airways.
The group met representatives of JAT, Belgrade Rail, Belgrade Airport and other Serbian enterprises.
Agreement was reached on opening a Serbian Chamber of Commerce office in Illinois.
The US state will reciprocate by opening a trade mission in Belgrade, which would become a centre for business deals in Southeast Europe.
US companies have been the leading foreign investors in Serbia since the beginning of mass privatisation in 2001.
Philip Morris alone has invested 518m euros in the Serbian tobacco industry.
More recently, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica has sought to encourage investment in Serbia by guaranteeing the security of invested funds.
Addressing the American Chamber of Commerce in Belgrade earlier this year, Kostunica said Serbia was rapidly working on reforming its legislation to ensure that foreigners feel confident about investing in the republic.
The outlook for Serbia has also been boosted by the credit rating agency Standard and Poor's decision to give a B+ rating to long-term Serbian state bonds and a B rating for short-term credits.
This is the first time in years that Serbia has received an international credit rating.
Business representatives have cautioned, however, that the risk of investing in Serbia remains high due to political instability and a large foreign debt, totaling about $9 billion.
Earlier this month, representatives from Bechtel visited Belgrade for talks with Serbian Minister for Foreign Economic Relations Milan Parivodic on a project to construct a highway from Serbia to Bulgaria.
One of the world's major construction companies, Bechtel is building road networks in Croatia and Romania.
Serbia-Montenegro to Step up Fight Against Human Trafficking
OSCE-sponsored research has found there are more than 1,134 human trafficking victims in Serbia-Montenegro, and the country is increasingly becoming not only a transit point but also a destination for trafficked persons.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 19/07/04
According to OSCE representative Hannelore Valier, Serbia-Montenegro's first priority in combating trafficking should be the adoption of a national strategy. [OSCE]
This year's report by the US State Department on global human trafficking placed Serbia-Montenegro on the "Tier 2 watch list".
The watch list -- a new addition to the four-year-old survey -- contains countries that are not yet in compliance with US legal standards and may be downgraded, but have promised to make or are in the process of making significant efforts to meet the requirements.
Research by the Victims' Association of Serbia for the OSCE Mission in Belgrade found there are more than 1,134 human trafficking victims in Serbia-Montenegro, including 940 women, 94 children and 100 men.
The actual number is certainly larger, since the study was conducted within a limited time frame -- between 1 May and 30 August 2003.
Serbia-Montenegro, the study found, is not only a country used for transit and temporary settlement of trafficked people, but is also increasingly becoming a country that recruits human trafficking victims.
Female victims are typically between 18 and 30 years of age.
The majority of foreign victims come to Serbia-Montenegro from Moldova, Ukraine and Romania, although a significant number originate from Serbia-Montenegro.
The women are mostly sold for the purpose of sexual exploitation.
When it comes to child trafficking, Serbia-Montenegro most frequently appears as a country of origin.
The children at highest risk of being trafficking are Roma children, children without parents, children with special needs, and those from poor or broken families.
Male human trafficking victims come mainly from China, Afghanistan, Romania, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Serbia-Montenegro.
They too respond to promises of jobs in the EU, only to be forced into slavery.
According to OSCE representative Hannelore Valier, Serbia-Montenegro's first priority in combating trafficking should be the adoption of a national strategy.
Penalties so far have been inadequate, she says.
Only last year was trafficking defined for the first time as a separate criminal act under Serbian law; since then, police have achieved significant results.
But official say there is much more Serbia-Montenegro must do to put an end to this type of crime.

Turkey also plans to open trade centres in Beijing, Riyadh, Jeddah, Moscow and Bucharest, according to Tuzmen.
The Albanian parliament decided on Tuesday (April 21st) to grant a fourth mobile operator licence to a consortium of local companies and Kosovo Post and Telecom.
The winning consortium offered a 7.2m-euro bid for the licence.
The deal is viewed as a strategic investment that will benefit both Albania and Kosovo's telecommunication markets.
The IMF will assist Albania with soft loans and has invited the government to send a request for a deal, IMF representative in Albania Ann Margaret Westin said on Wednesday (April 22nd).
Earlier, the IMF asked the government in Albania to reduce its expenditures in order to avoid exposing the country's financial stability to risk.
The IMF expects Bulgaria's economy to contract 3.5% in 2009, Bas Bakker, the IMF mission chief, said on Wednesday (April 22nd).
He underlined that the economy would recover slightly, predicting a contraction of 1% in 2010.
Bakker recommended additional budget cuts by Sofia.

Greece Welcomes Euro 2004 Champions, Looks Ahead to Olympics
Greeks took to the streets Monday to celebrate the national football team's triumph at the Euro 2004 championship in Portugal.
The victory is being hailed as the best possible advertisement for next month's Olympics.

Hundreds of thousands of Greeks lined streets in Athens on Monday (5 July), welcoming home the national football team after its triumph at the Euro 2004 championship in Portugal.
Initially viewed as an outsider, the Greek squad marched steadily to Sunday's final and to a 1-0 victory over host Portugal, resulting in its first ever European title.
More than 35,000 fans gathered at the Panathinaikon Stadium in central Athens -- the site of the first modern Olympics in 1896 -- to see the 23 players and their German coach Otto Rehhagel lift the cup and sing the national anthem.
Thousands of others joined the party outside the stadium.
The team's stunning success prompted celebrations elsewhere in Greece, as well as in other countries with sizeable Greek communities.
With just weeks before the Summer Olympics open in Athens on 13 August, officials and ordinary citizens hailed the soccer win as the best possible advertisement for the Games.
Organisers hope it would boost sluggish ticket sales.
Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis, who attended the final in Lisbon, said Greece was now on everyone's lips.
"These boys taught us a lesson as to what Greeks can do when we really believe in something, when we are united and have self-confidence, dynamism and method in achieving it," Karamanlis said Monday, addressing the packed stadium.
Athens Mayor Dora Bakoyianni also joined the celebrations.
"This is the biggest and best message for the Olympic Games: that Athens is here, everything is wonderful, we filled this stadium, and another 100,000 are outside," Bakoyianni said.
"We showed that Greece has changed," the AFP quoted opposition leader and former Foreign Minister George Papandreou as saying Monday.
He described the victory as a "good response to all the press articles in recent months about Greece not being able to stage the Olympics".
Athens 2004 Organising Committee Chief Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki conveyed similar sentiments, saying the triumph "smashed the views of those who said we can't make it".
With the ongoing preparations causing traffic snarls and other problems, Athenians are said to have grown less enthusiastic about the Games during recent months.
Many Greeks are also uneasy about the spiraling budget:the cost of security measures alone has already reached about 1 billion euros.
Sunday's win, however, has rekindled national pride, and many say it will rejuvenate attitudes towards the Games as well.
Meanwhile, the Olympic torch, which began a 36-day global journey on 2 June, was due to arrive in Turkey on Tuesday and then proceed to Bulgaria and Cyprus, before it returns to Greece on Friday.

Bosnian Serb Authorities Ask the Public to Help Capture War Crimes Fugitives
As NATO and the EU prepare for key decisions that will determine BiH's prospects for Euro-Atlantic integration, the government of the country's Serb-run entity is asking the public to help track down suspects wanted by the UN war crimes tribunal.

The government of Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) Serb-run entity launched a campaign Tuesday (22 March), urging members of the public to help track down suspects sought by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). It is the first time since the end of the 1992-1995 BiH conflict that Republika Srpska (RS) authorities have turned to Bosnian Serbs with such an appeal.
The "Us or Them" campaign features a video spot showing the images of indictees who remain at large.
It starts with former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander, Ratko Mladic, both indicted by the ICTY back in 1995. It then shows seven other indictees.
"Either they go to The Hague or we go to hell," the voice-over says, reminding citizens that BiH's progress towards EU and NATO membership will remain blocked for as long as the suspects are at large.
The spot will be run on the three most popular TV stations in RS.
A list of ICTY fugitives will also be displayed on billboards across the entity, along with a telephone number to call with information.
The failure of the RS authorities to arrest and hand over indictees to The Hague tribunal has twice cost the country an invitation to join NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme, a first step towards eventual Alliance membership.
BiH's application for admission into the PfP will likely be discussed during a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Vilnius, Lithuania, on 20 April.
According to an AP report, a third rejection could spell the end for BiH's chances of joining the programme.
While voicing his country's support for BiH's NATO bid, German Defence Minister Peter Struck reminded officials in Sarajevo on Monday that full co-operation with the ICTY remains a critical condition.
Following talks with BiH Defence Minister Nikola Radovanovic, Struck stressed that the surrender of some of the tribunal's top indictees, notably Mladic, would "advance to a great extent" the country's chances for PfP membership.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, meanwhile, told BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic on Monday that Brussels could issue a positive assessment of his country's preparedness for accession by the end of May, setting the stage for the opening of talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement later in the year.
For that to happen, however, BiH must show substantial progress by that time towards meeting the Union's conditions, Rehn said.
Belgrade Pledges More Surrenders, Progress in ICTY Co-operation
In an all-out effort to win a positive assessment of Serbia-Montenegro's readiness to begin the EU accession process, top Serbian and state-level leaders are vowing significant progress in co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.

Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said Tuesday (22 March) that he expects more war crimes suspects to surrender to the UN tribunal.
Speaking to Olli Rehn, the EU commissioner for enlargement, Kostunica pledged that significant progress would be made in the next week towards achieving full co-operation with the UN court.
He also signaled that his government is working to persuade two top suspects, retired generals Nebojsa Pavkovic and Sreten Lukic, to surrender.
"I am quite optimistic that in the days to come … we will have significant progress that will lead us to full co-operation with the ICTY," Reuters quoted the prime minister as saying after his talks with Rehn.
Kostunica's visit is being seen as part of an all-out diplomatic effort by Belgrade to secure a positive feasibility study on Serbia-Montenegro's readiness to move ahead with the EU accession process.
The study is due to be published on 12 April.
A positive assessment would pave the way for the signing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between Serbia-Montenegro and the Union -- considered a major step along the road to membership in the Union.
Most analysts agree that the surrenders of Pavkovic and Lukic are crucial for Belgrade's chances.
"We are aware of the fact that these cases are something that leads us to full co-operation with the ICTY, and we are treating these cases more than seriously," Kostunica said in response to a question about the two men.
Federal President Svetozar Marovic has said he believes that by 31 March, Serbia will fulfil all obligations necessary for a positive feasibility study.
"There is no question that co-operation or lack of co-operation on our part with the court in The Hague is the greatest obstacle facing us," Marovic told the daily Haaretz during a visit to Israel last week.
"I would like to remind you that two former presidents of Serbia are now facing the court in The Hague, one of them the former president of Yugoslavia (Slobodan Milosevic), two Yugoslav chiefs of staff and several ministers and deputy prime ministers," the president said. "In the past two months, eight people have turned themselves in of their own free will, including six generals.
It is now clear that there is a positive trend in co-operation between Serbia and Montenegro and the court in The Hague, and we will continue with that until we complete everything that can be done."
He reiterated the government's stance on Ratko Mladic, denying that the government has any knowledge about where the fugitive -- one of the UN tribunal's three most-wanted indictees -- is hiding.
Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte has charged that Mladic is not only hiding in Serbia, but receiving protection from a network of supporters within the Serbian military."If the Serbian government were to decide that it really wants to arrest Mladic, it could do so within hours," del Ponte has said.
In a separate development, Deputy Defence Minister Pavle Jankovic said Wednesday that co-operation with The Hague is the only obstacle standing in the way of Serbia-Montenegro entering NATO's Partnership for Peace programme.
Serbia-Montenegro could join in as little as a month's time if the conditions were met, he said during a visit to Washington.
A new era for Romania's Roma
According to official estimates, Roma account for some 2.5% of the country's population, and the actual number could be much higher.
They also are one of the most disadvantaged groups in Romania, with 74% in poverty.
As the country prepares to join the EU, efforts are under way to better the quality of their lives.

Europe is home to at least eight million Roma, of whom six million live in Central and Eastern Europe.
The last census, in 2002, revealed that Romania had a stable Roma population of 535,140 -- amounting to 2.5% of the country's population -- but unofficial estimates run as high as 2.5 million.
Experts in Roma history agree that the population hails from India and probably left there no later than the 10th century.
However, it remains very difficult to establish precisely when they settled down on Romanian territory.
The first documented evidence of Roma in Romania dates back to 1374, when Dan the 1st offered the Vodita monastery 40 Roma as slaves.
That was a status they had for centuries. In 1424, Transylvania's Roma were led by a voivode (ruler) as the Constitution stipulated, but that provision was scrapped in 1588 by the provincial assembly.
In 1785, Austrian Emperor Joseph II abolished slavery in Transylvania.
Four years later, the first Roma were accepted in the province's schools and churches.
Things were different in the other two Romanian provinces, Moldova and Walachia, which were still under Ottoman sovereignty and opposed to the modern ideas of the West.
It was only in 1855 and 1856, respectively, that the two abolished slavery entirely, under pressure from writers and intellectuals.
Centuries of slavery were followed by persecutions and deportations during the pro-Nazi regime of Ion Antonescu in the Second World War.
Nearly 38,000 Romanian Roma died in the Holocaust, according to figures advanced by the Romanian War Crimes Committee.
The subsequent communist dictatorship then forcibly displaced whole Roma communities and confiscated their assets in pursuing its objective of creating a homogenous Romanian society.
For half a century, communism had tried to conceal these problems while fostering the illusion of utopia.
With the fall of communism and the beginning of the transition period, however, social tensions erupted, and the fires were fanned by the burgeoning Romanian media.
In 1991, a Roma villager in Bolintin Deal, a settlement near Bucharest, killed a Romanian.
The murder aroused the Romanian community in the village, who responded by setting fire to Roma houses.
Two years later, on September 23rd 1993, three Roma people were killed in Hadareni, Mures County, by angry villagers.
One of the persons killed had earlier stabbed a Romanian.
His crime brought a collective punishment -- 14 houses of the Roma community were burned down and 175 Roma that had lived in Hadareni for nearly 70 years were ousted from the village.

Between 1990 and 1993, at least eight Roma were killed and many others seriously wounded during outburst of collective violence, according to a report released by the European Center for Roma Rights.
There have also been frequent instances of abuse of Roma at the hands of police.
As with crimes of private violence, such occurrences frequently go unpunished and sometimes are not even properly investigated.
Racist statements have been made by the leader of an extremist opposition party, Corneliu Vadim Tudor.
According to an OSCE report, he reportedly announced in August 1998 a ten-point programme which included "isolating the Roma criminals in special colonies" in order to "stop the transformation of Romania into a Gypsy camp".
The government, meanwhile, has become increasingly aware of the need to promote and apply a strategy for the Roma minority.
In February 1997, the government founded the National Roma Office as part of the National Minorities Department.
In October 2004, the office was transformed into the National Roma Agency, led by a president with the rank of state secretary.
In 2001, the government adopted a national strategy for bettering the quality of life for the Roma.
It defines priorities across ten major fields of activity, including social security, health, justice, education, communication and civic involvement.
A 7.6m-euro PHARE project meant to support this strategy was finalised in April 2006.
Meanwhile, the Romanian General Inspectorate of Police has launched a programme aimed at improving relations between the police and the Roma community, and to enhance the police's capacity to respond effectively in situations of tension between Roma and non-Roma communities.
The programme was developed with the help of the Project on Ethnic Relations and the Department of Justice Administration at the University of Louisville.
In July 2003, in Budapest, the leaders of eight Central and Eastern European states agreed to launch the "Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005-2015", a project initiated by the World Bank and the Open Society Institute.
Its primary objectives are the elimination of discrimination and poverty among this community.
Romania held the presidency of the programme for a year, between July 2005 and July 2006.
In July 2006, the World Bank agreed to loan Romania 58.5m for a social inclusion project.
Its beneficiaries include some of the most disadvantaged groups in the country -- the Roma minority, children at high risk and/or coming out of child care institutions, persons with disabilities, and victims of domestic violence.
The project was developed under the new Country Partnership Strategy principles, intended to help Romania meet its commitments in the Joint Inclusion Memorandum signed with the European Commission.
In less than three months, Romania will join the EU.
The time is ripe for addressing social sector issues, in order that the benefits of reform and EU accession can be brought to society's most vulnerable segments.
With 74% living in poverty, an infant mortality rate four times higher than the country's average and a formal employment rate of 13%, the Roma are particularly at risk. The last census, conducted in 2002, revealed that a quarter of Roma are illiterate.
Unwilling to renounce their traditions they've observed for hundreds years, including the custom of marrying children at an early age, the Roma are often at odds with the authorities and the law.
Minority Watch, based in London, suggests Romania and Bulgaria should use part of their regional development funds to improve life for the Roma.
Unless a sustained effort is made, improvements will only be short-term.
And that is something neither country can afford.
Giannis Valinakis: Balkans Must Work Together for Change
Greek Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Giannis Valinakis discusses Kosovo, the Cyprus issue and the way ahead for the Balkans in this exclusive interview with Southeast European Times correspondent Dimitris Agrafiotis.
By Dimitris Agrafiotis for Southeast European Times in Athens – 16/08/04
Greece is committed to helping build a foundation for Southeast European countries to join the EU. [EU]
Greek Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Giannis Valinakis says even thought the accession road is long for Southeast European countries to join the EU, Greece will stand by the states and foster the necessary reforms. Co-operation of states and peaceful resolution of differences play a huge role, he says.
Southeast European Times: How far are the Southeast European states from joining the EU?
Giannis Valinakis: I would say that they are closer to the EU than ever in the past.
The road undoubtedly has opened.
Everyone is convinced that the European way constitutes a one-way road.
The question is not anymore "if" but "when".
Many things have happened that justify such optimism.
First of all, the EU has already included a Southeast European state -- Slovenia -- in its recent enlargement.
Furthermore, the integration of Bulgaria and Romania in the next phase of enlargement, with a visible objective in 2007, is considered a given.
Croatia has recently received a positive opinion on the initiation of negotiations, while Macedonia recently forwarded an application of accession, even if it is institutionally premature.
SE Times: Are the governments of the Southeast European states ready to advance in the structural changes essential for meeting the EU criteria?
Greek Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs Giannis Valinakis says Greek-Turkish relations are at a “good level”. [File]
Valinakis: No one today can overlook the fact that important steps have been achieved both in the reinforcement of institutions and the economy.
These steps are larger in some fields and smaller in others.
Our wish is that these steps will intensify, since the distance that still separates the Southeast European countries from the [EU] criteria is long.
The required changes have to be made, and the governments of these countries have the leading role.
SE Times: How has Greece contributed to the accession prospects of the other Southeast European states?
Valinakis: We have stood by the Southeast European countries and we continue to do so.
Our motive is simple: when your neighbour behaves in a European manner, then everyone wins.
No one lives alone.
Therefore the Balkan states should shake off the past of distrust and conflict.
We can see this happening. The declaration of Thessaloniki on 21 June 2003 was an important moment, especially for the countries of the Western Balkans.
For the first time, it was clear that their future is in the EU.
Working together, we can transform Southeast Europe into a region of co-operation, progress and prosperity for all, with faith in the principles and the values of good neighbourliness, the peaceful resolution of differences, respect for human rights, democratic ideals and the rule of law.
SE Times: Do you think the situation in Kosovo is stable at this point?
What about the security in the Western Balkans?
Valinakis: As the recent violent events in Kosovo have shown us, the past has a way of returning.
Disproportions exist throughout the region, and memories are still fresh.
We are looking ahead to the new Balkans, however, as a place whose citizens can move without problems and fear, live without biases, and be free of the residues of the past.
The will exists.
However, much has to be done in order for change to take root.
The basic component must be the development of co-operation among the states and the resolution of existing problems.
We all can work towards that direction.
The objective to enter the EU should be a common driving force for all these countries.
SE Times: Could NATO accession help spur the EU integration of Southeast European countries?
Valinakis: The accession of the Southeast European countries to NATO is a strategic goal because they see it as one more stabilising factor.
The recent NATO summit in Istanbul certainly brought these countries further along the road to joining both the Alliance and European institutions.
SE Times: Greece has taken a clear position in favour of Turkey's EU integration.
Other European countries, however, have reacted differently.
How do you assess Turkey's EU prospects?
Valinakis: Our country supports Turkey's efforts to meet the EU requirements.
Positive steps have taken place in Turkey concerning the internal reforms, and for the first time there the will to achieve the essential steps is evident.
Of course, willpower is not enough; continuity is also necessary.
I believe that the reactions of certain European countries underline the point that there is still a lot to be done.
The Copenhagen criteria are known to all.
Our country wants to see this road completed.
As for the timetable, December is not a date that will judge everything. It is the first appointment in a new relationship.
SE Times: There is a general perception that Greek-Turkish relations have improved.
Are the two countries near the resolution of their bilateral problems?
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan (centre) leaves the monument of the unknown soldier in Athens. [AFP]
Valinakis: We are in a period in which Greek-Turkish relations are at a good level.
It is true that there is a better atmosphere, and recently one more factor was added that guarantees our good relations: the personal collaboration and "chemistry" of our two new prime ministers, Costas Karamanlis and Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Both sides comprehend that the European prospect is a catalyst for a better future for all. They are working towards this direction.
Greece, as member of the European family, supports Turkey's path towards Europe, while Turkey, as a future candidate, makes efforts to step into the European chariot.
However, we should not underestimate the difficulties that continue to exist in our relations.
SE Times: You were involved in the negotiations on resolving the Cyprus issue.
What phase are we in right now?
Are you optimistic about the result?
Valinakis: The Cyprus issue remains an international problem that simultaneously constitutes a subject of high priority for Greek foreign policy.
A European solution for Cyprus would influence Greek-Turkish relations positively.
It is generally agreed that there can and should be a solution.
We hope that soon there will be developments in the direction of a European solution for the island so that Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots can enjoy the good things that European integration brings.
In any case, though, it is up to Cyprus.

The lab, the most up-to-date in the region, will conduct drug chemistry analysis, ballistics examinations, fingerprinting, document analysis and DNA and blood tests.
Sea pollution caused by spilled ballast water from foreign ships, a lack of research, noncompliance with maritime territorial limits and excess urbanisation are the biggest problems facing the Montenegrin seashore, experts have warned.
According to the Vijesti newspaper, these problems may doom animal species and plant varieties in the region.
The hi-tech market in Romania is expected to reach 7 billion euros this year, up from 2 billion euros in 2007, Minister of Communications and Information Technologies Karoly Borbely announced on Wednesday (May 7th) at the opening of the biggest IT&C exhibition in the country.

Borissov: No quick fix for Bulgaria
Sofia Mayor Boyko Borissov will head Bulgaria's next government after his centre-right party won Sunday's parliamentary elections.

Fresh from their victory in Bulgaria's parliamentary elections Sunday (July 5th), Boyko Borissov and his centre-right Citizens for the European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) are vowing to step up reforms.
Borissov warned, however, that there will be no quick fix to the various problems the country is facing.
"We cannot be expected to work miracles in the next six months, and we haven't promised any such thing," the Sofia mayor told a news conference, stressing that his party's programme is a four-year one.
He voiced hope that Bulgaria would soon be able to regain access to EU assistance funding, frozen because of sluggish efforts in fighting crime and corruption.
Borissov, 50, also pledged that his government would prosecute any cases of corruption that took place during the outgoing government's four-year rule.
"Those who have stolen should be very afraid ...
The thieves will go to jail," he said.
Despite a larger margin of victory than polls had predicted, GERB fell several seats short of an outright parliamentary majority in the 240-seat legislature.
It now plans talks with other right-of-centre parties, most likely beginning with the Blue Coalition, which won 6.73% of Sunday's vote and will have 15 seats.
Blue Coalition co-chairmen Martin Dimitrov and Ivan Kostov have already said they are ready to give Borissov their support.
"The Blue Coalition will guarantee the majority in parliament and a government that will bring changes to Bulgaria," they told reporters Monday. "We will not haggle over ministerial portfolios," Kostov stressed.
Based on 100% of the ballots, the Central Election Commission said Monday that GERB took 39.7% of the proportional vote, entitling it to 90 parliamentary seats.
It also won 26 of all 31 mandates distributed separately via majority vote and is thus set to have 116 representatives in the new assembly.
Two of the parties in the outgoing tripartite coalition government -- the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) -- trailed far behind GERB, while the third, the National Movement for Stability and Progress, did not even pass the 4% threshold for entry in parliament.
The BSP, with 17.7%, will have 40 parliamentary seats.
The MRF won 14.5% of the popular vote and five individual seats and will thus have 38 representatives in the new assembly.
The ultranationalist Ataka (Attack) party ended fourth with 9.4% and 21 seats, ahead of the Blue Coalition and the Order, Law and Justice Party.
Turnout was 60.2%, exceeding the 55.8% recorded in the 2005 parliamentary elections and the 37.5% in last month's European Parliament elections.
Croatian shoppers reclaim Sunday
Croatian retailers and businesses reopen on Sundays as a ban introduced earlier this year is ruled unconstitutional.
By Natasa Radic for Southeast European Times in Zagreb – 06/07/09

Having lost income for six months, shopkeepers applaud the Constitutional Court's decision to lift a ban on Sunday shopping.
The limits, introduced in January, were lifted after the court's June 19th ruling.
Constitutional Court President Jasna Omejec explained that under the ban "the freedoms of entrepreneurs were limited … and that it did not necessarily protect the workers' rights".
Stores had been forced to close on Sundays since January 1st.
As sales plummeted, retailers hit by the economic crisis filed a lawsuit.
The court ruling "is extremely important in time of crisis when we expect good summer season results," said Dubrovnik shopkeeper Djivo Curlica.
Crowds rushed to shopping malls and stores nationwide on the first shopping Sunday in June, buying everything from groceries to shoes before the 2pm closing.
"I'm sorry for those that have to work Sundays, but Sunday is the only day when I can shop, as I work week days," said Davorka Maricic, a Zagreb resident.
Businesses in tourist hot spots had argued the restrictions undermined the country's appeal to visitors.
Foreign cruise ships arrive in the Dubrovnik area on Sundays and thousands of passengers disembark for the day.
Under the ban, they could not even purchase souvenirs.
The Croatian Chamber of Crafts, which had earlier appealed to the government not to curtail Sunday shopping, published a report detailing the economic impact.
"By May, 2,874 working posts were closed and small shops lost 17% of income," Chamber President Boris Vukelic said.
He warned that "the owners of small, family shops are largely hit by the ban ...
Croatia should follow EU regulations enabling small shops to decide how and when to work.
This could help them survive facing hard times."
The court ruling, however, may not be enough to relieve the plight of small businesses floundering at a time of worldwide economic crisis.
The first Sunday shoppers rushed to big malls and supermarkets, bypassing small neighbourhood shops.
A window into Serbian history
The tranquil atmosphere of Topola contrasts with its tumultuous past.
By Bojana Milovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 06/07/09 Photos by Nikola Barbutov
The family mausoleum is part of the Legacy House of Petar at the top of Oplenac Hill.
From 1804 to 1813, under the leadership of Karadjordje Petrovic, Serbia started mounting serious resistance to the Ottoman Empire and began restoring its statehood.
Karadjordje is known in history as the leader of the first Serbian uprising in 1804.
He established a fortified town at Topola and gathered an army for the fight against the Ottomans.
Today, two centuries later, one can visit his stronghold, house and church.
More then 100,000 tourists visit the site each year, a guide from the Topola's tourist organisation, Lidija Krstic, told Southeast European Times.
"Most of our visitors are children on organised school trips … Topola is a place where children can learn a lot about Serbian history," she said.
Many of the foreign tourists are diplomats and ambassadors who want to boost their knowledge about the country.
Karadjordje's uprising did not meet with long-term success.
He and other rebel leaders were forced to flee to the Austrian Empire in 1813, when the Ottoman Empire launched a massive assault.
The Church of St. Djordje is covered by 3,500 square metres of mosaic.
His grandson, King Petar I, began reconstructing the town upon the family's return to power in 1903, and today the town stands as a historical museum devoted to the first uprising.
Visitors can see Karadjordje's cannon, sabers, swords, firearms and flags.
The Legacy House of Petar is a grand complex at the top of Oplenac Hill. It spans 142 hectares and includes the Church of St. Djordje, the house where Petar monitored work on the mausoleum's construction, a house for the royal wine maker and the Royal Wine Cellar.
The church is home to a stunning mosaic, spanning 3,500 square metres with 40 million multicoloured glass cubes in 15,000 different shades.
The entire legacy house used to live off the production of wine from the Royal cellar.
Petar's house, built next to the mausoleum, is a museum today, exhibiting personal items of the royal family.
The most valuable exhibits are icons from Mount Athos monasteries and a tiara that belonged to Queen Marija, wife of King Aleksandar I. Visitors can also see portraits of royal family members.
The Wine Maker's House was built in 1911 for the "keeper" of royal vineyards. After World War II and the exile of the Karadjordjevic family from Serbia, the building served as the Museum of the People's Fight for Freedom.
Today it hosts cultural events and a permanent exhibition of renowned painter Nikola Grahovac, who spent three decades of his life in Topola and was a big donor to the Legacy House.
Our last stop is the Royal Wine Cellar.
The Royal vineyards used to span about 50ha.
The entire legacy house used to live off the production of wine from the Royal cellar, built by Aleksandar in 1931.
Today it is a museum exhibiting old equipment, wine presses and barrels dating back to the 1930s.
Although Topola represents a tumultuous period in Serbian history, the town today exhibits an aura of peace.
Residents are very proud of their town -- any one of them could be your guide through Topola's sites and historical importance.
New Information Surfaces in the Ibar Highway Murders
The alleged mastermind of former Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic's assassination, Mihajlo "Legija" Ulemek, is also a key suspect in another political murder, the subject now of a new trial.

Last week in Belgrade, a new trial began in the case of the October 1999 murder of four members of the Serbian Renewal Movement on the Ibar Highway.
The party president and then-leader of the Serbian opposition, Vuk Draskovic, survived with minor injuries.
The trial opened with a statement by Nenad Ilic, a former member of the disbanded Special Operations Unit (JSO).
He is charged with driving the truck used in the crime.
During the investigation of the murders in February 2001, Ilic admitted to having taken part in the multiple homicide.
He now claims to have been promised a prison term of several months, after which he and his family would get a new identity and financial assistance, for admitting to a role in the crime.
According to Ilic, State Security believed that former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic was somehow involved the crime and that the trial would delay or prevent his extradition to The Hague.
Ilic has now also accused Serbian Vice President Cedomir Jovanovic -- a close associate of assassinated Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic -- of involvement.
This does not surprise Dragoljub Todorovic, the lawyer who represents the families of the victims.
"Nothing special has been said which Ilic did not point out and which the initial judge did not take into consideration.
He did not have any comments regarding the statement issued once more by the Supreme Court.
The statement concerning Jovanovic does not have any special influence on this case, unless other details emerge," said Todorovic.
In January 2003, the regional court issued a seven-year prison sentence in the case to former Chief of State Security Rade Markovic, Milosevic's close associate and family friend.
The two perpetrators of the crime, Nenad Bujosevic and Ilic, were sentenced to 15-year prison terms, while the former chief of the Belgrade branch of State Security was cleared of all charges.
Markovic's lawyer, Toma Fila, claims that Ilic's latest statement does not have any weight and that the mention of Jovanovic is only for media value.
However, Fila expressed doubt about the final outcome of the trial, as investigations are still pending.
In his opinion, the missing link connecting Milosevic with the Ibar Highway murders is not his client, but rather Mihajlo Ulemek.
Also known as Legija, Ulemek is the former JSO chief who was later charged with planning Djindjic's murder.
He has also been described as the principal organiser of the Ibar Highway homicides, although his name is not mentioned in the charges.
The first assassination attempt against Djindjic on the highway in Belgrade, when a truck ran into a convoy of cars that drove the prime minister, is unmistakably reminiscent of the scenario played out in the 1999 murders.
The JSO has allegedly been involved in many of the politically motivated murders in Serbia -- time and new investigations promise to reveal new names of perpetrators.
Improved security keeps more Serbs in Kosovo
Serbs in central Kosovo say they feel safer in the country.
UNDP expert Danijela Mitic talks about Serbian life in Kosovo with SETimes.

Danijela Mitic, a Kosovo Serb, works as a UNDP expert and lives with her husband and two daughters in Cagllavica, near Pristina.
She said her family feels safe in Kosovo and they do not want to move. ]
In an exclusive interview with SETimes, Mitic talks about security and ethnic issues concerning Serbs in Central Kosovo and presents her view about Serb-Kosovo future relations.
SETimes: Two years after Pristina accepted the Ahtisaari plan which stipulates considerable autonomy and protection measures for the Serb minority, there are rumblings that Kosovo Serbs are not convinced that they can live safely in an independent Kosovo, and their view of the plan is distinctly negative.
What do you think?
Danijela Mitic: Generally, the security level has significantly increased in Kosovo.
Lots of Kosovo Serbs enjoy free movement in the country.
They are coming to shop in Pristina and more and more of them are getting jobs in Kosovo institutions, especially under the decentralisation process.
There are several indicators that isolation is no longer a case.
For example, UNDP surveys show that Kosovo Serbs are fed up with the coverage of Belgrade based media and want to hear more local news.
When you as a person are not isolated anymore you want to know more.
People of central Kosovo are happy with freedom of movement and freedom of speech and their lifestyle is better.
SETimes: Have you ever experienced ethnic violence in Kosovo?
Mitic: No, I have not had any ethnic problems, and I visit Pristina very often, because of my work.
SETimes: Do you trust the Kosovo police -- which is predominantly comprised of ethnic Albanians?
Mitic: It is not matter of trust, but rather doubts about their capacities.
I don't think they have the capacity to cover all investigations.
SETimes: Do you trust KFOR troops protecting Serbs in their communities?
Mitic: KFOR is just an additional security guarantee and I think they are now doing some useful projects, like small community support.
But I definitely do not want to see them again on the street as they were before.
When they are not in front of your eyes you don't think about them.
I see this is as progress.
SETimes: Do you think many Serbs in south and central Kosovo plan to move out of the country?
Mitic: I think life conditions, not politicians, cause decisions.
The times are changing and people are changing too.
People are looking for better life opportunities.
But as I said, now, more and more Serbians decide to stay.

The cabinet of the centre-right GERB party, which came to power last July, discovered nearly 150 unaccounted procurement deals signed by the previous Socialist-led government, Finance Minister Simeon Djankov said on Friday (April 9th).
The ensuing unfunded liabilities under "hidden" annexes to contracts agreed to by more than a dozen ministries between late 2008 and the first half of 2009 total more than 1.1 billion euros, Djankov told reporters at a Sofia press conference.
As a result, he said, the 2009 budget deficit would soar to 3.7% of GDP, up from the initially reported 1.9%, thus exceeding the EU limit of 3% of GDP. The 2008 budget figures would have to be revised as well, he added, noting that the 1.8% of GDP surplus reported for that year would shrink by up to 0.3%, due to the unaccounted deals.
Bulgaria's plans were to submit its application for joining the ERM2 -- commonly referred to as the eurozone's waiting room -- in July.
Sofia's hope was to adopt the euro as its official currency in 2013.
Speaking at the press conference with Djankov, Prime Minister Boyko Borisov said that, in view of the size of the gap, it would be wrong for Sofia to file the application.
"We officially give up the plan to bid for ERM2 because it will be offensive given this deficit," Borisov said. "We have in fact lied to our [EU] colleagues about our readiness for the eurozone, being unaware of this trap."
The finance ministry and the prosecutor's office have already started investigating former ministers and other senior officials over their suspected involvement in abuse of power stemming from the hidden contracts.
But at the same time the eurozone access remains a priority, and we continue to work for that," Djankov told Bulgarian National Radio in a separate interview.
"It is completely possible that we will file a formal application for eurozone accession before January 2011."
According to Georgi Angelov, an economist with the Open Society Institute in Sofia, postponing the ERM2 application would be a "huge mistake".
With the long-delayed health care, pension and public administration already put on hold, such a move would send "an extremely bad signal" to investors about the cabinet's willingness to address difficult issues, Angelov said.
Some fear that -- given the current problems facing the EU's poorest member in the grips of an economic crisis -- they will not benefit from adoption of the euro.
"Prices will increase and ordinary Bulgarians will grow poorer," Dimitar Nikolov, a 22-year-old student in Sofia, told SETimes.
Serbia, US agree to disagree on Kosovo
A visit by the US deputy secretary of state highlights improved ties, despite the lingering issue of Kosovo's independence.

During his recent tour of the Balkans, US Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg declared relations between the United States and Serbia as "excellent".
While Serbian President Boris Tadic reiterated that Belgrade will never recognise Kosovo, Steinberg did not see that as an impediment to progress in other areas.
One significant item was continued US support for Serbia's EU candidacy.
"Serbia is a key US partner in the region," Steinberg said, praising Belgrade's efforts to build a European future.
"The United States supports Serbia on its path to membership in the EU and the WTO."
He particularly welcomed the Serbian parliament's adoption, on March 31st, of a declaration condemning the 1995 Srebrenica atrocity.
At a press conference Thursday (April 8th), Tadic said he and Steinberg had discussed the political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and agreed that fears of new warfare were unfounded.
"The situation is being dramatised and I do not know for what purpose," Tadic said.
"Problems should be identified through rational and democratic dialogue" among Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats, he said.
Serbia, Tadic said, does not support the idea of a divided BiH and is committed to the Dayton Accord.
"But we do not think solutions should be imposed," he added.
As for Kosovo, Steinberg made it clear that the United States is not pushing Serbia to extend recognition.
"We are not pressuring anyone, we are not threatening, there is no incitement," he said during an interview with B92 TV. "Our position is that it is in the best interest of the people of Kosovo and the region to move on, to put the issue behind us and move forward."
Differences of opinion between Washington and Belgrade should not stand in the way of a "solution to the practical problems of Kosovo citizens", he said.
Belgrade was the second stop of a tour which also took Steinberg to Bosnia and Herzegovina and to Kosovo.
While in Pristina, he met with President Fatmir Sejdiu, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci and Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni.
In addition, he met with local Serb leaders in Gracanica, a Serb-dominated enclave about 10km from the capital city.
Steinberg said United States strongly supports acceleration of "improved relations between Serbia and Kosovo", pointing out that both have a European future.
Regarding other issues, Steinberg said Kosovo's future depends on combatting drug smuggling and organised crime.
If these plagues can not be dealt with, Steinberg said, economic success for Kosovo will remain in doubt.
"It has been and will remain having zero tolerance for mismanagement, corruption and organised crime," Thaci told Steinberg. "There is full dedication in the Republic of Kosovo for the rule of law."
EU's Fouere says too early to assess Macedonia's prospects
SKOPJE, Macedonia -- EU representative to Skopje, Erwan Fouere, said on Tuesday (August 4th) that it is too early to assess Macedonia's chances of getting a date for starting EU accession talks.
Fouere declined to comment on the upcoming European Commission progress report expected this fall, saying Macedonia must implement the necessary reforms and prove its readiness to open accession talks.
He added that resolving the long-running name dispute with Greece is important but not crucial to Macedonia's EU bid.
Fouere also urged the opposition Democratic Party of Albanians to avoid a threatened boycott of parliament in the coming weeks. (A1, MRT, Alsat - 04/08/09)
Ahtisaari comment draws fire in Serbia
UN envoy for the Kosovo talks Martti Ahtisaari's comment to the Belgrade negotiating team earlier this month has drawn fire from Serb officials.
Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica has said the government will take diplomatic action.

Statements made earlier this month by UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari have sparked accusations by Serbian officials that the envoy is sympathetic to ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said on Tuesday (29 August) that the government will "undertake diplomatic action to inform the international community of 'serious prejudices' Ahtisaari has about Serbian people", Belgrade's FoNet news agency reported.
Ahtisaari's statement that "the Serbs are guilty as a nation" for crimes against Albanians in 1998 and 1999 was made to the Belgrade negotiation team on 8 August.
UN secretary general spokesperson Brandon Varma has said that Ahtisaari's words were "taken out of context" and that "he only wanted to say that historical heritage cannot be ignored."
"When you hear this statement, all vague talk of narrower or wider context becomes meaningless.
The Serbian people have become well acquainted with the only context of this remark," Kostunica told FoNet.
Ahtisaari later tried to clarify his remarks, saying, "Every nation carries a burden for which it has to pay." While the new democratic leadership in Belgrade cannot be blamed for the policies of former President Slobodan Milosevic in Kosovo, Ahtisaari said, "leaders in Belgrade must face a historic inheritance and accept responsibility for the past years".
Despite the clarification, Serbian officials have denounced Ahtisaari.
Serbian Co-ordinating Centre for Kosovo director Sanda Raskovic-Ivic proposed on Monday that Serb officials ask UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to exclude Ahtisaari from future Kosovo status talks.
In an interview with Radio Free Europe, Raskovic-Ivic said that Ahtisaari's statement blaming the Serbs collectively for the situation in Kosovo "has degraded and insulted the Serbian people", putting him squarely on the side of the Kosovo Albanian negotiators.
Ahtisaari's statement was the topic of a Belgrade negotiation team meeting on Monday.
Team members said that Ahtisaari acted in contradiction of "the mandate he received from the UN secretary general", and that he has "put his position as the UN secretary general's special envoy for the future status of Kosovo in serious jeopardy".
The Belgrade team is led by Kostunica, Serbian President Boris Tadic and Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic.
"It would be too hasty to make a conclusion today that Serbia will or will not call for Ahtisaari's recall," Kostunica said at the meeting. "We will see what Ahtisaari does after all this and we will also see what results our diplomatic action will yield."
British business leaders call for "open door" policy for Bulgarians, Romanians
A group of top business leaders in Britain urged the government Tuesday to keep the doors to the country's labour market open for Bulgarians and Romanians after they join the EU.

"If Bulgaria and Romania join the EU at the beginning of next year, the UK should continue with its open door policy," the BNE's statement said. [Getty Images]
A group of top business leaders on Tuesday (29 August) urged the British government against changing its immigration policy ahead of Bulgaria and Romania's scheduled EU entry in January 2007.
There is heated debate on the issue in Britain, with opposition conservatives and cabinet members calling for restrictions to ensure that workers from the two Balkan nations will not flood the country's labour market after joining the Union.
Britain was among a very few EU member states that fully opened their labour markets to migrant workers from the ten countries admitted into the bloc in May 2004.
Recent reports suggest that while the government expected about 13,000 people from those countries to come to work in Britain, the actual figure exceeded 600,000.
Arguing that the British economy has benefited from this huge influx of workers, members of the Business for New Europe (BNE) signed a statement Tuesday that says Bulgarians and Romanians also should be allowed access to the country's labour market.
"If Bulgaria and Romania join the EU at the beginning of next year, the UK should continue with its open door policy," British daily Independent quoted from the BNE statement.
"A so-called pause in migration from these countries would be tantamount to a reversal of policy and could work against Britain's interests."
Citing recent economic reports, the Independent referenced figures showing that the contribution to the British economy by Eastern European immigrants last year equalled £2.54 billion.
Between 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent of British economic growth in 2005 and 2006 also is attributed to migrants.
"We've seen some real contributions to our labour market from, for example, young Polish workers coming to meet skills shortages in Britain," Treasury Economic Secretary Ed Balls said in an interview with the BBC. "At the same time, we're going to have to look very carefully at these issues in the next few months because we need to make sure we continue with a disciplined and managed approach."
The BNE, whose 20-member advisory council includes the heads of companies like Sainsbury, Centrica, Merrill Lynch, the London Stock Exchange, KPMG and energy giant BP, urged the government to be rational when deciding on the issue.
"We believe that in reaching its decision, the UK should be guided both by economic reason and by recent historical experience," the group said.
Romanian President Traian Basescu said fears that hundreds of thousands of workers from his country would flood the EU labour market were unfounded.
"The increase in salaries at private companies has exploded, and Romania also faces a labour shortage, especially in construction.
We believe that the Romanian market will remain an incentive, so that migration will not be an issue," he said in an interview with the International Herald Tribune.
Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin also sought to dispel such concerns, saying Bulgarians would pose no threat to the British labour market after the country joins the EU.
Bulgaria rejects Libyan protest over medics
Five nurses and a doctor sentenced in a controversial HIV infection case were pardoned by Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov soon after their transfer home.

Bulgaria rejected a formal Libyan protest Thursday (July 26th) against President Georgi Parvanov's decision to pardon five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor released from life imprisonment in the North African country earlier this week.
"There are no legal problems vis-a-vis the status of the medical workers back home from Libya, and Bulgaria has shown full respect for Libyan laws," Bulgarian Prosecutor General Boris Velchev told the Balkan country's state news agency, BTA.
The medics arrived in Sofia Tuesday, after more than eight years behind bars. They were twice sentenced to death on scientifically disputed charges of deliberately infecting more than 400 local children with HIV. On July 17th, the country's top legal body commuted their sentences to life in prison, following a deal with the families of the 438 infected children.
Each family was to receive $1m in compensation.
Under a 1984 prisoner exchange agreement, the six nurses and the doctor -- who was granted Bulgarian citizenship -- were transferred to Bulgaria to serve their sentences there.
But less than an hour after landing in Sofia, the six were pardoned by Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov.
Angered by the move, the families of the infected children urged the Libyan authorities to sever diplomatic ties with Bulgaria, expel the several thousand Bulgarians working in the Arab country and ask Interpol to re-arrest the medics.
The first secretary of the Bulgarian Embassy in Tripoli was summoned to the Libyan Foreign Ministry on Wednesday to be handed an official protest, claiming Parvanov's move to pardon the medics constituted "a clear violation" of the 1984 accord.
The agreement provides that following their transfer, prisoners are treated under the host country's legislation, the Bulgarian prosecutor general explained Thursday.
"After returning to Bulgaria, the medics began to carry out the sentences imposed in Libya according to the Bulgarian law," said Velchev. "This allows the president to pardon them and he exercised this right."
Rejecting Tripoli's claims, Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev said Thursday that an official response to the Libyan protest would be sent later in the day.
"It is understandable that Libya is reacting under existing pressure from the families of the infected children," the BTA quoted him as saying. "Bulgaria's decision is motivated and fair."
A day earlier, Stanishev said Bulgaria was considering forgiving Libya's long-outstanding $54m debt to his country as a contribution to the families of the infected children, many of whom are being treated in hospitals in Britain, France and Italy.
The highly controversial case against Bulgarian nurses Kristiana Vulcheva, Nasya Nenova, Snezhana Dimitrova, Valentina Siropulo and Valya Chervenyashka, as well as Palestinian-born doctor Ashraf Juma Hajuj, prompted widespread international criticism and posed an obstacle to Libya's efforts to build closer ties with the West.
The medics have maintained their innocence, testifying that the confessions some of them made following their arrests were extracted by torture.
International experts say the infections at a Benghazi hospital most likely predated the medics' arrival and were caused by poor hygiene at the facility.
Kosovo to hold elections in November
Authorities will closely monitor the status process to ensure the planned vote does not interfere, promised President Fatmir Sejdiu.

Kosovo's leaders and UNMIK head Joachim Ruecker agreed Thursday (July 26th) that local and parliamentary elections will take place in the province in November.
Although there are some concerns that elections could be an obstacle to resolving Kosovo's status, the two processes can move together, Ruecker said after meeting with Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu. The exact date for the vote has not been selected.
Sejdiu promised that the authorities "will closely monitor the status process" to ensure the elections do not interfere.
He stressed that Kosovo's government, parliament and negotiating team will continue their work until the vote, and that there is no danger of an institutional vacuum.
Kosovo citizens interviewed by Southeast European Times expressed different views about the latest development.
Pristina resident Ferdane Krasniqi said elections should be held in November so that an independent Kosovo can have a new legislature and government.
"We should have other leaders after the settlement of the status, because we don't need the state with these leaders," Krasniqi said, blasting the current legislature as corrupt and ineffective.
According to medical student Vjosa Gashi, elections should be held either in November or December.
"We need elections, because [otherwise] we pretend to be a democratic state," he said.
Shkumbin Munishi, a linguist, said it was a mistake to have postponed local elections last year.
"That was an interruption in the consolidation of the democratic process in Kosovo," Munishi said. "Now we hear that general and local elections will take place in November.
I don't believe that November is the right date, since it may be possible that the status process will overlap with the election process."
In that case, he said, key decisions would have to be made by the outgoing administration, raising questions of legitimacy.
"I would rather see the elections take place in October," he said. "After that there will be more time to constitute the new parliament and the government, which will have the mandate to deal with finalisation of the status process."

Bulgaria's star ice skating duo, Albena Denkova and Maxim Staviski, received their country's highest state honour, the Stara Planina 1st degree, for their contribution to the development of sports in the country.
President Georgi Parvanov presented the award on April 10th.
The duo's trainers, Natalia Linichuk and Genadiy Karponosov, received the Honorary Sign of the Bulgarian President.
In March, Denkova and Staviski won gold medals at the Figure Skating World Championship in Tokyo -- their second world title.
The Albanian premiere of Bizet's "Carmen" took place at the National Theatre of Opera and Ballet in Tirana on April 7th.
The production was directed by France's Patrizia Panton, conducted by Spain's Gloria Isabel Ramos Triano, and included Albanian and foreign performers.
A regional Roma festival titled "Art Against Prejudice" was held at the International Culture Centre in Tirana.
The event, organised by the Council of Europe and the European Commission, marked International Roma Day, celebrated worldwide on April 8th.
Concerts, photo exhibitions, paintings, sculptures, artwork and crafts were featured.
Zagreb will host the World Table Tennis Championship between May 21st and 27th.
The competition will be sponsored by Zagrebacka Banka and the Koncar company and will involve over 700 table tennis players from 132 countries.
The Montenegrin permanent mission at UNESCO officially opened on April 4th, when UNESCO Secretary-General Koichiro Matsuura accepted the credentials of Montenegrin Ambassador Milica Pejanovic in Paris.
Montenegro was admitted as the 192nd member of UNESCO in March, months after its split from the former state union with Serbia.
The 24th edition of the cultural manifestation "Nusic Days", dedicated to renowned Serbian novelist, playwright, satirist and rhetorician Branislav Nusic (1864-1938), opened in Smederovo on April 6th and runs through the 29th.
The programme includes art exhibits and theatre performances by Serbian and foreign troupes.
The third international fair of Slavic librarians will be held between April 19th and 23rd in Sarajevo and Tuzla.
This year the event will analyse the history and functioning of the largest Slavic literature collections in Europe and the United States, as well as the possibilities for introducing modern technologies in libraries.

In Serbia, bringing Christmas joy to the poor
Around 200 children from Belgrade's poorest families enjoyed a feast served by international diplomats.

The most important Christmas customs in Serbia are tied to children and the family, to the warm atmosphere of home, and the anticipated holiday feast.
Roast pork or lamb, stuffed cabbage rolls or sarma, cakes and cookies are found on nearly every dining room table.
Except, that is, for families who cannot afford it.
All that food costs money, and some don't have enough.
Their children, meanwhile, face the prospect of a holiday with no presents.
This year, the Belgrade city authorities stepped in to help them enjoy Christmas too.

Around 200 children -- many of them Roma -- got the chance to attend a Christmas lunch organised by the municipality and attended by international diplomats.
The children had their lunch served by Brazilian and Canadian ambassadors to Belgrade Dante Coelho de Lima and John Morrison, with US Ambassador Mary Warlick, who was celebrating her first Christmas in Belgrade.
"There is no better way to mark this day and show the Christmas spirit and tradition.
I'm enjoying this; it's a pleasure to help these children and cheer them up," Warlick told SETimes.
"For me, actions like this one are especially important, because my country is struggling with the problem of hunger, which is why I am particularly sensitive to children living in poverty, without regular healthy meals," de Lima said.
Biljana Momcilovic is 13-years-old and wants to become a hairdresser when she graduates from elementary school.
"I love Christmas and we always celebrate it in my house," she said. "My parents don't have enough money to buy presents for all of us.
I have two more brothers and a sister.
I've never tried dishes like these before; I really like them."
Although the children enjoyed the abundant food and were excited about the presents, their parents found it difficult to forget about the poverty that colours everyday life.
"I'm unemployed, we live on welfare, and yet we try to provide education, decent clothing and food for all our children. It's really hard," 55-year-old Zorica Kadri, a mother of five and grandmother of 20, told SETimes.
UN General Warned Milosevic of Possible Bloodshed in Srebrenica
A former commander of UN troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina told the UN war crimes tribunal that Slobodan Milosevic had power over Bosnian Serb leaders until at least May 1993, and used his influence to prevent a massacre in Srebrenica at the time.

A former commander of the UN forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) has told the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague that, having witnessed the level of hatred in the area of Srebrenica in March 1993, he warned Slobodan Milosevic of a possible "terrible tragedy" there.
Using the power he had over the Bosnian Serb leaders at the time, the former Yugoslav President prevented a likely massacre in May of that year, retired French General Philippe Morillon testified Thursday (12 February) at Milosevic's war crimes trial.
Milosevic faces 66 counts of war crimes under three separate indictments for his alleged role in the conflicts in Croatia, BiH and Kosovo in the 1990s.
He faces a single charge of genocide over the 1992-1995 war in BiH, including for the 1995 Srebrenica massacre of more than 7,500 Muslim men and boys.
UN prosecutors, who must complete their case against Milosevic next week, are trying to prove that he controlled Serb forces in BiH and is therefore responsible for atrocities they committed.
Milosevic insists he has no responsibility for war crimes troops under the command of Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic committed in BiH.
Morillon, who commanded the UN protection force (UNPROFOR) in BiH from September 1992 to July 1993, described the situation he confronted.
"They were in this hellish circle of revenge.
It was more than revenge that animated them all.
Not only the men, the women, the entire population was imbued with this," he said. "It wasn't the sickness of fear that had infected the entire population of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the fear of being dominated, of being eliminated.
It was pure hatred."
When Morillon visited the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica in eastern BiH in March 1993, the region faced sporadic shelling; Bosnian Serb blockades were already causing a shortage of food and supplies.
He promised people the UN would protect them, but feared that attacks by Muslim forces targeting Serb civilians would result in fierce retaliation.
"I knew the only person who could assist me was Mr. Milosevic and I went to tell him," Morillon said.
Urging the Yugoslav leader to pull back his troops, the general warned him that "something terrible" would happen in Srebrenica unless retaliatory attacks were halted.
"You will be condemned and demonised," he recalled telling Milosevic.
Milosevic, according to Morillon, had influence over Karadzic and Mladic until at least May 1993, when following orders from Belgrade, a possible massacre was prevented.
Milosevic said he ought to be given credit for this.
"The influence I could have yielded -- and that was political influence -- was used to stop the bloodshed over there ...
Everything was stopped, isn't that right?" Milosevic asked during cross-examination.
"Precisely,'' Morillon said.
The general said his fears came true two years later, and he was still "haunted" by the massacre of Muslim men and boys in the UN-declared safe area in July 1995, after Srebrenica fell to Bosnian Serb forces.
Albania Hosts Important Military Exercises
US and British troops and the Albanian Army are participating in two important military exercises in Albania, which hopes to eventually join NATO structures.
By Ardi Pulaj for Southeast European Times in Tirana - 09/10/03
For three weeks, Albanian troops were trained to carry out responsibilities in peacekeeping missions and to help the implementation of UN Security Council resolutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Afghanistan and Iraq.
The military exercises took place in co-operation with the United States and Britain, which sent experts and special units to help with the equipment and training.
The exercises, considered among the largest of their kind to have been carried out with US co-operation, were divided into three phases: familiarising Albanian troops with NATO training standards, improving operational skills, and boosting interaction between troops.
The British contingent was represented by the special forces of the Wells regiment.
Albanian troops participating in the military exercises were from ground forces, while the military police lent support and provided helicopters for evacuations and emergencies.
Albania, one of the strongest supporters of the US-led coalition in Iraq, hopes eventually to join NATO.
Although it was unable to provide significant military or material support during the Iraq campaign, it opened its air space, land routes and territorial waters to coalition forces, and offered use of its bases.
Albanian troops now are also included in peacekeeping missions in Afghanistan and Iraq.
As Albania tries to get closer to joining NATO, other Balkan countries are working hard to achieve the same goal.
At a meeting in Tirana in September, Albanian Defence Minister Pandeli Majko and his Macedonian and Croatian counterparts, Vlado Buckovski and Zeljka Antunovic, signed a joint statement emphasising that the United States plays a significant role in the process of joint co-operation towards NATO integration.
The ministers pledged to broaden the scope of trilateral military co-operation through consultations on security and defence policy, exchange of military education at all levels, military-technical cooperation, consultations on arms control, and co-operation in the framework of peacekeeping operations abroad.
They also agreed to step up border security and exchange intelligence information so as to better tackle organised crime, terrorism and trafficking in human beings, drugs and weapons of mass destruction.
Italy's Banca Intesa Buys Belgrade-based Delta Banka
The arrival in Serbia of one of Italy's top banks could boost investments and spur economic development, authorities say.

One of the largest Italian banks in terms of assets, Banca Intesa, bought a 75 per cent stake in Belgrade-based Delta Banka on 14 February. The purchase price of 278m euros was among the largest sums to have been garnered from the privatisation of Serbian companies to date.
Serbian Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic said Banca Intesa's arrival is important because it would attract the bank's clients and encourage them to do business with Serbian companies.
As a result, it stands to generate a further increase in trade with Italy, Serbia-Montenegro's second biggest trading partner.
"We expect the bank's arrival to help Serbian exports, primarily in the textile and food industries," Dinkic said.
Miroslav Miskovic, the president of Delta Holding -- the bank's parent firm -- said he will invest the money from the sale in further development, with the goal of making the company a regional leader in retail, agriculture and food production.
Delta Holding will try to secure a top position in the Croatian and Slovenian markets, followed by those in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, Miskovic said.
According to Giovanni Boccolini, a member of the Banca Intesa board of directors, Delta Banka is "a good platform" for business growth in Serbia.
The first privatisation of a state-owned Serbian bank took place on 26 January, when Greece's Alpha Bank purchased an 88.64 per cent stake in Jubanka for 152m euros.
The deal was signed by Dinkic and Alpha Bank senior official Yannis Costopoulos.
According to Dinkic, Alpha Bank has promised not to dismiss any of Jubanka's 1,328 employees over the next three years.
Costopoulos said Serbia has experienced much economic growth and has the potential for successful banking.
Through the purchase of Jubanka, which has 90 offices around the country, Alpha Bank has significantly enhanced its presence in the Southeast European market, at the same time becoming a major investor in Serbia.
Following the privatisation of Delta Bank and Jubanka, Dinkic said, foreign investment is expected to total around 1.5 billion euros this year, double the 2004 amount.
Local election fever grips Tirana
Incumbent Edi Rama will face off against Interior Minister Sokol Olldashi in the race for Tirana mayor.
Meanwhile, continued squabbling between the country's two main political parties has sparked criticism from OSCE.

President Alfred Moisiu said on Thursday (November 30th) that he is through waiting for the various political parties to agree on electoral reform and will use his constitutional powers this Saturday to set the date for local elections himself.
Sources suggest he will choose either January 20th or 21st.
One of the key races is for mayor of Tirana.
Incumbent Edi Rama, of the opposition Socialist Party, is facing a challenge from Interior Minister Sokol Olldashi, backed by the ruling Democratic Party (DP).
Rama, who has held the mayoral post since 2000, won the 2004 World Mayor Award.
Re-election would mean a third term in office.
Olldashi's campaign will be run by DP deputy leader and parliamentary group chairman Bamir Topi.
He promises that his candidate's victory will be as spectacular as the DP's win in the 2005 parliamentary elections.
Olldashi reportedly will keep his ministry post while campaigning.
While candidates for local government posts plan their campaigns, the country is also gearing up for parliamentary elections, though the date has not yet been decided.
The opposition has asked Moisiu not to schedule them at the same time as the January 21st elections in Serbia.
The Socialists say the status issue in Kosovo could potentially affect the vote in Albania, and that this should be considered when determining a date.
Moisiu says there is no connection.
"We should not be superstitious about what happens with other countries.
We are a sovereign country and should not depend on others," he said during a visit to Italy last week.
The ruling and opposition parties have been unable to find common ground on several issues related to election preparations, and the opposition is asking for amendments to the Election Code.
Meanwhile, a report by the OSCE mission in Tirana, released last weekend, strongly criticised the deteriorating political climate in Albania and said damage is being done to the electoral process.
The report noted much-needed reforms ahead of the municipal vote virtually have been stalled by squabbling between the main two parties.
From Soldiers to Businessmen: Bulgaria's Successful Model for the Region
In the aftermath of the Cold War, many former members of Bulgaria's armed forces found themselves out of work and contributing to the country's high unemployment rate.
Now a new project is helping former military personnel transition to civilian careers.

Georgi Chervenakov's background is a military one, but - as with many other Bulgarian officers - his military career is history.
Nowadays, Chervenakov is in the business of growing medicinal plants.
He was awarded 14,000 euros under the EU Special Accession Agricultural Rural Development programme.
He chose to grow lavender on a wild plot of land in Elena, northern Bulgaria. The former sergeant also became the chairman of a newly founded association of producers of ether and other medicinal plants.
While the army lost an able rank commander, the business community gained a promising entrepreneur.
As did other former communist states, Bulgaria inherited from the Cold War period a military society and an oversized army and security apparatus.
Therefore, the transition to democracy has been marked by a considerable reduction of uniformed personnel. In 2000, the number of ground forces was reduced by 49 per cent.
Decommissioning military personnel has increased unemployment, which is perceived as the number one domestic problem.
To tackle it, a local NGO - the Resource Centre Foundation (RCF) - is implementing, in close co-operation with the Ministry of Defence, a special programme designed to co-ordinate state and NGO efforts to facilitate the successful resettlement of redundant military servicemen.
It has opened a number of resettlement centres and temporary offices, covering 141 towns in Bulgaria.
The centres have been visited by 12,225 servicemen and their families, and the RCF has organised 132 motivational training courses attended by over 3,000 participants.
Its experts offer professional orientation and qualification and legal consultations, in addition to information about job openings.
As a result, 61 per cent of registered ex-military personnel have started work, and a good number of them have started their own businesses.
Another dimension of this public-private co-operation is the agreement signed between the RCF and the Ministry of Defence for military base conversion.
This project, which will convert bases near four Bulgarian municipalities into farming centres, received NATO approval, and is now in the fundraising stage.
When implemented, the project will provide both temporary and permanent jobs for decommissioned army personnel.
What started as a promising Bulgarian project has received massive international support. At the conference on Resettlement Programmes in Central and East Europe in April 2001, the project was deemed a unique model.
At the request of the Stability Pact and with NATO support, the RCF is assisting Yugoslavia, Croatia and soon Bosnia and Herzegovina in implementing similar programmes.
Science and Technology: IBM eyes investment in Serbia
The international technology giant IBM opened a new office in Belgrade and says it is exploring investment opportunities in the country.
Also in science and technology: a survey finds lagging computer literacy among young Macedonians, Turkey cleans up toxic waste in the Black Sea, and Montenegro's largest telco changes its name.

IBM opened an office in Belgrade on September 28th.
Addressing a news conference, general manager for Central Europe Brandon Riley said the move is aimed at backing increased investments in Serbia.
IBM is particularly interested in industry, the banking sector, telecommunications, the public administration sector and energy, he added.
A survey conducted by the E-Macedonia foundation found that internet usage and computer literacy among young Macedonians is far below world standards.
Most students at Macedonian universities do not know how to use the web to submit job applications, and new company employees require at least three months to learn how to use basic MS Office programmes, the survey found.
Turkey's authorities said a long-standing toxic waste problem in the Black Sea will now finally be resolved, under a joint project of the environment ministry and the Turkish Cement Manufacturers' Association.
Toxic waste barrels, left by Italian companies in the Black Sea some 18 years ago, will be returned to Italy and another European country for disposal.
Over 300 gastroenterologists from Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and the other former Yugoslav countries joined colleagues from Austria, Germany, Great Britain, Greece and Turkey at the Second BiH Congress of Gastroenterologists, held in Tuzla on September 28th-30th.
Participants discussed the newest methods of diagnostics and treatment, as well as problems related to kidney transplantation and treatment of hepatitis.
Montenegro's biggest fixed-line phone, mobile and internet operator, Telekom Crne Gore, completed its rebranding and will now be known as Crnogorski Telekom.
Under an agreement with Germany's Deutsche Telekom, it will also adopt the internationally renowned T-Mobile brand on the local market.
Deutsche Telekom is a majority owner of the Hungarian Magyar Telekom, which in turn controls a 76.53% stake in the Montenegrin telco.
Cisco Systems President and CEO John Chambers met with Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov and Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev in Sofia, offering them support in the development of an e-government project.
He also said the company would donate $200,000-worth of computer equipment to three Bulgarian schools.
SiteKreator, a business website creator developed by Bulgarian software engineers, was among 67 new products making their debut at DEMOfall 2006, one of the most prestigious world forums for IT innovations.
The conference was held in late September in San Diego.

Turkey is preparing to launch third generation GSM systems, which will allow the introduction of videophones and other services.
Turkish Transportation Minister Binali Yildirim announced the planned upgrade Thursday (January 18th).
A group of medics from Albania will attend special training courses in France and Italy before returning to their country to perform the first ever kidney transplant there.
The project is being implemented under INTERREG programme, which organises co-operation between Albanian and Italian health sector specialists.
The leading Greek telecom operator OTE says it had 512,000 high-speed customers at the end of December 2006, a threefold rise since the previous year.
The telco has lowered broadband internet prices by 67% since 2003.
A system allowing the automatic processing of cases was introduced at the Commercial Court in Belgrade on Thursday (January 18th), as part of a $12.8m project co-financed by USAID.
It provides for automatic selection of trial judges to ensure fair play and eliminate the possibility of corruption.
All commercial courts in Serbia are expected to be equipped with the system in the next 18 months.
Romania's IT and communications market reported a total turnover of 6.7 billion euros in 2006 -- an increase of 24% from 2005, according to the Institute for Calculation Technique.
The telecommunication services sector holds a share of 62% of the total business volume, or 4.1 billion euros.
Although it has a lower share, the software and IT services represent the most dynamic segment of the industry, with annual growth rates of over 40% in the past few years.
The first project for boosting computer literacy of Roma in Croatia wrapped up in Zagreb on Tuesday (January 16th).
During the programme, each Roma youth received a European Computer Driving Licence (ECDL) START certificate.
In November and December, the group successfully passed four educational modules -- a prelude to earning the ECDL Core Certificate.

Public support for Serbia's EU accession declines
Serbia has come closer to attaining EU membership status, but public support for accession is down.
By Bojana Milovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 25/07/11
Only 57% Serbians support country’s EU bid. [Reuters]
In 2003, 72% of the population supported the country's accession into the EU.
This number fell to 57% in early 2011.
"[Membership in] the EU seems far too unrealistic for Serbia … I'm interested in how I live and what I can afford, and whether Serbia will be in the EU or not makes no difference to me," 32-year-old Serbian economist Dejan Tripkovic told SETimes.
Public opinion today shows a stark contrast from a few years ago.
The current ruling coalition --headed by President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party -- won the previous election and formed a coalition based on the promise to bring Serbia into the EU.
Waning support for European integration has brought many political questions to the forefront of public debate. With elections scheduled for the first half of 2012, how will public opinion on EU accession lead to changes in Serbia's political sphere?
Ruling coalition representatives say they do not fear the upcoming election.
According to them, diminished support for European integration is normal and has occurred in all current EU member states during the association process.
Democratic Party official Nada Kolundzija commented: "We are not giving up on our European integration policy, regardless of the fact the citizens are starting to run out of enthusiasm.
We believe membership in the European Union is of state, national and economic interest and is good for all Serbian citizens."
Kolundzija said the current government may have made a mistake by not sufficiently explaining the benefits of membership.
"In the coming period, we will work on better presenting that link to citizens.
It has nothing to do with the election campaign, rather with our desire to mobilise all of our capacities in order to achieve our strategic goal of EU membership as soon as possible," she added.
Members of the opposition Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) are seen as the biggest eurosceptics.
They choose to go by a different name though: "eurorealists".
The party feels that citizens are just now beginning to see the true face of the EU.
According to DSS spokesman Petar Petkovic, "Current authorities have been deceiving citizens for three years with their 'Europe has no alternative' policy.
Citizens now have three years of experience with that kind of policy and will surely punish them in the upcoming election."
He says that the government has tricked citizens into believing that a quick EU accession will lead to a better life.
"Since that has not happened, and the state is in a serious crisis, citizens are beginning to see the devastating effects of the current government's policy," Petkovic adds.
He criticises the government for its "servile" attitude towards the EU, which, as he put it, wants to strip Serbia of a portion of its territory.
"Someone who demands that we establish neighbourly relations with Kosovo, an integral part of our state, cannot be our partner," Petkovic says.
Analyst Dejan Vuk Stankovic believes that public enthusiasm for European integration has withered due to the current government's failure to deliver concrete results, despite its excessive talk of EU membership.
"The government had promised to achieve candidacy and begin membership talks at the beginning of its term, not the end, which is the case now," Stankovic explains.
He thinks that citizens will not vote based on rhetoric in the next election, but results.
Bulgarian town aims for world record
The town of Pazardjik is hoping tourists flock to take a seat.
By Tzvetina Borisova for Southeast European Times in Sofia -- 25/07/11

What has been dubbed as "the world's longest bench" was officially inaugurated in the southern Bulgarian town of Pazardjik last month.
The bench, situated in a picturesque park on a river island, is 1,111m long and can seat 2,020 people.
Architect Dimitar Boyukliev, who designed the project, told SETimes they initially targeted a length over 1,000m since they wanted to be sure nobody would beat the length. They chose the figure 1,111 for the symbolism of many number ones.
Currently, the world's longest wooden bench officially recorded by Guinness World Records is 613.13m long and is located at the stadium in Osieczna, Poland.
The idea for Pazardjik to beat this record arose two years ago, when a local businessman contacted the town's administration with a proposal to sponsor the building of benches in the park that locals call "The Island".
Built as a city park in the communist-era times, it had fallen into rough shape, suffering the wear and tear of time as well as vandalism.
The municipality embraced the revitalisation idea, suggesting that as long as they are going to build benches, they might as well go for a record and make the world's longest bench.
The park, after all, offered suitable conditions for the project, as the bench could extend uninterrupted without breaking any structures or alleys.
Work began with most of the financing provided by local businesses and the rest coming from the municipality.
Now that the bench is completed with just a few small details left, Pazardjik is firmly on its way to Guinness.
"There are two ways to apply -- one is to invite a commission of Guinness to come to our town, and the second is by sending them documents proving our record.
We are going to go for the second way," Pazardjik's chief architect Krastyo Tankov told SETimes.
According to him, although their town is not a traditional tourist destination, it has a strategic location on the highway connecting Sofia and Plovdiv.
Authorities hope the bench may lure people travelling between the two cities to stop and enjoy a cup of coffee in the beautiful park.
"In order to enter geography books, you have to get into history books first," Tankov says.
The park, totally transformed from its abandoned state a couple of years ago, currently hosts art events and sculpture exhibitions, leading visitors on a pleasant tour around the area.
There is also a cycling track, a football field, entertainment facilities for kids and even an open-air reading area with books provided by the local library.
From a deserted place people avoided, it has become a favorite hangout for locals looking for ways to escape the noise of the town and have fun.
Ottoman Empire in Kosovo and Albanian history books
How the history of the Ottoman Empire in Kosovo and Albania is written has important implications for Kosovo and Albania's relations with Turkey.
By Muhamet Brajshori for Southeast European Times in Pristina -- 25/07/11

In the history books of Kosovo and Albania, full of nationalist building discourse, the Ottoman Empire, and in some cases Turkey, are considered an oppressor due to nearly five centuries of Ottoman rule.
However, historians argue that this nationalist-based perception could have a long-term impact on relations with a resurgent Turkey in the region.
Olsi Jazexhi, who is doing his PhD on Albanian nationalism, tells SETimes the history books on the Ottoman Empire and Turkey reflect a prejudice that is influenced by so-called Albanian European nationalism, which had different stages of development, beginning during the Ottoman presence until Communist rule.
"All those stages show Europe as a destination of the Albanians, and Turkey as the opposite of it, and since 9/11 show Islam as part of this evil," says Jazexhi.
Describing the Ottoman period, a history book written for primary schools in Kosovo describes the influence of Islam on Kosovo.
"Factors which had impact on the spread of Islam were: pressure on the people through land taxes, which should be paid only by Christians, abducting boys and taking them to Istanbul where they faced Islamisation and education in Islamic way, reprisals of the state organs on the population, etc."
In this context, one issue discussed among experts and historians is whether the Ottoman Empire was an occupying country in Albania and Kosovo.
Jazexhi argues that the Ottomans conquered lands that Albanian nationalist historians view as greater Albania, but mentions an important caveat.
"The Ottomans were not Turks, but in most cases were Albanians.
Albanian Muslims who constructed and administered in the Ottoman Empire and its European parts," he tells SETimes.
This stance is reflected in the view of Turks, who view Albanians as brothers and a loyal nation, and were part of the Ottoman elite that included over two dozen prime ministers of Albanian origin.
In a 2009 speech in Sarajevo, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said, "If there had not been an Ottoman tradition, Egyptians would not have seen any Albanian in their life," referring to the 19th century Albanian reformer Muhammad Ali, who ruled Egypt and established a dynasty.
However, historian Dhimiter Koci reflects the nationalist perspective, and questions the need for a revision of history.
"In our history the Ottomans were conquering our Albanian areas, and this is a fact which cannot be changed," says Koci, arguing that "any change of history or review, whatever they call it, is a risk to our national identity, and this happened just in communist times."
What may seem as an academic discussion among historians, may, however, have repercussion for Turkish foreign policy's guiding principle of "strategic depth" as advocated by Davutoglu, using Turkey's soft power -- including common historical and cultural bonds -- to advance Turkey's increasing imprint on the region.
Columnist Ndue Ukaj, for example, has doubts about the "brotherly relations" between Kosovo and Turkey.
"Is it possible with those with whom we have fought for five centuries, those that have degenerated and deformed the nation, with those who have rendered us in the pool of ignorance and underdevelopment…today, when we intend to turn towards the civilized world, to have brotherly relations?" he writes in a column.
This negative view of the Ottomans could also reverberate on Turkey's perception of ethnic Albanians over the long-run, warns Jazexhi.
"At the moment, Turkey is under Ahmet Davutoglu's feverish policy, which seeks communion with the peoples of the Balkans and wants to begin the history from the beginning.
But after a few decades I think the Turks will probably begin to change their attitude towards their Albanian brothers."
New BiH government still up in the air
Political infighting delays formation of a new state government nearly ten months after the elections.
By Ljiljana Kovacevic for Southeast European Times in Banja Luka –25/07/11

Months after the general elections, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is still waiting for a new government coalition as political parties wrangle over the division of ministerial functions in the BiH Council of Ministers.
After months of political fighting, the two parties that won the most votes -- the Social Democratic Party (SDP) headed by Zlatko Lagumdzija and Milorad Dodik's Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) -- have reached an impasse regarding the government.
In addition, SDP candidate and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Slavko Kukic, failed to receive the support of Republika Srpska (RS) delegates.
Most RS party representatives voted against Kukic, as did the members of both the main Croat parties HDZ BiH and HDZ 1990, and the Party for BiH headed by Haris Silajdzic.
Kukic received support from more than half of parliament members in the first and second voting rounds on June 29th and July 14th, but not the two-thirds support needed from the RS MPs, which is constitutionally required for the BiH Council of Ministers appointment.
"All that happened with my candidacy reflects the fragmentation of the BiH political scene and confirms that we will elect an executive government branch with difficulty.
BiH wasted much time needed to address the EU envisaged tasks, without which there is not progress in the Euro-Atlantic processes," Kukic told SETimes.
Party of Democratic Progress (PDP) President Mladen Ivanic says that the parties are not interested in forming a government, as they are constantly fighting.
"I think that the state government won't be formed until the end of the year … [to draw] attention away from the poor economic situation," Ivanic told SETimes.
He believes the state government will not be formed until the state budget deficit forces Lagumdzija and Dodik to come to an agreement.
"By the close of the year, we are expecting serious economic problems and a serious lack of funds.
At that time, we can expect a serious discussion on establishing a government, as the IMF imposed on BiH a condition for a new funding tranche only after forming of the state government," Ivanic said.
Political analyst Tanja Topic, however, thinks that the recent talks suggest the government will be formed soon.
She says that key leaders have no sincere desire to find a solution for the new government, but must find a way out of the political crisis.
According to Topic, SDP has little room to insist on its principles, as the party risks losing the most in the elections and forfeiting its chance to participate in shaping the future of BiH.
"If you really reach a compromise between the SDP, HDZ and SNSD in forming the new government, then the question arises why did BiH lose ten months and why was no agreement achieved immediately after the election?" Topic told SETimes.
The MJAFT! Campaign: Reversing the Tide of Public Apathy
[MJAFT] On 15 March, the OSCE office in Tirana announced the launch of a four-month nationwide campaign seeking to shake off public apathy and encourage Albanians to speak out against the ills that continue to plague their society.
Southeast European Times interviewed the campaign's director, Erion Veliaj, in Tirana.
Interview by Marta Muco for Southeast European Times (OSCE, MJAFT Campaign Web site - 28/07/03)
Supported by the OSCE and other international actors, the recently completed MJAFT! (ENOUGH!) campaign was an initiative of the Balkans YouthLink and the Albanian National Debate Association.
A number of other Albanian civic groups, which also see constructive civic participation as essential to good governance and democracy, participated in the effort.
Erion Veliaj, the campaign's director, described how change could be fostered.
Southeast European Times: You have said that raising awareness can change the perspectives of society, and especially those of the younger generation.
You yourself are young, having just graduated from college in the United States.
What was the main issue that inspired you to start a broad campaign in your home country?
Erion Veliaj: In Albania, there is a lack of open and frank public debate on political, economic and social problems.
These are basic issues of an open and free society that have remained persistently unaddressed for over a decade since the fall of communism.
Time is certainly ripe, if not late, for Albanian society to undergo drastic change in its attempts to move beyond a 'crisis mentality'.
People are resigned to a reality they think they cannot change, immune to corruption and tolerant of injustices.
The average citizen appears to have signed a 'certificate of silence' and given up trying to seek solutions.
This reality should and must change.
The time has come for all Albanians who care to see their society develop to join their voices and say that they have had ENOUGH and will not take this state of affairs any longer.
SE Times: The MJAFT!
Campaign just finished. What was it?
Veliaj: MJAFT!, meaning "ENOUGH!", was the largest awareness campaign ever to be held in Albania. Launched on 15 March and ending on 12 July, MJAFT! was a four-month civil society campaign.
It was a grassroots citizens' campaign, driven by the ideals of democracy and good governance through civic demand and participation.
The campaign aimed to raise awareness, to join forces with other non-governmental bodies --as well as with international and other national bodies working on similar issues -- and to speak out concerning the persistent problems plaguing Albanian society.
The campaign was about putting an end to the old status quo and saying a loud and clear "ENOUGH!" to deteriorating health and education services, blood feuds, trafficking and organised crime, poverty and unemployment, discrimination against women and disadvantaged groups, irresponsible politics and political corruption, environmental degradation and slow progress in the area of EU integration.
SE Times: What was the targeted audience for your campaign?
Veliaj: The campaign reached out to over nine million Albanians living at home and abroad.
Aiming to be the largest advocacy campaign ever held in Albania, MJAFT! established one of the most visited Web sites in the country, with over 900 subscribers to the regular press releases and the biweekly MJAFT! newsletter.
The site became a clearinghouse of information, containing statistics on each of the themes, quotes from the public and listing past and upcoming events for the campaign.
SE Times: Were there any specific themes around which you focused your efforts?
Veliaj: The MJAFT!
Campaign lobbied on eight themes.
These are issues which are believed to have slowed down Albania's progression into the EU, as well as its overall development.
The themes chosen also run alongside the UN Millennium Development Goals, targeted for the Year 2015.
The following is a list of the eight MJAFT! Campaign themes:
Suffering Health and Education Service (24 March-4 April)
Blood Feuds (5-20 April)
Trafficking and Organised Crime (20 April-3 May)
Poverty and Unemployment (5-16 May)
Discrimination against Women and Disadvantaged Groups(17-26 May)
Environmental Degradation (27 May-15 June)
Lack of Progress in EU Integration (16-27 June)
Widening Gap in Irresponsive Politics and Political Corruption (28 June-8 July)
SE Times: How do you evaluate the outcomes and achievements of the MJAFT?
Veliaj: As far as outreaching is concerned, there have been several achievements by the campaign.
These results can be classified under certain sections including networking/partnerships, media/promotion and research/training.
1) Networking/partnerships.
Partnerships have been built with civil society organisations, governmental agencies, international bodies (UNDP, UN Volunteers, the OSCE, the WHO, the British Council, the Lincoln Centre, and the embassies of the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Germany and the United States), and the private sector (AMC-Albanian Mobile Company, the largest mobile phone company in the country; Top Channel, a local television station).
2) Media/Promotion.
The campaign was highly visible one, with widespread media coverage in print, television and radio.
Other widespread activities, such as the MJAFT Bus Caravan tour, collected hundreds of activists across Albania for a seven-day tour through the country to promote the campaign in over 20 cities.
A high profile event included the MJAFT! Fest, a three-day open air concert bringing together over 20 regional and local bands and DJs to play over 50 hours of music.
3) Research/Training.
The MJAFT!
Campaign organised and offered training courses.
The training was geared towards committed individuals interested in fostering community change on problems that require governmental action.
Training sessions were conducted in 20 cities all over the country.
Publication of university student statistics was made possible by a nationwide survey released on 31 March, which revealed that students lack access to essential facilities at universities throughout Albania.
Approximately 1,000 students took part in the study.
Other MJAFT! activities included protests, public debates, city hall meetings, a marathon run, a theatre performance, a street fair and an exhibition.
SE Times: How has the campaign been received?
What kind of response has it generated?
Veliaj: It has been described as something more serious than an awareness-raising campaign.As Gjergj Tola, director of the silent theatre troupe that joined the MJAFT!
Bus Caravan put it, "Albanians from all walks of life, the leaders of our society, our intellectuals, our students, our teachers -- we are all calling for change.
Enough of the difficult times, we want a better life." An Albanian journalist described the initiative as "the most difficult in the Albanian world".
Others have stressed the need to reach out to smaller communities and more isolated areas of the country.
Daan Everts, the personal representative of the OSCE chairman-in-office, has said he hopes that MJAFT! will raise awareness and encourage a more active stance against organised crime, trafficking, corruption and the key issue of transparency of governance.
The campaign has also received praise and appreciation from political figures in the United States, such as Rep Tom Lantos, of San Francisco, and Rep Eliot Engel, who chairs the Albanian Issues Caucus.
Engel has praised the campaign as "evidence of a new era of Albanian thinking, a new approach to old problems, and a new hope for the future of Albania".
Europol to set up task force on non-Islamist threats
A special task force of senior European counter-terrorism experts will help investigate non-Islamist threats in Scandinavian countries, Europol says.
(EurActiv, Euobserver, AP, The Irish Times, The Australian, TODAYonline, BBC - 25/07/11; FT, AP, Zaman, Hurriyet - 24/07/11; B92, World Bulletin - 23/07/11)
The attacks in Oslo Friday (July 22nd) killed 96 people. [Reuters]
Europol will establish a task force to help investigate non-Islamist threats in the Scandinavian countries, media reports quoted the European law enforcement agency as saying on Monday (July 25th) in the wake of last week's twin terrorist attacks in Norway.
The group will initially comprise more than 50 senior experts from Britain and a number of other European countries, but could be expanded in the future, if needed, officials from The Hague-based agency said.
Europol head Rob Wainwright suggested the idea was prompted by Friday's bomb explosion at the government headquarters in Oslo and the killing spree at a Labour Party summer youth camp on Utoeya Island, about 50km away, just two hours later.
"As soon as it happened we opened our operational centre to connect the investigation with an international platform of counter terrorism analysts," Brussels-based Euobserver quoted him as saying.
"It has taken a lot of people by surprise.
We've been monitoring the right wing extremists in Europe for many years," Wainwright added.
On Sunday, the death toll from the shocking attacks rose to 93.
At least 96 others were wounded in the worst violence Norway has seen since World War II.
Anders Behring Breivik, a 32-year-old Norwegian, who is said to have links with far-right extremist groups, was arrested within hours of Friday's incidents.
He admitted carrying out both attacks, but has denied criminal responsibility for them.
In a 1,500-page "manifesto," titled "2083: A European Declaration of Independence" which was posted on the internet along with other writings, Breivik said that it was NATO's air strikes on Serbia in 1999 that "tipped the scales" for him, according to the AP.
He criticised the Norwegian government for joining the campaign, claiming that it wrongly targeted "our Serbian brothers [who] wanted to drive Islam out by deporting the Albanian Muslims back to Albania".
Insisting that the "Islamisation of Europe" cannot be stopped by peaceful means, Breivik calls for a "crusade" against "cultural Marxists" and Muslims.
Serbian President Boris Tadic, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other Balkan leaders, joined European and international officials in condemning the massacre in Norway.
"On behalf of the Serbian people, please accept our deepest condolences over the tragedy caused by the senseless bombings," Tadic wrote in a letter of condolence to Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg on Saturday.
The Turkish foreign ministry released a statement the same day, emphasising Ankara's support for the Nordic country.
"I would like to stress that we stand together in solidarity with our friends, the people of Norway and the Norwegian government during these hardest of times," Erdogan said in a separate personal message to his Norwegian counterpart, also condemning such terrorist attacks, in which innocent people are killed.
Abdulkadir Emin Onen, deputy-chairman of Erdogan's Justice and Development Party for foreign affairs and chairman of the Turkish Group at the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, told SETimes that Turks were "shocked by the tragic events" in Norway.
"Turkish people crossed their fingers from the very beginning, hoping there were no Islam organisations behind the Norway attacks," Aytekin Geleri, security analyst at the Ankara-based Institute of Strategic Thinking, told SETimes.
While acknowledging the potential menace posed by far-right extremist groups in Europe, Wainwright noted also that the threat of Islamist terrorism remains in the Old Continent.
"The threat of jihadist terrorism is still out there," he said. "It is still a real and substantial threat, but of course at the same time we have to monitor other possible terrorist activities."
SETimes correspondent Alakbar Raufoglu contributed to this report.
Serbian President Visits Kosovo
During the first day of his Kosovo tour, Serbian President Boris Tadic called for reconciliation and an end to hatred and destruction, while also urging the international community to provide additional guarantees for the province's Serbs.

Serbian President Boris Tadic began a two-day visit to Kosovo on Sunday (13 February), the first by a Serbian head of state since the 1999 conflict.
While calling for reconciliation, he also demanded greater security for Kosovo's Serbs and reiterated Belgrade's opposition to independence for the province.
"There has been a lot of hatred and destruction in the history of the Balkans, including Kosovo and Metohija, and it must stop," Tadic said. "I want to make a full contribution to a peaceful solution but I wish to say that I will not give up the fight for the legitimate interests of the Serb people."
In the town of Strpce, Tadic called on UNMIK to provide additional guarantees for the safety of Serbs and people of other ethnic backgrounds living in Kosovo, pledging that he would do everything possible to make sure they have "the right to live and survive".
He delivered similar messages to the residents of Serb-populated settlements in Silovo, Velika Hoca and Pristina.
On Monday, he visits two monasteries and Serb enclaves in central Kosovo.
More than 200,000 Serbs have left Kosovo since the end of the conflict there.
There are now approximately 90,000 Serbs living in the province.
Meeting with Tadic on Sunday, UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen expressed the hope that Tadic's visit would send a positive signal concerning Belgrade's readiness "to build bridges of trust".
He also urged the Serbian president to use his visit to become fully acquainted with the situation, and to take the opportunity to meet with representatives of all communities in Kosovo.
Tadic's visit could help resolve the issue of Serb villages that have been without electrical power, Jessen-Petersen said.
Emphasising that Kosovo authorities and the international institutions in the province were continuing their efforts and remained committed to the implementation of standards, he also pointed to areas where progress is needed -- specifically, in ensuring freedom of movement and the return of displaced persons.
Jessen-Petersen again called for full participation by Kosovo Serbs in the political and democratic process in Kosovo.
He and Tadic also discussed the reconstruction of Orthodox churches and monasteries that were destroyed during an outbreak of violence last March.
In other news, the head of the British consular office in Pristina said Monday that Belgrade must be included in any process aimed at establishing the final status of Kosovo. "The position of the British government is clear.
Belgrade must be included in defining the final status," Mark Dickinson told the Belgrade daily Vecernje Novosti.
"The Albanians think that Kosovo should be independent within the existing borders, while Serbia thinks that it must remain in Serbia, within those borders.
Our position is that Kosovo must be multiethnic, with a functioning economy and institutions and that the law must be respected," Dickinson said.
Albania Seeks to Privatise State-Owned Companies
The Albanian government has set privatisation of state-owned assets as a major goal for 2005.
Procedures for the sale of two companies -- Albtelekom and Albania Refining and Marketing of Oil -- are expected to start in April.

Albania intends to privatise two of its main state-owned companies, Albtelekom -- the main landline telephony company in the country -- and Albania Refining and Marketing of Oil (ARMO), with procedures scheduled to start in April.
The government has said privatisation of state-owned assets is a major goal for this year.
Four companies have shown interest in taking over ARMO, and seven are interested in Albtelekom, according to Economy Minister Anastas Angjeli, who has been discussing the planned sale with the Consulting Commission of Transparency and Privatisation.
"The process of transformation and restructuring these companies in the past four years made the consolidation of their economic-financial activity possible.
Now that the government passed the package of laws, they will be offered in an open international tender for privatisation by strategic investors," Angjeli said.
The economy, transport and industry ministries are working with international consultants and the interested parties to prepare for the tender.
The winner of the Albtelekom tender is expected to obtain between 51 per cent and 76 per cent of the shares of the company.
The ARMO winner cannot take more than 51 per cent of the shares.
ARMO is responsible for oil refineries in Ballsh and Fier, as well as for fuel wholesale and retail activities.
Albtelekom is predicting profits in 2005 of about 16.1m euros, according to Angjeli.
The telecommunications company experienced significant profit growth in 2004, largely due to increases in international calling. "
The privatisation of these companies aims to assist the development of economic growth through the greater presence of foreign direct investments, based on concurrency and transparency," Angjeli said.
The process will not end with ARMO and Albtelekom.
Authorities also plan to privatise the Albanian Power Corporation, the railway system, the main port in Durres, the coal industry, water supplies and the state transportation company, Albtransport.
Will bad news shake BiH's political elite?
A scathing report from Brussels indicates the depth of the country's quagmire, but many doubt it will spur needed change.

The European Commission's (EC) latest assessment of Bosnia and Herzegovina's progress towards EU accession is one of the most critical ever, officials acknowledge.
"The EC report objectively and in detail pointed to all areas in which the state should invest its additional efforts to further advance the process of EU accession," Directorate for European Integration Director Nevenka Savic told SETimes.
Delivered on Wednesday (October 12th), the report pointed to the lack of a functioning government -- one year after elections were held -- as a major obstacle.
It also said the country's political, economic and security situations are critical, and that BiH politicians lack a joint vision about in which direction to go.
The fight against organised crime is lagging, as are efforts to harmonise legislation with EU standards and implement economic and administrative reforms as well as improvements in human rights, the EC determined.
Overall, the report found, the pace of reforms is "very limited".
The only bright spots in the otherwise gloomy picture appeared to be visa liberalisation with the Schengen zone and the beginning of structural dialogue with the EU on judicial reform.
Will the negative news from Brussels galvanise local politicians into action?
Many appeared sceptical.
"Life is ever more difficult, the majority of citizens sink into apathy, the EU vision is spent in daily political games," said political analyst Vedran Dzihic. "At the same time, the BiH political elite continues the practice of presenting the deep crisis as normal, while the protection of national (read: their own) interests in accordance with their ethno-political populism is a substitute for serious reform," Dzihic told SETimes.
"The authorities were not at all worried about the report; I even think they are very satisfied.
Those in BiH, and especially in Republika Srpska, prefer isolation because they can more easily manipulate the citizens," parliament member and Party for Democratic Progress (PDP) President Mladen Ivanic told SETimes.
According to Sarajevo-based commentator Senad Pecanin, "the impression one gets is that at this rate, BiH will not enter the EU for another ten years."
Part of the problem, he said, is that members of the public are too busy struggling economically to focus their attention on the issue.
Warnings from Brussels affect the public less and less, and they in turn do not pressure the political elite, he said.
"When the people do not know how they will survive tomorrow, then the question about EU membership is not one which the public would pressure the ruling oligarchy about," Pecanin said.
Still, those interviewed by SETimes indicated they are concerned about the situation, though pessimistic about prospects for change.
"All the countries in the region are progressing, only BiH remains in place," Sarajevo administrative worker Haris Halilovic said, summing up a widespread view. "As long as national interests are above individual and civil rights, there will be no progress in this country."
EU mulls future role in Kosovo
Two top EU officials are proposing that the bloc take on a greater role in Kosovo after its final status is determined, including taking on policing functions.

[AFP]
In a 7-page report presented Monday (12 December), EU security chief Javier Solana and Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn called for an EU force to assume a greater role in Kosovo after its final status is determined, including taking on policing functions.
The report is an update of one released in June, which initially set forth the idea of an EU policing mission.
It was presented Monday to EU foreign ministers, who gathered in Brussels to discuss the prospects for further EU engagement in the Balkans.
"The EU could take on responsibilities in the police and rule of law and certain economic areas," the Reuters news agency quoted the new report as saying. "Contingency planning for a possible ESDP [security and defence] mission on police and rule of law should start."
The two officials also urged the bloc to help strengthen the rule of law in Kosovo by sending prosecutors, judges and prison staff, and to provide more aid to help lower the province's staggering unemployment rate, which currently stands at over 50 per cent.
Rehn and Solana stressed, however, that the bloc had no intention of completely replacing the current UN mission, which now handles everything from maintaining law and order in the province to overseeing its everyday civilian administrative tasks.
The bloc would not be creating a "EUMIK", they said.
At the same time, they warned the EU's engagement in Kosovo would likely be its largest and most expensive yet, representing another substantial burden for the EU's 2007-2013 budget -- already a source of strain within the bloc.
"The EU contribution to the future international presence may have to include the funding of any future interim civilian administration structure to implement the status settlement, as well as a future ESDP operation for police and rule of law," they wrote, urging ministers to make sure the budget includes sufficient funds.
The financial impact is likely to be keenly heeded by EU leaders, who have so far been unable to strike a deal over the bloc's long term financing.
The impasse has already had an impact on the EU's Balkan policy, with a decision on Macedonia's candidate status apparently put off in part because of budgetary concerns.
Speaking to reporters Friday, however, Rehn said the Union could not afford to fail in Kosovo because the province is "so important for the stability of the Western Balkans".
In their report, Rehn and Solana suggested there should be a European horizon for Kosovo regardless of how its status is resolved.
However, they said, the EU's role will depend on the progress of the status negotiations, which will have to somehow reconcile Serbia's demands for continued sovereignty and the ethnic Albanian majority's insistence on full independence.
Serbian police goes on strike
Police officers in Serbia demand improved working conditions and higher salary.

Strikes that began last week continue, as the Serbian police trade union demands better working conditions and higher salaries.
In addition to higher pay, the police want a new collective bargaining agreement, organisational reform and new uniforms.
"The interior ministry has shown understanding for our demands, but the finance ministry is blocking the realisation," Police Union of Serbia leader Veljko Mijailovic told SETimes.
He said that for two years now, the union has been warning that policemen do not have adequate winter equipment.
"Another winter is approaching, and not all policemen received winter jackets and boots yet," Mijailovic explained.
He apologised to the public, but said there is no way to solve the problems but by way of a strike.
The Serbian Interior Ministry's data shows that the average salary of police officers is between 350 and 400 euros monthly.
This security service has 45,000 employees, while it should have around 59,000, according to set norms and standards.
Belgrade alone lacks more than 1,000 police officers.
The Police Union of Serbia boasts about 15,000 members.
They are also demanding that the government amend the law on the police.
Mijailovic explained that the union is asking the government finally to regulate the systematisation of employees in the police, because without it, there can be no salary raise in 2012.
The union is also demanding adequate pay for shift work.
During the strike, the issuing of ID cards, passports and other documents is conducted only in cases of emergency, and border crossings are functioning with reduced manpower.
Police Director Milorad Veljovic thinks the union is justified in its requests and demands.
"The state must realise the importance of the police in maintaining security.
The police guard all border and administrative crossings and are always called on when high-risk gatherings need security and protection," Veljovic told SETimes.
End of SP's boycott draws praise, scepticism
The Albanian opposition ended its two year boycott of parliament, but the bitter rivalry with the ruling DP continues.

After two years of protests and hunger strikes, Albania's Socialist Party ended its parliamentary boycott last month, but many see the action as much too little, too late.
In the European Commission's (EC) Progress Report released last week, the EC did not recommend EU candidate status for Albania, finding the country lacking in many areas of reform.
The EC noted the SP's boycott contributed to the slow pace of reforms, something the opposition blamed on the government.
"Instead of carrying out reforms to improve democratic standards, Albania is experiencing a period of de-democratisation," SP lawmaker Ditmir Bushati told SETimes.
Returning to parliament, however, does not mean unconditional support for the draft laws the government is sending to parliament, the SP said.
"Our mission is not to vote for the incomplete initiatives of the government with an inflation of parliamentary statistics for adopting laws.
We want to move forward and this time we have a real parliamentary initiative, which will transform EU recommendations into a concrete working plan," SP Vice-President Saimir Tahiri told SETimes.
The opposition presented a proposal outlining ten areas for government reform -- including a proposal that both parties reach a consensus on nominating the heads of independent institutions such as ombudsman and central bank governor.
"Our mission is not to pretend we are working, but to work hard in order for Albanians to have real solutions," Tahiri said.
But despite talk of party unity and leading government reform, the SP is not powerful enough to carry out reforms alone, with some questioning the party's unity.
According to former SP chief Fatos Nano, the party is not serious in its efforts to lead reform.
"It's only [presenting] an image," Nano said.
Meanwhile, analyst Aleksader Cipa says that divisions within the party will affect its ability to lead.
"[The] opposition headed by Rama is in a situation where lack of initiative and solidarity with its leader is evident," Cipa told SETimes.
"The question is how sincere this decision to return to the parliament is.
These signals are confusing and contradictory, just like the SP leadership," DP MP Tritan Shehu told SETimes.
"The opposition, with its stubborn stance over the past two years, damaged the image of the country, the reforms and [the EU] integration process," he added.
Still, others view the end of the boycott as setting Albania up for more political deadlock.
"What will happen with the opposition returning to parliament is very simple: harsh democratic dialectic will be transferred from the street to the parliament," journalist Mustafa Nano told SETimes.
He said, however, the situation could present a positive note.
"A number of laws for which both parties' consensus is needed in parliament will be approved due to domestic or international pressure.
But this is only a small relief, because the antagonism between the majority and opposition will remain the same."
Group Holds Conference on Turkey's Accession Reforms
Representatives of the Greens/EFA group in the European Parliament held a three-day conference in Istanbul to show support for Turkey's EU bid and discuss problems related to the country's accession.

Representatives of the Greens/European Free Alliance group in the European Parliament met in Istanbul from 19 October to 22 October to discuss Turkey's EU accession.
The conference, the first held by a European party on Turkish soil, focused on the challenges facing the country as it seeks to fulfil the Union's criteria for membership.
"After … intense debate with Turkish politicians, representatives of Turkish civil society, media representatives, artists and scientists, we have gained a clearer picture of what is at stake from the question of Turkey's entry into the EU," the group, which focuses on environmental issues and democratic rights, said in a press statement.
Describing Franco-German reconciliation and post-communist integration -- the "miracles of the Rhine and the Oder" -- as the cornerstones of Europe's postwar development, Greens/EFA group Co-president Daniel Cohn-Bendit suggested Turkish accession would be an equally important landmark.
"I hope that in 10 or 15 years we will have witnessed a third miracle; the miracle of the Bosphorus," he said.
At the same time, Cohn-Bendit said, Turkish politicians should acknowledge that the country requires special treatment by the EU.
"Turkey is a country of 70 million people and of great importance to Europe.
But its integration into the EU is not comparable to that of Malta or Bulgaria or Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It will be difficult both for Turkey and for the EU and both sides should be honest," he said.
Conferences and roundtable talks addressed a broad range of issues facing Turkey, including women's rights, civil liberties, freedom of the press, environmental concerns, torture and the treatment of the Kurdish, Armenian and Christian communities.
Nearly all agreed that Turkey has made sweeping changes over the past two years, but many argued that implementation of reforms remains a problem.
The chairman of the Joint Parliamentary delegation for the EU and Turkey, Joost Lagendijk, said that reforms and trust are the keys to Turkey's accession.
Although the conditions for opening of the negotiations have been met, he said, that does not mean the criteria have been completely fulfilled.
While affirming its support for Turkey's accession bid, the Greens/EFA group said it would continue to monitor Turkey's progress, with special attention to issues of human rights, democratisation and the position of women in society.
Montenegro Seeks to Bolster Fishing Industry
Marine bioligists believe Montenegro could bring in as much as 30,000 tonnes of bluefish annually, provided the republic builds the necessary infrastructure and canning capacity.
Fishermen, however, describe this figure as unrealistic.

Since 1 January, Montenegro has had the right to freely export fish to EU member countries.
So far, however, only small quantities of fish have been caught and exported.
Moreover, there is considerable disagreement about the industry's potential.
While marine biologists insist Montenegro could export as much as 1.5m euros worth of fish, many fishermen say that goal is unrealistic.
Experts from the Marine Biology Institute in Kotor, working with counterparts from Ancona, Italy, estimate that Montenegro's territorial waters are home to about 130,000 tonnes of bluefish.
Sreten Mandic, the institute's director, says that means 30,000 tonnes could be fished annually.
This year's quota is 29,000 tonnes, which adds up to 36 permits.
However, the actual amount of fish being brought in remains well below that amount.
According to the Montenegrin and Italian experts, research shows that the possibilities for fishing far exceed the current canning capacity.
To address this problem, the Ribarstvo fish production and canning factory plans a series of projects designed to increase capacity ten fold.
These include building a factory for bluefish production.
It would initially employ about 300 people, with the number rising to 1,200 over the course of three to four years.
Montenegro's Agriculture Ministry, meanwhile, has earmarked 97,000 euros for the development of fishing this year.
The major problem is the lack of a development strategy, according to the president of the Association of Professional Fishermen, Marko Kise.
Currently, he says, Montenegro is simply not capable of earning 1.5m euros annually through fish exports, and some fishermen have purchased expensive boats only to find the amount of fish available isn't enough to turn a profit.
Moreover, Kise adds, Montenegrin fishermen face hurdles such as high registration fees and a lack of repair shipyards.
Even if it were possible to catch 30,000 tonnes of bluefish annually, fishing industry representatives warn that figure would come dangerously close to overfishing the species.
Moreover, Montenegro must locate markets.
Although Italy can be reached overnight, fishermen who have tried to enter the Belgrade market have been stymied by transportation problems -- it can take up to 48 hours for the fish to reach the capital.
With Montenegrin fish exporting still in an early phase, all sides agree that research and experimental projects are needed to assess the industry's potential and develop ways to fulfil it.

Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov inaugurated the 14th European Conference of Power Electronics and Motion Control in Ohrid.
The three-day event, which ended on Wednesday (September 8th), brought together 500 scientists, professors, students and businessmen from 50 countries.
Participants discussed co-ordination of the exchange and the publication of technical, scientific and economic information.
Serbian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Science Bozidar Djelic opened the international mathematics conference at the Serbian Academy of Arts and Science in Belgrade. The conference, which brought together 60 students from over 20 countries, ends on Monday (September 13th).
Cypriot researchers have created an unmanned aircraft that can withstand severe weather conditions by changing its shape.
The project, developed by Cyprus's GG Dedalos Technologies and the Israel Computational Fluid Dynamics Centre, aims to build a small affordable unmanned plane that can be used in remote locations at minimum risk and can be guided from the ground.
About 100 doctors of Serbian origin working in hospitals abroad gathered in Belgrade last week for the first Serbian Diaspora medical conference.
The aim was to improve co-operation between local doctors and medical experts from the diaspora with the institutions responsible for the quality of Serbia's health care system. According to estimates, about 14,000 doctors have left Serbia to find work in other countries.
Kosovo's Public Administration Ministry has launched an e-employment website for all public vacancies at the central and local levels.
The project is part of the E-Governance process. It aims to offer equal employment rights to all citizens.
Turkey has invested 60m euros in EU science projects and has been a partner in major scientific research worth nearly 900m euros in the past three years, EU Framework Programmes Co-ordinator Okan Kara told the Anadolu news agency on Tuesday (September 7th).
The projects have given Turkey access to major data generated in other countries, Kara added.

Delevic: reforms are in Serbia's interest
More is at stake than just EU membership, says the head of the country's European Integration Office.

With the arrest of Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic, Serbia has overcome one of the key obstacles to EU accession.
But the path ahead may be more complex than some Serbs had hoped.
Other conditions must still be met, including the swift adoption of several reform laws.
Moreover, some EU leaders – in particular, German Chancellor Angela Merkel – have linked Serbia's EU hopes to progress in bilateral talks with Kosovo, and on resolving the impasse in Kosovo's north.
Meanwhile, a recent poll by the government's European Integration Office shows a four-point drop in the number of citizens who say they would back EU accession in a referendum.
Six months ago, the percentage stood at 57%. Now it is 53%.
Belgrade still has its sights set on receiving a thumbs-up on October 12th, when the European Commission will issue its assessment of Serbia's readiness to become a formal candidate for membership.
SETimes spoke with Milica Delevic, head of the European Integration Office, about the overall prospects.
SETimes: Are you satisfied with the support citizens are showing Serbia's European integration process, and are you worried about the decline?
Milica Delevic: People are no longer so idealistic in their views on the EU, but the high level of support shows that they rationally understand it is both in the interest of Serbia and their own interest as citizens of this country to keep Serbia moving in that direction.
Potential NATO membership remains a sensitive issue in Serbia. [Reuters]
At the moment that is a high level of support.
It is very important that the support for the reforms we are carrying out is greater than the support for EU membership.
Eighty-five percent of the citizens think the reforms should be implemented for our own sake, rather than for the sake of the EU, whereas six months ago that kind of support was at 73%.
I would tell the citizens that it is important for Serbia to continue down the European integration path, as that guarantees the realisation of reforms they want to see.
SETimes: The recognition of Kosovo as a potential condition for Serbia's EU accession is often discussed in European and Serbian political circles.
What is the truth?
Delevic: Serbia is guided by the conditions that have been defined and specified through the stabilisation and enlargement process, and they are the implementation of human and minority rights, the democratic principles of the rule of law, a functional market economy and the application of the legal heritage of the EU.
As part of the first criterion, special focus is on the necessity of regional co-operation and the fulfillment of obligations stemming from signed international agreements.
Kosovo is not formally mentioned as a condition, but it may appear as something that defines the political climate important for the unraveling of processes, both in Serbia and the EU.
There is no consensus within the EU on Kosovo being a state, but there is a clear stand that everyone, including Kosovo, should be involved in regional co-operation and association with the EU.
SETimes: One delicate issue on the Serbian political scene is whether membership in NATO is a condition for EU membership.
How do you regard the issue?
Delevic: The majority of EU member states are members of NATO, but some are not and maintain their neutrality pretty jealously.
It is important that Serbia understands the difference between being a non-member that is ready to take responsibility for regional and global security and has constructive relations with NATO, and being a non-member with a hostile attitude towards the Alliance. Those are two completely different things and the latter could obstruct the country's accession to the EU.

SETimes: Serbia is hoping to receive a positive response from the EC on October 12th and thereby gain candidate status.
How much work does Serbia actually have to do in order to achieve that?
Delevic: Serbia has plenty more to do, and I believe a lot will be done until the unveiling of the European Commission's opinion on whether Serbia should become a candidate country, which will take place on October 12th.
One should not perceive the obtaining of candidate status as a magic wand that will change everything.
It is an assessment of our progress at the given moment in certain reform processes we are carrying out; it will be a time by which certain laws are adopted and when the Commission will assess the implementation of certain laws.
That will not be the end and one should not expect Serbia to become a fully orderly country at that moment.
For us, the most important thing now is to invest maximum effort in making the anticipated assessment by the EC as positive as possible.
That assessment will then influence the decision of the EU ministers, heads of state and governments on December 9th.
SETimes: How much has the arrest of Ratko Mladic facilitated Serbia's European integration?
Delevic: It has changed the political climate; an important formal condition has been met.
I do not view that as something that is important in the context of European integration, rather as something that is important for establishing responsibility for the serious crimes that were committed.
That arrest is something that demonstrates our reaction to international obligations, confirms our commitment to the rule of law and solidifies the faith that no crime can go unpunished, as well as that regional reconciliation and stability are priority goals.
SETimes: The Netherlands was the most fervent advocate of the blockade of Serbia's European integration until the arrest of Mladic.
However, even after his arrest it still has not ratified the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between Serbia and the EU.
In your opinion, what kind of message does that send?
Delevic: I expect the Netherlands will ratify this document as well.
I am convinced that much has been done and that the Dutch members of parliament will recognise that.
But the Netherlands is not the only country preventing the agreement from coming into force -- there are still many countries yet to ratify the agreement.
SETimes: Many doubt that, due to the major crisis and turmoil within the EU, Serbia will be included in the next wave of enlargement and become an EU member.
What is your response?
Delevic: The enlargement is now marked by the economic crisis and difficulties in the internal political situations in the member states and that will certainly affect the enlargement dynamic, but I do not think that this crisis, which is serious and requires a lot of time for resolving, is jeopardising the existence of the EU and awareness of the Union's strategic interest in accepting Western Balkan countries as new members.
What's in a name?
Brdo summit to take place
With or without Serbia, the planned EU-Balkans summit reportedly will be held in the Slovenian town of Brdo on Saturday.
(WAZ.EUobserver.com - 16/03/10; B92, Blic - 15/03/10; AFP, Beta, B92, Radio Srbija, Sofia News Agency - 14/03/10; Examiner.com - 10/03/10; AFP - 09/03/10; EurActiv, AFP - 08/03/10)
"Serbia is not going to participate in any international forum which does not uphold the principles of the UN," President Boris Tadic said. [Getty Images]
The EU-Balkans summit hosted by the Slovenian town of Brdo will take place as planned, even if some of the invited guests fail to show up, the Brussels-based online news service Euobserver reported on Tuesday (March 16th).
The news came amid speculation that Saturday's meeting -- the first to bring together the leaders of all former Yugoslav republics, plus Albania, in the last 18 years -- might be cancelled over Serbia's threat to boycott the event if Kosovo should attend as an independent state.
Serbian President Boris Tadic says his country will participate in any regional forum that respects the principles of the UN, including Security Council Resolution 1244.
"A regional forum cannot represent an implicit recognition of Kosovo's independence," he told reporters following talks with Hungarian President Laszlo Solyom in Novi Sad on Sunday. "Serbia will neither implicitly nor explicitly recognise Kosovo's independence, either by its decisions or with its participation in regional forums and meetings."
He insisted that Kosovo, which is recognised by 65 countries in the world, including the majority of EU member states and Balkan nations -- except Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Romania -- should participate in international forums under UNMIK's flag.
But Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said last week that he would attend the Brdo meeting only as the representative of an independent state.
The conference, organised under the motto "Together for the European Union: Contributions of the Western Balkans to a European Future", is being co-sponsored by Slovenia and Croatia.
EU Council President Herman van Rompuy will attend, as will Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency.
Spain is one of the five members of the 27-nation bloc that have not recognised Kosovo.
The goal of the meeting is to promote the region's EU integration prospects and to "look for solutions" to some open issues, Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor said last week.
The organisers, Pahor added, want the summit to end with a joint declaration on "the European perspective of the Western Balkans".
Serbia, which submitted its official EU membership application in December, has been warned by the bloc's heavyweights to refrain from strong rhetoric about Kosovo, according to the Euobserver report.
"It will cause lots of problems for the EU if Serbia is given the opportunity to decide under which conditions Kosovo can take part in international or regional forums," the Euobserver quoted a senior EU diplomat as saying. "We have tolerated this in the past but now it is time to turn the page."
A week before the Brdo meeting, Cedomir Jovanovic, the leader of Serbia's pro-European Liberal Democratic Party, urged Tadic to attend the summit, as well as to meet with Kosovo's leaders as a gesture of good will.
"Instead of fighting for territory, we must fight for life," Belgrade-based B92 quoted Jovanovic as saying.
Software glitch causes thousands of Macedonians to go unpaid
Macedonian workers and employers raised an uproar after a clumsily introduced software system caused many workers to go unpaid in January.

Anger and confusion surged in Macedonia this month as the botched introduction of Public Revenue Office (PRO) software for the "gross salary" system left thousands without pay for all of January.
Among them were the two leading presidential candidates.
According to the daily , Georgi Ivanov and Ljubomir Frckoski, the candidates of the ruling VMRO-DPMNE and the opposition Social Democrats, respectively, had not received their December and January salaries as of early February.
Both teach law at the University of Skopje.
Besides day-to-day expenses, Macedonians had debts to pay and interest payments to fear, while having no money in their pockets.
Local media estimated about 600,000 residents owed an average of 1,800 euros to banks in November 2008, leaving them vulnerable to penalties for overdue payments.
The situation cleared up somewhat by mid-February, although it was still far from ideal. As of February 15th, the PRO reported that of the approximately 60,000 registered employers in the country, 42,060 had paid their workers' insurance premiums and salaries.
The government introduced the new system in an effort to improve transparency, believing it would force employers to pay their mandatory contributions to their workers' pensions and health insurance, since those who failed to make those contributions and pay salaries by the 15th of the month would face fines as high as 2,000 euros and even the seizure of their businesses by the PRO.
Given the system's chaotic roll-out, the government did not enforce such threats and imposed relatively low penalties on the approximately 5,000 businesses that failed to submit even estimates of their obligations by February 15th.
Finger-pointing was widespread.
The finance ministry blamed employers for submitting their January payroll estimates late.
Numerous companies also failed to verify the compatibility of their accounting software with that of the PRO in time.
On the other hand, angry executives contended that the inflexible PRO software blocked entire companies' payrolls if even one employee's salary information was remiss.
A failed February 11th no-confidence vote in parliament cited the salary fiasco as one of its justifications, and the nation's largest labour union demanded Finance Minister Trajko Slaveski's resignation.
The government, though, defends the introduction of the technology.
Deputy Prime Minister Zoran Stavreski described the system as "worthwhile, sustainable and transparent", while contending "almost all European countries" already have it.
Stavreski said the government would iron out the glitches as they occurred.

As part of a sweeping military reform, the Serbia-Montenegro Army plans to cut more than 9,000 jobs this year.
Given high unemployment, the move could put additional pressure on the government to improve the economic outlook.

Serbia-Montenegro will downsize its military by 9,300 people this year as part of its efforts to adjust to NATO standards, the defence ministry's office of public relations said Sunday (29 May).
A total of 1,400 professional soldiers and 5,300 civilians will be released in Serbia, while in Montenegro the number of professional soldiers and civilians will be reduced by 1,800 and 800, respectively.
The downsizing will be gradual, the ministry said, adding that the first stage would include the early retirement of a number of people, followed by the privatisation of a number of compounds.
At the beginning of April, 4,200 civilians and 1,300 officers were dismissed in Serbia as part of a sweeping army reform. By 2010, the size of the Serbia-Montenegro Army will be slashed from 77,900 to 39,722.
According to Serbia-Montenegro Defence Minister Prvoslav Davinic, the downsizing is in line with an agreement between the Serbian government and the IMF -- which set the reduction of army personnel as a condition for further support of reforms.
Davinic said the Serbian Finance Ministry cut funding for 6,500 people from the army budget in January.
"Those who have not been dismissed have been receiving salaries from the budget, putting an additional strain on it," Davinic said.
The reform is a painful one, since Serbia is plagued by a high unemployment rate.
Official data suggests that out of 8 million people in Serbia, 800,000 are not working.
The government and the army have no specific social programme for those dismissed, and no new jobs have been found for them.
Upon leaving the army, the dismissed receive a year's salary -- between 4,000 and 6,500 euros.
Those who applied for voluntary redundancy get an additional 20 per cent.
A representative for the dismissed civilian employees, Vladimir Stanimirovic, says the state has failed to protect his clients, because they have no one to appeal to except the defence ministry, which dismissed them in the first place.
Stanimirovic said he will address international institutions and courts in hopes that "decisions on dismissals will be overturned".
Of all the army employees dismissed so far, only 270 have appealed to the military commission; five have been brought back to work.
In addition to military downsizing, this year is also expected to see restructuring at major state-owned companies -- a process that will also result in dismissals.
As a result, social pressure on the government will likely increase.
EULEX, Belgrade officials discuss Kosovo rule of law
EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon visited Serbia this week to discuss the Mitrovica court system.
The EU mission denies claims by Belgrade that it is forming a task force to handle customs, justice and police matters in northern Kosovo.

Yves de Kermabon, the head of EULEX, met with Belgrade officials on Wednesday (March 3rd) to discuss strengthening the rule of law in Kosovo.
De Kermabon met with Serbian Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic and State Secretary Slobodan Homen to discuss ways to get courts in Mitrovica functioning again.
"Both parties agreed that the discussions, which concentrated on improving the rule of law situation in Kosovo, were frank, positive and constructive," said EULEX in a press release.
"The aim was to find functional solutions in the field of justice, police and customs that can be acceptable to all communities."
EULEX confirmed that "a number of confidence-building measures were discussed" and "follow-up meetings, especially in the justice field" will take place to achieve "functional solutions".
"It was agreed that there was an urgent need to improve the rule of law situation in the north of Kosovo and that the best way forward was to find pragmatic solutions," the EU mission said.
According to Bogdanovic, the EU mission does not support the plan for Serb-dominated northern Kosovo.
The proposal -- conceived by the International Civilian Office in Kosovo (ICO) and the Kosovo government -- envisions the integration of the northern part of the country and the dissolution of parallel structures there that are supported by Belgrade.
"De Kermabon said that EULEX and the EU will not support violent or imposed solutions in northern Kosovo," Belgrade based RTV B92 quoted Bogdanovic as saying Wednesday, after the meeting.
Earlier this month, de Kermabon told the Belgrade daily Vecernje Novosti that the ICO plan is not a EULEX strategy.
"We believe that progress in northern Kosovo can only be achieved through dialogue, step by step," he said.
Bogdanovic said discussions centred on the formation of a joint EULEX/Serb government "work group that will deal with technical questions in the sectors of customs, justice and police".
But EULEX denied on Wednesday any agreement on such working groups.
"No agreement was made on setting up working groups in the field of customs, justice and police," the mission said. "The meetings focused almost entirely on normalisation of the work of the court in Mitrovica."
Homen told the Serb media that "there was discussion on the need to process war criminals, the importance of the fight against organised crime, and the exchange of documents, which has been stalled for two years."
"We once again expressed our readiness to process war crimes, but said that we need EULEX's help in that," Belgrade's B92 quoted Homen as saying.
Before the meetings with de Kermabon, Bogdanovic was quoted by Serb media as saying certain topics would be unavoidable.
He cited "legislation in northern Kosovo, then the implementation of police protocol in matters of customs and the flow of goods and capital between the two administrative lines".
EULEX did not confirm that any of this was discussed.
Bulgaria hopes to join euro zone by mid-2013
A prerequisite for entering the euro zone is joining the Exchange Rate Mechanism II.
Bulgaria plans to apply in November.
(Reuters, AFP, DPA, Novinite, BNR, Dnevnik - 03/08/09; Bloomberg, Dnevnik, BNN - 31/07/09)
Bulgaria may adopt the euro in four years. [File]
Bulgaria may be able to enter the euro zone by the middle of 2013, Finance Minister Simeon Djankov told Sofia-based daily 24 Chasa in an interview published on Monday (August 3rd).
"We have a chance to adopt the euro in the last year of the [government's four-year] mandate," he said.
A former World Bank chief economist, Djankov also serves as deputy prime minister in the cabinet of the centre-right Citizens for the European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), which was sworn in on July 27th.
Prior to introducing the euro as its official currency, Bulgaria must first join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism II (ERM II), a two-year currency stability test for hopefuls, currently comprised of 16 EU members.
Sofia plans to submit an application for participation in November, Djankov said last week.
"There is great uncertainty about what happens in the whole region in terms of the financial crisis," Bloomberg news agency quoted him as noting. "It doesn't affect our application, but may affect the speed with which it is considered."
Djankov believes Bulgaria will fulfil the official criteria for euro zone membership by the end of the year.
The main task now, he noted, is to keep the deficit below 3% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the euro zone limit.
"We are currently at 2.2-2.5% (budget deficit) ...
If the deficit exceeds 3.0%, it will put off our euro zone entry by two more years," Reuters quoted him as saying.
Djankov also forecast that inflation rates will continue to drop to an annual average of 2.8% this year, down from 3.7% in June.
In 1997, Bulgaria was hit by a severe economic and financial crisis that led to a sharp drop in GDP and personal incomes, a collapse of the country's banking sector and major foreign exchange problems.
After several months of chaos, the country adopted a currency board arrangement, under which the lev was pegged to the euro at a fixed rate of 1.95583.
Bulgaria's entry into the ERM II may allow the lev to fluctuate by as much as 15% around this central rate.
Djankov and central bank officials have said however that the peg will stay unchanged until Bulgaria joins the euro zone.
Stressing that there is no pressing need for Bulgaria to request an IMF loan, Djankov noted however that Sofia intends to seek the Fund's involvement in analysis of the budget for the rest of the year and especially for 2010.
"The IMF analysis can quickly be used for a possible loan in 2010, if it becomes obvious that the 2010 budget cannot be done just with the cuts," he said.
EULEX, Belgrade talks trouble Kosovo
Concerns have been growing in Pristina about the recent dialogue between EULEX and Belgrade.
By Besa Beqiri for Southeast European Times in Pristina --04/08/09

Belgrade said on Monday (August 3rd) that talks between Serbia and EULEX are ongoing. "
After two meetings held in Belgrade, negotiations with EULEX regarding the courts in Kosovo will be continued, and there will be talks on the possibility of Serb judges and prosecutors continuing to work," said Serb Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic.
His statement comes after Kosovo Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci sent a letter to EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon last month, asking for clarification on the organisation's intent to sign three protocols with Belgrade in the fields of justice, police and customs.
"I would ask you please to take into consideration that I have not seen the drafts of those protocols and I have not been officially informed from the EULEX mission that such discussions have been done with the institutions of Kosovo," said Kuci's letter.
In response, de Kermabon met with Kuci to discuss the issue.
"He [de Kermabon] guaranteed me that EULEX has not done and it does not have the right to make negotiations on behalf of Kosovo institutions," said Kuci.
"EULEX does not negotiate with Belgrade," said de Kermabon in a press release.
"There have been technical meetings with Belgrade, Tirana, Skopje and Podgorica to fight organised crime, trafficking and to improve the exchange of information in the fields of justice, customs and police."
Talking to Albanian TV station Top Channel, Pieter Feith, EU special representative in Kosovo, said he was informed about the EULEX-Belgrade talks, as were Pristina officials.
"Everything is being done in full transparency.
De Kermabon is in continuous contact on this issue with the deputy prime minister.
I am sure that the conclusion will be that this is in full accordance with the position of the Kosovo authorities," said Feith.
Kuci fired back, as quoted by Kosovo daily Zeri, saying, "Contacts with Belgrade are not the same as contacts with Tirana.
Pristina pays attention to the contacts somebody keeps with Belgrade, which are related to Kosovo.
We should also admit the fact that it is a psychosis, a trauma, laying everywhere among us related to such contacts; and Mr. Feith and others should know that even private visits to Belgrade have a meaning for the local representatives and the international representatives working in Kosovo."
Romanian Car Market Is Booming
In the first quarter of this year, Romanian car dealers sold more vehicles than ever before.
The unprecedented increase is being attributed to the new flat tax, as well as economic growth.
By Razvan Amariei for Southeast European Times in Bucharest – 06/05/05
Romanians bought more than 24,000 Dacias, a 128 per cent increase from 2004. [File]
On 29 December 2004, just one day after being sworn in, the new Romanian government decided to radically change the tax system. Since 1 January, profit taxes have been reduced from 25 per cent to 16 per cent, and the graduated income tax was replaced with a 16 per cent flat tax.
Both employees and business executives suddenly realised they had more money to spend -- and auto showrooms have been a favourite destination.
"I now earn almost 200 euros more each month. I can afford the payments for a 15,000-euro brand new car," explained Stefan Petru, an IT specialist from Bucharest.
"I was planning to buy five new cars for my company.
But the new taxation system will allow me to get two more," said Marian Albu, the owner of a real estate agency.
More than 56,000 vehicles (about 48,300 cars and 8,000 commercial vehicles) were sold in Romania in the first quarter of the year, at a total of 600m euros.
The figure sets a record, representing a 62 per cent increase compared with the first three months of last year.
About 32,000 of these cars were locally produced brands -- including more than 24,000 Dacias, a 128 per cent increase from 2004.
Another 24,000 were imports, the preferred brands being Renault, Skoda, Volkswagen and Peugeot.
While the flat tax largely explains this unprecedented buying spree, last year's 8 per cent economic growth rate (expected to be about 6 per cent this year) probably also played a role.
The 10 per cent appreciation of the national currency exchange rate to the euro and US dollar made cars more affordable too, as their prices are fixed in foreign currencies.
Dacia sales were helped by the launch of the new Logan model, manufactured by the Dacia Renault factory in Pitesti, a city of 150,000 people.
The Logan's release gave a powerful boost to the domestic production industry.
Local factories, which produced 26,500 cars from January to March 2004, registered an 82 per cent rise in production during the same period this year.
Exports experienced the most impressive growth, from 3,100 to 10,500 -- a 233 per cent increase.
However, the high demand has also created headaches for dealers.
There are too many clients for a limited number of personnel and showrooms, as well as a limited number of cars.
"When the sales over-run the forecast up to 20 per cent, it is not a problem, but if the difference reaches 40 per cent or even 50 per cent, the delivery time for a car might be longer than 30 days," said Radu Cristian, commercial manager of Peugeot dealer Trust Motors.
The boom has defied predictions that growth in 2005 would be a moderate 10 per cent to 15 per cent.
Last year had been the best ever for the Romanian auto market, with more than 180,000 vehicles sold.
If the first quarter trend continues, however, nearly 300,000 will have been sold by the end of 2005.
ICTY Sentences Kosovo Albanian for Contempt
A Kosovo Albanian was sentenced to four months in prison on Thursday after the UN war crimes tribunal found him guilty of interfering with a witness in the case against three former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army.

The UN war crimes tribunal on Thursday (5 May) sentenced a Kosovo Albanian to four months in jail for contempt.
However, the court freed him because the time he has already spent in detention exceeds the length of his sentence.
Beqa Beqaj, 51, was indicted in October on charges of "contempt, attempted contempt and incitement to contempt" of the UN tribunal.
Prosecutors alleged that on six occasions between June and October 2004, Beqaj interfered with a witness and a potential witness, referred to as B1 and B2 respectively, in the case against former Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) members Fatmir Limaj, Haradin Bala and Isak Musliu.
In doing so he "knowingly and wilfully interfered with the administration of justice by threatening, intimidating, offering a bribe to or otherwise interfered with witnesses or potential witnesses…" in the case against Limaj and the others, the indictment read.
Beqaj is a relative of Musliu.
The UN tribunal has indicted the three former KLA members on counts of crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war in connection with the 1998-1999 conflict in Kosovo.
They have been charged with murder, torture and inhuman acts allegedly committed against Serb and Albanian civilians held in a KLA prison camp in Lapushnik, eastern Kosovo, in 1998.
The three-member trial chamber, presided over by Judge Amin El Mahdi, ruled Thursday that there was no evidence supporting the allegations that Beqaj threatened and intimidated the two witnesses, nor that he offered a bribe to witness B1.
According to a summary of the chamber's judgment, published on the tribunal Web site, the judges also found no evidence supporting the allegations that Beqaj "interfered with the administration of justice in relation to the potential witness B2".
"The chamber is satisfied, however, that there is evidence which establishes beyond reasonable doubt that the accused wilfully and knowingly interfered with witness B1 and the administration of justice and that that conduct constitutes contempt of the tribunal," the summary read.
A survivor of an alleged massacre at the Lapushnik prison camp, tortures and two assassination attempts, witness B1 has already testified in the case against Limaj and, together with his family, is now in a witness protection programme.
The judges considered this as an aggravating circumstance, as Beqaj's offence was committed at a moment when the witness was particularly vulnerable.
The judges described as mitigating factors Beqaj's six children, his lack of a criminal record and his co-operation with The Hag
Taking into consideration all arguments and the evidence presented during the trial, the judges found Beqaj guilty only on the count of contempt.
He was acquitted of incitement to contempt the tribunal, while the charge of attempted contempt was dismissed.

Serbia tobacco action plan leads to CEFTA ratification in September
After adopting an action plan to regulate domestic tobacco laws earlier this year, Serbia has now cleared the way to ratify the CEFTA treaty with the rest of the region.
By Davor Konjikusic and Georgi Mitev-Shantek for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 06/06/07
The main goal of CEFTA is to develop economic relations among member countries. [CEFTA]
The Serbian Economy Ministry announced earlier this week that the country would ratify the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) in September, ending its status as the only country in the region not to have done so.
Serbian State Secretary at the Ministry of Economy and Regional Development Jasna Matic said on Monday (June 4th) that with the removal of the obstacles between Serbia and Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia -- which included import and export taxation -- Parliament can adopt the bill needed to ratify the agreement.
According to the agreement, CEFTA's main goal is to "establish a free trade area by gradual liberalisation of mutual trade relations, and by the removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade during a transitional period."
"By becoming a member of CEFTA, Serbia will benefit the most from a so-called diagonal accumulation principle that enables privileged export regime into the EU market of goods produced in more than one of the CEFTA member states," Matic said.
In light of the export market, the CEFTA members -- Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro and Kosovo -- have agreed to the Serbian government's action plan for the tobacco industry, which was adopted in March.
The plan envisions equalising the excise duty on domestic and foreign cigarettes from January 1st, 2008, increasing the customs duty from 15% to 57.6%, and will run from 2008 to 2012 to regulate relations between the state and the tobacco industry.
The document aims to improve the agricultural tobacco industry, increase exports of tobacco products and improve agricultural tobacco production.
The plan abolishes discriminatory excise taxation, providing the same treatment for domestic and foreign brands of cigarettes.
It also eases the present obligation to buy domestic tobacco -- companies can purchase up to 20% of their tobacco from abroad.
Tobacco factories in Serbia are satisfied by the move, saying it encourages continued investment in Serbia.
Eugenio Sidoli, general manager of the DIN cigarette plant in Nis, owned by Philip Morris, said the plan will be more costly to cigarette makers, but the costs will be offset by the introduction of market conditions and business policy changes.
"The aim is to earn a considerable excise revenue profit by 2012, as there should be an increase of the export in the tobacco industry, and encourage farmers to grow larger tobacco quantities and manufacture better tobacco leaves," Minister for Economic Affairs Milan Parivodic said.
Since 2003, four tobacco companies have invested about 1 billion euros in Serbia's tobacco industry.
Parivodic said the plan allows the ratification of CEFTA, and lets the country open negotiations on joining the World Trade Organisation.
No-confidence motions, calls for governments to resign in four Balkan nations
Opposition parties in Bulgaria and Serbia called on Tuesday for their governments' resignations, as Macedonia's Social Democrats filed a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski's cabinet.
The Romanian government will also face a no-confidence vote next week.

After two failed attempts, Romania's Democratic Party (PD) filed a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu's minority government on Monday (June 4th), while Macedonia's main opposition party made a similar move on Tuesday, in a bid to topple the ruling conservatives.
"The government has shown serious weaknesses on the issues where mistakes are not allowed ... particularly concerning interethnic relations," the AP quoted Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia spokesman Jani Makraduli as saying. "The lack of political dialogue has stalled the country's progress towards Euro-Atlantic integration."
The party's no-confidence motion, he said, was prompted by the inability of Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski's governing coalition to find a way out of the months-long political crisis, and by its failure to make good on promises to ensure economic revival and foreign investment growth.
With the ruling VMRO-DPMNE-led coalition controlling 68 of the 120 seats in Parliament, Gruevski said he had no fears that his government would survive the no-confidence vote, which is expected on Thursday.
His Romanian counterpart will face a similar test Monday, when the country's lawmakers are expected to vote on the no-confidence motion filed by President Traian Basescu's former party, amid the country's continuing political crisis.
In a surprise move Tuesday, Basescu sent out invitations for fresh consultations on choosing a new prime minister and a new government made up of Tariceanu's National Liberal Party (PNL), the PD and the Liberal Democratic Party.
Basescu wants the talks to be held Friday.
A senior PNL member described the president's proposal as "a trap", as the suggested coalition formula would produce another minority government, effectively leading to the early elections Basescu has been advocating.
Meanwhile, the opposition Social Democratic Party is expected to decide Friday whether it will join Tariceanu's cabinet, or whether it will file a separate no-confidence motion against the government, following their refusal to support the one submitted by the PD.
In Serbia, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica is also likely to face a no-confidence vote, the country's ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS) suggested on Tuesday, as it accused the government of "deceiving the public" about the circumstances behind the arrest of UN-indicted war crimes fugitive Zdravko Tolimir last week.
SRS deputy leader Tomislav Nikolic, whose party opposes co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, told reporters there was evidence that Tolimir was arrested in Serbia and not in Republika Srpska, as authorities claim.
"It is obvious that Kostunica and [President] Boris Tadic's government wishes to rule Serbia with lies, deceit and have the media ready to serve them at any cost, even with the government surprising and deceiving us like this, at a time when the fate of Kosovo is at stake," Nikolic said, adding that all 81 SRS deputies had signed the proposed no-confidence motion.
It needs to be backed by at least three more lawmakers to be placed on the parliamentary agenda.
In neighbouring Bulgaria, the right-wing opposition Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) adopted a declaration Tuesday, calling for the immediate resignation of the country's ruling three-party coalition, describing it as "harmful" to the nation.
UDF urged the other opposition parties in Parliament to back the move.
Meanwhile, one of the parties in the three-way coalition, the National Movement for Stability and Progress (NDSV) -- formerly the National Movement Simeon II party -- is facing a major crisis in the wake of a controversial congress Sunday.
In addition to the open split among delegates on whether the Liberal Party should leave the Socialist-led coalition, which its leader firmly opposes, the forum also sparked allegations that the election of a new executive body had been manipulated.
Turkish Parliament Aims to Reform Media
Amid allegations of corruption among the press, the Turkish Parliament may consider new legislation aimed at reforming media activities.
By Fatih Baran for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 12/08/03
With renewed attention being focused on the Turkish media, parliament is considering new legislation aimed at tackling the problem of corruption in the press.
Many see reining in the country's powerful media magnates as a crucial step.
"The government is preparing the new press law, taking into consideration EU standards, human rights, universal values and the needs of the country," State Minister Besir Atalay said. "The objective of the new law is to promote a more democratic, freer and more prosperous Turkey."
Editorial independence and press freedom remains a problem for Turkey, which came in 116th this year in the press freedom ranking issued by Reporters Without Borders.
That marked a decline from last year, when the country ranked 99th.
Although parliament has adopted human rights reforms, journalists continued to be arrested and sentenced to prison terms during 2003.
Critics say corruption and monopoly are the root of the problem.
Many of the country's press outlets are controlled by powerful media barons with influence over politics and ties to the banking sector.
According to the Turkish Journalists' Association, a media-politics-commerce triangle is pushing the country's press in the direction of further corruption.
There are a total of 28 national newspapers in Turkey.
Of these, 16 belong to three groups, which also control Turkey's largest TV channels.
These are the Dogan Media Group, owned by Aydin Dogan; the Sabah Media Group, owned by Turgay Ciner and Dinc Bilgin; and the Aksam Group, owned by Mehmet Emin Karamehmet.
Together, these groups control about 80 per cent of the market.
Among the country's media magnates, Aydin Dogan is the most formidable.
His group's best-known media holdings are two of Turkey's largest newspapers -- Hurriyet and Milliyet -- as well as Kanal D and CNN Turk, a joint television venture with CNN.
The group controls nearly 66 per cent of the country's advertising revenues and 80 per cent of distribution.
Dogan has become a powerful enough force in the country to affect political outcomes -- as he demonstrated in 1996, when a sustained campaign in his newspapers and TV channels helped speed the downfall of former Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan.
According to Atalay, creating a more pluralist media structure is on parliament's agenda.
The press groups, meanwhile, have welcomed the establishment of a parliamentary committee aimed at investigating the problem.
NS announces pre-election coalition with SNS in Serbia
BELGRADE, Serbia -- New Serbia (NS) leader Velimir Ilic announced on Thursday (October 28th) that his party will form a pre-election coalition with the largest opposition Serbian Progressive Party (SNS).
In an interview with Beta news agency, Ilic explained the move was prompted by the need for a strong alternative to the current government, which, he says, has failed to bring the economy out of crisis and defend Serbia's vital national interests.
Ilic called on former Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia to join the coalition as well, and help formulate a comprehensive programme to gain broad public support. (Beta, Press online, Vecernje Novosti - 28/10/10)
Macedonia a transit route for illegal migrants to EU countries
Although Macedonia does not generate large numbers of people wishing to enter the EU illegally, the country's position in the Balkans -- next to EU member Greece -- has made it an important transit point.
Illegal crossings to other countries via Macedonia have been on the rise, though the power of Macedonian authorities to stop them has also increased.
Border management has become more effective, especially now that EU candidate status offers a powerful incentive.
By Zoran Nikolovski for Southeast European Times in Skopje – 10/07/06
[Southeast European Times]
Statistics from the Macedonian Interior Ministry show a rise in the number of illegal crossings through Macedonia to EU countries, mainly via the border with Greece.
At the same time, however, the country's police are becoming more efficient.
During the first three months of this year, for example, the authorities stopped 716 people from illegally crossing the Macedonian border -- a 145 per cent increase in prevention, compared to the same period last year.
In the first nine months of 2005, a total of 1,181 attempts at illegal crossing were recorded, a rise of 21 per cent over the previous year.
The data suggests that more and more people are willing to break the law in the hope of gaining a better life in the West.
Most illegal migrants interviewed by the police cite economic reasons as their main motivation.
The migrants come from various national backgrounds, and even from different continents.
The largest number -- 1,057 last year -- are Albanians.
The data from 2005 also recorded 59 Macedonians trying to cross into Greece, along with 54 Serbians and Montenegrins, ten Bulgarians, three each from Romania, Peru and Turkey, and one each from Tajikistan, Russia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
A similar diversity of nationalities has been represented this year.
Most illegal crossings occur at the border with Greece, followed by the borders with Albania, Bulgaria and Serbia.
Behind the statistics are dramatic life stories.
The criminals who organise illegal crossings are unscrupulous, to say the least.
They charge thousands of euros, and their creativity in devising means of transport is limitless.
In a May incident, Macedonian police discovered 12 Albanian and eight Chinese nationals in a specially constructed bunker in a truck.
The passengers were squeezed into a pile of scraps and old car bodies.

A more drastic case that fortunately did not have a fatal end happened in January, when a Macedonian border patrol saved three would-be emigrants from freezing to death.
They were Albanians trying to get into Greece.
Having crossed into Macedonia legally, they were wandering around on Kajmakcalan Mountain and got caught in snowy weather.
They used cellphones to call their families, who then informed the police.
A swift rescue operation was mounted.
Greece offers the promise of jobs on orange and tangerine plantations in summer, and in the olive groves in autumn.
The pay is around 25 to 30 euros daily.
Greece is also a popular embarkation point for illegal ferry transfers to ports in Italy.
In general, police say there are three main routes to EU countries.
The first one, originating in Macedonia, is to Italy via Greece.
The second route starts in the Albanian port of Durres, with Bari as the destination, and the third is a land transit route across Balkan countries to Slovenia, Italy, Austria and -- more recently -- Hungary.
The Macedonian police have become more successful in detecting gangs of traffickers.
Much of the success, say experts, is due to the introduction of an integrated border management system.
Police have taken the job of border security from the army, and improved e-communication between the border crossings has been established.
Now that Macedonia has gained the status of EU candidate, it has a powerful incentive to boost these capabilities further.
The judicial battle against organised networks is also intensifying.
A court trial against a group of 28 people charged with trafficking migrants and vehicles is under way.
The charges were brought by the Anti-Organised Crime and Corruption Department with the interior ministry.
During the investigation process, special measures such as monitoring, recording and eavesdropping of the suspects were carried out.
According to the indictment, the group has existed since 2005 and was organised by two of the defendants.
They used trucks as their main vehicle for transport, furnishing them with special bunkers.
The fees charged ranged between 1,000-1,500 euros per migrant.
In addition to efforts by the police and courts, the ministry of labour and social affairs is carrying out a prevention project in collaboration with OSCE.
The goal is to promote improvement of ties among state-run institutions and civil society, using public information to educate people about the issue.
Experts view Macedonia primarily as a transfer zone, rather than a source zone of emigrants.The population is only 2 million, and the socioeconomic conditions as well as the country's traditions tend not to fuel a large number of migrants.
Indeed, British immigration authorities only recorded 15 cases involving Macedonian nationals trying to present themselves as asylum seekers or staying in Britain illegally in 2005.
Serbian government faces deepening rift
The Serbian government plunged into its gravest political crisis Wednesday, as the country's pro-European president and nationalist prime minster clashed over EU plans for their country and Kosovo's future.

"I deeply regret the obstruction by certain politicians in Belgrade in blocking the signature," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said. [Getty Images]
Serbia's nearly nine-month old government was brought to the brink of collapse Wednesday (February 6th), as the country's nationalist prime minister blocked a new EU deal, supported by the pro-European parties in his coalition cabinet.
Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica cancelled the government's regular Thursday meeting, which was supposed to approve the proposed interim political agreement with Brussels before its signing later in the day.
Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic has been given the mandate to sign the much more comprehensive Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU, but not the deal offered to Serbia ahead of pro-Western President Boris Tadic's re-election on Sunday.
A staunch opponent of Kosovo independence, Kostunica describes the 27-nation bloc's new proposal as a "deception" aimed at tricking Serbia into giving its consent to the province's secession.
Fearing that he would be outvoted by ministers from Tadic's Democratic Party (DS) and the G17 Plus, resulting in the EU deal being approved, the prime minister refused to call a cabinet session, insisting instead that the matter be first discussed at an emergency parliament meeting Monday.
DS member and Parliament Speaker Oliver Dulic turned down the prime minister's request, saying he would only schedule a session once the government has announced its official position on the signing of the political agreement with the EU.
Although Tadic is also opposed to Kosovo's independece, he believes that his country's future lies in the EU and has expressed support for the interim pact on political dialogue, free trade, visa liberalisation and educational exchanges.
He urged Kostunica on Wednesday to call a cabinet session, so that a common position on the issue can be reached.
"To preserve the stability of the state, it is necessary that all state institutions do their job and no one is allowed to obstruct the work of state institutions due to their party positions," Tadic said in a statement Wednesday.
"The government has to work in the interest of citizens," he added, reminding Kostunica that, under Serbia's constitution, the government is the one responsible for establishing and implementing policy.
"The work of the government of Serbia cannot depend on anyone's goodwill, nor can the parliament of Serbia replace the government of Serbia," the president said. "Everybody has its duties and authority defined by the constitution and the law."
Meanwhile, Djelic and 16 other government ministers signed a letter to Kostunica, requesting that the cabinet hold its regular meeting Thursday.
A one-sentence government statement made it clear this would not happen.
Following Kostunica's move to block the signing of the deal, Brussels said it had decided to postpone it, but that the offer would remain on the table until Belgrade is ready to sign it.
"I must also say that I deeply regret the obstruction by certain politicians in Belgrade in blocking the signature tomorrow," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said in Brussels on Wednesday, announcing the bloc's decision. "In my view they have really failed to hear the voice of the Serbian people who voted last Sunday in favour of Serbia's European future, in favour of better lives, better citizens' rights.
It is truly sad for Serbia if politicians continue to put power games ahead of their own citizens' interests."
Serbian analysts warned that the current institutional crisis could lead to the government's collapse and early parliamentary elections.
Macedonia tries to trademark popular Balkan food as national dish
Macedonia's government is seeking trademark protection for ajvar, a product found throughout the region.

Ajvar is a popular Southeast European spread made of red peppers and eggplant that differs slightly from region to region and is traditionally homemade in autumn.
While it is found in many countries, the Macedonian government is trying to trademark the product under the brand name Macedonian Ajvar.
If the trademark is granted by the Institute for Industrial Property, the brand would receive protection as a product with a certain geographic origin.
Macedonia could then seek international protection through bilateral agreements with importing countries, according to the agriculture ministry.
The Institute, however, says a Slovenian company has already tried to patent the product in Germany.
The bid failed because ajvar was deemed a generic name for a spread and thus not subject to trademark protection as one country's property.
Nevertheless, Skopje is going ahead.
"The Macedonian government is attempting to make ajvar a world-recognised product," said government spokesman Ivica Bocevski. "Branding would allow production to be standardised with the ingredients and its preparation listed on the labels.
This, in turn, will guarantee quality and competitiveness at home and on the world markets."
The government has formed a working group to draft standardised protocols for the ingredients, recipe and production.
Producers will have to comply with strict rules and deliver samples to the Faculty of Technology and Metallurgy once a year for quality control.
Macedonian authorities acknowledge that ajvar is being produced in many countries under different names.
However, in the case of "Macedonian Ajvar", they claim to be seeking protection for a traditional, local variety that has had its quality verified by state institutions.
Zagreb-Ljubljana diplomatic dispute continues
Zagreb and Ljubljana continue their battle of words over a controversial protected fishing zone.
With new EU involvement and warnings, the situation needs to be resolved, officials say.

Slovenia on Tuesday (February 5th) officially voiced opposition to the protected fishing zone (ZERP) that Croatia implemented at the beginning of the year.
The zone, which affects EU-members Slovenia and Italy, has been a major point of contention.
Despite intense discussions among diplomats and officials, no solution has been accepted by both sides.
Compounding the issue is the ongoing land dispute between Croatia and Slovenia.
Earlier this week, Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader suggested that Slovenia -- which currently holds the EU presidency -- was blocking Croatia's accession bid due to the disagreement.
According to Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa, however, Croatia has failed to meet the conditions for opening negotiations with the EU on the fisheries chapter of the acquis.
"We are not blocking negotiations on fisheries; rather it is Slovenia's understandable position," Jansa said on Tuesday.
He insisted that a mutually acceptable solution to the problem can be found.
Jansa said he is willing to meet with Sanader, but only if Italy is also involved.
"The meeting would not just be between Ljubljana and Zagreb, but it would be a meeting in the same framework as the one when the 2004 agreement was reached -- with the co-operation of the European Commission and the involvement of Italy," he told reporters.
The ZERP issue threatens to slow Croatia's EU bid at a time when it otherwise seems poised to move ahead quickly.
Hannes Swoboda, the European Parliament's rapporteur for Croatia, led a delegation to Zagreb this week.
In talks with Sanader, he said Croatia could potentially wrap up its EU accession process by the end of 2009.
Sanader said his government hopes to "complete most of the work" this year.
But as long as the dispute with Croatia continues, some negotiating chapters may continue to be blocked.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn has called on all sides in the dispute to avoid escalating tensions and instead make a serious effort to find a political solution "in a European spirit of compromise and good neighbouring relations," Rehn said on Wednesday.
Last week, Croatian President Stipe Mesic held an informal meeting with his Slovenian counterpart, Danilo Turk, in a bid to calm the situation.
They both urged their governments to settle the dispute and resolve issues in a friendly manner.
"We should welcome mutual respect and avoid statements that are negative and should not be a part of our dialogue," Turk said after the February 1st meeting.
"It must be clear that we have good relations with Slovenia, except for a few open issues," Mesic said, adding that Zagreb and Ljubljana should sit down at the table and discuss the outstanding issues.
Racism by fans prompts a UEFA warning to Croatian footballers
Croatia could face exclusion from the Euro 2008 championship in the event of new instances of racist behaviour among fans, the UEFA warned ahead of a key Croatia-England match in Zagreb on Wednesday.

The UEFA warned Croatia on Tuesday (October 10th) that it could face serious sanctions if there are new instances of racist behaviour among its fans.
"The sanctions range from a fine to points deduction to exclusion from the competition," UEFA's head of communications, William Gaillard, said ahead of a key Euro 2008 Group E qualifier between Croatia and England in Zagreb on Wednesday.
"It's clear that second-time and third-time offenders are not going to be treated at all the same way as a first-time offender."
Two months ago, around 200 Croatian fans formed a giant human swastika during their national team's 2-0 victory in a friendly match against Italy in Livorno, with many also giving Nazi salutes.
As a result, the world football governing body, FIFA, charged Croatia with bringing the game into disrepute.
The incident wasn't the first.
Racist chants were heard from supporters of the Croatian team during three of its matches at Euro 2004 in Portugal.
The team also was penalised after offensive banners were flown at a game against France.
"Sanctions will be heavier in the future," Gaillard warned.
While describing his country is a "friendly, peace-loving nation," Croatian national team coach Slaven Bilic said he couldn't rule out the possibility that black players on the English team could become targets of racist abuse.
"I can't see how we can stop it," Bilic told the British daily The Guardian on Tuesday. "How can you stop someone if he wants to shout something bad?
What can you do, cut out his tongue?
You can react after the incident but how do you prevent it from happening?
We can't have more security people than fans, so what then?"
Security measures were stepped up in Zagreb on Tuesday to prevent potential clashes between the two countries' fans, and police have been instructed to detain any troublemakers.
More than 700 guards and security personnel were being deployed at the 40,000-seat Maksimir stadium in Zagreb before the start of the key qualifier at 1700 GMT.
Groups of Croat and English fans will be separated well ahead of the entrances and again inside the stadium by a buffer zone of hundreds of empty seats.
Wednesday's match is crucial to both countries, as both fight for first place in the seven-nation Group E, including also Andorra, Estonia, Israel, Macedonia and Russia.
On Saturday, Croatia won a record tying 7-0 victory over Andorra, while England's match against Macedonia ended in a 0-0 home draw.
Opposition MP tapped as new czar of Romanian domestic intelligence
The choice of George Maior, a Social Democrat, has shaken up the political landscape in Romania and is seen as testing the limits of the ruling alliance.
By Gelu Trandafir for Southeast European Times in Bucharest – 11/10/06

George Maior was installed as the new director of domestic intelligence on Friday (October 6th), following a vote by parliament.
Previously, he had headed the Senate's Defence Committee as a representative of the opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD).
During the ceremony, Maior -- who studied at George Washington University and, as former state secretary, was involved in fruitful negotiations with NATO and the United States -- pledged that he would be guided by "the idea of total political neutrality".
At the same time, Claudiu Saftoiu, a former journalist and close ally of President Traian Basescu, was sworn in as head of Romanian foreign intelligence.
Basescu's decision to look to the opposition benches for the new Intelligence Services chief has jostled the political landscape.
Although few deny his qualifications, Maior's appointment was strongly resisted.
It tests the limits of the ruling Liberal-Democratic Alliance.
Prime Minister Colin Papescu Tariceanu's Liberals see the president's move as an act of betrayal.
The party joined forces with the ultra nationalist Greater Romania Party in opposing Maior.
Civic groups were also taken aback.
"In principle, we may agree with the decision to entrust one of the secret services to the opposition.
But the PSD is the party which, through its top leaders, already had the control of these services during most of the transition period, and did not show the political will for reform," said the Coalition of Reformist NGOs.
Moreover, the PSD itself is divided over the appointment.
The reformist "Cluj faction" to which Maior belongs has been buoyed by the decision.
But old guard Socialist leaders complain that Basescu is exploiting a PSD faction in his political battle with Tariceanu.
Basescu's aides say the choice of Maior is proof that the president does not want to make use of the secret services for political purposes.
The current decision will someday be considered a turning point in Romanian politics, they predict, saying it could establish a custom of giving the leadership of one of the secret service branches to the opposition.
Basescu also says the decision is in line with a larger goal of promoting young people with no connection to the Communist system, regardless of their political affiliation. Maior is 39, while Saftoiu is 38.
In a column for the daily Romania libera, Balkan analyst Tom Gallagher suggests the president "probably views Maior as a safe pair of hands in a delicate post.
He has pro-Western credentials and is sure to inspire more confidence in Washington than the currently suspended defence minister [Teodor Atanasiu], who is a public relations disaster for Romania."
Basescu also is seeking to gain leverage in the face of continued efforts by the Liberals to neutralise him, Gallagher adds.
Charges of misuse of foreign assistance by Macedonia quickly rebuffed
International diplomats took a dim view of claims that former European Integration Minister Radmila Sekerinska mismanaged foreign assistance.

Allegations by the new Macedonian government that its predecessor misused foreign assistance proved to be short-lived.
The claims, made last week by government spokesman Veton Ibrahimi, were vehemently denied by the former Deputy Prime Minister in charge of European Integration, Radmila Sekerinska.
According to Ibrahimi, some ambassadors had complained that foreign assistance managed by Sekerinska was being misused.
A government commission would be formed to look into the matter, and the police, finance ministry and anti-corruption commission would become involved if needed, the spokesman said.
Making unjustified accusations without investigation is ridiculous, Sekerinska responded.
She charged that the ruling VRMO-DPMNE party was attempting to discredit her and interfere with the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia ahead of a party confidence vote on former Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski.
Sekerinska is generally viewed as the most serious candidate to succeed Buckovski, who lost the confidence vote Saturday (October 7th).
Analysts say she has the potential to boost the party's ratings -- currently the worst in its history.
International officials and diplomats quickly weighed in, dismissing the allegations of mismanagement as groundless.
US Ambassador to Macedonia Gillian Milovanovich, British Ambassador Robert Chatterton Dickson and EU Special Representative Erwan Fouere all took issue with Ibrahimi's statement.
In a press release, the US embassy said it was "surprised by recent reports in the media alleging the misuse by the previous government of donor assistance, including assistance provided by the US government through USAID.
The embassy has no knowledge of such misuse and has made no such allegations."
"All USAID procurements are conducted in compliance with US government regulations, designed to make those transactions fair, transparent, and competitive.
Prior to awarding a project, implementing partners are subject to an audit of their internal controls and accounting policies and procedures.
All financial records and project activities are subject to periodic and random audits conducted by the Office of the Inspector General and independent audit firms," the statement added. Fouere said he was satisfied with the procedures used.
"The EU assistance management is the responsibility of the European Agency for Reconstruction in a fully transparent manner, and we are satisfied with what has been achieved," Fouere said.
Similar words came from the British ambassador.
"We have never had any problems with fraud or questions of misuse of our funds and we are continuing to work with the current government in the same manner with an extensive programme," Dickson said.
EU ready to resume talks with Serbia
Officials in Brussels say they expect the new Serbian government to put the country's EU accession bid back on track.

EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Monday (May 14th) that Brussels stands ready to resume talks with Serbia if its new government takes steps to co-operate fully with the UN war crimes tribunal and pushes ahead with economic reforms.
"We can revitalise Serbia's EU perspective immediately," the commissioner said on the sidelines of an EU foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels.
Parliament is expected to endorse the new coalition cabinet Tuesday evening, only hours before the constitutional deadline.
According to Belgrade-based Radio B92, Rehn will arrive in the Serbian capital Wednesday to meet the new 25-member government, which will be led by incumbent Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica of the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS).
Kostunica's previous adminstration did not include the Democratic Party (DP), led by President Boris Tadic, and instead relied on parliamentary support from the late Slobodan Milosevic's Socialists.
The new DSS-DP-G17 government, however, has a combined 130 seats in Parliament, enough to pass the reforms needed for the country's progress towards EU integration.
"We believe that not only will this government take up office, it will act effectively and get to work on necessary reforms," German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, said in Brussels on Monday.
He also reiterated the promise the EU made earlier this year, to keep its doors open to Serbia if it meets the bloc's requirement for full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, including the arrest and handover of indictees.
The Union suspended its talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Belgrade in May 2006 after Serbian authorities failed to arrest and extradite former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic to The Hague, as promised.
As part of the coalition deal, Tadic, who has pledged to take quick steps to improve his country's relations with the tribunal, will head a new panel -- the National Security Council -- which would co-ordinate the work of all security and intelligence services.
His party also will control the military services, while the DSS will control the police.
Tadic and Kostunica have also agreed that Serbia's intelligence agency BIA -- an institution with a key role in relations with The Hague tribunal -- will be headed by a person who does not belong to any political party.
"I trust the leaders of Serbia's democratic forces now realise their responsibility and choose a European future for Serbia, instead of letting the country fall back to its nationalist past," Rehn said, one day after Tomislav Nikolic, the deputy leader of the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party, resigned as parliament speaker.
According to reports, Rehn's expected visit to Belgrade on Wednesday will coincide with the signing in Brussels of a visa facilitation agreement between Serbia and the EU, which was initially scheduled to take place last week.
Diversifying energy sources essential for region, leaders say
SEE countries should find ways to reduce their dependency on imported oil and compensate for the shutdown of nuclear units in Bulgaria, participants at a summit last month agreed.

Ensuring enough energy to meet growing demand is a major problem affecting the Balkans, and leaders from the region have agreed on a common strategy to deal with it.
Meeting last month in Ohrid, leaders from seven Southeast European (SEE) countries drafted a plan aimed at stabilising the energy situation and ending frequent power shortages, and said around 30 billion euros were needed to put it into effect.
The presidents of Albania, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia attended, as did the vice president of Bulgaria and the chairman of Bosnia and Herzegovina's tripartite presidency.
Modernising the existing facilities and building new ones is a key step, the leaders agreed.
An emphasis should also be placed on gasification, since the region currently imports up to 80% of its oil, they said in a declaration issued at the end of the summit.
Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski said his country is willing to participate in the construction of a new energy source in another country, as a replacement for two recently closed units at the Kozloduy nuclear plant in Bulgaria.
Other priorities, Crvenkovski said, include better utilisation of hydro potential, boosting the supply of oil and gas pipeline and electricity transfer systems, and finding ways to make use of Kosovo lignite for the needs of Macedonia's thermoelectric plant at Bitola.
Bulgarian Vice President Angel Marin said the energy supply in the region has become more complicated following the closure of the Kozloduy units.
Serbian President Tadic, meanwhile, called for building three gas pipelines in Serbia -- towards Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary, respectively.
He also announced the construction of a large gas depot in Vojvodina.
"The region lacks financial resources, and through better regional co-operation we will create opportunities for greater foreign investment," said Croatian President Stipe Mesic.
He added that his country hopes to become an energy hub in the Balkans.
"Croatia has come a long way in working both on the Pan-European Oil Pipeline and on energy-related problems with Italy," he said.
Despite the energy strategy agreement, the Ohrid meeting was partly overshadowed by the Kosovo status issue.
Serbia's Tadic and Albanian President Alfred Moisiu argued during a press conference, with Moisiu charging Belgrade with trying to delay a settlement, and Tadic responding that Serbia had the right to defend its sovereignty.
Other leaders agreed that the issue is the one major stumbling block amid otherwise improved ties.
"Co-operation with all countries in the region is more or less good, and the region is only burdened by the pace of defining Kosovo's status," Mesic said.
Croatia Pushes for Boost in Refugee Ruturns
The return of refugees displaced by the conflict in the former Yugoslavia is a top priority.
Croatian President Stipe Mesic suggests a trilateral agreement might help.
By Natasa Radic for Southeast European Times in Zagreb - 22/05/03
Croatian President Stipe Mesic wants to speed up the refugee return process and has suggested a trilateral agreement that would be promoted by the highest ranking politicians of Croatia, Serbia-Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Once signed, the document would give a clear political signal not only to those who still need to return to their previous homes, but also to EU and NATO officials who have been emphasising the returns as a crucial issue that must resolved in the region.
More than eight years after the end of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, the governments of the countries involved are still trying to encourage refugees to return to their homes.
But there are problems: some houses have been destroyed, others inhabited by new occupants.
Immediately after the conflict, foreign governments tried to speed up the process by providing substantial financial assistance. They were involved in rebuilding, encouraging refugee returns and educating people about the benefits of reconciliation.
After the countries in the region developed their own plans to convince people to return, foreign assistance began to wane.
Although Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia-Montenegro all have expressed the desire to join the Euro-Atlantic alliances, the political establishment in Brussels clearly stated that the process of returns is a crucial issue that needs to be accomplished.
The results achieved so far are encouraging, but not substantial.
Some refugees do not want to return to their previous hometowns because they have embarked on a new life elsewhere.
Those who are willing to come back need the opportunity to restart their lives and reclaim their property.
Mesic has decided to take a leading role and persuade others to encourage the process of return by sending a clear message. His initiative has been well received.
Since their democratic transitions, the countries in the region have started co-operating more closely.
New steps towards stability and a lasting peace must be taken.
Mesic believes that now is the appropriate time to close conflict-related chapters, such as the problem of refugees, and has called for international assistance.
After negotiations are concluded, the trilateral document will be signed at a high-level meeting.
According to Mesic, the agreement should be based on common principles and values, and followed by concrete measures that would yield clear results.
Russian recognition of Georgian provinces prompts widespread condemnation
Condemning Russia's recognition of the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, international organisations and individual governments, including in the Balkans, reiterated on Tuesday their support for Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Russian President Dmitry Medvedev's decision to recognise the independence of Georgia's breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia drew widespread condemnation Tuesday (August 26th).
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer rejected the move as a "direct violation" of numerous UN Security Council resolutions on Georgia's territorial integrity that Russia itself has endorsed.
He also questioned Moscow's commitment to peace and security in the Caucasus.
Echoing his words, EU leaders also "strongly condemned" Medvedev's decision.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel calling it "unacceptable".
France, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, stressed that Moscow's move contradicts "the principles of the independence, the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Georgia" and called for a political solution.
EU leaders will discuss the situation in Georgia at an extraordinary meeting in Brussels on Monday, called by French President Nicolas Sarkozy.
The OSCE described Tuesday's decision as a violation of the principles of the 56-nation organisation, of which Russia is also a member.
Finnish Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb, the pan-European security body's current chairman-in-office, called for the immediate withdrawal of all Russian troops from Georgia, in line with the conditions of the cease-fire agreement it signed on August 12th.
While Russia has pulled the bulk of its forces from Georgia proper in recent days, it is still keeping hundreds of troops in a large buffer zone around Abkhazia and South Ossetia and at the Georgian Black Sea port of Poti.
"The international community cannot accept unilaterally established buffer zones," Stubb said.
Moscow's decision sparked criticism from its Soviet-era satellites and current EU and NATO members in Eastern Europe and the Balkans.
"This regrettable unilateral act, devoid of legal basis, could have a stronger impact on the situation in the area, as well as the outlook for the durable regulation of conflicts in the region," the Romanian foreign ministry warned.
Voicing "serious concern" over Russia's move, Bulgaria reiterated "its unconditional support for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia in its internationally recognised borders" and joined calls for the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Georgia.
EU candidates Croatia and Turkey also expressed their support for Georgia's position, as well as concern about the impact of Moscow's decision on the Caucasus.
The "fait accompli policy could create an impression that the move was aimed at avoiding talks on the future status of South Ossetia and Abkhazia" to which Medvedev earlier agreed, Croatian President Stipe Mesic said.
"Turkey is of the opinion that this conflict should be resolved through peaceful means," the Turkish foreign ministry declared.
On the other hand, Russian ally Serbia noted on Tuesday that it had warned that Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence and "the recognition of this illegal act" could set a precedent for similar acts elsewhere in the world.
Forest fires ravage Macedonia
With Macedonia's firefighting capabilities again being tested this summer, the government has not been able to deliver on plans for new equipment.

Macedonian firefighters are battling numerous forest fires that sprang up in the past week because of high temperatures and dry conditions.
The biggest is on Mount Belasica near Strumitsa.
Firefighters there have been trying to gain control of the flames for more than ten days.
So far, approximately 1,000ha of forest on Mount Belasica have burned.
In addition to the firefighting brigade, the army has been called in.
Fires are also raging in other parts of the country -- including near Bitola, Kicevo, Krusevo, Kumanovo, Radovish, Tetovo and the villages of Kuckovo and Radusha.
Nationwide, according to the government, fires have destroyed 2,622ha of forest.
According to the Centre for Crisis Management, fires around Tetovo are under control as of Tuesday (August 26th).
But a fire in the Poreche region, where the municipality of Makedonski Brod is located, has spread and now laps at the border of Jasen National Park.
Over 1,000ha have burned in this region, and the army has activated around 200 soldiers in a bid to bring it under control.
On Mount Kajmakchalan in the region of Bitola, meanwhile, a fire that originated in neighbouring Greece is still active.
To make matters worse, parts of the area are all but inaccessible.
The situation led the government to reimpose a ban on public entry into forests, initially announced in July and subsequently lifted.
Now in effect again, the restriction means anyone entering forest land must have a special permit from the ministry.
Meanwhile, the interior ministry says prosecutors are filing three cases against alleged arsonists.
It disclosed no names, though.
Some are accusing the authorities of rejecting possible firefighting assistance from Greece on political grounds.
According to the Macedonian newspaper Spic, the country used firefighting planes supplied by Croatia in 2007.
This year, even though the fire on Mount Kajmakchalan originated in Greece, Macedonia has not asked for similar aid from its neighbour.
Intense fires ravaged Macedonia last year as well.
At the time, the government pledged to buy modern firefighting equipment.
But a tender for purchasing such equipment failed.
According to Shaban Saliu, head of the Office of Protection and Rescue, the sole participating company failed to submit complete documentation.
Business: Albania's health system receives 1.2m-euro Swiss loan
Widespread reforms will take place in the Albanian health system thanks to a 1.2m-euro Swiss loan.
Also this week: the European Investment Bank approved a 380m-euro loan to boost the Bulgarian road system, and the Kosovo ministry of economy and finance will decrease taxes.

The Swiss government allocated 1.2 m euros to finance a three-year programme of reforms in Albania's health system.
The health ministry said it will focus on continued training of medical staff in order to improve health care nationwide.
Turkey's Turk Telekom announced on Monday (April 28th) that it will make a 15% public stake offering of its state-owned shares.
The IPO is the second biggest economic news in Turkey after the sale of Tekel to BAT a month ago.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) has approved a 380m-euro loan to the Bulgarian road infrastructure fund, according to an agreement signed by the government and the EIB on Wednesday (April 30th).
The entire financing for the fund is going to reach 705m euros, out of which 325m euros will be federal matching funds raised by the government.
Kosovo's ministry of economy and finance intends to decrease taxes for businesses but has warned it will take all measures against debtors, including withdrawing their debts from their bank accounts.
The ministry also said it will decrease all income taxes, with cuts expected to reach up to 50% for certain categories.
Macedonia completed the construction of a 400\kW power transmission line, which will connect its eastern border city of Stip with Bulgaria.
The line will be commissioned as soon as Bulgaria completes infrastructure projects related to the connection of the transmission systems of the two countries.
Montenegro received more than 44,000 tourists in the first two months of this year, representing an increase of 34% from last year, according to data published by the country's central bank on Wednesday (April 30th).
Officials registered 200,000 overnight stays in the country in January and February, up 47.9% from the same period a year ago.
Foreigners accounted for 66% of the country's guests.
Montenegro expects to welcome more than 1.3m tourists by the end of this year.

Limaj indicted: the political impact
A key challenger for leadership of the PDK may be out of contention as the result of a war crimes case.
Will it help or harm Prime Minister Thaci?

With veteran politician and former KLA member Fatmir Limaj under a fresh indictment on war crimes charges, speculation is mounting about the potential impact on Kosovo politics -- and, in particular, on Prime Minister Hashim Thaci's Democratic Party of Kosovo.
EULEX last week officially confirmed the indictment against Limaj and nine others.
They stand accused of torturing and killing prisoners held at a detention centre in the village of Klecka in 1999.
The case has been held up for months because of Limaj's immunity as a member of parliament, and due to political quarrels over how to handle the issue.
According to political commentator Fatlum Sadiku, an unfavourable court ruling against Limaj could also have a negative effect on Thaci during next year's presidential elections.
"His party, despite differences, is still together.
But if Limaj is sentenced, as one of the main members of PDK he will hold Thaci responsible, and leave the party, Sadiku said. "This is one of the reasons why Thaci is trying to convince other political parties to postpone the presidential elections until 2013."
According to Seb Bytyci of the Balkan Policy Institute, however, a verdict against Limaj could actually strengthen Thaci's hand, as his main rival for the party leadership would be out of contention.
"A possible arrest or guilty verdict of Limaj can have several consequences.
Regarding PDK, it may weaken its position in general.
But it may strengthen the position of Hashim Thaci within the PDK, as Limaj is seen as a rival," says Bytyci.
The delicacy of PDK's internal politics was already on display as the government and parliament grappled with the issue of immunity.
"There are two blocs in PDK, one led by Thaci and one led by [Parliament] Speaker Krasniqi and Limaj," Sadiku explained. "When the prime minister sent the immunity file to the court, despite the speaker's opposition, it was clear that the processes ahead would make the politicians angry because of the feeling that one side loses and one wins."
Meanwhile, Limaj is also under investigation for corruption, a spokesperson for the EU's justice mission confirmed to SETimes.
The allegations stem from his time as minister of transport.
The probe is "ongoing," said the spokesman, Nicholas Hawton, adding that it will take time, and a prosecutorial extension may be needed.
"A large amount of material is currently under assessment.
Noteworthy is that the KCCP (Kosovo Criminal Code of Procedure) provides the possibility for the prosecution to investigate a complex case for 18 months and, in addition, in 'extraordinary cases' to file a request for extension to the supreme court of Kosovo for a further six months.
People under investigation continue to be interviewed by EULEX prosecutors," Hawton said.
In 2003, Limaj was indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) on war crimes charges stemming from alleged abuses at another KLA detention camp, in Lapushnik.
He was acquitted of all charges.
"The Klecka case is not the same as the one for which he was acquitted in the ICTY," Hawton stressed.
Ruling party places final piece in Bulgarian presidential elections
Regional Development Minister Rosen Plevneliev, former EU Commissioner Meglena Kuneva and former Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin are among more than a dozen contenders hoping to win the October 23rd presidential election in Bulgaria.

Citizens for the European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) on Sunday (September 4th) nominated Regional Development Minister Rosen Plevneliev as its candidate for Bulgaria's upcoming presidential elections.
The 47-year-old soft-spoken technocrat is one of more than a dozen contenders hoping to win the October 23rd vote and succeed incumbent President Georgi Parvanov, whose second five-year term ends in January.
Other key presidential hopefuls include Bulgaria's first EU Commissioner Meglena Kuneva, who is running as an independent candidate and former Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin, who has been nominated for the post by the country's Socialist party.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov, the leader of GERB, officially confirmed Plevneliev's nomination at a news conference in Sofia, along with that of Justice Minister Margarita Popova as vice-presidential candidate.
The two ministers, neither of whom is a member of the ruling or any other party, will submit their resignations on Wednesday, when their replacements will be announced.
Hours before Borisov's announcement, polling agency MBMD named Plevneliev as the front-runner in the presidential race citing the results of its latest public opinion survey, noting however that Bulgaria's next president is likely to be elected in a run-off on October 30th.
The regional development minister would garner 32.7% of the vote if the elections were held today, MBMD said.
Kuneva would come out a distant second with 15.7%, ahead of Kalfin with 12.3%.
Whoever of those two would make it to the second round of the vote, Plevneliev would win, the agency believed.
Volen Siderov, the head of the ultranationalist Ataka party and the only leader of a parliamentary represented party running for the presidential post, is expected to get only 2% of the vote, well below the 21.5% he garnered in the first round of the last presidential elections in 2006.
He was then defeated in the run-off by Parvanov, who won a second term in office after taking 76% of the vote.
Krasimir Karakachanov, the leader of another Bulgarian nationalist party, VMRO, is likely to muster 2.3% of the vote on October 23rd, while Rumen Hristov, who was nominated as candidate for the presidential post by the right-wing Blue Coalition, would get 1.9%.
Controversial Bulgarian businessman Alexei Petrov, a former commando and advisor at the State Agency for National Security who was arrested in 2010 on charges of involvement in serious organised crime could get 1.5% of the vote, according to the MBMD poll.
The survey, conducted by the agency between August 29th and September 1st among 1,052 voters, also showed that about 20% of the respondents will not vote in the election.
Alpha Research also expects the GERB candidate to win the vote, but in the second round, which other polling agencies also see as inevitable.
Aside from the presidential poll, local government elections will also be held in Bulgaria on October 23rd.
Balkan countries work to round up privately held weapons, ammunition
The Balkans remains a place where guns are kept in many homes, despite ongoing efforts to disarm the public.
By Linda Karadaku for Southeast European Times in Pristina -- 05/09/11
Albanian Interior Ministry official Xhavit Shala says "The higher the level of weapons collection, the better the security parametres for citizens." [Reuters]
The statistics about gun ownership regionwide are surprising and the results can be deadly.
In Albania alone, for example, analyst Jonuz Kola estimated this summer that 6% to 9% of the population has a weapon in the home. Scores of accidental shootings occur, including that of a 9-year-old in Shkodra, who died at the hands of his 11-year-old brother on July 18th.
Xhavit Shala, an expert within the Albanian Interior Ministry notes that in 1997, a considerable amount of weapons ended up in the hands of civilians, increasing criminality: "From domestic violence to the organised crime," he tells SETimes.
The South Eastern and Eastern Europe Clearinghouse for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SEESAC) is spearheading efforts to boost national and regional capacities to control and reduce the spread and misuse of small and light weapons.
Iva Savic, project communications officer of the SEESAC Office in Belgrade, tells SETimes "De-militarisation is still considered an important task which is yet to be fully tackled by the governments in the region."
She acknowledges that today SEESAC lacks reliable and comprehensive data on the exact number of illegal weapons circulating in various countries.
But a 2007 SEESAC study concluded that "the Western Balkans, with a population of 19.6 million people, has almost 4,280,000 weapons in the hands of civilians."
In Kosovo, the daily Koha Ditore quoted a UNDP survey.
It found that out of 400,000 weapons in the hands of the citizens, 330,000 are illegal.
Mimoza Shahini, a leading Kosovo psychologist, tells SETimes, "Free access to the weapons presents a permanent danger not only for the physical safety of children ... but also plays a role in the social and moral maturity of a child.
Using weapons "increases the level of delinquency especially among young people" and offers them a means for suicide.
Those who witness gun violence, she adds, "suffer post-traumatic stress disorder".
Savic says there is a clear commitment by governments in the region to tackle the issue of illegal weapons possession.
She notes that the Croatia's interior ministry launched a nationwide awareness-raising and arms collection campaign under the slogan "Less Arms, Less Tragedies".
Such programmes, says Savic, "should help change the current gun culture in the region, encourage the voluntary return of illegal weapons and stifle the desire to acquire them in the future".
She adds that since 2007, the Croatian government has managed to collect 58,818 small arms and explosive devices, almost two million rounds of ammunition and nearly 2 tonnes of explosives from civilian homes.
Hopefully, a similar campaign will begin in Serbia within months, she tells SETimes.
In addition, in both Serbia and Croatia, there are ongoing Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) destruction campaigns.
With the assistance of SEESAC and the EU, Serbia's interior ministry destroyed 28,285 surplus and confiscated weapons in 2010 and approximately 27,000 in 2009.
Croatia's interior ministry began its campaign this year.
"So far, 30,000 weapons have been earmarked for destruction, while 7,000 have already been disposed of this year," says Savic.
To prevent further proliferation, some governments in the region are taking extra steps to secure their own storage sites through infrastructure improvements.
SEESAC is currently helping the governments of both Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina strengthen security at their SALW storage sites.
In May for example, the reconstruction of the Montenegrin ammunition storage site "Taras" was completed with the help of SEESAC and the EU.
One other option should be considered, says Savic, "In this post-conflict region, more rigorous implementation of existing laws in cases of possession of an illegal weapon would significantly aid efforts to collect illegally owned weapons."
Turkey-Israel: What's next?
Deterioration of ties poses a heightened risk for the region, analysts say.

Just hours after a UN report on last year's Gaza flotilla incident was published on Friday (September 2nd), Turkey announced it would expel Israel's ambassador to Ankara and suspended all military agreements with its former ally.
Now, relations between the two countries are "even worse than they were right after the Mavi Marmara event", says Salih Kapusuz, deputy chairman of ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), responsible for public relations.
"Our position was clear from the very beginning.
Whatever the outcome we're ready for it," Kapusuz said. "The whole world knows, as does Israel, that whatever the justification this wouldn't go unanswered."
Nine Turkish activists died on May 31st, 2010, after Israeli commandos boarded the aid ship Mavi Marmara and were met with resistance.
Friday's report by the UN found that although the action was justified under international law, Israel had used excessive force.
Ankara has demanded an official apology and reparations to the families of the victims, but Israel has so far declined.
"Israel regrets any loss of life or injuries during the incident," says Arthur Lenk, director of the Israeli foreign ministry's Department of International Law and a staff member on the UN panel.
He said his country "accepts the Panel's report and hopes Turkey will work with it on restoring their ties and improve relations in the mutual interest of both countries".
"Relations with Turkey have been, and remain, very important to Israel," he said. "Accordingly, Israel has made significant efforts to reach a bilateral agreement that would enable both countries to put the flotilla incident behind them and to improve relations."
"Now that the UN Secretary General's report is published, we hope that a compromise in such a spirit will be achieved," he added.
Alon Liel, former Israeli ambassador to Turkey, says over the past six months "apologising or not apologising" was the main issue in Israeli-Turkish relations.
"Israel decided not to apologise over one year ago and will have to live now with the results of its refusal -- a Turkish dramatic downgrading of the Turkish-Israeli diplomatic link to the rank of a second secretary, the lowest diplomatic rank in the Israeli diplomatic service."
"The damage to the Israeli-Turkish bilateral link is obvious and unavoidable," he adds.
For Hikmet Cetin, Turkey's former foreign affairs minister, "it is unfortunate that the Gaza incident is being driven to [such] a dangerous level."
"In the history of our countries there has never been such a problem.
This is the wrong path for both Israel and Turkey," he argues.
"Diplomacy needs patience and time.
Only in this way can there be a solution."
However, Cenk Sidar, managing director of Washington-based Sidar Global Advisors, believes there is no room for Turkey to make concessions.
"The ball had been in Israel's court, and it will stay there for a while," he says.
At the same time, he added, "further deterioration of Israeli-Turkish relations is an enormous risk for the region at a time of heightened and wide-spread unrest."
The current state of affairs has left leaders searching for a way out of the impasse.
Cetin says a "sharp turn" is needed with the support of international and local society.
"It also can come on a cultural level, even from football diplomacy," he mentions, pointing to the upcoming UEFA Champions League match that might be played in Istanbul between Besiktas (Turkey) and Maccabi Tel-Aviv (Israel), on September 15th.
Although it is unclear whether the Israeli team will come to Turkey, officials in Ankara pledge to show maximum hospitality.
"Politics and sports are separate," Minister of Youth and Sports Suat Kilic says. "We view this match from the perspective of sports. The Turkish people will show hospitality to anyone who comes for international contests to our country."
Ivanov inaugurated as president of Macedonia

After signing an oath in parliament, Gjorge Ivanov was inaugurated as Macedonia's fourth president Tuesday (May 12th) in Skopje.
The presidents of Albania, Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia were special guests at the ceremony and Ivanov met with each separately afterwards.
Also present were Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski and his cabinet, diplomats assigned to Macedonia, representatives of state institutions, religious communities and all political parties with the exception of the opposition Democratic Party of Albanians, reportedly because Kosovo's president had not been invited.
In his inaugural speech, Ivanov pledged to "encourage and support all political leaders … and all citizens".
The new president said his political goal was to help steer Macedonia towards NATO and EU membership.
"Macedonia continues on the path of Euro-Atlantic integration by leading a responsible foreign and domestic policy," he said.
Another priority, Ivanov added, will be to improve Macedonia's relations with neighbouring Greece.
The two have been locked in a bitter name dispute for years.
"Undoubtedly we share the same European values … and understand the Balkans as the cradle of European culture," he said.
Foreign respect, he added, is best earned at home.
"We can achieve neither a European future nor regional cooperation if we do not invest in the capacity, institutions and potentials of our country," he said.
Ivanov will spend his first full day in office in Brussels, meeting with EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana.
Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu is set to become the first head of state to visit Ivanov in Macedonia.
His trip is scheduled for later this month.
Ivanov, 49, was born in the Macedonian town of Valandovo.
Before becoming president, he was a political science professor at Sts. Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje.
Greece reiterates support for Belgrade's EU bid
ATHENS, Greece -- Serbia should join the EU as soon as possible, Greek President Karolos Papoulias said on Tuesday (June 1st), after meeting with Serbian counterpart Boris Tadic in Athens.
Papoulias stressed that Greece will continue to support Belgrade in its membership bid.
He also reiterated that efforts aimed at resolving Kosovo's status must continue, in accordance with both with international law with respect for Serbia's territorial integrity.
He and Tadic also discussed Greece's economic crisis, with Tadic expressing Serbia's solidarity.
He added that many Serb tourists plan to spend their summer holidays in Greece, providing a "small contribution to revive its economy". (Kathimerini, Tanjug, B92, ANA-MPA - 01/06/10)
Iran to ship low-enriched uranium to Turkey
Iran will ship about half of its low-enriched uranium abroad, under a swap hammered out on Monday.
But it raises red flags in some capitals.

[Getty Images]
Iran agreed to transfer much of its low-enriched uranium abroad under a deal with Brazil and Turkey, signed in Tehran on Monday (May 17th).
But the move was met with scepticism by EU, US and Russian officials, as Iran also vowed to keep its 20% enrichment programme in place -- in violation of UN Security Council resolutions.
Under Monday's agreement, signed by the foreign ministers of the three countries, Iran is to ship 1,200kg of its low-enriched uranium to Turkey within a month.
In return, no more than a year later, it will get 120kg of higher-grade nuclear fuel from a different foreign source to be used in a medical research reactor.
The swap was announced following talks among Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, over Tehran's disputed nuclear programme.
Monday's deal is based on an agreement brokered by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) last year, under which Iran was to send nearly 80% of its low-enriched uranium abroad for processing into nuclear fuel.
In October, Tehran accepted in principle the proposed accord, but then backed off from it, despite warnings that it could face new UN sanctions.
Iran's total stockpile of low-enriched uranium is believed to have grown from 1,500kg last autumn to an estimated 2,300kg today.
The Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security's David Albright said the country's current stockpile is more than twice the amount needed to produce enough material for one bomb.
Tehran's move four months ago to raise its enrichment goal to 20%, up from 3.5%, caused further concern among Western powers already worried about the true objectives of Iran's nuclear programme.
"For us, now, there are no grounds anymore for new sanctions or measures," Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told reporters in Tehran. "Iran will write a letter to the IAEA and we hope that the IAEA in Vienna will react quickly and positively so that there will be a result in a very short period of time."
But Western officials made clear they plan to continue working on new UN sanctions against Iran, saying the new pact did not go far enough.
Maja Kocijancic, a spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, said Monday's deal appeared to be "a variant" of the one brokered by the IAEA last year.
"If Iran has now accepted the IAEA proposal, this is welcome but it does not solve the fundamental problem, which is that the international community has serious concerns about the peaceful intention of the Iran nuclear programme," the DPA quoted her as saying.
"Iran's failure to engage seriously and provide reassurances about the programme and not respecting the resolutions that were adopted is the reason why we are still pursuing the sanctions resolution in the Security Council."
The White House acknowledged the efforts made by Turkey and Brazil, two non-permanent members of the Security Council, but noted that the "vague" deal should now be communicated "clearly and authoritatively" to the IAEA.
"Given Iran's repeated failure to live up to its own commitments, and the need to address fundamental issues related to Iran's nuclear programme, the United States and the international community continue to have serious concerns," White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said.
Final Kosovo Election Results Released
The final results of the 23 October parliamentary elections in Kosovo have confirmed the victory of the Democratic League of Kosovo.
Short of winning an outright majority, however, the party must now seek coalition partners.

Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) has been confirmed as winner in the province's second parliamentary elections since 1999.
As in the 2001 vote, on 23 October the party again failed to win an outright majority and must now find partners for a coalition government.
That cabinet will likely be in office during talks on Kosovo's final status, expected to begin in mid-2005.
The final results, released by the province's Central Election Commission (CEC) on Wednesday (3 November), showed that the LDK won 45.42 per cent of the vote and will retain its 47-seat representation in the province's 120-member assembly, in which 20 seats are reserved for representatives of Kosovo's minorities.
As for other main Kosovo Albanian parties, Hashim Thaci's Democratic Party of Kosovo came in second with 28.9 per cent of the vote, entitling it to 30 parliamentary seats -- four more than it won in the 2001 election.
Ramush Haradinaj's Alliance for the Future of Kosovo finished third with 8.4 per cent of the vote, winning 9 seats.
ORA, a new party founded by publisher and journalist Veton Surroi, came in fourth with 6.23 per cent of the vote and 7 parliamentary seats.
A total of six other Kosovo Albanian parties won the remaining seven of the 100 multiethnic seats in the assembly.
Twelve entities were eligible to contest the 20 seats set aside for Kosovo's minorities, the OSCE statement said Wednesday.
Of the ten seats for Kosovo Serb representatives, eight are to be taken by the Serbian List for Kosovo and Metohija and two by the Citizens' Initiative of Serbia.
The remaining 10 seats go to representatives of Bosniak, Turkish Roma, Ashkali, Egyptian and Gorani communities.
The turnout, according to the final results, was 53.57 per cent.
Nearly 660,000 of all 1.3 million registered voters took part in vote.
However, turnout among the Kosovo Serb community was less than 1 per cent.
The majority of the group's eligible voters refused to cast a ballot, following calls for a boycott from Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, other Belgrade officials and leaders of the Serbian Orthodox Church.
The international community has said it plans to launch talks on determining Kosovo's final status, provided a review in mid-2005 shows the province has made substantial progress in meeting UN-set benchmarks in areas such as the rule of law, minority rights and dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade.
Jens Modvig, deputy head of the OSCE Mission in Kosovo and acting chairman of the CEC, urged the elected representatives on Wednesday "to rapidly form a new government and, with increased vigour, continue to make progress in implementing the standards" set by the international community.
Some have voiced concern about a possible stalemate in consultations on forming a government coalition and a repetition of the situation in 2001, when it took leading parties 12 weeks to reach an agreement.
Expectations are that Rugova will seek partners from the major pro-independence Kosovo Albanian parties and that the talks will produce few major changes in the current government configuration.
Acknowledging that a certain delay was again possible, a Western diplomat told Reuters however that this time around that it would be shorter.
"It'll be weeks, rather than months.
But not too many weeks," he said.
Local papers predicted that UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen could intervene in the event no agreement is reached within 10 days
EUFOR Commander: New Force to Continue SFOR's Mandate
The commander of the EU's future peacekeeping force in BiH held his first press conference in Sarajevo on Wednesday.
He said the new force would retain SFOR's mandate and capabilities.

The commander of the EU's future peacekeeping force in Bosnia and Herzegovina, (BiH), British Major General David Leakey, held his first press conference at Sarajevo's Camp Butmir on Wednesday (3 November).
According to Leakey, the new force will retain the mandate and capabilities of the current NATO-led force, SFOR.
"There will be a seamless transition from SFOR to EUFOR and we shall build on SFOR's success," Leakey said. "EUFOR will have the same number of troops as SFOR and will have the full authority of Dayton.
In practical terms, the handover from SFOR to EUFOR means that 80 per cent of SFOR troops will merely change title and put EU insignia on their shoulders."
The transition will be carried out on 2 December, when the EU begins its military operation in BiH, code-named Althea.
It will replace the NATO operation, which has been responsible for implementing the military aspects of the 1996 Dayton Peace Accord, preventing further hostilities and stabilising the country.
EUFOR will have the same legal mandate SFOR did under the Dayton Agreement.
According to Leakey, its main tasks will be the maintenance of peace and stability in BiH, assistance with defence reform in the country and co-operation with NATO's headquarters in BiH in locating and arresting war crimes indictees.
He emphasised, however, that the main responsibility for meeting the country's obligations to the UN war crimes tribunal lies with BiH authorities.
'The fact that our two headquarters share the same building in Butmir will ease the practical mechanics of carrying out our respective missions and will guarantee our close co-operation," said Leakey. "However, I must stress that the primary responsibility to arrest war criminals still lies with the Bosnian government authorities and law enforcement agencies."
The EUFOR commander said his staff will co-operate closely with the BiH armed forces, and will support authorities in the fight against organised crime and in boosting the return of refugees and displaced persons.
The top international envoy in BiH, High Representative Paddy Ashdown, will provide political coherence among the EU military force, the EU Police Mission, the monitoring mission and community programmes to bring BiH closer to EU standards.
"This means helping BiH to transition from stabilisation to integration into the EU," Leakey said
Macedonians to Vote on Territorial Organisation
Macedonian citizens will cast their votes Sunday in a referendum on the country's new territorial organisation law.
The vote could have implications for Macedonia's bid to join Euro-Atlantic structures.

Macedonian citizens will decide between the country's new law on territorial organisation and the old 1996 law in a referendum on Sunday (7 November).
The new law -- which would reorganise the state into 83 municipalities, replacing the present 123 sectors -- is intended to implement one of the country's obligations under the Ohrid Framework Agreement.
According to international officials, the referendum also has implications for Macedonia's bid for eventual membership in NATO and the EU.
"Decentralisation is a cornerstone of the Ohrid Accord and an essential element to ensure the integration of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia into Euro-Atlantic institutions," NATO Deputy Secretary General Alessandro Minuto Rizzo said last week.
On Monday, the EU issued a statement saying it respects Macedonia's constitutional right to organise a referendum, while cautioning that a delay in decentralisation would "seriously jeopardise further progress towards the EU".
The main opposition party, VMRO-DPMNE, along with other parties that oppose the new legislation, argue that it will lead to cantonal division, federalisation of the country and separation along ethnic lines.
"The statehood is questioned here," said VMRO-DPMNE leader Nikola Gruevski. "We have a historical responsibility to protect the state against division."
Deputy Prime Minister Radmila Sekerinska, who is responsible for the country's European integration, says voter rejection of the territorial organisation law would lead Macedonia into an institutional and political crisis, and the consequence would be a delay in meeting the political criteria set by the EU.
Macedonia would lag behind in the implementation of decentralisation, or the transfer of responsibilities from the government to municipalities, for at least one year, according to Sekerinska.
Under the constitution, the results of a referendum cannot be changed for at least one year.
By law, a turnout of at least 855,000 voters is necessary for a referendum to be successful.
The ruling coalition has urged people to stay home, in the hope the vote will fail to reach the minimum turnout requirement.
Proposal to fight corruption met with scepticism in Serbia
Critics charge one of two proposed anti-corruption measures is unconstitutional.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 24/05/11

Serbia's Tax Administration recently submitted a proposal to the government that would dramatically raise the stakes for anyone considering bribery or other forms of corruption.
The measure would erase an individual's accrued seniority at work -- "stazh" -- if he or she is convicted of corruption.
"The state would make it clear it was ready to stand up to corruption and I claim that many who are considering corruption would abandon such thoughts at the very start," Tax Administration Director Dragutin Radosavljevic told the state TV, RTS.
The proposal calls for seizing a convict's property in addition to voiding that accrued seniority.
While the public agrees the fight against corruption should be intensified, many lawyers and NGOs argue the part of the proposal concerning accrued work time is unconstitutional.
They say corruption could be fought more successfully if existing laws were implemented more consistently.
"The measure is unconstitutional because it is impossible to tie an entire career to one misdemeanor of which someone had been convicted," Anti-Corruption Agency committee member Zlatko Minic told SETimes.
"[It] would probably be quickly abolished by the Constitutional Court," he added.
Others claim that there are yet more efficient ways of fighting corruption.
"Authorities should primarily focus on better encouraging and protecting whistleblowers, as well as on those that have conspicuously more property than before working in public service, and prove whether their salary enabled them to pay for such an increase," Transparency Serbia representative Nemanja Nenadic told SETimes.
But Radosavljevic argues tougher measures are necessary given corruption's grave consequences.
"One corruption affair can discredit an entire institution, sector and government and has a negative impact on the state's image," he said.
Experts say the part of the Tax Administration's proposal concerning confiscation of property makes sense.
"Such a measure is already being applied in Serbia against organised and war crimes convicts, who have to prove how they obtained the money for their property so as to prevent it from being seized," Minic said.
He notes, however, that the Tax Administration already has legal instruments with which it could check individuals' property.
"The law on tax administration and taxing process from 2002 has enabled the cross-checking of reported revenues and expenditures, and it would be interesting to see whether the Tax Administration had utilised those mechanisms before it proposed this measure.
That way, all those who were publicly suspected of corruption could have been checked and prosecuted, at least for embezzlement, but there was no evidence," Minic said.
Fighting corruption is considered a key condition for EU accession.
A Global Corruption Barometer survey conducted late last year suggests that Serbian citizens perceive an increase in corruption over the last three years.
At the same time, the rating of the government's effectiveness in fighting corruption fell from 2.38 to 2.24, prompting the cabinet to announce plans to draft a new strategy.
BiH Film Sweeps Prizes at Sarajevo Film Festival
Bosnia and Herzegovina director Pjer Zalica's film Gori vatra (Fuse) won five awards at this year's Sarajevo Film Festival, which has been working for several years to become a home for filmmakers from the region.
By Beth Kampschror for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 10/09/03
A dark comedy about venal small-town Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) officials preparing for a visit from former US President Bill Clinton by papering over prostitution, police corruption and smuggling, swept the awards at this year's Sarajevo Film Festival, bringing the focus to local and regional films -- the main goal of the nine-year-old festival.
"Honestly, I did expect this kind of reaction to the films," said producer Ademir Kenovic of the three features made in BiH in the past year.
"It's clear that these successes are not coincidences.
Now the group of young people doing short films will have a better, faster chance of doing feature films."
Director Pjer Zalica's first feature Gori vatra (Fuse) won five awards, two of which were for best regional film.
Festival organisers made this year's regional programme -- ten movies from six countries -- the festival's focal point by moving it from afternoon screenings at a local cinema to evening slots at the red-carpeted National Theatre.
Such an elegant home for regional films would have done little for local talent had the programme been short on BiH productions.
But this year has been a banner one in that regard.
Besides opening with Zalica's feature, the festival held the world premiere of Srdjan Vuletic's Ljeto u zlatnoj dolini (Summer in the Golden Valley), and showed Dino Mustafic's Remake as part of the BiH programme.
Three films released in one year is a departure for a country that produced only three films between 1992 and 2001.
But since BiH-born director Danis Tanovic won an Oscar for his film No Man's Land in 2002, local filmmakers have found that they're not as likely to be ignored by producers.
Even the government has created a film fund that helped finance Zalica's and Vuletic's films.
Financing is a problem all regional directors share.
Bulgarian director Ludmil Todorov said that his country now releases two or three features every year, compared to the 20-plus that were released annually under the Communists.
"This film has no foreign money in it," Todorov said about his regional programme film Emigrants, which was financed by the National Film Centre and state television.
"It becomes easier, but it's going very slow."
The regional programme aside, festival attendance in general was at an all-time high.
Passes sold out within an hour of online availability, and more than 1,000 people lined up for tickets when the box office opened a week before the festival.
In all, about 100,000 people watched the 162 films from 44 countries.
For now, Gori vatra's five awards is a start, as is the media circus around Pjer Zalica after he brought home an award last week from a Swiss film festival.
"You don't make a film to get an award," Zalica told the Sarajevo weekly Dani after winning the Locarno Film Festival's Silver Leopard.
"But there's no making films without them.
It would be good if this starts to raise awareness that money invested in film can come back."
Military promotions put Turkey at a crossroad
As Turkey's government blocked the appointment of key military commanders, observers are divided over whether the move signals a triumph for democracy or a shift towards autocracy.

Turkey's Islamic-rooted government won a victory this week in its simmering power contest with the country's secular military.
Following a four-day meeting of the Supreme Military Council, the two top army posts remain empty after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan blocked the promotion of senior officers implicated in alleged plots against the government.
In Turkey, which has suffered four military coups in the past 50 years, the army has been virtually free of civilian oversight, with military appointments merely rubber-stamped by politicians.
However this year, Erdogan refused to approve the army's choice for head of land forces, General Hasan Igsiz, after the officer was summoned to give evidence in an investigation into a plot to discredit the government using Internet propaganda.
According to some observers, the result of the week-long standoff surrounding the summit marks a victory for civil democracy.
But opponents of the ruling Justice and Development Party say the government used underhand tactics to weaken the army in a bid to pave the way for an Islamic dictatorship.
"We have two sides of the coin," Yusuf Kanli, a political commentator aligned with the secular opposition, told SETimes. "On one side, there it's a major step for Turkish democracy because for the first time the civilian government is saying, 'I'm not a spectator, it's my responsibility and I will make the decision'."
"But on the other hand, they played dirty to strengthen their hand.
The government isn't doing this to contribute to Turkish democracy, it's doing it to stop people it doesn't want appointed to key positions."
Igsiz was one of 18 senior officers summoned to give evidence regarding the alleged Internet propaganda plot.
General Isik Kosaner, the current commander of land forces, was slated to replace General Ilker Basbug, who is due to retire from the top post of Chief of Staff on August 30th.
However, Kosaner's appointment was also held up as the deadlock over Igsiz continued.
Also omitted from the promotions list were 11 other officers who have been served with arrest warrants over an alleged plot to overthrow the Islamic-leaning government in 2003.
The supposed coup plan, code-named Sledgehammer, was revealed by the Taraf newspaper in February, and would have involved bombing mosques and provoking military tensions with Greece to create instability as a pretext for a military takeover.
In total, 102 officers were issued with arrest warrants last month over the plan, which the army claims was part of a military training seminar simulating a situation of internal unrest.
"In all these issues, there are criminals involved, but at the same time the government is exploiting the issue to silence its critics.
In this country, we have to ward off military dictatorial ambitions.
But it's civilian dictatorial ambitions that are more dangerous," Kanli said.
"It's certainly a step forward by democracy, but the problem is that the government is despised by some sections of society who traditionally see the military as the ultimate guardians of their interests," Mustafa Akyol, liberal Islamic commentator for the Star newspaper, said.
"It's time for them to learn to do politics without relying on the military.
Turkey isn't a dictatorship.
There's opposing media and opposing parties.
The military should simply have no role."

The Sarajevo Film Festival's 16th edition, which was held from July 23rd to 31st, faced the looming dark cloud of recession over Europe – a situation which gave organisers added motivation to make the event a success.
"Our aim was to renew BiH cinematography and create an atmosphere for development of young filmmakers who will connect with their European colleagues and the world.
I think that we have fully achieved that and more.
People come here, work and develop their projects.
This is no longer a festival where movies are merely watched, but are also made," festival director Mirsad Purivatra told SETimes.

Operation Storm: 15 years later
Croatia's independence war ended with Europe's biggest land offensive since World War II.
As happens every year, Croatia and Serbia expressed sharply contrasting views of the event's significance.

Croatian political dignitaries gathered in Knin on Thursday (August 5th) to commemorate the 15th anniversary of Operation Storm, the military action that ended the war in Croatia.
Since 1995, the anniversary has been celebrated in Croatia as Victory and Homeland Thanksgiving Day.
Speaking at the ceremony, Croatian President Ivo Josipovic focused as much on Croatia's future as on its past.
He called for renewed attention to the country's social needs.
"There should be no one hungry in Croatia, no youth without perspective or without the chance of a proper education, and all disabled persons should have the chance to attend a rehabilitation programme, receive the opportunity to work and enjoy a normal life," he said.
Operation Storm is a bitter point of contention between Croatia and Serbia, and Josipovic, who has worked to boost diplomatic ties, was clear about where to place the blame for conflict that consumed the Balkans during the 1990s.
It was former Yugoslav strongman Slobodan Milosevic's policies which brought evil to the region, to Croatia and Serbia and to all the people living in the area, he said.
"Our victory is honourable and does not give anyone the right to retaliate," he said.
Croatia's prime minister, Jadranka Kosor, said that as a NATO member and soon-to-be EU member, Croatia wants the region to become an example of stability and peace.
She also adamantly defended the 1995 operation.
"It is an historical fact that Croatia was brutally attacked and that the tanks came from Serbia," Kosor said. "They destroyed Croatian towns and killed Croatian soldiers and civilians.
We will not allow revision of the historical facts, not concerning any topic and especially not concerning the military actions that liberated Croatia for good."
"We had the right to defend our country in the name of the future of our children," she said. "We will celebrate Operation Storm because that is how we celebrate victory and peace." The view from Belgrade remains starkly different.
On Wednesday, Serbian President Boris Tadic met with families of missing persons, and said "the crimes cannot be forgotten".
Operation Storm was a large scale action that lasted 84 hours and amounted to the biggest European land offensive since World War II.
It started early on August 4th 1995, and ended with Croatia regaining control of areas occupied by Serb separatists since 1991.
While the victory was decisive, it also had a human cost.
According to UN sources, between 150,000 and 200,000 people fled the area as a result of the operation.
Croatian sources narrow the number to 90,000 refugees, while Serbian sources claim between 200,000 and 250,000 Serbs were displaced.
The number of civilian deaths is also disputed.
The Croatian Helsinki Committee says 116 people were killed, while the Serbian NGO Veritas puts the number at 1,200.
At the same time, 184 Croatian soldiers died and 1,430 were wounded.
Turkish Military Chief: Country Losing Say in Iraqi Reconstruction
The head of Turkey's military has cautioned that Ankara's decision not to deploy troops in Iraq is leaving it without a say in its neighbour's political reconstruction.
(The New York Times - 10/11/03; Reuters, AFP - 09/11/03; BBC, Reuters, FT, VOA, Anadolu Agency - 07/11/03)
Ankara's decision not to send troops to Iraq is leaving Turkey without a say in its southern neighbour's future political development, the chief of the Turkish General Staff has warned.
"Currently we do not know what shape Iraq will take ... We have no say since we are not there," General Hilmi Ozkok was quoted as saying in an interview with the liberal Radikal daily, on Sunday (9 November).
The general's words followed an official Turkish Foreign Ministry statement on Friday, announcing Ankara's decision not to deploy troops in Iraq for the time being.
The move was agreed on during a telephone conversation between Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul and US Secretary of State Colin Powell late Thursday, reports said.
The Turkish government's earlier decision to contribute troops to the US-led peacekeeping forces in Iraq was approved by parliament in early October, but met with fierce opposition from the Iraqi Governing Council and Iraqi Kurds.
Turkish public opinion was also against the plan to send troops.
"We said from the beginning that we were not too eager anyway," the BBC quoted Gul as saying on Friday. "We had said we would send [troops] if our contribution would be of use.
We saw that this is not the situation.
That's why we made this decision."
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher voiced Washington's regret Friday over the change of plans, but said the bottom line was to ensure stability in Iraq.
"There is recognition, I think, on all our parts -- the United States' side, Turkish as well as the Iraqis -- that maybe this deployment at this time would not add to that goal in the way that we had hoped it would," Boucher said.
In Ankara, Gul said the situation in Iraq remained very dynamic "and we will determine our attitude according to conditions".
Ozkok echoed his words, saying that Turkey would follow developments closely since instability in Iraq would directly affect his country.
Turkey has voiced concerns that the Kurds in northern Iraq could take steps towards independence, potentially rekindling the separatist ambitions of ethnic Kurds in Turkey's southeast.
"Terrorist activities are on the rise," the Agence France Presse quoted Ozkok as saying.
"If Iraq becomes a source of terrorism, that would be of close interest to us ...
If Iraq is divided and there is a formation in the north, that would affect us very much," he added.
Ozkok also ruled out withdrawing about 1,500 Turkish soldiers positioned in northern Iraq.
"Our forces there show our determination, they show how much that region affects us," the general said. "There has been no development to change this, therefore our forces will remain there."
Bulgaria "disappointed" by loss of EU funds
The European Commission decided on Tuesday to cut Bulgaria's access to 220m euros in EU funding, citing Sofia's persistent failure to tackle corruption and organised crime.
(Euobserver, EurActiv, FT, Times - 26/11/08; AFP, Reuters, AP, DPA, BBC, International Herald Tribune, Euobserver, BNT, Sofia Echo, Dnevnik, Mediapool, News.bg, Focus news Agency - 25/11/08)
"We have to play by the book and respect the rules of financial management," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said. [File]
The European Commission (EC) took an unprecedented step against an EU member state Tuesday (November 25th), depriving Bulgaria of 220m euros in funding for its persistent failure to tackle corruption and organised crime.
It also warned Sofia that it could lose a further 340m euros, unless it takes urgent action.
In July, the EC froze nearly 500m euros in aid to Bulgaria, citing continuing weaknesses in the country's control systems and cases of fraud and irregularity in a damning report.
It also withdrew the accreditation of two government agencies handling funds under the PHARE pre-accession programme -- one under the finance ministry and the other under the regional development ministry.
The EU has suspended a total of more than 800m euros in aid to Bulgaria since it joined the bloc in January 2007.
Of that, 560m euros come under the PHARE programme, including the uncontracted 220m euros now irretrievably lost.
Sofia could see the remaining 340m euros of contracted but unpaid aid by the end of 2009, if the EC decides to restore the two implementing agencies' accreditation before that.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn told reporters Tuesday that the EC was still unable to do that, as recent reviews had revealed new irregularities in addition to those outlined in the July report.
"As they say, the man's gotta do what the man's gotta do," Rehn said in Brussels. "We have to play by the book and respect the rules of financial management."
Announcing the EC's decision earlier Tuesday, commission spokeswoman Krisztina Nagy urged Bulgaria to act quickly to improve the management of EU funds.
Reforms undertaken by Bulgaria this year have failed to bring about a tangible improvement in the management of EU money thus far, according to the EC.
"I recognise action plans have been set up and legislation has been revised; however, many of these measures are only a promise of future action and have not yet delivered concrete results," Rehn said.
Tuesday's decision caught Bulgarian officials by surprise.
Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev and his deputy in charge of EU fund management, Meglena Plugchieva, who were both in Berlin, criticised the EC, as they expressed their "disappointment".
Stanishev complained the EU had not always given Bulgaria the treatment it accorded to other member states.
Plugchieva vowed, though, that Bulgaria "will nevertheless ... strictly implement the European rules and procedures to guarantee the correct and transparent use of all European funds".
Slamming the government for the loss of EU funds as the economic crisis begins to bite, right-wing opposition parties called for the cabinet's resignation and early elections.
International petition aims to save BiH's Cave Vjetrenica
International organisations are raising the alarm over Bosnia and Herzegovina's Cave Vjetrenica -- a natural monument and candidate for UNESCO's World Heritage List -- because of the threat to its natural resources and unique fauna.
By Envesa Hodzic-Kovac for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo – 26/11/08

An international petition is under way to preserve Cave Vjetrenica from nearby economic development.
The initiative began with the involvement of the Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Speleological Association "Vjetrenica-Popovo polje", the International Society for Subterranean Biology (SIBIOS), the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and the World Commission on Protected Areas-Task Force on Caves and Karst.
Cave Vjetrenica -- or the Wind Cave -- situated in the karst landscape of the south-Dinaric Alps, is the largest cave system in BiH and is considered the most biodiverse subterranean cave in the world.
The cave entrance is near the village of Zavala (Ravno municipality) in southern Herzegovina.
The cave's known length is 6km, including a 2.5km-long main tunnel, although geologists speculate that Vjetrenica may stretch another 10-15km to the Adriatic Sea.
Only 20 caves in the world have more than 20 animal species.
Vjetrenica is famous for its cave life, including 85 types of troglobites (cave dwellers) and stygobites (aquatic cave dwellers), a total rivalled only by Postojna Cave in Slovenia and considerably surpassing that of Mammoth Cave in the US state of Kentucky, a World Heritage List cave.
Vjetrenica contains spacious corridors and chambers, housing numerous lakes and waterfalls and both year-round and seasonal streams.
The longest lake, Veliko Jezero (the Great Lake), is 180m long.
The cave abounds in stalactites, flowstone, draperies and cascades.
Paleontologists have found the remains of eight fossilised animals in Vjetrenica to date.
In 1950, Vjetrenica gained protection as a monument of nature as well as a listing in the Emerald Network of Areas of Special Conservation Interest.
The National Commission for UNESCO of BiH has recommended its inclusion twice (2004 and 2007) on UNESCO's World Heritage List.
''The future of Vjetrenica in Popovo Polje valley is seriously threatened.
We would like to warn BiH authorities that the country is likely to lose one of its most precious and world renowned natural heritage gems,'' said Boris Sket, the president of SIBIOS, and Elery Hamilton-Smith, the IUCN Task Force chairman, in a letter addressed to the mayor of Ravno on July 30th.
The international petition urges BiH authorities to meet their international obligations to protect nature in BiH.
It also asks them to halt industrial activities in the Vjetrenica vicinity, such as quarrying, water pumping within the cave and application of chemicals on the cave's surface.
The petitioners additionally want authorities to consult with qualified institutions before launching any tourism ventures in the cave's vicinity, in order to preserve this highly sensitive and unique ecosystem.

Bulgaria sold two tonnes of high-quality rose oil this year to the world's perfumery giants, according to Nedko Nedkov, director of the Rose Institute in the town of Kazanlak.
This year's output was lower than expected, due to poor weather conditions.
Turkey's gross domestic expenditure on research and development (GERD) reached 0.79% of GDP in 2005, according to figures published by TurkStat on Friday (August 10th).
In terms of purchasing power parity, GERD expenditure increased 19.7% year on year.
The US government has invested around 18m euros in the Kogalniceanu military base in Romania, Colonel John Ingham of the US Office of Defence Co-operation said on Monday (August 13th).
Speaking to Realitatea TV, he said Washington plans to contract Romanian companies to provide healthcare, food supplies and other provisions for the US base, set to open next week.
The number of registered unemployed in Croatia decreased by 9.2% in July compared to the same month last year, reaching a total of 245,768, according to official figures published on Friday (August 10th).
Following seasonal trends, the number of registered unemployed decreased by 1.5% month to month.
The Albanian government approved the start of construction at the new thermal power plant in Vlora. The facility, expected to cost 84m euros, will help alleviate the country's chronic power shortages.
The Montenegrin government signed a 1.3m-euro contract with the French company, Louis Berger.
The French firm will build the Adriatic-Ionian and Bar-Boljare highways.

Croatia to stay on reform track
The newest EU member-to-be will also be the first to inaugurate a new EU monitoring mechanism.

After the EU Council decided on June 30th to close accession negotiations with Croatia -- and open the accession treaty path by the end of the year – a new monitoring mechanism was launched to ensure the fulfillment of Croatia's commitments undertaken during negotiations.
The Commission, by monitoring Croatia's preparations to assume full membership responsibilities, seeks to avoid a repeat of Bulgaria and Romania who entered the EU in 2007 despite considerable problems with crime and corruption.
"Monitoring reform efforts up to accession will give the necessary assurance to Croatia and current member states," EU leaders stated in the Council's report on Croatia issued on June 24th.
Croatia will be the first EU candidate country to undergo the Council's new monitoring system, which will continue until the anticipated accession date of July 1, 2014.
"Although Croatia has made great progress, Croatia still needs to continue working on the reduction of pending court cases, and ensuring a full application of the legal system for all citizens," EC Vice President and Commissioner for Justice Viviane Reding said in an interview for Deutsche Welle.
Commitments undertaken in the area of Judiciary and Fundamental Rights, including the continued development of judicial reform and efficiency, impartial handling of war crimes cases, and fighting corruption, will be published every six months in the Council's progress reports.
The Commission will send early warnings to Croatian authorities if they fall behind relevant requirements.
The mechanism allows for "soft pressure" by the EU in the period between the end of negotiations and the accession.
Several EU governments, especially France, Britain and Netherlands, are advocating a strict monitoring of Croatia during this process.
It is clear that the EU learned a lesson from its experience with Romania and Bulgaria, where the backsliding started before their accession.
David Florian Bieber, professor for Southeast European Studies at the University of Graz, says there is another reason behind the new monitoring mechanism.
"The talks with Croatia were concluded very quickly at the end, so some of the promises, especially fighting corruption and rule of law need to be fulfilled," he told SETimes.
Croatian public authorities are optimistic and view the new mechanism as an incentive to pursue relevant reforms.
"The monitoring exercise and Croatia's overall track-record in the closed chapters have already confirmed its determination and capability of fulfilling all its commitments, overcoming various obstacles along the way and becoming a credible EU member," a spokesperson for Croatia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration told SETimes. "Rest assured that this attitude will persist with equally strong commitment in the years to come."
"This new mechanism is a good sign; it demonstrates that the EU can think of new and more constructive ways to conclude membership talks and still have ways to monitor progress," Bieber says.
From a broader EU enlargement perspective, the new monitoring mechanism in Croatia is a model for future talks with other countries in the Balkans.
Exhibition Is a Homecoming for Albanian Artists
Tirana's National Gallery of Art recently hosted a landmark exhibition featuring the work of 23 Albanian artists who live and work abroad.
The event was a joint project of the International Organisation for Migration and the UNHCR.

After years of living abroad, Albanian artists are returning to their homeland.
"Colours of Albania in the World," an exhibition held recently at the National Gallery of Art in Tirana, featured 23 artists who have migrated to other countries, including many who left during and immediately after the communist regime.
The exhibition was the first in Albania to bring together artists from the diaspora.
The focus was on the need to respect migrants and refugees, and on the positive contribution they make to their host societies.
According to the International Organisation of Migration (IOM), which organised the event together with the UNHCR, the purpose of the art show was to "spark debate and reflection not only on human suffering, but also on human dignity".
"This is really a unique event for Albania," said Albi Greva of the IOM office in Tirana. "There are so many artists who have returned for this exhibit after their decision to emigrate from Albania in early 1990s.
It's so rare to have them all in one exhibition."
For Xhovalin Delia, an Albanian artist living in Florence, Italy, the event was "similar to the call of your own father to return to your home country".
During communism, notes UNHCR representative in Albania Marion Hoffman, artists "had to either perform according to the rules of dictatorship, or work in hiding, or flee . In this exhibition, we discover colours which, until 14 years ago, would have been drably oppressed within the country's own hermetically closed borders."
The event was officially inaugurated by Prime Minister Fatos Nano.
At the opening ceremony, he hailed the participating artists, whom he said, "have introduced to their host societies certain values of Albanian culture such as passion, friendship and nobility".
"They are putting their mark on the artistic scene of their host societies and now have an opportunity to show their work in their own country.
They remind us that 20 million refugees and displaced persons around the world would also rather return home, if they could," Hoffmann said.
Funding for the exhibition was provided by local and international donors.
The artists featured were Adrian Paci, Flutura Preka, Besnik Haxhillari, Helidon Gjergji, Ibrahim Kodra, Omer Kaleshi, Ornela Vorpsi, Venera Kastrati, Anila Rubiku, Armando Lulaj, Bashkim Ahmeti, Bujar Marikaj, Arjan Risvani, Ilir Zefi, Xhovalin Delia, Bujar Luca, Astrit Vatnika, Artan Shabani, Agim Sula, Elton Milaqi, Pëllumb Puci, Valbona Musliu and Viktor Ferraj.

Obama commemorates Armenian deaths; Turkey is critical
The issue remains highly sensitive, with Turkey refusing allegations of genocide.
(Zaman, The Gulf Today, Aysor.am - 25/04/11; The White House, Hurriyet, World Bulletin, RFE/RL, VOA, The Washington Times, Deutsche Welle - 24/04/11)
"Obama's statement is one-sided and it reads history from a single perspective," Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu said on Sunday (April 24th). [Reuters]
US President Barack Obama marked Armenian Remembrance Day at the weekend, describing the deaths of 1.5 million Armenians 96 years ago as "one of the worst atrocities of the 20th century", although he stopped short of using the term genocide.
"I have consistently stated my own view of what occurred in 1915, and my view of that history has not changed," Obama wrote in a statement Saturday (April 23rd).
"It is in all of our interest to see the achievement of a full, frank and just acknowledgment of the facts."
His words drew strong criticism from Turkey, with Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu saying the statement "is one-sided and reads history from a single perspective".
"It is saddening that each year this issue pops up and casts a shadow on our relations with the United States. Lots of pain was endured in the Ottoman territories during the break-up of the empire," Istanbul-based daily Hurriyet quoted him as adding.
"We would have expected Mr. Obama to also remember the sufferings of Turks back in those days."
As many as 1.5 million ethnic Armenians were massacred in 1915 and 1916 in what many historians regard as the first genocide of the 20th century.
Ankara rejects that claim, however, arguing that the numbers have been exaggerated, and that the killings took place amid a general climate of civil war in which Turks also died.
The issue remains extremely sensitive, and for years public debate within Turkey was unheard of.
Recently, however, that has started to change.
Small gatherings were held in six cities around the country on Sunday, commemorating Armenian intellectuals and community leaders who were rounded up in Istanbul by the Ottoman authorities on April 24th, 1915.
Most were deported to Central Anatolia, where they perished.
Many say that action marked the start of a much larger purge, although Turkey has long insisted there was no systematic plan for exterminating Armenians.
Praising Ankara and Yerevan for the efforts they have been making in recent years to improve their ties, Obama urged them on Saturday to move forward along that path.
"I salute the Turks who saved Armenians in 1915 and am encouraged by the dialogue among Turks and Armenians, and within Turkey itself, regarding this painful history," he said.
"Together, the Turkish and Armenian people will be stronger as they acknowledge their common history and recognise their common humanity."
Obama also praised the Armenians for their contributions around the world since the tragic events in Turkey nearly a century ago, viewing them as "a testament to the strength, tenacity and courage of the Armenian people".
The Armenian diaspora in the United States was also unhappy with the president's statement and criticised him for failing to make good on his pre-election promise to recognise the Armenian genocide.
"The president offered only euphemisms and evasive terminology to describe the murder of over 1.5 million men, women and children -- effectively keeping in place the gag rule imposed by the Turkish government on the open and honest discussion of this crime," the Armenian Assembly of America stated.
Turkish group plans new relief mission to Gaza
Turkish-Israeli relations, already strained, could face a new challenge.
By Alina Lehtinen for Southeast European Times in Istanbul -- 25/04/11
Last year's flotilla incident caused the death of nine civilians and set off a diplomatic row between Turkey and Israel [Reuters]
The Turkish humanitarian relief group IHH, responsible for organising last year's controversial Gaza flotilla, plans a similar action next month.
Government officials confirmed on April 14th that Israel has urged Ankara to stop the upcoming mission.
They insist, however, that they do not have the right to prevent the ships from sailing.
Eight Turks and one US citizen of Turkish origin died during the previous relief mission after a raid by Israeli commandos.
The IHH flotilla had breached a blockade of Gaza imposed by Israel, which said it was acting in accordance with international law.
Analysts say that while Turkey has also been critical of Israeli policies towards the Palestinians, its tone has hardened since Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) came to power.
"In Turkey, people always cared for Palestinians but previously foreign policy makers did not pay much attention to public opinion," said Kemal Kirisci from Bogazici University.
"Now it is different.
AKP is very good at populism," he said.
In recent years, Turkey has been eager to play a mediator role between different groups in the Middle East and North Africa.
Earlier this month, Turkey said it could host a meeting between the two rival Palestinian groups, Fatah and Hamas.
"Turkey has said recently that it has a particular mission as a country that is strategically located in-between the Middle East and Europe. Turkey sees itself as an order creator and a model for the rest of the region," Tarik Oguzlu, a professor at Bilkent University, told SETimes.
But according to Yair Hirschfeld of the University of Haifa, Turkey is undermining the official rulers of Palestine by talking with Hamas.
"It would be very important for Turkey to acknowledge the official Palestinian leadership.
Playing games around this and undermining the official leadership is not very constructive," Hirschfeld said.
Following last year's flotilla crisis, anti-Israel sentiment surged in Turkey.
A popular film released in January, Valley of the Wolves Palestine, portrayed Israelis as bloodthirsty villains.
Last December, there was a rare moment of co-operation, with Turkey sending aid to Israel during a forest fire on Mount Carmel that killed at least 44 people.
Despite the plethora of issues that must be resolved in order to improve relations, some experts are hopeful.
"The Turkish side must recognise that cornering Israel does not serve Turkey's interests," Kirisci explained. "Turkey needs to regain Israel's trust.
This of course is difficult to achieve if Israeli domestic politics keep slipping further and further to the right and the Israeli government keeps hurting the people in Gaza."
"What we have to do is sit together quietly and to prevent stupid acts from both sides and see how we can translate the real common strategic interest into the region and into our co-operative policy," Hirschfeld said.
"Israel has many friends in Turkey and Turkey has many friends in Israel.
Finding a solution is an interest of both sides."
Nikolic's hunger strike: what is the impact?
The leader of Serbian's largest opposition party has called off his protest, but the political ramifications continue.

Tomislav Nikolic is taking foods and liquids again, following an appeal from the church.
Meanwhile, analysts are gauging the impact of his protest on Serbia's fractured political scene.
The Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) leader began a hunger and thirst strike on April 16th, demanding the country hold early elections.
Following the intervention of Patriarch Irinej, who told him this kind of protest was not in line with Serbian Orthodox beliefs, Nikolic drank water again on April 21st.
Several days later, on Easter Sunday, he ended the hunger strike as well.
The government sharply criticised Nikolic's actions, saying they undermined the country's stability and encouraged extreme behaviour.
"Somebody who presents himself as the leader of the largest opposition party has to have responsibility," said Slobodan Homen, the government's media relations co-ordinator.
"He should know that his actions could endanger the lives of citizens because he is sending the message that any demand can be achieved by sacrificing your own life."
"Unfortunately, all of this is just a part of political marketing which sets a dangerous precedent and fosters an image of Serbia as an immature and unstable country," he added.
Belgrade economist Milan Kovacevic, a foreign investment adviser, said that Nikolic's actions would have another damaging effect.
"A factor in the investment climate is both political risk and instability, which is increasing because of Nikolic's strike and weakening the view that investing in Serbia is justified," said Kovacevic.
SNS members, however, have rejected the criticism.
"Who has Nikolic harmed apart from himself by risking his own life?
We haven't broken a single piece of glass at our protests, let alone endangered the country's stability.
This government, which is leading us towards economic collapse, is threatening Serbia's European perspective," Nebojsa Stefanovic, a member of the party presidency, told SETimes.
Political analyst Dejan Vuk Stankovic believes that Serbia has managed to avoid radicalisation. But the already tense relations between the opposition and government are likely to deteriorate further, he said.
"Citizens, despite their dissatisfaction with the standard of living, are not ready for more radical protests.
However, we will now have the complete polarisation of the government and opposition," he told SETimes.
"But I do not think that European integration will slow down as a result of that because the Serbian Progressive Party also wants Serbia to be granted EU candidate status," Stankovic added.
He agreed that Nikolic's strike had the potential to push Serbian politics in a risky direction. "If [President Boris] Tadic had given in and called [snap] elections because of Nikolic's strike, that could have set a dangerous precedent," the analyst said.
"And if Nikolic had gotten the elections, what would he have done tomorrow as prime minister, when dissatisfied workers go on a hunger strike or begin a more radical protest?"
SNS member Stefanovic said his party is up to the challenge. "We are aware that the SNS would face many problems if it were to form a government," he said.
"However, unlike this government, which doesn't want to speak to its people and its hungry workers, we would solve all of them through dialogue," he said.
Serbia is due to hold regular general elections in the spring of 2012.
A snap vote could bring big dividends for the SNS, which has commanded high levels of voter support for months, according to opinion polls.
Northern Kosovo situation unites political elite in Pristina
Political heavyweights stand behind the Kosovo government's actions in the north, but some say it will have consequences.
By Linda Karadaku for Southeast European Times in Pristina -- 16/08/11

They may disagree on most other questions, but the major political forces in Kosovo share a consensus on at least one matter: the government's move last month to take control of two border crossings in the north.
Arbana Vidishiqi, head of the Kosovo bureau of Radio Free Europe, says the intervention in the north marked the first time that the country's political elite has stood united in their support for the current administration.
"I believe it was the disappointment with the situation in the north, the 12 years of status quo which the Kosovo political elite blames the international [community] for," Vidishiqi told SETimes. "They now see a case for a substantial change of this situation,"
Underlining the broad-based support, parliament passed a resolution supporting the decision by a vote of 89-8 on July 28th.
The only substantial dissent came from Vetevendosje, which said Prime Minister Thaci was not going far enough.
It urged the president announce an extraordinary situation in the country and halt talks with Serbia.
"Unification, mobilisation of all citizens and subjects to support the institutions to defend Kosovo is the only way to preserve the territorial integrity," said Glauk Konjufca, and MP representing the party.
He also accused Prime Minister Hashim Thaci of "personal protagonism", saying he wanted to do everything by himself.
The government's action was supported by the Students' Parliament of the University of Pristina.
Its chairman, Mentor Hasani, told SETimes that they fully trusted the Kosovo police and support the intervention.
"The action has united the politics in the country and its citizens because the intervention was indespensable," he told SETimes.
The non-governmental organization Nectar of Goodness, meanwhile, launched a boycott of products from Serbia.
A member of the NGO Lavdrim Gashi told SETimes that they intend to make the public "aware that they can fill their kitchens without Serbian goods".
Some political commentators, however, have reacted with caution, suggesting the actual consequences could be mixed.
"Nothing came out of the meeting in the UN.
The Kosovo government's action was legitimate, but not well-prepared and it failed at the end.
It will have a cost for Kosovo because a second attempt will be very difficult," analyst Nexhmedin Spahiu told SETimes.
"The northern issue in the talks can take another direction and get out of the Ahtisaari framework," he said. "It would not be good to have a second state like Bosnia, divided in cantons and entities."
The government's move triggered a reaction from local Kosovo Serbs, who set up road blocks and prevented the police from gaining access to one of the border crossing points.
One policeman died in an apparent sniper attack.
The crisis defused after KFOR took over the posts.
Under a temporary agreement, NATO peacekeepers will continue to guard them pending a long-term solution.
Turkish Parliament votes for new president
Turkey's parliament began choosing a new president on Friday, with the main opposition party boycotting the vote and threatening legal action at the Constitutional Court.

The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has been working to secure the required two-thirds majority for its presidential candidate, Abdullah Gul, ahead of the first round of voting by Parliament on Friday (April 27th).
The only other contender for incumbent Ahmet Necdet Sezer's post is dissident AKP lawmaker Ersonmez Yarbay, but he is said to have no chance of beating Gul, now the foreign minister.
Under the constitution, a candidate must be supported by at least 367 of all 550 members of parliament to win in the first round.
If it produces no winner, a second round will be held on Wednesday, when a two-thirds majority is again required.
If none of the contenders has mustered that level of support, a third round of voting will take place on May 9th, when a simple majority, or 276 votes, will suffice.
If this does not occur, a fourth and final round of voting under the same simple-majority rule will be held on May 15th, a day before Sezer's seven-year term expires.
The AKP, which holds 353 seats in parliament, including the speaker's, appeared confident Thursday that Gul could win a first-round victory Friday, despite the main opposition Republican People's Party's (CHP) planned boycott of the vote.
"In my view, everything is very clear," Parliament Speaker Bulent Arinc told reporters. "This parliament will elect the 11th president of Turkey comfortably."
The CHP, which has 152 deputies in parliament and wants the next president to be chosen after early parliamentary elections, has warned that it will challenge the results before the Constitutional Court in the event fewer than 367 deputies attend parliament's session Friday.
Arinc insisted, however, that the usual one-third quorum, or 184 lawmakers, would suffice for him to open the session.
Legal experts support that view, saying the CHP's argument for annulling the election result lacks merit.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the leader of the AKP, has called on all lawmakers to attend Friday's session.
"I urge all elected deputies ... to come and do their democratic political duty.
We are facing one of the most important days of our democratic life," Reuters quoted him as saying.
The opposition's push reflects concerns among secular Turks that the ruling AKP, which has its roots in political Islam, will take all key state positions.
Although the AKP has consistently denied it, the secularists fear that the party has a hidden religious agenda.
Seeking to allay those fears, Gul has been pledging since his nomination Tuesday that he will abide by the principles of secularism and be the president of all citizens, if elected.
"I am loyal to the republic, to secularism, to the principles of a democratic, social state ruled by law, as stated in the constitution in essence," he said in an interview published in the Milliyet newspaper Thursday.
Secularists also fear that following his ascent to the presidency -- a largely ceremonial post, except for key veto power -- the AKP will renew its efforts to lift the existing Muslim headscarf ban.
It bars Turkish women from wearing headscarves in campuses and public office.
Gul's wife, Hayrunisa, wears the headscarf, as do the wives of Erdogan and Arinc.
Gul this week described his wife's choice as a personal preference and said it should be respected.
Croatia's Kostelic transformed the sport
Janica Kostelic and her brother Ivica have inspired a brand new generation of Croatian skiers.

Before the Kostelic family transformed it, Alpine skiing was not a popular sport in Croatia.
The country lacks mountains, and ski lovers usually travel to neighbouring Slovenia for winter sports -- or even further, to Austria and Italy.
However, sports fans across Croatia, and indeed across the world, have been gripped by the determination of Janica Kostelic, her brother, Ivica, and their father Ante.
Janica was born on January 5, 1982, in Zagreb.
In her youth, she participated in, and won, all the junior categories in the sport.
In her last junior season, 1996-1997, she won the Topolino and Pinoccio in slalom and giant slalom.
Kostelic retires as a triple overall winner in the Federation Internationale de Ski (FIS) World Cup in 2000-2001, 2002-2003 and 2005-2006, and with four Olympic gold and two Olympic silver medals -- Salt Lake City 2002 and Turin 2006.
She was five time gold medallist in two FIS World Championship in alpine skiing -- St. Moritz 2003 and Bormio/Santa Caterina 2005.
In the FIS World Cup, Kostelic won 30 races in all five alpine disciplines.
She won three Crystal Globes in the FIS World Cup slalom.
At St. Moritz in 1999, Kostelic tore four of the seven ligaments in her right knee.
After numerous injuries, her return to the 2000/2001 World Cup was remarkable -- she won seven of the eight slalom events.
However, she then had problems with her thyroid gland, which was surgically removed in 2004.
Croatian media are now taking stock of her achievements and her well-deserved place in sports history.
Most comments have a common thread -- that perhaps one day Janica will return to alpine skiing.
At the same time, commentators say her wish for a normal life is understandable.
The Kostelic legacy is enormous.
In Croatia, there are new ski princesses who await their shot at the throne, and Kostelic has been an inspiration to them all.
Not bad for a little girl who, as her mother remembers, "kept falling and getting into the other children's way, and we thought that she'd never learn how to ski".
Every time Janica won a major championship or returned with her gold medals from the Olympics, Croatians flocked to welcome her back -- their hero.
BiH gets a government for New Year's
It took five meetings among party leaders to reach a concensus on forming a government, 14 months after voters went to the polls.

The leaders of the six major political parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) finally agreed on Wednesday (December 28th) to form the state Council of Ministers, in a move that should boost the country's crippled EU bid.
Also during their meeting in Sarajevo, the parties agreed on the laws on the census and state aid, the "Finci and Sejdic case", as well as the state budget to temporarily finance the government's work during the first quarter of 2012.
Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ-BiH) leader Dragan Covic and other party officials said the prime minister will be Vjekoslav Bevanda, whose name will be submitted to the BiH presidency.
Bevanda worked as finance minister in the Federation of BiH (FBiH) government, joining HDZ two years ago.
Before his post at the ministry, he worked in banking and is considered one of BiH's top economic experts.
At their joint press conference following Wednesday's meeting, the party leaders announced details of the government's ethnic composition.
The Bosniaks secured the ministries of foreign affairs, security, defence, transport and communications.
The Serbs got the ministries of finance, foreign trade and economic relations, as well as civil affairs, while the Croats got the post of chairman of the Council of Ministers as well as the ministries of justice and human rights and refugees.
Republika Srpska President Milorad Dodik , who heads the SNSD party, said the agreement is the result of a compromise by domestic political parties, not pressure by the international community.
"We did not get what we thought we should, but no one got everything they wanted," Dodik said.
The key agreements on the laws of the EU package will allow BiH to apply for EU candidate status.
Social Democratic Party (SDP) leader Zlatko Lagumdzija said that satisfactory co-operation was reached with the HDZ.
HDZ 1990 leader Bozho Ljubic, however, announced he may withdraw his signature on forming the Council of Ministers and could join the opposition if certain matters are not cleared up and harmonised in bilateral discussions in the next several days.
Banja Luka-based economic expert Snjezana Stankovic told SETimes that as much as the agreement is political in nature, it is more important from an economic standpoint because BiH had lost significant investments and foreign funds due to the inability of politicians to form a government.
"There was a ˈtechnical budgetˈ which only provided salaries and funds necessary for institutions to function.
Now it will be possible to adopt a ˈdevelopment budgetˈ, which will provide investments in the stateˈs economy as well as foreign investments," Stankovic added.
EU delegation head and special representative in BiH Peter Sorensen welcomed the agreement.
"The EU delegation in BiH was encouraged by the fact that a compromise was reached after a political stalemate that had lasted for months," he said in a statement.
"We encourage the BiH authorities to continue to tackle the problems of the state budget for 2012, and [develop] a global fiscal framework in order to fully ensure the functioning of state institutions and the fulfillment of the international obligations of BiH," he concluded.
Bulgarian Foreign Minister Nikolai Mladenov issued a statement Thursday saying the newly-formed Council of Ministers must make up for lost time and immediately undertake reforms needed to accelerate NATO and EU integration.
"I am confident that this is possible and the country will receive Bulgaria's full support in its path to reforms," the Sofia Echo quoted him as saying.
Sarajevo resident Stevan Vukcevic, 28, voiced the publicˈs collective sense of relief, saying it was a disgrace that politicians made citizens wait for over a year.
"I think they agreed at that meeting to give us a gift for New Yearˈs.
I hope the citizens will know how to punish this behaviour in the next elections, and that they will not forget the year without a government," Vukcevic said.
Mladic supporters face new trial
Ratko Mladic will testify via video at the trial of those accused of helping him elude capture.

Ten people accused of helping Ratko Mladic, himself on trial at The Hague tribunal charged with genocide at Srebrenica, are facing a retrial that began on December 21st.
The ten are charged with helping Mladic hide from 2002 to 2006, while the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) had a warrant out for his arrest.
The trial is the result of a ruling by the Appeals Court in July that overturned the acquittal of the ten defendants in their first trial.
Judge Tatjana Stefanovic said she would ask for Mladic's testimony because "he needs to answer important questions about his many years of hiding."
The defendants' lawyers, however, insist that Mladic's health and mental stability must first be determined to ensure he is a valid witness.
"A team of appropriate experts must do so.
After all he lived through there is reason to assume his mental health deteriorated and his testimony might not be sufficiently reliable," lawyer Milos Saljic, who represented Mladic while he was in custody in Belgrade, told SETimes.
The ten lawyers representing the defendants pointed out that it would be necessary to meet with Mladic in Scheveningen.
"Fortunately, Mladic is still alive and will be able to testify that these people had nothing to do with the fact that the ICTY was not able to put Mladic behind bars," lawyer Nebojsa Milosavljevic told SETimes.
All of the accused stand by their statements given at the first trial, denying that they hid Mladic.
Seven decided not to testify at the new trial, while three will speak in their own defence.
Asked by the judge whether they ever met Mladic, one of the accused, Borislav Ivanovic, said he had once.
"My mother took care of his apartment where I once saw him, when I came over," said Ivanovic.
He confirmed that he knew who Mladic was from the media.
Several defendants said they made statements under police pressure, and that during the first trial they often received telephone threats.
"We hope that the new court proceedings [will include] all the evidence, that there won't be delays and that we will get short-term sentence under the law," Milan Antonijevic, president of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, told SETimes.
Antonijevic said it will be determined during the course of the trial whether or not Mladic's circle of support was wider than the ten defendants.
In his opinion, the court has the opportunity to clarify if two soldiers of the Serbian and Montenegro army, Dragan Jakovljevic and Drazen Milovanovic, were killed in 2004 at the military facility in Karas to prevent a leak that Mladic was hiding at the facility at the time.
The defendants' lawyers say they are not certain the trial will be fair.
"By giving Mladic a chance to confess if the accused did hide him, it is still questionable if the trial will be conducted fairly, without state interference," lawyer Krsto Bobot told SETimes.
Mladic is scheduled to appear in court as a witness on February 22nd.
The first trial against the ten lasted more than four years and ended in 2010.
Presiding trial judge Dejan Garic decided some were not proven guilty, while for others the offence became obsolete.
Serge Brammertz, chief prosecutor of The Hague tribunal, has said it is necessary to determine who participated in the Mladic support network during the ten years he was in hiding.
Serbia's Nikolic begins hunger strike
BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) leader Tomislav Nikolic announced on Saturday (April 16th) he has launched a hunger strike that will continue until the party's demand for early elections is met.
Nikolic was speaking at an anti-government demonstration in Belgrade attended by tens of thousands of people.
The SNS insists the snap vote should be called for December.
The next scheduled general elections are in May 2012. (Beta, Tanjug, RTS, B92, Blic - 16/04/11)
NGOs brighten up the holidays in BiH
During tough economic times NGOs are helping to keep holiday traditions alive for those who can't afford it.

When Santa Claus brings gifts, the gratification is clear on children's faces.
The most famous Santa Claus in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dragan Divjak, or Seko as he is commonly known, has been bringing smiles to children's faces for more than 30 years.
"I used to go through cities on a sleigh, dressed in my red suit, and gave out gift packages to children.
There is no more sleigh today, that kind of tradition is lost, but giving to the kids is still a custom," Divjak told SETimes.
Even today, as the world-wide economic crisis has brought poverty to the doors of numerous families in BiH, several NGOs strive to bring a smile to every child's face.
Tuzla-based Children of the Earth, along with several similar NGOs in BiH, has run the ''One sweet, One child'' programme for the past six years now.
"The goal is to ensure a New Year's package for children of low social standing so that they too can experience a holiday season full of blessings," volunteer Irma Bastic told SETimes.
Bastic and her colleagues collect sweets in shopping centres where citizens donate them for this purpose.
"The tradition that Santa Claus should give gifts to children has acquired a new meaning during the crisis.
Santa Claus [is working] under recession conditions," volunteer Ivica Gojcin told SETimes.
Several NGOs in BiH provide gifts to children. [Bedrana Kaletovic/SETimes]
But for some, gifts are not all that is wanted.
For Children's Village of Peace in Turija, New Year's celebrations are always a bit different.
The NGO takes care of around 150 little ones left without family and guardian care, providing love and security in a family surrounding.
"I wish that my two sisters and I remain together, that they don't take us apart and that we always get along nicely,'' said 12-year-old Djula who came to the village three months ago after her parents passed away.
The village was built by the German Rudolf Walther Foundation, together with the local community.
For the holidays, presents are made by children in Germany and sent to the village.
"The most important thing is to have someone thinking of you, someone who appreciates your work and wants to help you in your efforts to make the life of these children better," said Amra Ramadanovic, a psychologist at the village.
Romanian county wants to buy back "Dracula's Castle"
Romania's Brasov county is ready to pay the former royal family 60m euros for a 14th century fortress, nicknamed "Dracula's Castle", in hopes of boosting tourism revenue.
(Telegraph, The Scotsman, The New York Times, Nine o'Clock - 09/01/07; Reuters, Bloomberg, HotNews.ro - 08/01/07; The Scotsman - 07/01/07; The Journal News - 28/12/06)

Romania's Brasov county council is seeking a ten-year loan from an Austrian bank to buy back a medieval Transylvanian fortress, known as "Dracula's Castle", from the descendants of the country's former royal family of Habsburg.
The current owners -- Dominic von Habsburg, an industrial designer who lives in New York, and his sisters Elisabeth Sandhofer and Maria-Magdalena Holzhausen, who both reside in Austria -- have demanded 60m euros for the real estate, officially called Bran Castle.
"We want to get involved in getting back the castle and running it because it would be a very good opportunity to further develop tourism,'' the president of the Brasov County Council, Aristotel Cancescu, said on Monday (January 8th). "The costs are minor compared to what we might obtain.
In order to buy the castle, the County Council will pay in the first two years 2.7m euros, and the rest up to 60m euros will be paid through a loan."
Any purchase would require approval by all council members.
Cancescu said he expects this to happen at the next meeting.
Perched at the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains, the castle belonged to Romania's Queen Marie, a grandchild of British Queen Victoria, until 1948, when it was seized by Romania's communist regime and turned into a museum.
It was returned to the queen's grandchildren last spring under the country's restitution law.
In December, von Habsburg decided to offer it for sale and approached the Brasov council.
According to Romanian Culture and Religious Affairs Minister Adrian Iorgulescu, this was not in line with the legally envisioned procedure, as the government had the first right to buy the castle.
"The purchase offer is illegal as we have the first refusal," a report in Britain's daily Telegraph on Tuesday quoted the minister as saying. "Brasov County Council can think about buying the castle only after the culture ministry says it is not interested, and we have not yet even made our offer."
Romania's English-language daily Nine o'Clock also quoted Iorgulescu as saying there can be no formal discussion on the castle's sale until his ministry receives a written request from its current owners.
"I am not against the possibility that the castle might be bought by the Brasov County Council at a later phase, but the legal procedures are not being respected right now," the minister added.
According to him, the price demanded by von Habsburg was "indecently high" and far exceeds the castle's real value.
Located about 200km north of Bucharest and first documented in November 1377, Dracula's castle is one of Romania's greatest tourist attractions.
Vlad Tepes, or Vlad the Impaler, who was born in 1431 and ruled in Wallachia three times between 1448 and 1476, is believed to have spent time there.
The count, who gained world fame through Bram Stoker's 1897 novel "Dracula," earned his nickname due to his habit of executing captured Turks and other opponents by impaling them on wooden spikes.
Lia Trandafir, a partner at the Bucharest-based law firm Rubin, Meyer, Doru & Trandafir, which represents the owners, told Bloomberg news agency Monday that, regardless of who buys the castle, it will have to remain a museum for three years after the purchase.
"This castle cannot be bad business, regardless of who buys it because of the symbols associated with it,'' Trandafir said. "Right now it's the only museum in Romania that finances itself entirely and also produces a profit."
Macedonian, Greek name feud continues
Twelve years have passed since the UN brokered an interim accord between Greece and Macedonia, but the widely held belief that the name dispute will blow over in time is looking increasingly unrealistic.

Skopje's international airport is at the centre of the latest dispute. [File]
The end of December saw the ongoing quarrel between Greece and Macedonia flare up again.
The catalyst this time was the announcement of the new name for Skopje airport -- Aleksandar Makedonski (Alexander the Macedonian).
Accusing Skopje of falsifying history, Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis reiterated Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis' threat -- made two months previously -- to nix Macedonia's EU accession bid.
"More than 2,000 years later, history can be neither changed nor falsified," Bakoyannis said. "Their behaviour is out of sync with the duties of good-neighbourly relations set down in the interim accord and in their obligations towards the EU.
It does not serve their Euro-Atlantic ambitions well.
Greece has made its stance clear to its allies and partners.
It is a stance backed by the country's entire body politic."
The cultural heritage of the ancient Macedonians, of which Alexander constitutes the pinnacle, has been hotly disputed ever since the state claimed its independence from Yugoslavia in 1992.
Points of contention have included the name "Macedonia", the star of Vergina -- discovered in Greece but still used in a modified form as Macedonia's official flag -- and the disputed presence of a "Macedonian minority" in northern Greece.
Greece's northern province of Macedonia has been particularly sensitive to the alleged usurpation of the region's culture, forming a hotbed of protest against the Macedonian government's policies in the early 1990s.
The minister responsible for the administration of the region, which -- to confuse matters still further -- has its own airport named "Macedonia", was equally firm in his criticism of the renaming of Skopje's airport.
"We want good neighbourly relations with them, but we don't want to see the distortion of historical truths," Minister Georgios Kalantzis said.
Acts like this are unfriendly, and won't provide a solution to the problems they have in their country."
Also last month, Athens reacted angrily to the Macedonian government's expressions of concern over the fate of a "Macedonian minority" in northern Greece, the existence of which Bakoyannis strongly denies.
Solutions to the name of the former Yugoslav republic, still known to the UN as FYROM, were proposed by Special Representative Matthew Nimetz in 2005, but were rejected by both parties.
With the prospect of Macedonia's EU and NATO membership looming, however, both sides will be under pressure to sacrifice some domestic political capital to reach a mutually acceptable compromise.
Speculation mounts over Ahtisaari's recommendations for Kosovo status
UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's office says his proposal for Kosovo's future will be ready by January 21st, the date of elections in Serbia.

A spokesman for Martti Ahtisaari confirmed last week that the UN envoy's much-awaited plan for the future status of Kosovo would be presented after the January 21st parliamentary elections in Serbia.
"It's in the final stages," Remi Dourlot said on Thursday (January 4th). "[The plan] has still to be finalised, but it will be ready for the 21st and will be presented any time after then." Ahtisaari is expected to brief members of the International Contact Group before unveiling his plan to Belgrade and Pristina.
Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku said he is confident that Ahtisaari will summarise his final recommendations for the province and will present them to the UN Security Council at the end of February or beginning of March.
Meanwhile, speculation continues about what exactly Ahtisaari will recommend.
The editors of the Austrian newspaper Die Presse, Wieland Schneider and Norbert Rief, wrote in Thursday's edition that they expect Ahtisaari will propose some kind of "supervised independence" for Kosovo.
"We are confident that Ahtisaari's package will not surprise us," UNMIK deputy chief Steven Schook said after a meeting last week with Ceku. "However, after the presentation, we will analyse the package and then Kosovo's negotiating team will present its view about it."
Serbia, which opposes independence for Kosovo and argues instead for "substantial autonomy", has already warned it will oppose any proposal that does not guarantee the inviolability of its borders.
If Ahtisaari "makes an agreement for independence with the Albanian separatists, the Serbian government will reject it as invalid", Local Government Minister Zoran Locar said.
At the weekend, Serbian President Boris Tadic urged Ahtisaari to delay presenting his blueprint until a new government is formed in Belgrade.
He said an unfavourable proposal could jeopardise Serbian coalition negotiations.
Russia's Ambassador to the UN Security Council, Vitaly Churkin, said at a press conference last week that Kosovo will not be on the Security Council's agenda this month.
"We Russians believe that an opportunity must be given to the sides to continue the dialogue," Churkin said. "It would be extremely dangerous to go into imposition mode."
However, he appeared to confirm that Ahtisaari's blueprint would be on the table soon.
"There is an idea that Ahtisaari will present his proposal for Kosovo immediately after the elections in Serbia," he said.
An OSCE 'Eye-opener' for Youth in the Former Yugoslavia
The MCC consists of 16 shipping containers with radio and TV studios, an Internet cafe, library, office, dressing room for the stage, kitchen, toilets and washrooms and a storeroom. [MCC] For the past two years, they have been travelling from city to city in the Balkans.
When they arrive, they set their containers in a circle, covered by a big coloured dome.
They organise concerts and theatre performances and offer teenagers the opportunity to use modern technology.
By Zoran B. Nikolic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 06/01/03
A large round structure sits in an empty field in the heart of Novi Pazar, the centre of Serbia's Muslim minority.
Large metal boxes, originally shipping containers, are arranged in a circle under a giant, coloured plastic dome.
It looks like a circus.
"It's an Internet circus - that's what I tell local children when they ask me what this is," says Moni Schuman, a Mobile Culture Container (MCC) staff member.
The MCC, a project for youth between ages 14 and 21 in the former Yugoslavia, is run by Defence of our Future, a Viennese foundation.
Freimut Duve, the OSCE representative for Freedom of Media, initiated the foundation, which is being implemented in the framework of the Stability Pact for Southeast Europe.
It is defined as a "test-project for young people in post-conflict regions".
"We wanted to address the issue of hate speech in the region, starting at the secondary school level.
We explicitly want to work against any kind of group identification and instead promote the idea of a citizen's identification," said Duve.
The MCC consists of 16 shipping containers with radio and TV studios, an Internet cafe, library, office, dressing room for the stage, kitchen, toilets and washrooms and a storeroom.
A team of eight, mostly from Southeast Europe, runs it.
Achim Koch, who is the director, technical supervisor and project designer, comes from Germany.
They travel from city to city, remaining for five weeks at each place, at the mayor's invitation.
When they arrive, they set containers in a circle and cover the space in the centre with the dome.
There, they organise concerts and theatre performances, discussions, workshops, exhibitions, dancing and music.
They form a high school newspaper in each city, leaving all the necessary equipment and money for printing on their departure.
In the past two years, the project has visited ten cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Kosovo and Serbia.
The assistance of schools, local press, NGOs and youth clubs is necessary in order to implement this project.
In the mornings, school classes and youth clubs are invited to discuss the future.
By arrangement with school heads and youth group leaders, young people can get to know the MCC, use it and talk about their prospects for the future.
After the discussion, participants can enroll in several workshops: literature, theatre, graffiti, fashion, painting, set design, research, newspapers, radio, video, digital photography and Internet.
The project has initiated ten youth newspapers in and around the cities it visited.
The first newspaper team was founded in Cacak (Yugoslavia, 2001) followed by Gorazde, Visegrad (BiH, 2001), Mostar, Stolac, Banja Luka, Jajce, Blagaj (BiH, 2002), Skopje (Macedonia, 2002) and Mitrovica (Kosovo, 2002).
The newspapers are networked and their product goes online as soon as it is printed.
Contacts are maintained via the Internet after the MCC has moved on to other towns.
In addition, young people from the former "mobile culture towns" are invited to visit the new locations. In 2001, there were visits from Tuzla to Osijek and from Tuzla and Osijek to Cacak.
In Gorazde, people came from all of the towns that had been visited previously.
A visit to Mitrovica in September and October was the most challenging so far.
This town is still divided into northern Serbian and southern Albanian sections, separated by the Ibar River.
Despite UNMIK's continuous efforts, there is still little communication between the two parts.
The MCC was set up at the well-known bridge of Mitrovica.
From the centre of the bridge, steps led to an artificial island in the middle of the river and then to the containers via a small footbridge.
After initial reluctance, young Serbs and Albanians flocked to the MCC and started working together.
Besides the usual MCC activities, they ran 88 hours of a bilingual radio programme that could be heard all over Kosovo.
More than 5,000 people visited the MCC and 300 participated in the workshops.
In Mitrovica, their efforts started to bear fruit.
With the help of UNMIK and some international organisations, a co-ordination team they left behind succeeded in obtaining space in the KFOR confidence zone to set up a place for meetings and a room for the newspaper.
The first edition of the youth newspaper came out this month with a circulation of 1,000 copies in Albanian and 1,000 copies in Serbian.
The containers are now in winter hibernation in Sarajevo.
The original plan was to conclude the MCC tour after two years.
But in 2003 the project will go on a short tour either to the previously visited cities or near them.
Its mission will be long-term support for the work of the youth newspapers.
The youth in each city will now begin to produce a daily newspaper, supported by radio and TV work.
Currently, MCC is looking for partner stations to broadcast these productions.
At the end of the tour, the whole structure and the equipment will stay permanently at one of the visited cities where the most work remains to be done - probably Mostar or Mitrovica.
Montenegro battles on to destroy aging weapons
Niksic is Montengro's second largest city and home to an enormous amount of potentially lethal surplus weapons and ammunition, an uncomfortable combination.
By Nedjeljko Rudovic for Southeast European Times in Podgorica -- 21/10/10
Huge stockpiles are a serious concern. [Nedjeljko Rudovic]
For the past three years, the Montenegrin government has been wrangling with residents of several villages around Niksic.
It wants desperately to destroy thousands of tonnes of unstable ammunition, enough to raze the city if it were to detonate.
But residents have served up a series of protests and blockades, amid fears the deliberate detonations will pose health and environmental theats.
After independence four years ago, there were over 12,000 tonnes of ordnance in military depots across Montenegro.
Of this amount, nearly 9,800 tonnes represent a surplus.
There were nearly 5,500 tonnes in warehouses, including about 3,700 tonnes in the Brezovik warehouse in Niksic.
Nearly 1,000 tonnes of that is scheduled for destruction.
The ammunition, some of it 20 to 40 years old, is well past its expiration date, and as it degrades, becomes unstable.
"This can lead to spontaneous and uncontrolled explosion, which would have unforeseeable consequences.
High risk is a munition with 'unstable gunpowder' ...
Chemical degradation [is accompanied by] the release of heat, and can easily result in ignition," said Assistant Defence Minister Colonel Rifet Kosovac.
He tells SETimes that the munitions are conventional only, not chemical, biological or radioactive weapons and ammunition.
"That simply does not exist in warehouses on the territory of Montenegro," he says.
Destruction of surplus weapons is conducted within the Montenegro Demilitarisation (MONDEM) programme and a technical agreement on the destruction of small arms and light weapons and various types of ammunition, signed between the defence ministry and the US State Department.
Some of it should have been removed by now.
"We sold 1,500 tonnes of weapons and ammunition surplus, but customers still have not taken over them.
Of the remaining amount, approximately 2,000 tonnes is scheduled for destruction.
The rest will be offered for sale.
If we don't sell that, it must be destroyed," says Kosovac.
Aleksandar Dedovic, director of the NGO Alpha Centre, believes that the existence of large quantities of surplus ammunition, weapons and mines poses one of the most serious threats to Montenegrin security.
"Bearing in mind that these weapons and ammunition were produced a very long time ago, and that it is stored in such conditions that do not guarantee long-term stability, we believe [the government] urgently needs to continue with their planning and professional destruction," Dedovic tells SETimes.
He adds that government communications with residents in the affected areas has been largely lacking.
"It is necessary to present [clearly] that we are faced with serious danger and the [potentially] tragic consequences caused by the further continuation of this situation."
BiH expects visa-free regime by year end
The mood is jubilant, but some questions whether the EU will grant BiH visa liberalisation this year.
By Ljiljana Kovacevic for Southeast European Times in Banja Luka -- 21/10/10

The European Parliament (EP) took a long-awaited step earlier this month, endorsing the European Commission's (EC) proposal to abolish visas for BiH and Albanian citizens by year's end.
The EU Council of Ministers will have a final say at its meeting on November 8th and 9th.
In BiH, the mood is jubilant.
"We expect the EU interior and justice ministers to confirm the European Parliament's decision.
The signals we received [suggest] the decision will be positive," BiH Ambassador to the EU Osman Topcagic told SETimes.
The majority of EP members voted in favour of the European Commission's initiative -- which concluded last May.
It affirmed that BiH met the requirements in the requisite fields for abolishing visas -- security, illegal migration and crime.
"The EP gave strong support, 538 deputies voted in favour, so I think that BiH is ready.The fact that now some would open new dilemmas would only mean a political intensification of the situation," EP Rapporteur for Visa Regime Liberalisation Tanya Fajon said.
France, Denmark and the Netherlands, however, have asked for additional security guarantees from BiH to support the visa-free regime.
"It was not in opposition to visa abolition for BiH citizens but about seeking additional information and verification," Topcagic said.
Many of these guarantees were already presented by fulfilling the 174 conditions contained in the roadmap that the EC established for BiH.
"Fulfilling the roadmap will help us in the process of European integration, and will improve both the safety of our citizens and citizens of Europe," said Topcagic.
He could not say when the decision to liberalise the visa regime can enter into force.
"By being placed on the 'white Schengen list' our job is not finished.
We will continue to improve institutions and work on introducing European standards in order to accelerate our approach to European integration," Topcagic noted.
Nebojsa Radmanovic, a member BiH's tripartite presidency, said that no EU council country will block the decision to abolish the visa regime.
"If it does happen, then the Europeans will show they don't want BiH, and perhaps most of the Western Balkans, in the EU.
That strategy is not good," Radmanovic said.
He adds that BiH has fulfilled a higher number of requirements for visa liberalisation than other countries in the region.
Liberalisation will allow BiH citizens who have biometric passports to spend up to three months in participating EU member states.
Jovana Bjelakovic, 20, a student from Banja Luka, hopes that will help her visit relatives in Milan, Italy.
"Almost every year I go to visit them.
However, much time and money is spent on trips to Sarajevo and the issue of visas by the Italian Embassy.
I hope that it will finally come to an end," she told SETimes.
But to Danilo Gajic, 74, a retiree in Banja Luka, visa liberalisation does not account for much.
"The pension I receive is insufficient to meet my basic needs, let alone to travel abroad.
Those who have money have traveled as in the past, and those who lack money will hardly do so in the future," he said.
Serbia Steps up Efforts to Arrest Mladic
US Ambassador to Serbia-Montenegro Michael Polt says Washington is counting on Belgrade to meet its international obligations.
Meanwhile, efforts to nab fugitive war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic have increased.

US Ambassador Michael Polt reiterated last week that his government is determined to see fugitive war crimes indictees Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic brought to justice.
Washington is counting on Serbia-Montenegro to meet its international obligations, Polt told the Belgrade daily Politika on 23 August.
His statement came amid rumours that Belgrade has been given an October deadline to extradite Mladic, or face sanctions.
Asked about this, Polt said the deadline was "yesterday" -- that is, Mladic should have been arrested long ago, and the international community expects immediate action.
He rejected speculation that a deal has been struck between Belgrade and Washington, under which four retired generals indicted for war crimes in Kosovo would be tried in Serbia if Mladic were extradited.
Serbian authorities have stepped up efforts to find and arrest him.
According to Polt, co-operation between Belgrade and the United States has also increased.
"Especially after Boris Tadic’s victory in the presidential election, both he and [Prime Minister Vojislav] Kostunica and his government are co-operating actively with us.
They assure us that they are completely devoted to finding, arresting and extraditing Ratko Mladic to The Hague.
We are working together with them to make sure that the verbal promises and undertaken obligations are transferred into action," Polt said at a press conference over the summer.
"Co-operation refers to everything that the security services and the police in Serbia-Montenegro can do in making progress and, above all, establishing where Mladic is located, and to subsequently make a plan for his arrest," he said, in response to journalists' questions.
Tadic, who took office in July, has pledged that Mladic would be arrested if found in Serbia.
In an interview with the daily Vecernje Novosti, he cited police and military reports which, he said, indicated that Mladic is hiding out in the border regions of Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Greece Considers Future of Olympic Sports Facilities
Maintaining the sports facilities built for the 2004 Athens Olympics will cost tens of millions of euros annually.
With the Games over, authorities are considering how to use the venues in the future.

Days after the end of the Athens Olympics, Greek authorities are mulling over the best possible future use for some of the venues and facilities built for the Games.
Greece was initially planning to spend 4.6 billion euros on the Games, but preliminary estimates suggest the final budget figure will likely exceed 7 billion euros.
Of this, at least 2.5 billion euros reportedly went towards the construction of new venues and the renovation of existing ones.
Maintenance costs for more than a dozen of the venues, including the main Olympic stadium, will range between 50m euros and 100m euros annually.
Authorities are anxious to come up with ways to prevent them from becoming "white elephants" -- a term used by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for costly venues of little post-Games use.
"There are ideas.
Some plans are being studied.
But there is no definite solution," the AP quoted Christos Hadjiemmanuel, the head of the state-run Olympic Properties company, as saying.
The future of some venues reportedly has been decided.
The Olympic village, for instance, will be turned into apartments for low-income workers, while the media and broadcast centres will be used as exhibition and conference halls.
Other options that are being discussed, according to the International Herald Tribune, include finding private buyers for facilities such as stadiums and others, renewing Athens's bid to bring the Games permanently to their home country, and organising -- independently from the IOC -- Greece's own Olympics, to be held biannually in years not conflicting with IOC Games.
As the country basked in the worldwide praise it received for conducting successful and safe Games, Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis said in a televised address Monday (30 August) that the event heralded the start of a new era for Greece.
"We must prove that the success of such a great and complicated undertaking is not limited to two weeks of celebrations.
It is a watershed of the new era," Karamanlis said. "It is an investment in the new period that Greece is beginning.
It is capital for the years that are coming."
In other news, cabinet spokesman Thodoris Roussopoulos said Tuesday that the government is proposing the establishment of a special parliamentary committee to address the problem of doping athletes.
Several doping scandals marred the Olympics, including one involving track stars Costas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou, who withdrew from the Games.
The government has decided to tighten controls over health and sports organisations and impose stricter penalties for the distribution and use of banned substances.

Only 13% of Serbia's population uses the internet, the Serbian Ministry of Telecommunications and Information Society reported on Wednesday (November 14th).
According to the ministry, the high prices of internet access and the scarcity of information in Serbian are key factors.
Representatives of the Montenegrin Academy of Science and Arts and the Polish Academy of Science signed an agreement Monday (November 13th) on scientific co-operation between the two institutions.
It was signed during a visit to Warsaw by a Montenegrin Science Academy delegation.
Archaeologists have discovered what is believed to be the oldest iron workshop in the world, during excavations in the central Black Sea province of Corum, Turkey.
The workshop, dating back to the Bronze Age, unveiled important evidence of the life of the Hittites.
Bulgaria and Slovakia signed an agreement last week regarding co-operation in the industrial, technical and technological sectors.
The accord is intended to boost private sector participation in the two countries' industrial and technological growth.

Albanian Programme Aims to Combat HIV/AIDS
Health authorities in Albania have prepared a national strategy to combat HIV/AIDS.
The programme is intended to prevent the disease and to care for those who are infected.
By Ardi Pulaj for Southeast European Times in Tirana - 15/03/04

Albania has prepared a six-year national strategy aimed at fighting HIV and AIDS.
The health ministry is in charge of the project, which is being sponsored by the UNDP and assisted by experts from other ministries, international organisations and NGOs.
The goal is to maintain Albania's status as a country with comparatively few HIV/AIDS cases.
The WHO reports that the prevalence of this disease in Albania is less that 1 in 1,000, which is considered a very low level.
According to the programme co-ordinators, the emphasis will be on disease prevention and treatment of infected persons.
The latter issue is crucial because of the high cost of medication.
"We know that together with caring for the infected persons, we have to concentrate on preventing the disease," says project co-ordinator Erjon Dasho, adding that this will be realised through campaigns in schools and the media.
The education ministry, meanwhile, is trying to improve sex education in schools.
Also envisioned are more efforts to market condoms, circulate information among drug users about syringes, protect donated blood and promote voluntary HIV/AIDS tests.
Official sources confirm that the health ministry has started to buy medicine to treat those infected, adding that 25 out of all the infected cases need urgent treatment.
The government has announced the allocation of 126m euros for treatment.
According to information made public on Worlds AIDS Day in 2003, Albania has 116 cases of persons with HIV or AIDS.
Five cases are children under 15 years old.
In all, nearly 40 people have died from AIDS in the country.
Prior to 2000, 42 cases of HIV/AIDS were diagnosed and reported. In 2000, 10 new cases of HIV/AIDS were reported; 20 new cases in 2001; 26 cases in 2002; and 18 cases in 2003.
The largest number of cases is in the 20 to 40-year old age bracket.
More than 82 per cent of people infected with HIV are unemployed, 65.7 per cent are emigrants, and 65 per cent have had no formal education.
A report launched by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and UNICEF in 2003 found that the disease especially threatens the mobile population.
That includes returnees, labour migrants, rural-to-urban migrants, refugees, internally displaced people, victims of trafficking, commercial sex workers and humanitarian workers.
"The links between mobility and HIV/AIDS are related to the conditions and the structure of the migration process," says Maurizio Busatti, chief of the IOM Mission in Albania.
Other groups at high risk include young people living without parental care, ethnic minorities, drug users and homosexuals.

A review of business and economic news from the Balkans since 14 May:
The mid-term development strategy for Bosnia and Herzegovina presented in Sarajevo on 17 May envisions that the country's economy will become self-sustaining by 2007.
By that time, BiH is expected to have restored its credit trustworthiness on international markets and to have established a functioning market economy, the plan notes.
An IMF team led by the Fund's desk chief in Macedonia, Franek Rozwadowski, has arrived in the country to review co-operation over the past 10 years.
The delegation is expected to meet with Finance Minister Nikola Popovski and other officials to discuss a possible extension of the current arrangement by six months, until the end of 2004 or the conclusion of a new stand-by arrangement.
The World Bank announced the approval of 13 grants for Albania under its Small Grants Programme for empowering civil society organisations.
The Tirana office of the Bank reviewed 62 project proposals before making the selection.
Total funding under the programme is $48,000.
Turkey's Telecommunications Board distributed long-distance telephone service licenses to 27 companies on 17 May.
The companies entered the market after Turk Telecom's monopoly ended on 1 January.
The Austrian consortium AHW, which includes Raiffeisen Investment, SAPP and Drawa Trading, will control 70 per cent of a new joint venture to manage Bosnia and Herzegovina's leading cellulose and paper producer, Natron.
AHW's investments in Natron under the agreement are set to reach 33m euros.
The Macedonian government and the Greek industrial group Mitilineos agreed to start talks on the sale of the Sasa and Zletovo lead and zinc mines.
The investor is reportedly offering to pay 650,000 euros for Sasa and 250,000 euros for Zletovo.
The two mines employ more than 2,500 people.
The Croatian government allocated 250,000 euros to 35 NGOs to implement a total of 100 ecological projects.
The financing is double that allocated in 2003, the ecology ministry said.
The Slovenian department store chain Merkator said it plans to invest 44.2m euros in Croatia this year.
Of that amount, 26.7m euros will go towards the construction of two trading centres in Osijek and Zadar.
Merkator also plans to create 450 new jobs in 2004, including at two outlets to be built by the end of the year in Dakovo and Cakovec.
The Bulgarian customs directorate announced that it collected 614m euros in revenues during the first quarter.
In April, revenues increased by 25 per cent compared to a year ago.
The increase, however, was less than the 31.4 per cent registered in March.

OHR Official Urges BiH Politicians to Change Approach
A senior international official in Bosnia and Herzegovina is urging local politicians to change their overall approach so that the project of transforming the country can be carried out successfully.
(Office of the High Representative, Fena - 14/09/04)
"Political leaders in BiH for the most part have yet to conceive a clear vision of the kind of country they are trying to build," said Principal Deputy High Representative Donald Hays. [OHR]
A senior international official urged politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) on Tuesday (14 September) to change their overall approach to meet the challenge of transforming their country.
According to Donald Hays, the principal deputy of the top international envoy in BiH, Paddy Ashdown, the success of the transformation project depends on individuals who have a vision, a plan for achieving it, and the ability to communicate effectively with those who will play a role in the process.
Such "agents of change" are vital to carrying out the difficult, but necessary reforms that will ensure a better future for the country, Hays said at a conference in Sarajevo.
"Political leaders in BiH for the most part have yet to conceive a clear vision of the kind of country they are trying to build," he said. "Nor has there been an easy-to-comprehend plan regarding a strategy to construct that vision; and consequently they have been unsuccessful to date in effectively communicating their vision and strategy."
BiH politicians, Hays noted, have in the past been reluctant to push ahead with reforms, fearing loss of popularity.
"In other transition countries, such successful reformers have been voted out of office, only to have their incoming critics benefit when the reforms start to deliver positive results," he said.
However, he added, the pain of implementing critical reforms is compensated by measurable gains.
If change leads to a visibly better life, then the agents of change can pursue the reform agenda without exhausting their political capital, Hays said.
"In short, we need a political class that is self confident rather than self-promoting and polemic.
And I believe that we are experiencing such a change in the character of BiH politicians," Hays said. "As we move from the push of Dayton to the pull of Brussels, we see that many of the transition issues that were obscured by the war and its aftermath -- issues of tedious but necessary economic adjustment, issues of European convergence and globalisation -- require fresh ideas and fresh faces.
We may see the results of this in the coming elections."
For BiH, the destination is Europe, and this goal can motivate people to make the necessary sacrifices, Hays said. "Europe means stability, visa-free travel, the very real prospect of prosperity, and the best guarantee for their future," he added.
Territorial Organisation in Macedonia Faces November Referendum
On 7 November, Macedonian voters will weigh in on the country's recently adopted laws on territorial organisation.
By Marija Lazarova for Southeast European Times in Skopje – 15/09/04

The Macedonian Parliament has scheduled a referendum on the country's new territorial organisation laws for 7 November.
The decision came after the World Macedonian Congress, the organisation behind the push for a referendum, gathered 180,454 signatures in support of the initiative.
The signatures were collected during the legally required six-month window between 23 February and 23 August.
Opening the parliamentary session devoted to the issue, Parliament Speaker Ljupco Jordanovski explained that under the constitution, MPs should not discuss the referendum itself and could only consider the date on which it will be held.
The recently adopted laws fulfil Macedonia's remaining commitments under the Ohrid Peace Accords, which brought an end to seven months of interethnic turmoil in 2001.
The opposition VMRO-DPMNE Party and Liberal Democrats said the date should be the one preferred by the initiators of the referendum.
"The World Macedonian Congress … wants the plebiscite to take place on 21 November," said VMRO-DPMNE said, "so I think this date, which does not overlap the Muslim religious holiday of Ramadan, should be upheld."
According to Rafis Aliti of the junior coalition member Democratic Union for Integration, however, it is best that the vote be held as soon as possible.
"For us as a party, the 7 November proposal is acceptable," Aliti said, "and religious affairs should not be involved in this."
Macedonian voters will be answering yes or no to the referendum question: "Do you favour local self-government territorial organisation (municipalities and the City of Skopje) as defined in the Law on Territorial Organisation of the Republic of Macedonia and Definition of Areas of Local Self-Government Units issued in 1996 and the Law on the City of Skopje issued the same year?"
By law, a referendum is considered valid if a majority of voters support it and turnout is greater than 50 per cent.
The result is binding and must be observed by state bodies.
Local elections in Macedonia had been scheduled for 21 November, but will now be delayed as a result of the referendum.
Parliament voted to amend the law on local elections, deciding that local elections will now take place during the first week of March every fourth year.
The 2005 local vote is the exception: it will take place on 31st March.
Meanwhile, the EU has warned Macedonia that its chances of membership could be jeopardised if voters reject the laws on territorial organisation.
Speaking on Tuesday (14 September), Dutch Foreign Minister Bernard Bot -- whose country currently holds the EU's rotating presidency -- said the Union considers full implementation of the Ohrid Accords "essential".
The EU also confirmed that a European Commission questionnaire concerning Macedonia's application for candidate status would be delivered to Skopje on 1 October.
As elections approach, Kurdish issue heats up
Intense competition for the Kurdish vote and a political crackdown have fueled unrest as the June 12th elections approach.

As turbulence continues throughout the Middle East, neighbouring Turkey, long revered as a model of the compatibility between Islam and democracy, is undergoing a political crisis of its own.
With national parliamentary elections scheduled for June 12th, ever-simmering tensions between the state and the Kurdish community have risen to a more dramatic level, with Kurdish candidates banned, students arrested, and threats issued on both sides.
On May 4th, militants linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party carried out an attack against Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's convoy.
Although Erdogan was unhurt, a member of his police escort was killed.
Meanwhile, the High Election Board's decision to ban 12 independent candidates backed by the largely Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) sparked intense protests throughout the southeast and elsewhere.
A Kurdish civilian died during the demonstrations.
"There is a stiff competition between the [ruling Justice and Development Party] AKP and the BDP in Kurdish areas," University of Central Florida Professor Hakan Ozoglu, a historian of Kurdish nationalism, tells SETimes. "This spike in violence can be seen as a result of this competition for power."
So strong was the public outcry that the board reversed its decision almost immediately, granting permission to the majority of the banned candidates to run for office in June.
Though this decision was met with enthusiasm, the initial ban reflects the periodically arbitrary nature of the Turkish political and juridical system.
Lehigh University Professor and Carnegie Endowment for International Peace scholar Henri Barkey called the attempted ban "a last-gasp attempt by the 'Deep State' to throw a monkey wrench into the elections," referring to anti-democratic elements within the government and military.
That the board revoked its decision so rapidly, Barkey says, "shows that people understand that you cannot prevent BDP from participating in an open way".
This in itself is a positive sign, he says, in terms of an awareness of rights.
Minerva Chair of the Institute for National Strategic Studies Denise Natali emphasises the significance of the protests themselves.
"The fact that these recent events have evoked such 'loud' responses indicates that some positive attitudinal changes have in fact, occurred," she says.
Such events stand in stark contrast to the AKP's overtures towards the Kurdish population of two years ago, when discussion turned to a "Kurdish Opening" that would grant the population unprecedented rights.
Moderate steps in that direction were taken, such as the establishment of a Kurdish-language state television station, a remarkable gesture in a country that still banned the use of the Kurdish language in public settings during the 1990s.
However, the fundamental changes that many hoped for never manifested, and relations have soured in the wake of what seems to some like broken promises.
Protests and a civil disobedience campaign have been ongoing in the predominately Kurdish southeast. [Reuters]
Natali cautions against viewing current events as a deterioration of temporarily improved relations, noting the heterogeneity of viewpoints within state structures and society.
"These types of responses are not representative of a monolithic Turkish voice.
The 'state' reaction to the Kurdish problem historically has been a mixed one, with different approaches from civilian and military elites, as different groups across the political spectrum," she explains.
Recent arrests and bans are a continuation of a longer historical trajectory.
"The arrests over the past few months were preceded for the past two and a half years by enormous political pressure on political activists," notes Aliza Marcus, Macarthur fellow and author of Blood and Belief: The PKK and the Kurdish Fight for Independence, adding that "upwards of 2,000 people have been detained and imprisoned in the past two years."
The outcome of next month's election is widely expected to be a victory for the incumbent AKP.
The remaining seats will likely be filled by the Republican People's Party (CHP) and possibly the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), along with a number of independents.
Because the BDP falls short of a 10% electoral threshold required to enter parliament, the party must field candidates as independents.
If 20 or more of these candidates are able to win seats, they can form a bloc and be able to influence the parliamentary agenda, Barkey explained.
BDP, the latest manifestation of a series of banned Kurdish-backed political parties, has exhibited unparalleled success in the past year, so such a prospect is not out of reach.
According to Barkey, the party's heightened status is most evident in its ability to organise "an almost universal boycott" in the southeast of last year's September 12th referendum on constitutional changes.
After the election itself, the AKP has vowed to pursue major reforms to the constitution, an outdated and widely unpopular product of the 1980 military coup.
"Kurds expect that the government has to do something serious, something major," says Barkey. "The problem is that the Kurdish situation has come to a point where the constitution is what is really holding up" substantive progress in regards to Kurdish rights and state-Kurdish relations.
The opportunity to help shape constitutional reform and cement minority rights is seen as crucial to the BDP and the Kurdish population as a whole.

Natali emphasises that nationalist demands make up only a piece of the Kurdish platform.
Of particular value in the reformed constitution, she says, would be "a more inclusive notion of citizenship", which, "alongside proven facts on the ground, could encourage more positive relations between the Kurds in Turkey and the state".
In the meantime, threats and accusations continue to be voiced on all sides.
In the past two weeks alone, independent BDP Kurdish parliamentary candidate Aysel Tugluk announced that Kurds will "build our own democracy" if the state doesn't grant it.
Erdogan completely dismissed the notion of a "Kurdish problem", though State Minister Bulent Arinc quickly stepped in to clarify that the AKP does recognise the issue.
Meanwhile, PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan warned from his prison cell of large scale violence after June 15th if an agreement between the government and Kurds cannot be reached.
Thus, while the potential for positive change after the coming election is quite real, it is clear that no immediate solution is forthcoming, and that the path forward may not be a straight one.
"Institutions do not change overnight," emphasises Natali, adding that real change and reconciliation are "going to take time, and will include steps forward and backward".
Ozoglu sounded an even starker note: "I predict that it will get worse before it gets better," he told SETimes.

Orson Welles becomes "Citizen of Split"
A new sculpture honours the legendary director and actor, who had a long association with the city.

A year ago, local photographer Fedja Klaric thought that a monument of Orson Welles should be erected in Split, because he had enjoyed spending time in the city and in other Dalmatian towns in the last two decades of his life.
Zeljko Kerum, a local businessman and owner of the multiplex movie theatre and shopping centre, financed the project in hopes it will increase tourism and revenue.
"With the unveiling of Orson Welles' sculpture in Split's Broadarica area, Citizen Kane has become a new citizen of Split," Klaric said.
''I once visited a hotel in Vienna where a wall inscription said that Mozart almost spent a night in that hotel, but his intention had been interrupted for some reason," he explained. "That inspired me to use the opportunity to forge a link between Split and one of the greatest movie directors ever."
In the late 1960s, Orson Welles met Croatian actress and sculptor Oja Kodar, with whom he spent about 20 years, until his death in 1985.
She was delighted with Klaric's idea and agreed to make the sculpture herself.
''Orson loved the tiny Mediterranean stone-built streets of Split and other Dalmatian coastal towns," Kodar said. "He enjoyed the locals and had many friends.
Unfortunately, all have passed away before seeing his monument unveiled."
Welles frequently visited Split and nearby Primosten, where the couple shared a villa, Kodar said.
''Orson even supported the Split football team, Hajduk.
One of the players, Geza Senauer, was his close friend, and Orson would attend the games.
He found something in common with the fiery temperament of people in the Croatian coastal region of Dalmatia," she said.
Kodar' s original name was Olga Palinkas.
She changed it to "Oja Kodar" because "kodar" in Croatian means "gift".
Welles used to tell her that she was like a gift to him, she explained to the large audience at the unveiling of the sculpture.
Meanwhile, Klaric would like to see Welles honoured in another way.
He wants a street in Split to be named after him.
Welles filmed ''Process in Croatia'' and also acted in a few Croatian movies such as ''The Secret of Nicola Tesla'' and ''The Battle on Neretva''.
He started but never completed a few projects in Split and on the nearby island of Hvar.
Serbia's presidential race could be a "serious turning point"
Nine candidates will take part in Serbia's presidential election Sunday, but polls show that only two stand a chance of winning -- pro-European incumbent Boris Tadic and Serbian Radical Party candidate Tomislav Nikolic.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 17/01/08

Many Belgrade analysts believe that Sunday's (January 20th) Serbian presidential elections will decide the future of the country and its European integration.
Nine politicians are running for president, but the favorites are Democratic Party leader and current Serbian President Boris Tadic and Serbian Radical Party deputy leader Tomislav Nikolic.
Tadic, who took office in 2004, advocates Serbia's accelerated integration into the EU.
Nikolic favours association with Russia and says Moscow should be invited to establish military bases in Serbia.
Nikolic also announced that he would appoint Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj, who is on trial for war crimes before The Hague tribunal, as prime minister-designate.
Tadic and Nikolic agree on one matter -- Serbia will not recognise the independence of Kosovo.
The province, which has a majority ethnic Albanian population, has been under UN administration since 1999.
Kosovo Albanian leaders have announced that they will declare independence in a few weeks, in co-ordination with the United States and major European countries.
The duel between the two frontrunners could be decided by a third politician -- Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
Polls show that Tadic could beat Nikolic only with support from all ruling coalition partners, especially Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia.
But Kostunica disagrees with Tadic's plan to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU if the Union sends a mission to Kosovo, as planned, to replace the current UN mission there.
The prime minister insists that the EU cannot support Kosovo's independence and, at the same time, sign the SAA with Serbia.
For now, Kostunica has chosen to back his coalition partner from the previous parliamentary election, Velimir Ilic, who is expected to get around 8% of the vote.
Liberal Democrat leader Cedomir Jovanovic is the only presidential candidate in favour of Kosovo's independence.
Like Ilic, Jovanovic stands to win about 8% of votes on Sunday.
Five other candidates are expected to garner even less.
By law, if none of the candidates wins more than 50% of the first-round votes, the top two candidates must go to a runoff.
In that round, the candidate with the majority of votes wins.
According to polls conducted by the Belgrade-based Center for Free Elections and Democracy, the race will be extremely tight.
Nikolic is expected to have the advantage over Tadic in the first round with an estimated 1.15 million votes, while Tadic is expected to pull about 1.05 million.
Turnout will play a major role in the outcome.
A low turnout could benefit the Radicals, as they have highly disciplined voters.
However, Strategic Marketing Director Srdjan Bogosavljevic said that the chances for Nikolic to win in the first round are very slim, since the remaining seven candidates would most likely "take away about 25% of the votes".
Serbia "is essentially facing a serious turning point, if a power shift occurs," Bogosavljevic said.
Security Council remains split on Kosovo's status
Kosovo will never enter the UN or other international political organisations if it declares independence, Russia warned at a Security Council meeting Wednesday, while Western nations reiterated their support for the province's drive for statehood.

"They [Kosovo] would not become members of the UN, they would not become members of international political institutions ... if they go down the road of unilateral declarations," Russian Ambassador to the UN Vitaly Churkin told reporters. [Getty Images]
The UN Security Council met on Wednesday (January 16th) to discuss Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's report on UNMIK's activities and developments in Kosovo during the last quarter of 2007.
Failure to progress towards resolving the province's future status could jeopardise regional stability and UN achievements in Kosovo, the report warned.
"Moving forward with a process to determine Kosovo's future status should remain a high priority for the Security Council and for the international community," said the Secretary-General..
After 18 months of internationally sponsored talks between Belgrade and Pristina failed to produce an agreement, the leaders of Kosovo's 90% ethnic Albanian majority are now planning to adopt a unilateral declaration of independence from Serbia.
Serbian President Boris Tadic, whose country opposes the province's bid for statehood and is offering broad autonomy instead, urged the Security Council on Wednesday to prevent any such move.
He also called for further negotiations towards a compromise acceptable to both sides.
Tadic also assured the 15-nation body that his country "will not resort to violence and war".
But should violence break out in the province and if KFOR was unable to adequately protect the Kosovo Serbs, "we are ready… to help provide protection to the threatened population" with the agreement of competent international institutions, he added.
Welcoming Tadic's pledge that Serbia will refrain from violence, US Ambassador to the UN Zalmay Khalilzad also urged Belgrade to refrain from imposing "economic measures" on Kosovo, which reportedly could include cutting off the province's power supplies.
He also cautioned the country against taking any steps that could mar its long-term relations with the United States and EU nations, most of which are expected to join Washington in recognising an independent Kosovo even without UN endorsement.
Russia, one of the five veto-wielding members of the Security Council, has been backing Serbia in its opposition to granting the province any form of statehood and has vowed to block any UN decision on Kosovo's future that is not acceptable to Belgrade.
Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin insisted on Wednesday that the province's final status is a Security Council issue, not an EU one, and that member nations should prepare a roadmap towards a negotiated solution.
Churkin also warned that an independent Kosovo would never become a member of the UN or other international political organisations.
"Going down the way of unilateral moves, Kosovo is not going to join the ranks of fully recognised members of the international community," he said.
Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci, who was only allowed to address the Council during a closed-door part of Wednesday's session, voiced the province's determination to proceed with declaring independence, telling reporters it is necessary for regional stability.
"Kosovo has established democratic and multiethnic institutions and is ready for a final decision," he said, pledging that it would become a "country of equal opportunities for all its citizens".
He also said he would work for promoting a good relationship with Serbia.
SEE prime ministers reach agreement on free trade
The prime ministers of eight Southeast European nations have agreed to launch negotiations on a regional trade agreement.
It would extend the existing CEFTA to cover all Western Balkan countries.

At a summit in Bucharest, the prime ministers of eight Southeast European countries agreed on Thursday (6 April) to establish a single free trade zone by expanding and modernising the existing Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA).
By the end of the year, the process is expected to lead to the conclusion of a single Regional Trade Agreement (RTA), which would replace a myriad of bilateral free trade agreements between SEE countries.
The summit was hosted by Romanian Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu, whose country holds the CEFTA chairmanship this year.
He was joined by his Bulgarian and Croatian counterparts, Sergey Stanishev and Ivo Sanader, whose countries are the only other current CEFTA members.
Bulgaria and Romania may exit the pact in early 2007, when they are scheduled to join the EU.
The other prime ministers in attendance were Albania's Sali Berisha, Bosnia and Herzegovina's Adnan Terzic, Macedonia's Vlado Buckovski, Moldova's Vasile Tarlev, Montenegro's Milo Djukanovic and Serbia's Vojislav Kostunica.
UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen represented Kosovo in the meeting, organised by Tariceanu and Erhard Busek, the special co-ordinator for the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe.
The initiative is backed by the EU, which was represented in Bucharest by Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn and Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson.
Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel, whose country currently holds the rotating EU membership, also attended the summit.
Since 2001, countries in the region have concluded 31 bilateral free trade agreements with each other.
A single RTA would consolidate bilateral trade concessions in the existing accords, through which more than 90 per cent of trade in the region has been liberalised, including almost all trade in industrial products.
In addition to extending the CEFTA to cover all countries in the region, the RTA would modernise it, by adding new provisions for harmonising rules and regulations, improving dispute settlement, trade in services and the protection of intellectual property.
Trade within the region increased 33 per cent between 2001, when it totalled 2.7 billion euros, and 2004, when it reached 3.5 billion euros, according to European Commission figures.
At the same time, trade with the rest of the world marked a 21 per cent growth -- from 30.2 billion euros in 2001 to 36.4 billion euros in 2004.
Trade between the SEE countries and the EU increased from 52 billion euros in 2001 to 79.8 billion euros in 2005, marking a growth of 53 per cent.
The RTA is expected to bolster trade in the region and to boost much-needed investment.
"This initiative helps the countries to prepare for the economic co-operation that is an inherent part of EU membership," Rehn said ahead of Thursday's meeting. "It is also an excellent example of regional co-operation becoming reality, and it is also a good training ground for economic co-operation in preparation for EU membership."
Serbs still not ready to return to Kosovo politics
Kosovo Serb representatives remain unwilling to rejoin the political structures in Kosovo, despite calls from the provisional government and UNMIK.
In addition, Belgrade is pressuring members of the community to give up wages they may have been receiving from Kosovo institutions.

Speaking on Thursday (6 April), Kosovo Deputy Prime Minister Lutfi Haziri appealed to the province's Serbs to return to the provisional institutions.
The community, he said, "should not become a hostage of Belgrade politics".
"Their future is in Kosovo and within the institutions," Haziri said.
However, Kosovo Serb representatives say they are not ready to return.
"We are looking at what to do, but we don't just want to serve as decor," says Randjel Nojkic, a community leader who is also a member of Serbia's delegation for talks with Pristina.
Serbs have boycotted Kosovo politics for two years, saying their presence amounts to window-dressing.
On Wednesday, UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen criticised Serbia for pushing the Kosovo Serb community to continue its boycott, and for demanding that they give up wages from the province's budget.
"Building confidence and reassuring minorities is the responsibility of all Kosovo Albanians, but in order to be fully effective it also requires a constructive engagement by Belgrade," Jessen-Petersen said.
Under a directive from Belgrade's Co-ordination Centre for Kosovo, Serbs are being asked to relinquish salaries they receive from the Kosovo provisional institutions on top of the subsidies paid to them by Serbia.
The move affects Serbs who have held positions in local self-government, health and educational institutions.
In effect, it means that all Kosovo Serbs would be equally dependent on subsidies from Belgrade.
The Co-ordination Centre says the move is meant to fend off disparities and tensions among Kosovo Serbs.
Jessen-Petersen criticised the Co-ordination Centre for working to speed the departure of Kosovo Serbs from the institutions.
That goes against the international community's wishes for a multiethnic Kosovo, he said.
"The new political leadership in Kosovo, including the new prime minister, has injected new momentum into standards implementation," Jessen-Petersen said in a press release Thursday."We all wanted to see this continue to translate into real results, including on minority issues."
Athens Calls for Firm EU Commitment to Western Balkan Countries' Accession
Speaking at a two-day meeting on Southeast Europe, Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou praised regional progress but said there was a continuing need for reforms in the Western Balkans.
(FT - 25/05/03; Hellenic EU Presidency, HINA, Macedonian Press Agency - 24/05/03; World Economic Forum - 23/05/03)
Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou said Saturday (24 May) that the EU should signal a firm commitment to the accession of the Western Balkan countries when members meet in Thessaloniki next month.
Warning against "enlargement fatigue", Papandreou called for overcoming stereotypes and prejudices about the region and for promoting a new, positive vision.
"It would be impossible to imagine how the greatest peace project of the last 50 years, the EU, could pretend that its task is complete until it embraces this very region, where, unluckily, so much blood has been spilled so recently," Papandreou said during his keynote address at a two-day meeting on Southeast Europe, organised jointly by the World Economic Forum and the Greek EU presidency.
The Athens conference opened Friday, drawing 300 participants from 31 countries, including foreign investors, regional business leaders, politicians and opinion-makers.
The presidents of Croatia and Macedonia attended the forum, along with the prime ministers of Albania, Kosovo, Republika Srpska and the two constituent republics of Serbia-Montenegro.
Cabinet ministers represented Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey.
In his address, Papandreou spoke of the need "to move from a strategy of stabilisation and association . to a much more robust strategy focusing on policies and instruments that promote real cohesion and real integration into the EU".
The Union, he said, must find the funds needed to implement those policies.
Greece has called for the allocation of 300m euros in annual EU financial assistance for projects in the five Western Balkan countries -- Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia and Serbia-Montenegro -- between 2004 and 2006.
This is in addition to the 4.6 billion euros already earmarked for the region.
While praising the progress countries in the region have been making towards sustainable development, Papandreou spoke of a continuing need to accelerate reforms.
"The rule of law isn't as strong as it should be and organised crime is one important issue that has to be addressed," he said.
Panellists at the Athens meeting noted remarkable economic and political achievements in Southeast Europe over the past four years, but agreed that much work remains to achieve the stability, infrastructure, institution-building and good governance needed to sustain and propel this growth.
The EU is to expand into a 25-member organisation with the accession of ten more countries due to join in 2004.
Bulgaria and Romania are expected to become EU members in 2007, and Turkey has been recognised as an EU candidate since 1999.
Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria continue to battle Danube floodwaters
Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria are working hard to make sure embankments will not give way as Europe's second-longest river rose to a 111-year record high.
(FT, The Scotsman, International Herald Tribune, Irish Examiner, Independent, The Times - 17/04/06; AP, Reuters, BBC, CNN, FT, Rompres, Mediafax, BNN, Sofia news Agency, Mediapool, Dnevnik.bg - 16/04/06)

Hundreds of people in Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria have been forced to leave their homes as spring snow melt and heavy rains pushed the Danube River to record high levels, causing floods in many parts across the region.
Emergency workers and volunteers were working hard Sunday (16 April) to make sure that embankments would not give way as Europe's second-longest river rose to a 111-year record high.
Serbian authorities have declared a state of emergency in ten regions as the Danube and its three tributaries, the Sava, the Tisa and the Tamis rivers, reached dangerous levels.
Belgrade, the meeting point of the Danube and the Sava rivers, is among the Serbian cities hit by the floods, which have left lower-lying streets of the capital and an ancient fortress under water.
The Danube reached a level of 843cm there, leading to the closure of waterfront roads to traffic.
About 100 buildings have been damaged and several hundred of the city's residents have been evacuated.
A bottleneck at Serbia's narrow Djerdap gorge, near the border with Romania, is said to have caused the Danube waters to rise upstream all the way to Belgrade.
"We have reinforced barriers which will resist the wave, but the question is how long the water level will remain so high," said Srdjan Jovanovic, the head of Belgrade's flood defence team. "That's what's worrying."
Jovanovic also appealed to residents to avoid a popular recreation spot on the Sava.
Some young women, according to him, had pierced sandbags with their high heels, raising the risk of collapse.
"The danger is big, and water can break the top of the dikes.
The whole recreation area would be flooded in only a few seconds," he said.
In Serbia, the highest water level of 957cm was recorded at Veliko Gladiste, where the Danube forms the border with Romania.
The river could rise a further 30cm within the next few days.
In the country's northern Vojvodina province, about 10,000 hectares of farmland have been completely swamped and some 200,000 hectares have been turned into mud and slush that could threaten crops in Serbia's breadbasket.
In Romania, where 12 districts are in a state of emergency, authorities have ordered the controlled flooding of up to 90,000 hectares of forests and farmland in a bid to prevent the river from engulfing urban areas there and across the river in Bulgaria.
"The water flow has fallen by 200 cubic metres per second," Reuters quoted Beatrice Popescu, of the Romanian Environment Ministry, as saying. "This is a success."
Neighbouring Bulgaria, meanwhile, has declared a crisis situation in all municipalities in seven regions that stretch down the Danube River valley.
In the northwestern Bulgarian port city of Vidin, home to about 50,000 people, an emergency tent camp for 1,200 people has been set up just outside the city.
The water level there reached 966cm during the weekend.
Most of the city's industrial zone is flooded.
Some 40 per cent of the town of Nikopol, to the east of Vidin, was inundated Saturday, when the Danube waters rose to 865cm.
Soldiers and divers continued to fortify dikes there and in other partially swamped towns, including Lom.
Bulgarian Emergency Management Minister Emel Etem, meanwhile, warned that the Danube would reach a new peak by Wednesday.
Wisner urges Kosovo's people to look to the future

The solution to the Kosovo status issue must be one that contributes to regional stability and prosperity, the US envoy for Kosovo status talks, Frank Wisner, said during a weekend visit to the province.
He also reiterated Washington's view regarding timing.
"The US stance on Kosovo's status remains the same, a solution should be reached by the end of this year," Wisner said on Friday (14 April) after arriving in Pristina, where he met with Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu, Prime Minister Agim Ceku and the Kosovo negotiating team.
Wisner praised the efforts made by the ethnic Albanian majority in reaching out to the Serb minority.
"I am very pleased to see this devotion towards a safer future for these communities, but also for the good understanding between majority and minorities, including also Serbs," he said.
On Saturday, the US diplomat visited the city of Prizren, where he urged all ethnic communities to look beyond the past in order to build a new Kosovo.
He called on Kosovo's people to undertake important steps in restoring interethnic confidence and reconciliation and make it clear that all citizens will have a peaceful and prosperous future.
During a stop in Mitrovica, Wisner called for collaboration between the northern and southern parts of the ethnically divided city.
He also urged Kosovo Serbs to take part in provisional institutions, and said he disagreed with Belgrade's recent demand that Serbs employed in those institutions give up their UN-paid salaries or lose funding provided by Serbia.
Wisner, who is on a diplomatic tour of the region, arrived in Kosovo after a stop in Skopje, where he met with Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski and discussed the issue of demarcating Macedonia's border with Kosovo.
On Monday, Wisner was due in Belgrade for meetings with Serbian President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
Meanwhile, a new incident at the weekend marred the already troubled interethnic relations in Mitrovica.
According to local media reports, two bombs were thrown at the house of a local Serb resident, Zorica Mitrovic.
One of the devices exploded, causing damage.
Kosovo police have launched a probe, while local Serb leader Nebojsa Jovic repeated a call on UNMIK to tighten sanctions against extremist attacks targeting the Serb minority.
Microsoft eyes Albanian market
Microsoft is looking to expand its presence in Albania, but says the process will take time.
During a recent visit to Tirana, the company's chief of operations for Southeast Europe urged authorities to safeguard software copyrights and boost public awareness about computers.

The software giant Microsoft appears interested in expanding its presence in Albania.
An Albanian-language version of its Office XP system is being released for the first time, and the company is mulling over a plan to computerise the country's schools.
"We will need three up to five years to get profitable results from the Albanian market," the head of Microsoft's operations in Southeast Europe, Goran Radman, told reporters during a visit to Tirana last month. "This is a process that will start with the technical expertise and training.
In the meantime we will work for reaching an agreement ...
I am happy to announce that we have made the first steps," he said.
Radman urged Albanian authorities to safeguard Microsoft's copyrights and ensure fair play in the market, and said the country stood to benefit greatly from the introduction of new technology.
"Every service can be facilitated starting from the distribution of car licenses, birth certificates and tax payments," Radman said. "By applying our technology the authorities and the public will reduce the time for services."
At the beginning of this year, Albanian Minister of Education and Science Genc Pollo met in Lisbon with Microsoft chief Bill Gates.
Among other things, they discussed a possible deal on computerising the country's education system and the creation of an "e-government" system meant to increase transparency of public administration and facilitate communication between citizens and the government.
"The Internet should be accessible in the schools.
From the information we have, Albanian schools do not even have computers," Radman said, suggesting that the authorities boost public awareness and provide incentives such as tax breaks for computer purchases.
Currently, the number of computers bought per year in Albania varies from 12,000 to 17,000.
In neighbouring Macedonia, the number is five times higher.
"We would like to establish a centre of new technologies in Albania, a kind of a 'technological park'.
Another idea of ours is building up a network among the Albanian diaspora and local companies in Albania for passing the information to the public," Radman said.
Microsoft is a US-based software corporation headquartered in Redmond, Washington, with 2005 global annual sales of close to $40 billion and about 64,000 employees in 85 countries and regions.

Kosovo's north on edge once more
Roads in the north are again blocked as Serbs vow to resist a takeover of border crossings by Kosovo authorities.

Only weeks after an interim agreement defused the crisis at the border, roads in northern Kosovo were again being blocked on Tuesday (September 13th) as local Serbs built barricades to protest the takeover of crossing points by Kosovo authorities.
Pristina has vowed to go ahead with the plans Friday, despite the local opposition.
"We are planning a series of peaceful protests and civic disobedience," Zubin Potok Mayor Slavisa Ristic told SETimes. We find the [takeover by] Kosovo customs unacceptable, because it means we will be cut off from Serbia, and the institutions of a state we do not recognise will be established."
Residents placed logs and bags of sand in the roadways, or used trucks and buses to prevent access.
As of Wednesday, traffic was being fully or partially impeded on the main roads leading out of Mitrovica.
In the town of Leposavic, residents were allowing only one lane of traffic to remain open, in a bid to prevent KFOR from transporting customs equipment to the Jarinje and Brnjak administrative checkpoints.
In Zvecan, however, a KFOR convoy was reportedly allowed through after residents were assured that its destination was not the border control points, but Camp Nothing Hill in Leposavic instead.
As tensions mount, the Serbian government has called on the EU, UN and NATO to prevent what it described as a "unilateral" move by Pristina, saying regional stability is at stake.
The planned takeover "jeopardises the continuation of dialogue [between Belgrade and Pristina] and implementation of the status-neutral agreements that have been reached," it said.
Kosovo authorities say they are determined to proceed as planned.
"The moment has come," Prime Minister Hashim Thaci told Radio Free Europe on Tuesday. "The revenues which will come [from the gates] and the flow of goods from Serbia to Kosovo will be paid directly to the Kosovo budget."
Speaking to SETimes, political commentator Fatlum Sadiku said last month's visit to the region by German Chancellor Angela Merkel was a game-changer, spurring EULEX to co-operate more closely with Pristina when it comes to the situation in the north.
During her visit, Merkel demanded that Serbian "parallel structures" in the north be shut down.
She directly tied Belgrade's EU prospects to the issue.
"EULEX -- since Merkel's statements -- has recognised it must be [on board the] train, because it will move with or without it," Sadiku said. "EULEX knows that Pristina wants to extend its authority and they want to be part of any action, rather than to stay and observe like in July."
Kosovo and EULEX police are prepared for any emerging situation, Security Studies Professor Abdullah Hajdari said.
"Criminal activities such as barricades or burning of the gates will not be tolerated," Hajdari told SETimes.
Mayor Ristic, however, said Kosovo Serbs should not be obliged to accept rule by a state they do not recognise as legitimate.
"The international community did not force the Albanians to accept Serbian institutions, therefore they will not be able to force us to accept Pristina institutions either," Ristic said.
The head of the Kosovo Compromise project, Aleksandar Mitic, said that while Serbs may find the options on the table unpalatable, they have limited leverage.
"One should bear in mind that the Belgrade authorities have made EU accession their priority, which has practically stripped them of the possibility of decisive action in the matter of Kosovo," Mitic told SETimes.
Nokia opens production unit and research centre in Romania
Since joining the EU in January, Romania has become a new draw for foreign investors.
Finnish mobile producer Nokia is just one of the companies opening subsidiaries in the country.

Nokia, the world's leading mobile phone supplier, will open a production unit and a research centre in Romania, under a Memorandum of Understanding that was signed recently between representatives of the Cluj County Council and the Finnish mobile producer.
Nokia will invest 60m euros in the plant -- its eleventh -- that will be built in the Tetarom III industrial park, 18km from Cluj.
Nokia Vice President Raimo Puntala said the new factory would boost the company's production capacity.
Nokia, said Puntala, sold 350 million mobile phones in 2006, up 30% from 2005.
The mobile telephony market is expected to increase 10% this year.
The Cluj factory will help meet the demand for Nokia products in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
The Transylvanian city of Cluj-Napoca was chosen due to its skilled labour force, solid internal and external logistical connections and long-standing industrial tradition, according to Nokia.
Local authorities say the area will become much more attractive to foreign investors as soon as the Transylvania motorway is finished.
Nokia will start building the plant this spring.
By year's end, 500 employees will be recruited, and production will start at the beginning of 2008.
The main suppliers will join Nokia at the location, forming Nokia Village.
Nokia will also set up a commercial company in Cluj.
Local authorities expect that the Finnish investment will have a significant impact on the county's economic development, creating 15,000 jobs.
Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu said the government would support the project through infrastructure expansion.
Cluj airport may require an addition, as Nokia delivers its products all over the world.
Ericsson, Microsoft and Renault have also announced plans to open research, support or design facilities in Romania.
NATO's Enyeart: BiH MAP challenged by elections
The new commander of NATO Headquarters Sarajevo talks to SETimes about the path to NATO membership.

US Army Brigadier General David Enyeart assumed command of NATO headquarters in Sarajevo on June 10th -- just two months after the Alliance's foreign ministers gave conditional approval to Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) Membership Action Plan (MAP).
But BiH must first resolve the issue of allocating various defence properties between the two entities.
Enyeart sat down with SETimes correspondent Valdo Kos to discuss how the country can achieve this goal.
SETimes: After BiH's conditional MAP, how do you see the political climate in the country?
Is it good enough to achieve an agreement on unmovable defence property?
Brigadier General David Enyeart: BiH has been working towards NATO membership … for many years.
This shows that the necessary long-term political commitment and consensus does exist across the entire country.
The political climate in BiH is now dominated by the upcoming [October] election.
The need to satisfy the final condition for the MAP has been overshadowed by the election, and the resolution of the ownership of defence property is now a political issue.
However, this is not the time to lose forward motion in the mistaken belief that BiH is already active within MAP.
Activities within MAP are based on an Annual National Programme (ANP), and NATO has stipulated that BiH cannot begin its first ANP until defence property has been resolved.
BiH could fulfil the one condition that NATO has applied, but the responsibility lies with BiH political leaders.
SETimes: Discussions about the MAP are virtually non-existent.
Can you explain why there is so little being said?
Enyeart: There may be little public discussion, but within the government work is definitely going ahead to draft an ANP.
This is being done by the BiH Council of Ministers' NATO Co-ordination Team.
There is considerable overlap between the NATO programmes that BiH is already working on and the ANP.
Specifically, the content of any future ANP will be very similar to the work that is currently being done within the Individual Partnership Action Plan (IPAP).
BiH should be prepared to continue working within IPAP if defence property has not been resolved by the start of the next MAP cycle in September.
SETimes: What role will NATO HQ Sarajevo play in the facilitation of talks on unmovable defence property?
Enyeart: NATO HQ Sarajevo has been working with the ministry of defence and other parties to help resolve this issue, and we remain ready to support this effort.
We are assisting in the research of the titles and paperwork to prepare the property for legal turn over to the government or entities.
We have also prepared a draft intergovernmental agreement to assist in resolving this last step so BiH can activate MAP. We hope that BiH can move forward and make this a top priority.
SETimes: You took over the command of the NATO HQ in Sarajevo from another US officer.
What does the continued presence of a US commander of the NATO HQ say about the future of the Alliance's commitment to BiH's stability?
Enyeart: At a time when our military resources are under huge pressure, the continued involvement of the United States in NATO HQ Sarajevo shows how important we regard the stability of the Western Balkans and Bosnia Herzegovina as key factors in European security.
But let me be clear, this is not a US mission.
The unique character of NATO is its ability to connect Europe and North America, and our HQ in Sarajevo is an excellent example of that shared vision.
SETimes: Why should Republika Srpska (RS) welcome NATO membership for BiH?
Enyeart: The benefits of joining NATO are improved national and regional security, stability, economic development, a more professional and cost efficient military, strengthened democratic institutions and moving closer to membership in the EU.
These benefits have been well proved for over 60 years and by 28 different member nations.
People living in RS could expect the same improvements to their standard of living.
Britain's Cameron vows to "fight" for Turkey's EU bid
British Prime Minister David Cameron says he's "angry" about the slow pace of Turkey's EU membership talks.

Reaffirming London's strong support for Turkey's EU bid, British Prime Minister David Cameron criticised on Tuesday (July 27th) opponents of the predominantly Muslim country's aspirations to join the bloc as a full-fledged member.
Visiting Ankara for the first time since assuming office in May, Cameron drew a parallel with France's attempts in the 1960s to block his country's entry into the European Economic Community, the forerunner of today's EU.
"We know what it's like to be shut out of the club," Cameron said. "But we also know that these things can change."
He said there are three categories of opponents to Turkey's membership bid: protectionists, who fear its economic power; the polarised, who want it to choose between East and West; and the prejudiced, who wilfully misunderstand Islam.
"I will always argue that the values of real Islam are not incompatible with the values of Europe, that Europe is defined not by religion, but by values," Cameron said.
Turkey began membership negotiations with the EU in October 2005.
But the process has been slow, as the country has managed to open talks on only 13 of the 35 chapters that candidate countries are required to complete.
That is largely due to Turkey's sluggish reform progress and its refusal to open its ports and airports to traffic from EU-member Cyprus, as a result of which eight of the negotiation chapters remain frozen.
Another factor contributing to the pace of the negotiations is France and Germany's insistence that Ankara should not be offered full-fledged membership in the bloc after it wraps up the talks, rather, some sort of a "privileged partnership".
While urging Turkey to continue implementing "aggressively" EU required reforms, Cameron expressed "anger" at moves to obstruct its accession progress.
"When I think about what Turkey has done to defend Europe as a NATO ally, and what Turkey is doing today in Afghanistan, alongside our European allies, it makes me angry that your progress towards EU membership can be frustrate d in the way it has been," he said. "My view is clear: I believe it is just wrong to say that Turkey can guard the camp but not be allowed to sit in the tent."
The British leader also pledged to actively promote and "fight" for Turkey's EU membership bid, saying he wanted the two countries to "pave the road from Ankara to Brussels".
Cameron signed a strategic partnership document aimed at deepening trade and defence ties with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday, and insisted that the EU could only benefit politically and economically from Turkey's membership.
Turkey, which has more young people than any of the 27 EU member states, is expected to catch up to the bloc's most populous nation, Germany, within the next six years.
It is also set to become the second-largest economy in Europe by 2050.
"A European Union without Turkey is not stronger but weaker, not more secure but less secure, not richer but poorer," Cameron stressed.

A review of business and economic news from the Balkans since 2 April:
US-based Bechtel and Turkey's Enka Insaat announced plans to jointly build a 415km motorway crossing six counties in central and western Romania. The 2.2 billion euro project is expected to be launched in early July and be completed by 2012.
The European Investment Bank will provide a 200m euro loan to Turkey to support small and medium-sized enterprises.
Funds will be channelled through five Turkish banks.
Economy Minister Ali Babacan signed the loan agreement on 8 April.
An official from Turkey's Privatisation Administration announced that the sale of the Tupras oil refinery will be signed on 18 April.
The Zorlu Group and Tatneft won the tender for a 65.76 per cent stake in Tupras with their 1.07 billion euro bid.
The US company Cabletel signed an agreement with Bulgarian natural gas operator Bulgargaz on use of the latter's fibre optic network.
Cabletel, which plans to supply the Bulgarian market with phone, Internet and cable TV services, seeks to become the first serious rival of the Bulgarian Telecommunications Company.
Germany announced it would extend 10.5m euros to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) for a water supply project in the Una-Sana canton, under an agreement signed between the two countries on 6 April.
Half of the funds will be extended as a grant, the remainder as credit under favourable terms.
Bosnia and Herzegovina's government adopted a law creating the legal framework for harmonisation of statistical standards at the state level.
Passage of this law was one of the requirements set by the European Commission for the country's integration in the EU structures.
The World Bank and Albania signed a $25m loan agreement for construction of the Vlora thermal power plant.
The Bank also agreed to provide technical assistance for reforms in the energy sector.
The Croatian National Bank reported that the inflow of foreign direct investments in Croatia increased by more than 50 per cent compared to a year ago, reaching $1.7 billion in 2003.
The rise is due in part to the privatisation of 25 per cent of the oil company INA, which brought $505m.
The number of foreign tourists visiting Croatia increased by 16.5 per cent year-on-year to 50,883 in February, the Central Bureau of Statistics announced.
Overnight stays by foreign tourists increased by 22.1 per cent to 137,558.
The largest numbers of overnight visitors came from Slovenia, Austria, Italy, Germany and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Ceku: Serbs to live "with dignity" in Kosovo
UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's blueprint for Kosovo's status contains specific provisions -- including the use of two official languages, guaranteed seats in parliament, and special status for Serb Orthodox monasteries -- meant to ensure a multiethnic future, Kosovo's prime minister told Belgrade media.

UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan for resolving the Kosovo status issue is balanced and gives concrete guarantees to Serbs and other minorities in the province that they can live safely, Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku told the Belgrade daily Glas javnosti.
In an interview published on Monday (February 5th), Ceku cited concrete provisions in the roadmap, including the use of two official languages (Albanian and Serb), legislative mechanisms for protecting the national interests of Kosovo Serbs, guaranteed seats in parliament for minorities, a special status for Serb Orthodox monasteries and cultural and historical monuments, and other privileges related to decentralisation.
The roadmap ensures that Serbs will be able to remain in Kosovo and live there with dignity, Ceku said.
He added that if Kosovo becomes independent, it would pursue economic co-operation with Serbia, without any prejudices.
Ties between Belgrade and Pristina will improve greatly once the status issue is finally settled, he said.
Ahtisaari's proposal, presented Friday in both Belgrade and Pristina, does not specifically mention independence, but would give the province "the right to negotiate and conclude international agreements, including the right to seek membership in international organisations".
Meanwhile, supervision by an international civilian and military presence would ensure peace and stability.
At a press conference in Pristina on Friday, the UN envoy said his blueprint aimed to set out the provisions needed for a future Kosovo that is viable, sustainable and stable.
The plan "includes detailed measures to ensure the promotion and protection of the rights of communities and their members, the effective decentralisation of government, and the preservation and protection of cultural and religious heritage," he said.
A number of new Kosovo Serb majority municipalities will be established with additional competences, particularly in the areas of education and public health, he said.
"More than 40 key religious and cultural sites will have Protective Zones to ensure that the Serbian Orthodox Church will remain a living religious community," he noted.
The plan includes specific representation mechanisms meant to safeguard and encourage the participation of non-Albanians in public institutions.
"To protect the rights of Kosovo non-Albanian communities in the legislative process, the settlement also provides that certain enumerated laws may only be enacted if a majority of the Kosovo non-Albanian members of the Assembly agree to their adoption," Ahtisaari said.
Belgrade and Pristina are expected to present their remarks about the blueprint by February 13th.
The envoy will then begin a new set of consultations in Vienna, with the goal of getting a final document before the UN Security Council within the coming months.
"I want to give both parties the chance once again to make their points," he said on Friday, adding that he is prepared to consider constructive amendments and is willing to integrate compromise solutions that parties might reach.
The Adriatic 3 Charter -- a Ticket to NATO?
A new combined initiative of Albania, Macedonia and Croatia called the Charter of the Adriatic 3 could pave the way for those countries to join NATO sooner rather than later.
By Orest Erzeni for Southeast European Times in Tirana - 06/03/03
Albania, Croatia and Macedonia believe they now have a greater chance of joining NATO earlier than becoming a part of the EU.
The three countries have established strong co-operation in the form of a new three-party initiative called the Charter of the Adriatic 3.
Drafted immediately after NATO's November summit in Prague, the initiative demonstrates their ambition to speed up preparations to become members of the alliance.
Enthusiasm is high, especially in Tirana, where on 27 February the general secretaries of the foreign ministries of the three states met for the final discussion of the Charter.
It will be approved by the three foreign ministers during a meeting in Dubrovnik on Friday (7 March).
The regional initiative was endorsed in Tirana on 12 February during the summit of the Albanian, Croatian and Macedonian presidents.
Albania's Alfred Moisiu announced that they would sign the Charter in March.
The Adriatic 3 Charter initiative enjoys broad political and public backing in all three countries.
Public opinion generally views US support as the greatest hope for realisation of the initiative.
President George W. Bush indicated such support when he met with Moisiu, Croatian President Stipe Mesic and Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski during the Prague Summit.
Moisiu has hailed the initiative as a partnership among the three countries and the United States. In a letter sent on 21 January, Bush welcomed their decision to work together to join NATO.
Washington has emphasised the importance of establishing modern military forces; despite this challenge, there is a conviction in Tirana that the United States will be a determining factor.
There are even plans for the Charter to be signed in Washington.
The governments in Tirana, Zagreb and Skopje seem convinced that through their combined efforts, they will increase their chances to board the NATO train. They view the Adriatic 3 Charter as the right ticket for that journey.
Balkan states hope to spur Danube tourism
People living along the southeastern stretch of the Danube know the region has much to offer -- natural beauty, neolithic excavations, antique cities and medieval monasteries and cuisine.
For the rest of the world, however, all this remains an undiscovered secret.

The Danube, Europe's most mysterious river, connects more than 80 million people in eight countries.
It has witnessed the rise and fall of many empires, and treasures from some of the world's oldest civilisations can be found in its vicinity.
While its westerly segment is popular, the river's Balkan stretch also has the potential for tourism -- a potential that remains largely untapped.
Governments and the tourist industry in the region are hoping to change that.
"It is necessary to work very hard, but with help and vision from the government [it can be done]," Mihajlo Todic, head of a Belgrade-based tourist agency, told Southeast European Times.
Todic's agency, Oscar Tours, arranges itineraries for cruise line passengers making a stop in Belgrade.
These tend to be older people because "youngsters haven't money or time", Todic explains.
Typically, these visitors spend a day and a half at the most to see the Belgrade Fortress, Tito's tomb, the seat of the Karadjordjevic dynasty in Oplenac, and the monasteries of Fruska Gora.
The city's more recent history is also in evidence: the ruins of the Yugoslav Army general headquarters and defence ministry are unavoidable.

"Tourists are delighted with the city and with Belgraders, especially with its beautiful women," Tomic says.
"They expected a neglected and ruined city, and in front of them is modern, vibrant metropolis full of friendly people talking foreign languages."
The Western European stretch of the Danube has been a prime cruise destination for years.
With one third of the cruise market, it bests the glorious Nile in terms of popularity.
The number of people embarking at Passau, Germany -- the leading point of departure -- long ago exceeded 130,000 per season.
Prices range from 1,340-3,760 euros for a ten-day cruise, to 4,200 euros for a three-week cruise from Passau or Amsterdam downstream from Konstata.
But until now, the southeast Danube has enjoyed only a small share of the rewards.
This region also has much to offer -- natural beauty, archaeological excavations, medieval monasteries and baroque architecture in the cities.
At the same time, it is paying for decades of neglect.
How can cruise lines be expected to favour a part of the world where there aren't even sufficient places to dock?
Croatia has only two docks -- in Vukovar and Osijek (on the Drava). Camps and hotel capacity are lacking.
Serbia has more than 30 small docks, but only six have a camp and restaurant.
These countries simply have not built the infrastructure needed to draw even small-scale cruises, let alone five-star liners.

This is a loss not only for the Balkan economies, but also for tourists.
For instance, those who flock to the 900-year-old Benedictine Abbey in Melk, Austria would surely also appreciate Serbia's Holy Mountain, with its 16 monasteries.
Tourists are also missing out on the untouched beauty of the Kopacki Rit nature park in Slavonija, Croatia, where they could also sample local specialties such as kulen, paprika-flavoured sausage and fish stew.
From Sombor, one can cross the Danube near the Petrovaradin Fortress, also known as the Gibraltar on the Danube, and see the awe-inspiring Iron Gate Gorge, the largest river crag in Europe.
Those fond of history shouldn't miss Russe in Bulgaria, where ancient stone houses, perched one on another, cling to the steep riverbank. Also a must is Bucharest, the "Paris of the East", which is also the site of the megalomaniac Nicolae Ceausescu's gargantuan "House of the People".
Nature lovers will appreciate the Danube delta with its picturesque landscapes and a unique ecosystem, home to more than 300 species of birds and 100 types of fish.
It is also the last European home of the pelican.
Tourists in search of new destinations, and Balkan economies in need of tourism revenues -- it would seem to be an ideal match.
With more development, better services and effective promotional campaigns, vision could someday become reality.
Greece to sue Siemens over bribery scandal
ATHENS, Greece -- The government announced on Monday (January 24th) it will take legal action against the German electronics giant Siemens over allegedly bribing officials.
"Greece will seek compensation for the damage it has suffered from the corrupt practices that have been used by your company in the past," Investment Minister Haris Pamboukis wrote in a letter to the German company's Greek subsidiary, Siemens Hellas. A parliamentary investigation spanning 11 months concluded that Greek taxpayers suffered losses worth 2 billion euros because of the alleged bribery between 1997 and 2002.
Last year, former Transport Minister Anastasios Mantelis admitted receiving one bribe of 100,000 euros in 1998.
Other ministers who allegedly took bribes may be identified soon. (BBC, Reuters, ANA-MPA - 24/01/11)
Fires contained in Greece, but not the criticism
Although reconstruction efforts are under way in Greece, the effects of this summer's fires will be felt for a long time.

A Greek pilot lost his life Thursday (August 27th) when his aircraft crashed during efforts to contain a blaze on the Ionian island of Kefalonia.
The plane was among dozens deployed to fight wildfires that have ravaged parts of Greece, mostly near Athens.
Colonel Stergios Kotoulas, 55, was flying an antiquated PZL-M-18 Dromader which had reportedly logged more than 4,700 hours of flight time.
It was the first fire-related death in the country this year, and comes amid ongoing controversy over whether Greece's fire fighting fleet is being adequately funded and maintained.
Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis and President Karolos Papoulias expressed their grief and condolences to the pilot's family, saying that he had lost his life while trying to carry out a difficult task.
Meanwhile, the opposition Panhellenic Socialist Party (PASOK) lashed out at policies it says were responsible for the rash of fires.
"The 2009 fires have to become the red line for the state and the citizens," PASOK leader George Papandreou said. "These most recent disasters should mark the end of an era and of a development model that states that anything that won't become cement will turn into ashes."
The blazes, which broke out more than a week ago in areas north of Athens, have now mostly been contained.
Earlier this week, Karamanlis visited the main fire fighting base in Elefsina in order to thank the crew.
His government thanked foreign countries -- including Cyprus, France, Italy and Turkey -- that have aided the effort.
Power has been restored in most areas, and traffic has been flowing smoothly again as affected roads are re-opened.
The impact, nevertheless, will be felt for a long time to come.
It spells additional pressure for Karamanlis's government, which has only a one-vote majority in parliament and is now fending off accusations of incompetence and neglect.
The number of firefighting planes in operation is the same as in 2007, when scores of people perished in catastrophic fires around the country.
Moreover, many of the planes are decades old, and critics say they are obsolete and dangerous to fly.
Thursday's crash was reportedly due to a technical malfunction.
Each time a wave of fires breaks out, it alters the environment in ways that make future blazes even more likely.
According to experts, this summer's disaster will raise the average temperature in downtown Athens by almost one degree Celsius over the course of the next few years.
Some of the forests that were burnt are not capable of rejuvenating.
NATO chief urges Athens, Ankara to iron out differences
"At the end of the day, the lack of security agreements might put our personnel on the ground at risk," NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said.
(Euractiv, eKathimerini, AP, DPA, Euronews, Xinhua - 28/08/09; AFP, DPA, Deutsche Welle, Euronews, ANA-MPA, ERT, Turk.net, Zaman, Sofia Echo, Novinite - 27/08/09; AP, AFP, Politiken.dk - 26/08/09; NATO -- 25/08/09 - 28/08/09)

NATO's new secretary-general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, urged Greece and Turkey this week to improve ties, stressing that their ongoing disputes are impeding the Alliance's efforts in Afghanistan and Africa by putting ground troops at risk.
"I do not think we could allow a lack of security because of all these political disputes -- we have to find pragmatic solutions," Rasmussen said Thursday (August 27th).
Cyprus is at the core of tensions between the two neighbouring nations, both NATO members.
Ankara does not recognise the Greek Cypriot-run part of the ethnically divided Mediterranean island, which joined the EU in May 2004, minus its Turkish Cypriot-controlled north.
In response, Turkey has prevented Cyprus's inclusion in strategic co-operation between the EU and NATO, thus making it impossible for the Alliance to ensure adequate protection for the 27-nation Union's trainers in Afghanistan.
"At the end of the day, the lack of security agreements might put our personnel on the ground at risk... It is a subject of real concern to me," Rasmussen said.
The former Danish prime minister, who was sworn in as the Alliance's 12th secretary-general on August 1st, voiced hope before the start of his trip Wednesday that he will see an improvement in the ties between the two key NATO allies during his term.
"While these are bilateral issues, the effects of these tensions are felt far beyond, NATO-EU relations being the most obvious," he said.
In Athens, Rasmussen held talks with Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis, Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis and Defence Minister Evangelos Meimarakis.
Aside from the relations between Greece and Turkey, other topics included the situation in Afghanistan, the process of formulating a new NATO doctrine and the Alliance's relations with Russia, according to Greek news agency ANA-MPA.
Greek officials also briefed Rasmussen on the ongoing UN-mediated negotiations on resolving the country's name dispute with neighbouring Macedonia.
After wrapping up talks in Athens on Thursday, the NATO chief left for Turkey, where he met with President Abdullah Gul.
Rasmussen later talked with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
He urged Rasmussen to work to improve NATO's dialogue with the Muslim world.
While condemning acts of terrorism conducted in the name of Islam, the Turkish prime minister took the opportunity to call on the West to show greater respect for Muslims and to push his country's EU bid.
"If the European Union desires to be a global actor, the home for an alliance of civilisations, then Turkey must take its place within the Union," the AP quoted him as saying.
Rasmussen urged Turkey to play a bigger role in the fight against terrorism, as well as to contribute more troops to the Alliance's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan.
The Turkish ISAF contingent currently numbers about 730 soldiers, operating in Kabul and the surrounding area.
Rasmussen also urged Turkey to consider bigger involvement in efforts to rebuild the impoverished, war-ravaged Asian nation's educational system.
NATO to withdraw more troops from Kosovo
BRUSSELS, Belgium -- NATO will downsize its troop strength in Kosovo from the current 10,000 to 5,000 as of March 1st, Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told a press conference in Brussels on Monday (January 24th).
He did not confirm whether France's military presence in the north will be replaced by US troops.
Rasmussen also confirmed that co-operation with Kosovo Police and EULEX continues in the interest of Kosovo's stability and its citizens.
He praised the transfer of authority to Kosovo Police in guarding Serb religious objects and sites. (Telegrafi, Klan Kosova, Kohavision, RTK - 24/01/11)
EU's Rehn says donor support needed for Kosovo
While it stands ready to lead the post-settlement efforts in Kosovo, the EU cannot provide all of the required resources from its own budget, the bloc's enlargement commissioner said on Wednesday.
(EurActiv - 29/03/07; AP, AFP, Reuters, DPA, FT, Beta, B92, Makfax, EUROPA - 28/03/07)

The EU is ready to play a "leading role" in Kosovo after its status issue has been resolved, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Wednesday (March 28th), two days after UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari unveiled his final proposal for a settlement.
The document, drawn up by the former Finnish president and sent to the Security Council on Monday, envisions EU-supervised independence for Kosovo, described as the "only viable option".
"The essence of the decision on Kosovo is European unity," Rehn told a European Parliament (EP) committee on Wednesday.
"We must continue to support President Ahtisaari and his proposal with consistent determination in the UN Security Council.
There is no gain in delaying the decision.
The UN has already been running Kosovo for eight years.
The status quo is not sustainable."
The Security Council is expected to open a debate on Ahtisaari's Kosovo plan shortly after Britain takes over the chairmanship of the 15-nation body at the beginning of April, and to decide on the province's future status later this year.
Addressing the EP on Wednesday, Rehn made it clear that EU planning for "the largest civilian crisis management mission" the Union has ever undertaken was well advanced.
Under the plan, once the status issue has been resolved, the EU will send up to 2,000 international staff to Kosovo, including up to 1,500 police officers, magistrates and customs officials.
Citing an internal report, drafted by Rehn and EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday that the 120-day transitional period, during which UNMIK would hand over responsibilities to the EU, would likely be "highly sensitive in political and security terms".
According to the paper, the EU mission would be fully operational "for a minimum period of two years".
"The EU will play a leading role both in the running of international civilian missions and in support of Kosovo's European aspirations," Rehn told EU lawmakers Wednesday. "We have no exit strategy, only an entry strategy."
The estimated funding needed for the first three years, he said, would be up to 1.5 billion euros.
This would cover Kosovo's share of the Yugoslav debt, the cost of status implementation, economic development needs and the cost of the international presence.
"Resources cannot come from the EU budget alone," said Rehn. "EU member states and our international partners must share the responsibility."
The EU expects the United States and international financial institutions to contribute some of the resources.
Before debate begins in the Security Council, political directors from the six nations in the Contact Group for Kosovo -- Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States -- met in London on Wednesday.
"The Contact Group remains united in its shared sense of responsibility to promote peace in Kosovo and in the region, despite any differences of perception," the British liaison office in Pristina said in a statement.
Russia, which is also one of the five permanent members of the Security Council, is the only country in the Contact Group that has voiced opposition to Ahtisaari's proposal.
It has been calling for further negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina.
In Macedonia, little-watched labs keep things honest for consumers
The government took a huge step this month regarding labs that standardise all kinds of measurements.

Two jars of pickles are arranged side-by-side on the grocery store shelf, but determining the better deal is difficult without the accurate weight of each being marked clearly on the label.
That’s where the bureau of metrology comes in, the agency in Macedonia that determines weights and measurements on everything from canned goods to cars.
The bureau and its nine labs attract little attention, but their efforts mean big business.
"In industry and trade, it [means] better quality products; in terms of everyday life, [it] means increased protection of consumers," Bureau Director Dimitar Parnardziev told SETimes.
The nine national labs are responsible for very specific units of measurement.
There is one each for mass, length, pressure, volume and flow, electricity, temperature, time and frequency, density, and even reference material.
On January 16th, the government accredited four of the nine: the labs for mass, pressure, volume and flow, and temperature.
The rest, says Economy Minister Valjon Saracini, will be accredited soon.
He tells SETimes, "The accreditation of four laboratories will overcome technical barriers and [boost the] free flow of goods and services," by increasing confidence in the results of measurements made by the bureau.
In a news release, the bureau noted that such accreditations would affect a range of activities including "the quality of environmental protection, general technical safety, a smooth exchange of goods and services, and proceedings before administrative and judicial authorities".
The secondary goal, it adds, is to implement relevant inspection and certification activities.
Beyond that, the metrology bureau aims to provide "efficient service to customers in a short timeframe and [at a cost] competitive [with the] international market, especially in the region and the EU".
The bureau co-operates with counterparts in the region, including the metrology institutes of Turkey, Albania, Bulgaria, and Slovenia.
Ahead, the bureau plans to expand co-operation with counterparts in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Montenegro.
Greece and the World Cup
Greek sports reporter Dimitris Kaimas discusses football with SETimes correspondent Christos Ringas.

Despite a disastrous start for the national team, when it lost 0-2 to South Korea in its first match at the World Cup, Greeks are eternal optimists and some still hope for a place among the top 16.
Interest remains strong in a nation where football has long been one of the top sports attractions.
Dimitris Kaimas, a sports reporter for Greece's state radio network ERA, spoke with SETimes about the team, its fans, and the overall mood coming into the World Cup.
SETimes: How are Greeks celebrating the country's participation in the World Cup?
Dimitris Kaimas: The cafes and taverns are overcrowded these days, as many like to watch Karagounis, Gekas and the other players.
However, because we are going through a crisis, many people gather in friends' houses over beer and ouzo, and share opinions about the game, the lineups, the strategies.
"If I was the coach…" is a phrase heard often these days.
If our team brings victories, those small gatherings will turn into huge groups in central squares with national flags in hand and [ready] to celebrate until dawn!
If not, then they will demand radical changes and we will seek blame.
Most tourists are coming from European countries where football is adored and they seek cafes or bars to watch their teams.
SETimes: How many players competing in the Greek Super League are in the World Cup?
Kaimas: We'll have the chance to watch seven foreign players from the Super League.
Gilberto Silva, captain of the Brazilian national team, is the biggest name.
Next is Djibril Cisse, Super League's top scorer, who after many years, plays for the French team.
Also, a basic player in Chile's line up is PAOK's Pablo Contreras, as is Skoda Xanthi's Zdeno Strba for Slovakia.
By playing for Algeria, Rafik Djebbour will try to win a transfer to a league better than ours.
Danny Fernandez of Iraklis is among the 23 players on the Portuguese team, which is important to him and to Iraklis, while Levadiakos' Ignacio Gonzalez is a player on loan.
SETimes: Were there any measures taken regarding the Greek fans?
Kaimas: We often experience violent incidents in sports -- football, basketball, volleyball and recently even handball.
Often, the incidents become a lead story in the foreign media.
The cause for all incidents is the fanatics among fans.
However, with few exceptions, Greeks have not created incidents involving our national teams.
The national team does not have bad fans.
Especially those travelling to South Africa are not going to do anything [bad].
If organised fans of the major Greek clubs were travelling, then there would be big danger.
SETimes: What does Greek football gain from the team's second qualification for the World Cup?
Kaimas: Participation itself is a gain.
The national team players get additional experience and Greek football is present on the top football event on Earth.
The team's course will set the benefits and losses.
Nobody wants to remember the one and only entry in the 1994 World Cup, which produced three defeats and ten received goals.
If the team qualifies among the top 16, it will be a huge success, affirming our presence is not accidental.
It will legitimise the rise of Greek football and make those who consider our team an average one shut up.
SETimes: Is there an interest from foreign managers in Greek players?
Kaimas: There is big interest.
Big careers have started through the World Cup.
Now that Greece competes in the tournament, it is likely that new horizons will open for some players.
Ninis, Sampras, Torosidis and Vyntra will most likely "oblige" managers and the leading European clubs.
Of course, it is one thing to show interest and another to get a transfer.
But perhaps this time is their time.
Dengbej bards keep the Kurdish musical tradition alive
Kurdish Dengbej, the tradition of oral narrative and singing, has been kept alive for centuries.
By Ozgur Ogret reports for Southeast European Times in Istanbul -- 22/03/12

Dengbej, a poetic style in verbal narrative and song, has been passed down through generations by oral tradition, telling the tale of the Kurdish people.
It is sung in the Kurdish language only.
Dengbejing -- as the narrative style is called -- is found in areas where Kurds predominantly live, in eastern Turkey.
The history of this poetry and narrative goes back as far as the records of the Kurdish culture and history go.
"Unfortunately, written literature is not much developed among the Kurds.
Dengbejing, at the same time, tells us of the difficulties, agonies, wars, even clashes between families, clans that the Kurds have experienced in a way we call oral literature," said Fırat Sayan, executive director and lecturer at the Istanbul Kurdish Institute.
Dengbejs are musical bards who narrate life experience in a specific musical form, traditionally, the oldest musical form -- the human voice, with no musical accompaniment.
Recently, however, dengbej performance started to be accompanied with instruments.
"When one says dengbej among the Kurds, we think of men.
Generally, men perform the art of dengbejing in the evening when the people do not go out much for six or seven months [in the winter] and when fairy tales and dengbejs are told," Sayan said.
Cypriot leaders launch new peace talks
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is hopeful that leaders of Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots will make "significant progress" during intensive peace talks this month.
(Irish Times, Cyprus Mail, Financial Mirror, Zaman - 12/01/10; AP, DPA, BBC, CNA, Famagusta Gazette, Hurriyet, World Bulletin, Makfax - 11/01/10; UN News Centre - 07/01/10)

Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat opened the first of two rounds of UN-backed peace talks on Monday (January 11th), aimed at ending four decades of division in Cyprus.
During six daylong sessions -- three in the first round, closing Wednesday, and another three opening on January 25th -- the two leaders will discuss issues including governance, power-sharing, the economy, and matters involving the EU.
Property rights, one of the thorniest issues in the negotiations, is on the agenda for discussion before the second round of talks ends January 27th.
The process will be followed by a two-month break preceding the April presidential election in the northern Turkish region of the island.
Talat is running for re-election and progress is critical to his bid.
The talks are being held at the residence of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's Special Representative in Cyprus, Taye Brook Zerihoun.
After his nine-hour meeting with Talat on Monday, Christofias told reporters that the discussion focused on various aspects of governing Cyprus.
"We both made the point that nothing is agreed or will be agreed until everything is agreed," said Christofias, stressing that neither he, nor Talat will walk away from the talks.
"Let us hope that at the end of the day we will have more convergences, which is the common aim."
The last attempt to negotiate a solution to a divided Cyprus ended in failure in April 2004, when Greek Cypriot voters overwhelmingly rejected a UN-sponsored reunification proposal.
A majority of Turkish Cypriots voted in favour of the plan.
In May 2004, only the internationally recognised Greek-run part of Cyprus joined the EU, thereby representing the whole country.
Ankara alone recognises the Turkish-controlled part of Cyprus.
The peace process remained deadlocked until September 2008, when Christofias and Talat launched a new round of direct, UN-sponsored negotiations amid high hopes that an agreement would be reached by the end of last year.
But after the 60 meetings, a deal remains elusive.
Ban expressed hope that the two leaders will be able to agree on the critically important issues and "make significant progress".
"As Secretary General, I have expressed my firm commitment and willingness and readiness to engage myself whenever the time is appropriate," Ban said on Monday, according to Cyprus News Agency.
Before the talks began, the Turkish Cypriots submitted proposals on governance and power-sharing, which the Greek Cypriots flatly rejected as "unacceptable".
"These proposals cannot form the basis for discussion," Greek Cypriot government spokesman Stephanos Stephanou said on Sunday.
Leaked to the press last week, the Turkish Cypriot proposals are said to include separate rights to sign international agreements and control of Cypriot air space.
A poll conducted last month suggested that Talat will be defeated by hard-line Turkish Cypriot Prime Minister and leader of the National Unity Party (UBP) Dervis Eroglu.
Pushing for a continuation of the division of the island along ethnic lines, the UBP has suggested that a two-state model is the only basis for a solution.
Greece, Cyprus, Bulgaria get high grades for water quality
Greece, followed by Cyprus and four other EU members, are the countries with the highest percentage of clean surf within the 27-nation bloc, according to a European Commission survey.

Almost all of Greece's coastal and inland swimming areas that were monitored last year met the EU's highest quality standards, the European Commission (EC) said in an annual report published last week.
According to the 36-page survey, only three of the 1,273 Greek seaside sites covered in the assessment did not comply with the 27-nation bloc's tough "guide values", and just one fell short of the minimum, or mandatory values.
The country's four freshwater swimming areas that were also checked against a set of physical, chemical and microbiological parameters last year were found to be fully in compliance with the more stringent quality standards.
On the basis of those findings, the EC concluded that, on average, 99.8% of the "bathing waters" in Greece met the guide values.
But, it also noted that another 830 Greek swimming sites were not included in the report due to incomplete samplings, caused by delays in the commissioning of the monitoring programme.
The EC's Quality of Bathing Water report -- which was released on June 10th -- was conducted during the 2009 season and covered a total of more than 20,000 seaside, lake and river sites in the EU member states.
The survey showed that 96% of Europe's coastal waters and 90% of its inland swimming areas complied with the EU's minimum water quality standards last year.
While both figures are slightly lower than those in 2008, they also show the significant improvement achieved since 1990, when 80% of Europe's seaside swimming areas and only 52% of the freshwater ones were within the norm.
"Over the last 30 years, EU and national legislation has significantly improved the quality of Europe's bathing waters but our work does not end here," EU Environment Commissioner Janez Potocnik said upon the release of the report. "Despite our decade-long track record of high quality, we need to keep up the effort constantly to both improve and maintain what we have achieved."
Aside from Greece, other countries where at least 90% of all recreational surf met the EU stringent guide values in 2009 included Cyprus (99.1%), France (95.7%), Malta (93.1%), Bulgaria (90.3%) and Portugal (90%).
Bulgaria, whose Black Sea resorts attract thousands of local and foreign tourists every summer, has 89 coastal and four freshwater swimming areas.
The country's compliance with the EU bathing water quality standards has been improving since it started reporting on it after joining the bloc in 2007.
Last year, 98.9% of Bulgaria's Black Sea beaches met the mandatory values, up from 93.3% in 2008.
"The rate of compliance [of coastal waters] with the guide values increased significantly from 78.7% to 91%," the EC said in a separate country report.
Romania, one of the three EU members, along with Cyprus and Malta, that reported data for coastal areas only, appeared to be lagging behind its southern neighbour.
While all of the country's 49 seaside sites surveyed met the minimum quality standards, only four, or 8.2% of all, complied with the guide values in 2009.
Bulgarian mobsters feel the heat
A number of gangsters have been arrested in Bulgaria in recent weeks as part of a state crackdown on organised crime.

Bulgarian authorities have arrested a number of members of the country's under world in recent weeks, hoping to stem crime as well as criticism that their efforts against lawlessness and corruption are ineffective.
The highest-profile suspect is Krasimir "The Big Margin" Marinov, detained hours after the mafia-style execution on January 5th of Bobi Tsankosv, 30, a controversial former radio show host with ties to the mob.
Four days later, the Sofia City Court ruled that the alleged organised crime boss, charged with ordering the murder, must remain behind bars until trial.
If convicted, Marinov could face life in prison.
Police are still searching for his brother, Nikolai "The Little Margin" Marinov, who went into hiding following Tsankov's murder.
The US Embassy in Sofia reports approximately 140 "contract killings" in Bulgaria from 1993 through 2008.
Another dozen or so are believed to have been committed last year.
Only a few of the cases have ended in convictions.
Following publication of his book, "The Secrets of the Gangsters", Tsankov gave two lengthy interviews in November for Nova television's tabloid show "Goreshto" [Hot].
Tsankov spoke openly about his close ties to prominent mobsters.
He also wrote a series of articles on Bulgarian crime syndicates for the Sofia-based Weekend newspaper and was planning to publish a second book, reportedly about drug trafficking.
Tsankov said he had received threats from drug kingpin Stefan "Sako" Bonev in November.
Bonev was free at the time on a 3,000-euro bail.
Sofia City Prosecutor Nikolai Kokinov confirmed that Tsankov contacted him in November to complain about threats.
"He then offered his services and started visiting [the city prosecutors in] Sofia and providing information about certain cases," Kokinov said in an interview with Bulgarian National Radio.
The information Tsankov disclosed "voluntarily" during meetings with prosecutors was "serious and valuable", said Kokinov.
Tsankov's co-operation, he added, coincided with a feeling of anxiety among Bulgarian gangsters because of beefed-up anti-crime efforts.
"For months now criminals [have felt] pressured," he said. "Their space is shrinking and gangsters become bolder and more ruthless.
They are nervous and feel restricted because they can no longer obtain the money they are used to."
As part of an operation last month dubbed "The Insolents", police busted a high-profile organised crime group believed to be behind more than a dozen kidnappings over the past two years.
More than 20 people were arrested during raids in December.
Revelations made by the gang's leader -- Ivaylo "Yozhi" Evtimov -- during interrogation reportedly led to the discovery of the remains of two criminals missing for months.
The bodies were unearthed in a mountainous region near Sofia.
About three weeks ago, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov admitted that people within his government are believed to be helping organised crime groups.
Borisov stressed the need to purge government of such collaborators.
"The system leaks and has to be cleaned out, and the only way to do that is by removing inside people," Bulgarian daily Dnevnik quoted him as saying.

Irina Socol, the president and general manager of the Romanian branch of IT and software development company Siveco, won the 2010 European Award for Women's Entrepreneurship in the science category.
She is the first Romanian businesswoman to be honoured in the competition.
Serbia activated its e-administration portal on Friday (June 11th), according to the ministry of telecommunications and information society.
The portal offers about 50 services to companies and individuals, Minister Jasna Matic said.
Ivaylo Hristov, co-founder of a Bulgarian-Danish company for social network applications, won this year's prize for Best Young Entrepreneur.

Kosovo journalist targeted
PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Journalist Caslav Milisavljevic claimed on Tuesday (July 20th) that an explosive device thrown in his yard was a politically motivated attack.
Sources say that the hand grenade tossed at the house in Zvecan, outside Mitrovica early Tuesday caused no injuries, but damaged three vehicles.
Milisavljevic is editor-in-chief of Radio Mitrovica.
Three groups -- the Independent Association of Journalists of Serbia, the Union of Kosovo Journalists of Kosovo, and the Association of Professional Journalists of Kosovo -- condemned the attack.
This is the third incident in the area in recent weeks.
In early July, one man was killed during a protest, and days later, Kosovo Serb lawmaker Petar Miletic was injured in an attack. (Koha Ditore Zeri - 21/07/10; Klan Kosova, Kohavision, Telegrafi, RTK - 20/07/10)

Another UN bus attacked in Kosovo
A UN bus carrying 55 passengers was attacked Wednesday on the route between Dragas and Belgrade.
It was the latest in a string of incidents that have cast a shadow over security in Kosovo.
By Blerta Foniqi for Southeast European Times in Pristina – 06/01/06
"Attempts by isolated individuals or groups to disrupt Kosovo's way forward must not be tolerated," said UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen. [Laura Hasani]
A bomb was thrown at a UN bus in Kosovo Wednesday night (4 January), causing damage but no injuries to the 55 passengers aboard.
It was the second attack in the past month on the regular bus service provided between Dragas and Belgrade, and the second this week on a UN bus.
"No injuries were caused and the passengers continued their journey on another bus under police escort," said UN spokesman Niray Singh.
According to him, the bus passengers were Kosovo Albanians and members of the ethnic Bosnian and Turkish communities, as well as one person of Chinese nationality.
Kosovo's ethnic minorities often use the route, but members of Kosovo's 90 per cent Albanian majority are also frequent passengers.
The bombing follows the stoning Tuesday of a UN bus transporting Serbs from Rahoveci to Mitrovica.
The Kosovo Police Service arrested four people in connection with that attack.
Amid a string of recent incidents, UNMIK head Soren Jessen-Petersen has condemned "criminal violence" and warned that such acts are not in the interest of Kosovo.
"Attempts by isolated individuals or groups to disrupt Kosovo's way forward must not be tolerated," Jessen-Petersen said in December.
UNMIK Police and the Kosovo Police Service, meanwhile, have stepped up security measures to ensure that a safe and secure environment is maintained during the ongoing process of deciding Kosovo's future status.
As part of Operation Stringent Security, police patrols have been increased and vehicle checkpoints set up throughout Kosovo, with a focus on potentially vulnerable areas. Some 352 people have been arrested for various offences, while 84 weapons have been seized.
On 28 December, police operations were further intensified north of the divided city of Mitrovica, following violent incidents in the area.
Police Commissioner Kai Vittrup reiterated on Wednesday that police would remain on high alert during the status negotiations process.
"In the course of Operation Stringent Security, police will continue to prioritise measures in different parts of Kosovo in light of developments in the security situation," Vittrup said.
Kosovo's police say that crime on the whole has been decreasing.
However, 2006 started with a series of violent incidents, with two people killed by firearms over the last few days, in addition to the bus attacks.

An IMF mission arrived in Turkey to assess the latest economic developments and measures related to structural reforms.
Turkey is preparing to sign a new three-year stand-by arrangement with the Fund.
Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Russia agreed to resolve issues concerning their interstate debts within six months.
BiH has wartime liabilities of 44.3m euros for gas deliveries from Russia, while Russia owes BiH 102.5m euros -- part of its Soviet-era clearing debt to the former Yugoslavia.
Croatia's economy minister, Branko Vukelic, announced that Russia intends to settle its Soviet-era clearing debt to Croatia by the end of 2004.
Representatives of the two governments are expected to sign an agreement on the settlement of the 151.4m-euro debt within weeks, he said.
Repayment will likely take the form of equipment supplies for thermal power plants and for construction of a gas pipeline, as well as supply of two BE-200 firefighting aircraft.
The European Investment Bank provided 2.4m euros in financing for the extension and modernisation project at the Albanian port of Durres.
The funds were used to purchase a travelling crane with a 120-tonne capacity.
Total cost of the project is estimated at 17m euros.
Cyprus hopes to cut its budget deficit and join the eurozone by 2008, Cypriot Finance Minister Makis Keravnos announced on 14 September.
He called for adoption of the cost savings plan outlined in Cyprus' EU convergence package, to reduce the budget deficit to 2.9 per cent of GDP by the end of 2005 and observe the EU ceiling of 3 per cent.
The IMF published the concluding statement from its 2004 Article IV Consultation with Greece, urging the government to act immediately to address the challenges resulting from Olympics-related spending.
Specifically, the Fund called for credible fiscal consolidation, policies to boost aggregate supply, and better alignment of real wages with productivity to help restore competitiveness.
Italy will extend about 65m euros in financial assistance to Serbia under a new economic co-operation programme.
The funds will be used for support of healthcare, energy, education, environmental protection, agriculture and welfare housing construction.
Macedonia's government will review a proposal to revise the state budget for 2004 at one of its next sessions, announced Finance Minister Nikola Popovski.
He described the overestimated inflation target as the main reason for the adjustment. Instead of the initially expected 2.8 per cent, annual inflation for 2004 will stand at around 0.5 per cent.
Bulgaria's Finance Ministry and the IMF mission resumed talks on the country's 2004 budget execution and the draft budget for 2005.
At issue is the government's plan for a 25 per cent hike of the minimum wage in 2005, something the Fund opposes.
If no agreement is reached during this round of talks, further efforts will be made in December.
Handover of BiH Civil Air Space Almost Complete
BiH's recent admission into the European Civil Aviation Conference is just one part of the handover of civilian airspace to local authorities.
By Beth Kampschror for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 20/01/03
Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) recently joined the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC), an organisation that promotes safe and efficient air transport systems in Europe.
"We should acknowledge the great strides that these new member states have made, and in some cases the extreme difficulties they have had to overcome, both internal and external, to join ECAC," said conference president Alfredo Roma.
In BiH's case, overcoming those difficulties has been part of the handover of its civil airspace to local control, which will be largely completed by the end of this year.
"It's a big achievement for BiH to become a member of ECAC -- we were a candidate for the last three or four years," said Yves Lambert, the co-ordinator of the European Commission and the International Civil Aviation Organisation project to help BiH join the civil aviation community.
Lambert said that evaluation teams had noted so much progress between the October 2001 visit and the June 2002 visit that BiH was invited to join the organisation.
NATO troops were in charge of all airspace in BiH since the end of the war in 1995, but that control is being gradually handed back to local authorities.
For example, SFOR and the civilian authorities signed an agreement on 1 July to start the first phase of the transfer of control over Sarajevo airport from the SFOR Air Detachment to civilian authorities.
The initial handover -- responsibility for security, rescue, fire fighting and medical emergencies -- was possible because the civilian airport authorities and municipal emergency services performed well during a May exercise in air accident response.
Local authorities are slated to take over complete responsibility for Sarajevo Airport by the end of the year.
The foreign-run body overseeing aviation here has also given way to a new Civil Aviation Steering Committee, which will be led by the Office of the High Representative but will have representation from the entity ministries and other domestic government and aviation bodies.
The committee's job will be to improve and help BiH civil aviation institutions, monitor the safety oversight audit follow-up and make sure that BiH complies with requirements of the aviation organisations it has joined.
Lambert said that the transfer and BiH's membership in ECAC are not the end goals of the EC/ICAO project.
Sarajevo Airport has had its own trained air traffic controllers since 1 January, as Banja Luka airport has had for the past two years.
Mostar Airport should have its own controllers by the end of 2003.
Another step is for BiH to join the Joint Aviation Authorities, which is the European equivalent of the United States' Federal Aviation Administration.
It controls monitoring and regulating aviation operations.
"We have to progress in the fields of monitoring and such things, but that will be the next challenge for us," Lambert said.
Tourism Bolsters Croatia's Image
Croatia's developing tourism industry has played a key role in efforts to retool the country's image following the conflicts of the 1990s.
By Miranda Novak for Southeast European Times in Zagreb - 26/04/04

Following the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s, Croatia turned to tourism to build a new, positive image.
Within a relatively short time, the country has succeeded in boosting its reputation as an attractive place to visit and do business.
This year, Croatia is expecting a 3 per cent to 5 per cent increase in the number of hotel stays, a figure which is expected to improve the tourist industry's financial results by as much as 10 per cent.
Croatia will likely attract visitors despite the continued impact of the terrorist threat on the European tourist industry in general.
Experts say, however, that Croatia must build on the successes achieved so far.
One method is through effective advertising, including the creation of a recognisable slogan that will "brand" the country worldwide.
An oft-cited model is Spain, which after the death of Franco in 1975, undertook to end its international isolation.
It waged an aggressive campaign based on the slogan "Everything Under the Sun".
As a young democratic country, Croatia today is facing similar challenges.
Meanwhile, officials stress the need to ensure that the country has the facilities and services needed to accommodate an influx of visitors.
Tourism Minister Bozidar Kalmeta has expressed dissatisfaction with the level of preparations in some Croatian communities, resulting from work delays.
At the same time, the government is addressing the problem of uncontrolled shoreline construction and encroachment on the seashore.
Illegal construction has burgeoned -- a problem resulting from the desire to make a quick buck without adequate investment, authorities say.
East West Communications President Thomas Cromwell believes image building has had a major impact on the ability of countries to succeed in the international arena.
However, he cautions, "tourism is only one of the areas a country needs to develop, and this is only one of the sectors which will benefit from image improvement."
As Croatia continues to bolster its image through its developing tourist industry, analysts say successes in foreign policy -- such as the recent, favourable report by the European Commission -- will help boost tourism.
Great white shark -- still found in the Adriatic Sea
Considered extinct about 40 years ago, the great white shark is back in the Adriatic waters, dangerous as ever, having attacked a diver from Slovenia.
By Ivo Scepanovic for Southeast European Times in Split – 04/11/08

One man's frightening encounter with the great white shark in the Adriatic, just ten metres off the shore of the remote island of Vis, central Dalmatia, has made headlines in Croatia and confirmed suspicions of the predator's presence in the Adriatic.
Older locals remember a shark attack in the central Adriatic that claimed the life of a German tourist.
Divers had felt safe after 40 years of shark inactivity.
A 43-year-old Slovenian diver, Damjan Pesek, went spear fishing with a friend in Mala Smokova, near the island of Vis.
Witnesses say the shark that attacked him was 5m long.
"It felt like something suddenly hit my body. You actually do not feel the bite," said Pesek at the hospital in Split that treated the serious injuries to his left leg.
"I used a spear to fight back," said Pesek.
Friends pulled him into a boat and rushed him to the nearest doctor.
Paramedics in turn transported him to Split for decompression and emergency treatment.
"There is almost no way that a diver can defend himself if a shark wants to kill him," Croatia's top shark expert, Dr. Alen Soldo, says.
At first, the researchers were not sure of the species that attacked Pesek.
"Other kinds of sharks may have been attracted to the diver as he was carrying [bloody] fish around his belt," Soldo thought at first.
However, doctors found two teeth typical of the great white shark in the diver's leg.
The expert thinks that the arrival of the great white shark in the Adriatic could be directly connected to the tuna population.
''The shark was probably following the schools of tuna and got attracted by the fish around the diver's belt.
As schools of tuna are not frequent in the Adriatic anymore, the great white shark rarely travels to these waters," explained Soldo.
Despite the nearly tragic circumstances, Soldo said he was glad to hear the great white shark found its way back to the Adriatic, as experts had assumed it extinct in those waters for the past four decades.
He added that humans are still the intruders when they venture into the underwater world.
Experts think the great white shark will move on quickly from the Adriatic, given its migratory nature.

Serbian drug boss faces additional charges
Darko Saric and his associates allegedly channelled money from cocaine smuggling into business investments through an elaborate scheme.
By Bojana Milovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade – 11/08/10

Just four months after his most recent indictment, alleged drug trafficker Darko Saric now faces accusations of money laundering. On Monday (August 9th), Serbian prosecutors charged him and eight others, saying they used drug money to invest in hotels and farms in Vojvojdina.
Besides Saric, the accused are Radovan Strbac and his wife Dubravka Strbac, Stevica Kostic, Zoran Copic, Andrija Krlovic, Marinko Vucetic, Predrag Milosavljevic and Nebojsa Jestrovic.
While seven of them are in custody, Saric and Copic are still at large.
According to the Special Prosecutor for Organised Crime, Miljko Radisavljevic, they used about 20m euros gained from the sale of cocaine to obtain bank guarantees, which were then used for the privatisation of publicly-owned companies.
The money, Radisavljevic says, was invested in the Senta-based Mladi Borac company, the Novi Sad-based firm Putnik, Mitrosrem in Sremska Mitrovica and the Subotica-based Palic company.
A financial investigation into those companies is under way.
The accused, except for Saric, did not directly participate in the smuggling of drugs, but were allegedly responsible for channelling the ill-gotten revenues into legal business and financial streams.
Under the scheme, several offshore companies were established to transfer the money to Serbia, where it could then be paid into the accounts of local companies, Radislavljevic said.
Part of the money was deposited in cash in the Novi Sad-based Metals Bank.
Serbian media sources estimate that Saric is worth more than 100m euros, earned mainly through drug trafficking.
In April, the special prosecution filed charges against him and 19 others suspected of smuggling 2.5 tonnes of cocaine from South America.
As for this newer money laundering case, "Darko Saric and Zoran Copic are still at large and for that reason we have proposed that they be tried in absentia.
The prosecution believes that owing to the complexity of the case, it is necessary that all the accused be tried in a single proceeding," Radisavljevic said.
If convicted and caught, Sarco could spend dozens of years in prison.
Serbia passed a new law against money laundering in March, aiming to beef up the fight against corruption and meet international standards.
Serbian police have said Saric may be hiding in the region.
According to Montenegrin police chief Veselin Veljovic, however, new information has come to light suggesting that he has left the Balkans and gone to South Africa.
Serbian police chief Milorad Veljovic told SETimes that police are doing everything to find Saric and his associates.
"It is not only in the interest of the Serbian police and state, but also in the interest of the Balkan region as a whole," Veljovic said.
Police findings, he added, indicate Saric is certainly not in Serbia, but in the interest of the investigation he didn't want to go into precise details about the suspect's location.
Analysts say RS secession not likely
Political analysts say pro-independence rhetoric coming out of Banja Luka may win votes, but will not bear fruit any time soon.

Although campaigning for Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) October elections has not yet officially begun, authorities in Republika Srpska are already cooking up a hot potato for voters. .
They are expected to promote the theme that Serbs are vulnerable in BiH and may one day have to split from the country.
Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, leader of the ruling Union of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD), is reviving the pro-independence rhetoric that won him both the 2006 elections and an absolute majority in parliament.
Spurring him, analysts say, is the recent International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling on Kosovo. On July 22nd, the court said Pristina's unilateral declaration of sovereignty did not violate international law.
The Bosnian Serb leader denies he is advocating a split, but says one could eventually come about.
"The agenda is not secession of the RS, but a struggle for status," he says. "Of course, that struggle could evolve and at some point lead us to a place where everyone understands that BiH is not viable as a country."
Dodik and his party have already pushed through a law authorising a referendum on independence.
It took effect on April 20th.
Sarajevo University Political Science Professor Sacir Filandra believes the ICJ's ruling has shifted the debate .
"In the coming years, from the perspective of an imaginary Serbian nationalist bloc, certain actions towards RS can be expected, calculated to compensate for the loss of Kosovo," Filandra explained.
For that reason, he said, BiH should tread carefully when it comes to its own relationship with Pristina.
"I believe that the initiatives within Bosnia to recognise Kosovo would be counterproductive.
At this point the national question is not important for Bosnians and Croats in BiH, and its being brought to the fore would only exacerbate and complicate the internal situation in the country and the region," he said.
Faculty of Philosophy Banja Luka Professor Miodrag Zivanovic says any bid for seccession would be self-destructive.
"It would mean that people of RS would find themselves living under sanctions again, and that in this case, the Serbs would be brutally and forcibly returned to BiH," Zivanovic said.
Filandra and he agree that Belgrade has a strong influence on the Bosnian Serb leadership.
Zivanovic believes Belgrade's sway over Banja Luka must be curtailed, "because Serbia and Bosnia are two countries that should have their own policies".
Filandra, however, sees both a "bad and a good side" to the relationship.
"The bad side is that Belgrade is using RS.
The good side is the fact that politicians in RS are not independent when it comes to national strategic decisions.
Belgrade is a far more serious and realistic international legal actor, which, for Bosnia and Herzegovina and the entire region, is a better thing," Filandra said.
Oil prices, emerging economies reshape global picture
Economists differ when it comes to interpreting the significance of rising oil prices, which in real terms are approaching those which triggered the stagflation of the 1970s.
Optimists suggest that market balance will be restored once supply side problems -- including bottlenecks in refining capacity -- are resolved. Others, factoring in the economic ascendancy of China and India, increased competition for resources and the threat of global warming, see a more complicated picture.
In the past, the more pessimistic scenarios have been partly invalidated by technological advances and the operation of market forces.
Will that be the case again?
A collision of issues -- economic, political, strategic, and ecological -- suggests that policymakers should not be complacent, writes former Romanian Finance Minister Daniel Daianu.
By Daniel Daianu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest – 03/01/06
When the oil price went above $50 per barrel, the world started to worry.
When it reached $70 per barrel in September -- subsequently slipping down to between $60 and $65 -- analysts began looking carefully at the next threshold.
The reason is clear: in real terms. $80 per barrel is equivalent to the price level which triggered stagflation in the Western economies several decades ago.
At that time, Arab oil-producing countries used this strategic commodity as an economic and political weapon; in several rounds, the oil price escalated to over $40 per barrel.
The price meant a drastic and considerable change of the terms of trade between the oil exporting and importing countries.
Today's higher oil prices thus raise a simple question: is the current situation similar to that of several decades ago? [File]
Wealthy, industrialised countries absorbed the oil price shock through economic slowdown (even recession) and heavy monetisation of their surging budget deficits.
Over time, the rise in the price of industrial products compensated for the new price of oil.
The combination of recession and high inflation -- close to 20 per cent just before the advent of Paul Volcker at the helm of the Federal Reserve -- confounded not a few macroeconomists; they had a hard time in accepting that massive under utilisation of resources can cohabit with a much quicker pace of inflation.
Consequently, the conventional paradigm had to be extended to take into account the scenario in which a powerful supply-side shock overpowers the ability of the economy to undergo a smooth and fast reallocation of resources, as a means to absorb that shock.
In this case, recession combined with higher inflation becomes inevitable.
Arguably, the Western economies experienced a shock which, decades later, was to be felt on a much grander scale by post-communist economies.
Whereas the West had to deal with a brutal change in the terms of trade for a strategic commodity, post-communist economies had to deal with the wide-ranging institutional reforms and resource reallocation following the collapse of the Soviet trade bloc.
Indeed, Soviet bloc countries were partially insulated at the time of the oil price shock, for they benefited from cheap oil from the former USSR.
Poor oil-importing economies were the hardest hit, suffering a double blow: a much higher price of oil, plus gradually rising prices of industrial products.
Today's higher oil prices thus raise a simple question: is the current situation similar to that of several decades ago?
On one hand, refining capacity bottlenecks indicate that there is a supply side problem, which was amplified by the consequences of natural disasters, such as the Katrina and Rita hurricanes.
Likewise, oil exploration has not been expanded sufficiently in recent years.
The policy implication is that market balance could be restored were these supply constraints eliminated.
However, there is one major novelty in the picture: the economic ascendancy of Asia -- and particularly of China and India -- creates an additional, growing pressure on the oil and gas market.
Over time, the rise in the price of industrial products compensated for the new price of oil. [File]
The big question, then, is this: What is the potential impact of this new global economic picture on the price dynamic of basic commodities, on which the functioning of modern economies relies?
In a Malthusian, pessimistic scenario, further sharp price rises can be envisaged, with a struggle for the control of key resources.
Let us recall the intellectual and policy-related debates after the publication of the Meadows report "The Limits to Growth" -- which was commissioned by the Club of Rome more than three decades ago.
Likewise the modeling of global dynamics (the Forrester Model, developed by the MIT professor Jay Forrester) was stimulated in order to investigate what was likely to happen in the wake of severe change of circumstances on commodity markets.
The Malthusian view was partially invalidated by technological advances and by the operation of market forces, which made the use of alternative energy sources profitable at the new prices.
Could we bet again on technology and be complacent?
Perhaps, but the answer has to take China and India into account.
The demand side shock is likely to continue, with Asian economies exerting pressure on the oil and gas market in the years to come.
Arguably, this alone posts that the price of oil will not be returning to below $40 a barrel any time soon.
Furthermore, although the price hike has been comparatively gradual, it is nevertheless forcing adjustments in consumption and production.
Once again, the most severely hit are poor countries, especially those that import energy.
Several implications can be drawn.
The competition for the control of oil and gas fields will intensify in the years to come, impacting geopolitical and security related concerns; a frantic search for new fields will be ushered in; oil and gas will be seen even more as highly strategic commodities and major economies will define external policies accordingly.
It is highly probable that the needs of industries to be more competitive will collide with ecological concerns at a time when the effects of global warming are ever more visible and worrying.
Higher oil and gas prices slow down growth and lead to higher core inflation.
Hence, major trade-offs for both firms and governments emerge, requiring policy clarity and thorough calculations of costs and benefits.
A new thrust for energy conservation is to be expected under the new circumstances.
Private and public budgets will be increasingly strained unless measures are enacted soon and implemented consistently over time.
Regional oil transport market faces tough competition

The regional energy market is experiencing busy times as many Southeastern European countries have decided to push ahead with long-debated oil transport projects -- aiming to bring Caspian oil or even gas to the West.
At least three pipelines have started to refuel dreams in the region of oil riches that would eventually boost local economies.
None of the projects has received the EU's unconditional support, however.
Unofficially, various EU experts fear that some pipelines would eventually affect the Union's relations with Russia.
Nevertheless, it's no secret that Brussels is watching the race to determine which project will operate first and act as a liaison with the rich Caspian seaports believed to be sitting on trillions of dollars in untapped oil.
Oil experts suspect that Moscow will ultimately have the final say on the projects, as it will be mainly Russia's oil that will be pumped.
Various energy-hungry EU member states have expressed concern, given Russia's regular halting of oil exports.
While Brussels remains in standby mode, competition gets tougher every month on the Southeast European oil transport market.
The first move became public in late January, when Romania announced a fresh start for the Pan European Oil Pipeline (PEOP).
It would link the Romanian Black Sea port of Constanta with the Italian port of Trieste, with involvement by Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia.
The pipeline would dodge Russian control of the regional energy market and would contribute substantially to a lower European dependency on Russian and Middle Eastern oil.
The announcement was made during Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi's visit to Bucharest.
He officially reiterated Rome's support for the 1,319km pipeline.
According to its promoters, the PEOP has "enormous" advantages over its competitors -- at least twice the capacity with an existing "pipe-to-pipe" connection to a line that crosses the Alps in Trieste.

The project has been on hold for years, mainly due to the lack of consensus among the various states -- especially on the tariffs for transportation.
In the initial feasibility study, the project was budgeted at $2.4 billion.
Talks started in 1994, but the political framework and regional conflicts prevented much progress.
Moreover, the project has faced regular delays based on funding shortages and poor decisions, according to Italian newspaper Il Piccolo.
Rome and Bucharest seem recently to have put aside the past, and have clearly expressed a keen interest in advancing the project.
The PEOP has become a key target for Romania's energy policy, in light of more advanced rival projects, all crossing the Balkans and all, in theory, approved by Russia.
One of the PEOP's main competitors is the Burgas-Alexandroupoli pipeline that would carry Russian oil from Bulgaria's Black Sea coast to a Greek port in the northeast Aegean.
According to Greek news agency ANA, the 285km pipeline has an estimated investment cost of $800m and is expected to have an initial annual capacity of 35 million tonnes of oil.
After years of delays, the main backers -- Greece, Russia and Bulgaria -- have finally decided to act.
A tri-partite working group recently met in Burgas, Bulgaria and finalised the initial interstate agreement on construction of the pipeline.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has called on Greece and Bulgaria to reach a final agreement as soon as possible.
"If the Bulgarian and Greek partners fail to reach accord, we will have to boost our exports through the territory of other countries," Putin said during his annual news conference on February 2nd "Moreover, as Bulgaria and Greece are EU members, the EU should be highly interested in the implementation of this project," Putin said.
According to various experts, Moscow is getting nervous not only because of the latest moves regarding the PEOP, but also because Russia had been excluded as the guarantor of supplies for a third rival pipeline in the region -- the AMBO project, linking Bulgaria, Macedonia and Albania.
According to an accord signed in late January in Skopje, the third pipeline aims to carry oil from the Caspian region to the Black Sea port of Burgas in Bulgaria, and then through Macedonia to the Mediterranean port of Vlore in Albania.
After years of slow work, optimistic scenarios suggest the 850km pipeline, with a capacity of 35 million metric tonnes per year and a cost of around $1.3 billion, may be ready by the end of the decade.
Srebrenica: 16 years later
Family members mourn as 600 victims are buried on the 16th anniversary of the worst massacre since World War II in Europe.

Kada is with her son Samir in Potocari, a place where they had parted in 1995, promising to see each other again. On (Monday) July 11th, Kada buried her son there -- the ground covering all of the mother's hopes.
"The corpse is incomplete, many of his bones are missing, that is why the forensics [team] told me to wait for the burial of my Samir, but I could wait no longer.
I am alone, have nobody who could bury my Samir if I don't live to see the day.
I want to know where he rests," Kada tells SETimes through her tears.
Not far from her Mejrema Ibric cries over her brother.
When they parted, Mejrema was just eight years old.
Now, she hardly remembers him.
"He is gone, and I haven't even got to know him.
Here I am today, we are together for the last time," says Mejrema.
In Potocari, the place of the 1995 massacre and gravesite of the murdered Bosniaks, this is the saddest day of the year.
More than 600 people found final peace here Monday, 164 of them younger than 18.
"Today is a day of silence.
It is our responsibility to punish the wrongdoers, give these families strength to go on, and to promise ourselves a better future in which a neighbour will not harm his neighbour.
In this silence we need to find home for building a better future," Croatian President Ivo Josipovic said.

"I lost everything.
I watched my dearest ones die, and as we were parting Potocari in 1995, I believed that some of them would survive.
Nobody stayed alive, here I am saying goodbye to them and parting once more," said Zejna Huskic.
An estimated 40,000 members of the victims' families, friends and neighbours joined local and international community representatives at the ceremony on Monday.
"The arrest of Ratko Mladic gives us yet more reason to reflect on the horrific crimes against the innocent that took place here in Srebrenica. We remember what was done and what the world failed to do 16 years ago."
Although politics did not take the stage, it was noted that no Serbian government representatives attended.
Serbian NGO Women in Black, however, did attend.
"To forget, deny and hide that which happened is an underestimation of ourselves and our own dignity.
We are very displeased with the way a country considers the Srebrenica issue to be over with the handing over of Ratko Mladic, considering that there are no changes on the punishment and law level, not to mention the part of culture, science, media," the NGO's President Stasa Zajovic told SETimes.
More than 6,000 members of the Peace March were also present at the burial, walking for three days to Potocari, to get to know the bitterness of the way crossed by those from Srebrenica in 1995.
More than 5,100 of the July 1995 victims have been buried in the memorial centre at Potocari.
Another 188 victims of genocide were buried at other locations, according to family wishes.
According to the official listing of the genocide, 8,365 people were killed, and the remains of more than 3,000 are still hidden in mass graves or are awaiting identification.
Serbia, BiH optimistic about new chapter in ties
The leaders of BiH and Serbia met in Istanbul last week with an eye to the future, rather than the past.
"Serbia will never upset the stability of Bosnia and Herzegovina," said President Boris Tadic.

A new page was turned in relations between Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) last week as leaders agreed to mend strained ties.
Serbian President Boris Tadic and BiH Presidency Chairman Haris Silajdzic's meeting in Istanbul yielded a joint declaration underlining "a joint vision for the future".
The agreement was brokered by Turkey with President Abdullah Gul at the helm.
"To create an environment of lasting peace, stability and good neighbourly relations, a joint vision has to be developed in which our nations can live in peaceful co-existence and harmony," the declaration said.
For months, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu has been shuttling between the two counties.
"This meeting is a first of its kind since the Bosnian [conflict]," Davutoglu told the Turkish daily Sabah on April 24th.
The declaration promotes "security for all, high level political dialogue, economic interdependence and preservation of multiethnic, multi-cultural and multi-religious social fabric of the region".
Dusan Reljic, a research associate at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, told SETimes "If Bosnian politicians become part of a new, positive trend in the region, the entire region's path towards normalisation and stabilisation will be facilitated."
Belgrade Centre for Security Studies head Aleksandar Fatic said the meeting opens the way for Belgrade to communicate directly with Sarajevo authorities, rather than through Republika Srpska (RS), as has been the case.
"I believe that good relations between Belgrade and Sarajevo are the best guarantee for preserving RS's status in line with the Dayton Peace Accords -- a potential conflict between the RS political elite and the Bosniak leaders in the Federation of BiH could only lead to the annulment of RS by the international community," Fatic told SETimes.
"Serbia will never … upset the stability of Bosnia and Herzegovina," Tadic said at the weekend meeting.
He underlined that this new beginning could mark a new era for boosting regional co-operation.
Replied Silajdzic, "it is very important for the Bosnian people to hear this."
Both countries are aspiring to join the EU, with hopes that this reconciliation process will help further their bids.
Analysts say that Turkey has also strengthened its position regarding EU accession by organising the meeting.
"In tune with its growing foreign policy ambitions, Turkey is aiming to be among the leading foreign factors in Southeast Europe," Reljic said. "Turkey is relying on mediation diplomacy, economic and financial projects and its traditional ties in the region that are not limited to countries with a predominantly Islamic tradition."
"It was, no doubt, not an easy thing to come to this point," Sami Kohen, a foreign policy columnist for the Turkish daily Milliyet wrote on Tuesday (April 27th). "It can be said that the architect of this meeting was Davutoglu."
Banja Luka analyst Tanja Topic welcomed the declaration as a strong step towards normalising regional relations.
Further political initiatives in this direction, she added, could lead to a weakening of nationalistic hard line politics in RS.
"If recent political steps forward in the whole region would be continued by Croatia and particularly by Serbia, then such negative reactions will soon be marginalised, and the hard line RS politicians can only become political losers," Topic told SETimes.
The agreement was not without controversy.
Nebojsa Radmanovic, the BiH presidency's Serb member, termed the declaration a violation of the constitution because Silajdzic signed it without the consent of the other two presidency members.
"Silajdzic and Foreign Minister Sven Alkalaj were on an unofficial visit to Istanbul, and therefore could not accept any document on behalf of BiH," Radmanovic said.
That reaction, Topic said, "shows that RS leaders feel they are losing some kind of exclusivity in the relations with Serbia".
During the meeting, Gul touched on the importance of establishing and sustaining regional relationships.
"The Balkans has always been at peace and stability under a huge roof -- and this time the roof will be the EU and NATO structures, to which we attach great importance," he said. "The normalization of the relations between Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina is vital."
Milan, 71, a pensioner from Belgrade, said it's not easy for Serbs to sort out their feelings towards Turkey.
"You know what the first association with the Turks in Serbia is -- we were under their occupation for 500 years," he said. "But a lot has changed.
If they have a euro or two to invest in Serbia now, they're welcome."
Montenegro balks at opening up real estate market
Worried that too much property will be snapped up by foreigners, Montenegrin leaders have not been able to agree on removing restrictions on the country's real estate market.

Two years after Montenegro gained independence, fears that Russians and other foreigners could buy up large amounts of land are fueling a heated debate over liberalizing real estate laws in the small Adriatic country.
The larger ruling coalition party -- Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic's Democratic Party of Socialists -- favours complete liberalisation of the real estate market.
But its coalition ally, the Social Democratic Party, has joined the opposition in urging continued restrictions in order to keep the country's attractive coastline in Montenegrin hands.
Because of the quarrel over the issue, the government withdrew a bill on property rights for foreigners that had been up for discussion during parliament's spring session.
Under the constitution, a two-thirds majority would be needed in order to push such legislation through.
Under current law, foreign commercial entities can purchase property in Montenegro, but individuals from abroad cannot.
In actual practice, many foreigners -- usually with assistance from Montenegrin contacts -- are able to get around the limitation by registering a business, then liquidating it after they have bought the property.
A Montenegrin administrative court has ruled that "a foreign private person not pursuing an economic activity in Montenegro cannot claim ownership over land".
It remains unclear, however, whether this ruling has been implemented.
Statistical data drives home the significance of the issue. During an 11-month period, 53% out of a total 900m euros in Foreign Direct Investment went towards acquisition of real estate.
At the same time, capital outflows amounted to 450m euros – three thirds of that being invested in real estate.
Montenegrins who sell their inherited property appear to be buying real estate outside the country -- often in Belgrade or Novi Sad -- or simply using the proceeds for consumption, instead of for new investments that could minimize the foreign trade deficit and increase employment.
Deputy Prime Minister Gordana Djurovic, who handles international economic relations, declined to sign onto the government's proposed property law, saying it "does not envisage the conditions of reciprocity".
She put forth a similar opinion regarding a draft law on state property, arguing that coastal areas and forests ought to remain state property. "The law should instead stipulate certain special rights to utilization of these public goods through concessions, leasing, rent and similar contractual arrangements," Djurovic said.
However, Association of Lawyers Secretary-General Branislav Radulovic believes that the insistence on reciprocity is not a "particularly strong argument".
"With 13.812 sq km of territory, one would wonder whether reciprocity is sufficient to defend Montenegrin interests.
With regard to Russia, for instance, this principle is perfectly senseless," Radulovic says.

"Montenegro can promote concessions as a way of attracting foreign investments, like Bulgaria did," he suggests. "Bulgaria did not sell off its property -- instead, it concluded agreements on concessions with the foreign investors allowing them to use and manage the property for 99 years.
Thus it avoided losing its ownership over land, but also prevented manipulations and fictitious agreements."
The president of the Employers' Union, Predrag Mitrovic, warns that the state should be attentive to the comparative experiences of European countries and other states in the region.
"In practice, it happened that countries with so-called liberal legislation find themselves besieged by 'economic terrorism', by giving up their land for money coming from the gray and black economies abroad," he says.
"Such liberal laws are particularly dangerous for small states like Montenegro and I believe the state should proceed more cautiously."
By contrast, finance ministry councilor Predrag Stamatovic argues that the state has no business limiting individuals' rights to private property, including the transference of rights to another individual.
"Who has the right to prevent further development and inflow of foreign capital?" he asks, pointing out that taxes on property transfer contributed 40m euros to the state budget last year.
During the negotiations that led to the signing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU last year, Montenegro pledged to open its real-estate market for citizens of EU member states.
Implementation of the SAA is expected to start in 2010, after all the parliaments of all 27 EU members ratify the agreement
Once Montenegro becomes an EU candidate, negotiations will begin on all chapters of the acquis communitaire.
As it conducts an initial screening of Montenegrin laws, the European Commission will evaluate the extent of harmonization with EU criteria.
Property rights for EU citizens will come under the chapters on free movement of goods and capital.
These chapters have, in the past, proven among the most difficult for candidate countries that do not want to relinquish the right to manage their real estate.
For example, Croatia has not been able to conclude negotiations on the free movement of capital chapter.
During the screening two years ago European Commission experts concluded Croatian legislation is not in line with European standards.
In spite of EU warnings, Croatia has been slow to adopt the substantial changes that would allow EU citizens "the necessary rights that would enable them to acquire real estate in Croatia", as the EC put it.
But according to SAA and other documents, Croatia should complete the liberalisation of its real estate markets by 2009.
Citizens of Germany, Belgium, Great Britain, France, Netherlands and Spain can acquire real estate in Croatia based on reciprocity agreements.
The procedure, however, can take up to two years due to administrative red tape.
As a result, many would-be property owners resort to a practice similar to that found in Montenegro, establishing businesses and then acquiring real estate without restrictions.
All the new EU members tried to limit the sales of real estate to the foreigners in their negotiations with EC, whether the issues at question were the secondary residences or economically significant areas.
Malta's attempt was the most successful.
No person who has not lived in Malta for at least five years has the right to buy a secondary residence, and this also applies to Maltese citizens who live abroad.

New Code of Ethics for the Serbian Police
For years, a widespread outcry against police behavior has been heard in Serbia.
Last week, a new code of ethics for Serbian police went into effect.
By Davor Konjikusic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 23/06/03
A good policeman helps people across the street, helps old ladies with their shopping bags, doesn't accept foreign currency concealed in a driver's license, does not stick his hands in the pockets of passersby, does not harass teenagers and refrains from corporal punishment.
This is how the public at large describes the type of Serbian policeman they would like to see, and it's a far cry from what most are seeing now.
A new code of ethics and conduct was completed in May, in accordance with the European Code of Police Ethics, and adopted at the urging of the European Council's Committe of Ministers.
It went into effect last week.
"The code is certainly a good thing because the police have been compromised by their bad public image, mainly because of the behavior of the secret police, and the people at the ministry wish for that attitude of citizens toward policemen to change.
What we need is . a community policeman, a policeman who is well liked and is a member of the community," said Vojin Dimitrijevic, director of the Belgrade Centre for Human Rights.
In the future, members of the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs will be obliged to respect and enforce certain rules in doing their job.
These include presumption of innocence, greater attention to the needs of minority groups, knowledge of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and similar materials, and cordial and responsible behavior toward citizens.
Policemen should inform arrested persons of the reasons for their arrest; attend to the basic needs of arrested persons, and show their badges.
They should not accept gifts or bribes.
According to the code, every member of the ministry is obliged to ignore any order that goes against public interests and is not in keeping with the law.
The code will be included in the curriculum and educational programmes of all police schools beginning this year.
"Uniformed policemen . are showing far more cordiality in dealing with citizens.
Once the police begin behaving with equal cordiality and directness towards nuns as towards criminals, we will be able to say that we finally have a reformed and well trained police force," said Milan Simic from the Committee of Lawyers for Human Rights.
Policemen have welcomed the adoption of the code.
"The effects of this code are not short-term, for this is a long-range benefit for society at large.
Professional rules are needed by everyone, including the police," said Slobodan Miletic, secretary of the internal affairs ministry.
EU urges Turkey to adopt a comprehensive reform programme
The EU urged the Turkish government to speed up the reform process in a key report published last week.
By Ayhan Simsek for Southeast European Times -- 11/11/08
Government pressure on the media remains a problem in Turkey, the report said. [Getty Images]
"Despite its strong political mandate, the [Turkish] government did not put forward a consistent and comprehensive programme of political reforms", the EU said in its 2008 Progress Report.
It criticised Turkey for continuing restrictions on freedom of expression, governmental pressure on the media, the military's influence in politics and lack of progress on ensuring cultural diversity and respect for minorities.
The report also expressed disappointment over the failure of a push for a new constitution to align Turkey with international standards on basic rights.
Criticising the recent controversial bans on certain websites in Turkey, the EU said the bans were "disproportionate in scope and duration".
It also raised the question of government pressure on the news media.
As an example, it cited Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's call for a boycott of Dogan, the country's biggest media group, following its coverage of a major corruption scandal allegedly linked to the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP).
Article 301 of the Turkish criminal code, with its vague provisos criminalising "public denigration" of "Turkishness", remains a sore point for the EU.
In April, parliament adopted amendments restricting the scope of Article 301, but the EU report emphasised they were inadequate.
Turkey's attitude towards its citizens of Kurdish origin has been limited and uneven, according to the EU.
The Kurdish minority still awaits a promised TV channel broadcasting exclusively in its language.
Children with a native tongue other than Turkish cannot learn it in public schools.
The EU's progress report on Turkey also objected to the military's influence in politics, saying, "Senior members of the armed forces have expressed their opinion on domestic and foreign policy issues going beyond their remit."
The AKP reacted by insisting there is no question of its commitment to the EU membership process.
Responding to questions from reporters, Deputy Prime Minister Cemil Cicek said there was no slowdown in efforts to enact EU reforms.
He scolded opposition parties for allegedly showing almost no interest in new reforms.
Cicek also criticised the EU's considerable expectations, saying "Adopting a new law in Turkey is not as easy as taking a cigarette pack from your pocket."
Turkey started EU accession talks in 2005, but negotiators have opened only eight of the 35 necessary chapters and closed only one so far.
The standoff over Cyprus and objections by French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who opposes Turkish membership in the EU, have combined to block the opening of 13 key chapters.
Many analysts in Turkey view inaction on these chapters as the main reason for declining public interest in EU accession.
Despite second-half rally, Serbia-Montenegro comes up short
Serbia-Montenegro's first foray into the 2006 World Cup ended in disappointment.
A one-man show by Chelsea goalscorer Arjen Robben gave the Netherlands an early lead and they held on to win the match 1-0.

It took only 17 minutes for the Netherlands to score a winning a goal and make a successful first step Sunday (11 June) through the "Group of Death" at the 2006 World Cup in Germany.
At the packed Zentralstadion in Leipzig, 43,000 spectators had the chance to witness the superlative play by a single man -- Arjen Robben.
The Chelsea striker got a long-range ball from Robin van Persie, ran 20 metres and slid the ball under Serbia-Montenegro goalkeeper Dragoslav Jevric.
The Serbia-Montenegro defence was caught too far up the pitch.
It was clear that the "Fantastic Four" are not so fantastic without Nemanja Vidic, who had been suspended for one match.
Two minutes before Robben scored, Serbia-Montenegro's "Spanish" forwards -- Savo Milosevic (Osasuna) and Majteja Kezman (Atletico Madrid) ran into each other for a ball that Predrag Djordjevic cut inside, right in front of the Orange side's goalie, Van der Saar.
It was Serbia-Montenegro's first decent chance, and for the remainder of the period they got few others.
In the second half, though, the Dutch took their feet off the gas, while Serbia-Montenegro substitute Ognjen Koroman breathed new life into his side's play.
Running from midfield, he forced his teammates to be more agile and made some good shots.
Coach Ilija Petkovic made several tactical changes, and Igor Duljaj successfully pacified Robben.
Another substitute, 2.02m-tall Nikola Zigic replaced Savo Milosevic, and tried to ambush the Netherlands immediately after the restart.
Koroman and Zigic tested Van der Saar a couple times.
Pressing for an equaliser, Serbia-Montenegro left plenty of space at the other end for the Dutch, but there was no one to take advantage of it.
Ruud van Nistelroij was practically invisible the whole match, like his counterpart Mateja Kezman on the Serbia-Montenegro side.
Beside a few Robben runs, the only real second-half danger came from Van Persie's free kick.
By the end, the Serbia-Montenegro players had regained their confidence and had the Dutch subdued, but they lacked the one thing they needed – support for the lone striker, Zigic.
Despite the improved effort, the Blues remained a goal short.
A win is a win, and the Dutch deservedly picked up three points.
But coach Marco van Basten may be happier with the points than the performance.
Petkovic and his squad, meanwhile, have five days to tune up for an even bigger challenge – Argentina.
Brussels welcomes BiH agreement, calls for concrete action
EU officials say Saturday's deal among the three major parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is a "step in the right direction" but must translate into results.

"We now expect that such a political agreement is implemented with concrete actions in relevant institutions," EU security chief Javier Solana said on Monday (November 10th). [Getty Images]
A surprise agreement among Bosnia and Herzegovina's three largest political parties has drawn praise from EU officials, but Brussels remains concerned about resurgent nationalism in the country.
Meeting on Monday (November 10th), the bloc's top diplomats urged authorities in Sarajevo to assume their responsibilities and push ahead with reforms needed for EU integration.
They welcomed the agreement signed on Saturday but cautioned that it must lead to actual results.
The deal is a "step in the right direction", EU security chief Javier Solana told the newspaper Glas Srpske. "We now expect that such a political agreement is implemented with concrete actions in relevant institutions."
Milorad Dodik of Republika Srpska's Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD), Dragan Covic of the Croat Democratic Union of BiH (HDZ BiH) and Sulejman Tihic of the Bosniak Party of Democratic Action (SDA) signed the accord.
Among other reforms, it calls for overhauling the country's constitution through a series of amendments, conducting a national census in 2011 and determining the status of the Brcko District.
In a joint statement, the three leaders said they agreed on a wide range of issues, including harmonisation of the constitution with the European Human Rights Convention, the competency of the state, functioning of BiH state institutions, division of state property and the territorial organisation of the country, particularly for the middle levels of the government.
They also saw eye to eye on drafting the state budget for next year, the statement indicated.
The agreement came several days after French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner, Solana and EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn sent a strongly worded letter to the BiH presidency, urging its members to resolve issues that have blocked the country's progress towards integration.
The international community's top envoy in BiH, Miroslav Lajcak, said the deal is "proof that compromise is possible when there is readiness for an open dialogue".
The accord has stirred a mixed reaction among opposition parties, however.
While the Serb Democratic Party supports it, the Bosniak Party for BiH and the Croat Democratic Union 1990 have both registered strong objections.
They claim it favours Bosnian Serbs and is not in the interest of Bosniaks and Croats.
In related news, EU defence ministers decided on Monday that the EU's peacekeeping mission in BiH, EUFOR Althea, should remain there until political stability is restored.
The EU had hoped to trim the size of the mission, which began operations in December 2004, but political tensions in the country forced a reconsideration of those plans.
On Monday, BiH presidency members Haris Silajdzic and Zeljko Komsic met with visiting British Foreign Secretary David Miliband, who said his country remains committed to BiH's European integration.
Greece Launches Unprecedented Security Measures for EU Summit
As senior officials, national leaders and members of 32 European country delegations prepare for the upcoming three-day summit in Thessaloniki, the host country is launching what it describes as its biggest security operation ever.
(Reuters, BBC - 17/06/03)
Greece has launched an unprecedented security operation to ward off any possible threats from land, water and air during the EU summit, which will be held from 19 June to 21 June outside its northern city of Thessaloniki. On Tuesday (17 June), the government started deploying thousands of police and army troops as well as surface-to-air missiles and naval ships in the vicinity of the event, whose main venue will be at the Porto Carras resort on the Halkidiki peninsula.
"This is the biggest security operation that has ever been designed with the participation of all of the country's armed forces," Reuters quoted Greek police spokesman Lefteris Economou as saying.
"We must ensure that the location of the summit is completely safe for the participants."
Senior EU officials, national leaders and members of 32 European country delegations are to take part in the three-day summit.
The forum will bring together top officials from the current 15 EU member states and the ten that are due to join next year, as well as leaders of Balkan hopefuls.
Concerned both about terrorist attacks and violent street protests, Greece has mobilised around 16,000 police and armed forces for the massive security operation, including 4,000 army, navy and air force staff.
Dozens of navy frigates, coast guard speedboats and frogmen began sealing off the area of the three hotels in the Porto Carras Hotels Complex on Tuesday.
A barbed wire fence, topped with infrared cameras and stretching more than 11 km, will cut off the access to the Halkidiki peninsula from land.
Snipers with night vision equipment are already on guard in the vineyards and woods surrounding the main hotel, and Patriot, Stinger and Crotale surface-to-air missiles have also been brought to the site.
Riot police have been deployed to ensure that expected street protests do not sour the event, while about 2,000 police are to be positioned along the road leading from Thessaloniki's Macedonia airport to the seaside hotel.
To make sure it is prepared for the worst, Greece is keeping 33 public prosecutors on stand-by, should the need arise to process arrests.
Authorities say at least 60,000 demonstrators are likely to arrive in Thessaloniki, and are expected to stage protests during the summit.
But demonstrators promise more than 100,000 people, who will commit acts described by one as "social disobedience".
While protesters' access to the Porto Carras resort will be blocked off, there will be no restricted zones in Thessaloniki.
"We are an open, multicultural city and will welcome demonstrators," Northern Greece Minister Giorgos Paschalidis said.
Authorities view the EU summit as a key test before the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.
"What we learn we'll apply to the Olympics," a senior police officer said.
Leading Serbian Orthodox Cleric Urges Karadzic to Surrender
A leading member of the Serbian Orthodox Church has called on fugitive Radovan Karadzic to surrender to the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
(The Times, Radio B92 - 26/08/05; SEE Security Monitor, Reuters, Beta - 25/08/05)
“If I had to ask Radovan Karadzic one question it would be ‘do you want to continue living in a hole like a hunted animal, or would it be better to go to The Hague’”, said Amfilohije Radovic, a leading member of the Serbian Orthodox Church. [File]
A leading member of the Serbian Orthodox Church (SOC) has urged fugitive Radovan Karadzic to surrender to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
"If I had to ask Radovan Karadzic one question it would be 'do you want to continue living in a hole like a hunted animal, or would it be better to go to The Hague?'" Amfilohije Radovic, Metropolitan of Montenegro and the Littoral, said in an interview with the Times on Thursday (25 August).
"This is his personal decision, and just as I wouldn't want someone to impose their will on me, I wouldn't like to do the same to him," Amfilohije, who is considered to be Karadzic's spiritual father, told the Times. "But I expect him to make that decision.-- just as he took responsibility to lead the Serbs from Bosnia.
I expect him to do the right thing, to take such responsibility upon himself."
The ICTY indicted the former Bosnian Serb leader 10 years ago, charging him with multiple counts of war crimes for his role in the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
He also faces two counts of genocide in connection with the 43-month siege of Sarajevo and the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.
Karadzic has been on the run for more than eight years now and is widely believed to be hiding in the eastern parts of BiH or in Montenegro.
In late July, Karadzic's wife made a surprise public appeal.
"I beg you with all my heart and soul to surrender," Ljiljana Zelen-Karadzic said in an interview with AP Television News on 28 July. "It will be a sacrifice for us, for the sake of your family."
Noting the tremendous pressure that Karadzic's fugitive status has brought on his family, Amfilohije told the Times that were he in such a situation, his choice would be to surrender.
"I can't say what he should do, but I can say what I would do.
I would go to The Hague," he said.
Described as a supporter and confidant of the Karadzic family, the Metropolitan has denied allegations that he is hiding the ICTY indictee in church property in Montenegro, insisting that he has not seen Karadzic since 1995.
He had given a similar advice to other Serb commanders who recently turned themselves in to the ICTY, the cleric said.
The Metropolitan's remarks follow a report the independent Montenegrin weekly Monitor carried Thursday, suggesting that Karadzic could turn himself in as early as September, ahead of the scheduled start of Serbia-Montenegro's negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU in early October.
Citing sources close to authorities, the Monitor said talks on Karadzic's surrender have intensified recently and that his transfer to the ICTY was being prepared in co-operation with Serbian security services.
The handover of all war crimes suspects wanted by the ICTY is a major condition Serbia-Montenegro and other former Yugoslav republics involved in the Balkan conflicts in the 1990s must meet to be able to join EU and NATO structures.
Turkey Defines New Tactics in Combat With PKK
While reiterating their determination to crack down on terrorist violence, Turkish authorities also say democratisation and reducing economic inequity are key to defusing the militant Kurdistan Workers' Party.

Following a recent rise in attacks by Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) terrorists, authorities in Ankara have launched a new strategy for addressing the problem.
During a visit to Diyarbakir earlier this month, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the solution lies in strengthening democracy.
Turkey's National Security Council (MGK) subsequently met to discuss new measures aimed at boosting the economic development of southeastern Turkey, which has been stymied by 20 years of clashes with the PKK.
According to a report prepared by the MGK General Secretaria, the resurgence in violence in part reflects internal divisions within the PKK, whose leaders have been quarrelling about the group's future direction.
Another reason is the upcoming adoption, expected in September, of Turkey's new antiterrorism law.
Tens of thousands of people have died as a result of the PKK's separatist campaign. In 1999, following the capture of its leader, Abdullah Ocalan, the group declared a unilateral ceasefire and later changed its name.
In June 2005, however, it decided to end the ceasefire and resume armed conflict, especially in the predominantly Kurdish areas of southeastern Turkey.
Worried that the bad old days of bloodshed and government crackdowns could return, NGOs and some Kurdish intellectuals have urged the PKK to lay down its arms, while also calling on Ankara to grant a broad-based amnesty.
A new Kurdish political movement led by former Democracy Party (DEP) deputies Leyla Zana, Orhan Dogan, Selim Sadak and Hatip Dicle has asked the PKK to declare an unconditional and indefinite ceasefire.
Meanwhile, the prime minister's statements emphasising democracy have raised hope that the threat of violence can be defused through conciliation.
Fifteen Kurdish associations, 30 unions, 18 business groups and the Diyarbakır Democracy Platform have backed Erdogan, who risked fierce criticism from Turkish nationalists and some opposition politicians by acknowledging that the "Kurdish question" must be addressed.
Minority rights is among the issues Turkey has to face as part of its bid to join the EU, with membership talks expected to begin on 3 October.
The country has already implemented some reforms in this direction, including the lifting of prohibitions on Kurdish-language broadcasting and educational courses.
At least one PKK leader appears to have responded favourably to the government's initiatives.
Zubeyir Aydar, who is also a former DEP deputy, issued a written statement declaring a one-month ceasefire and saying the recent steps taken by Ankara are an indication of the government's sincerity.

According to reports, the cancellation is due to unacceptably low bids by major participants.
The Bulgarian customs agency announced on 12 November that revenues from import charges reached a record 306m euros in October.
The nearly 20 per cent annual increase is being attributed to an expanded tax base, higher excise duties and a surge in imports.
The Bulgarian Regional Development Ministry says it is considering changes to the preliminary memorandum on the Bourgas-Alexandroupolis pipeline project.

US corporation Johnson Controls to invest in Macedonia
A US corporation producing electronic interiors is planning a multi-phase investment in Macedonia.
The first phase will see construction of a plant for production of automotive interior electronics, while plants manufacturing plastic parts and brake parts will be constructed in the second and third phases, respectively.

The Macedonian government and representatives of the US company, Johnson Controls, signed a memorandum for co-operation and investment earlier this month, allowing the corporation to begin building a plant at the Bunardzik free economic zone near Skopje.
In the first phase, Johnson Controls plans to construct a 6,000 square metre plant to produce automotive interior electronics by 2010.
Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski and General Manager for Electronics and Vice President of Johnson Controls for Europe Thomas Patzelt signed the memorandum on 11 May.
They said that the first phase of the investment, to be launched on 5 September, would provide 500 new jobs.
"With this project Macedonia shows its competitiveness and opens opportunity to be a desirable destination for investment," Buckovski said. "It is now left to us to fulfil the commitments we have undertaken by 1 September.
This means we should complete in a short time all the administrative procedures and construct the infrastructure."
Patzelt said the company will meet the commitments it made within the memorandum.
"We plan to produce electronic products in Macedonia, and they will be first sold in France, Italy and Germany and later throughout the world."
Bob Venyanovich, former vice president of the board of the US company, announced that a line for production of automotive plastic parts will be constructed in the second phase of the investment at Bunardzik, followed by a plant for brake parts in the third phase.
Investment in the infrastructure leading to the zone will amount to about 6m euros.
"This is not a huge investment, since that part has already been built.
We believe with this we can realise what we have been expecting for so long -- that the Bunardzik zone actually comes alive," said Minister of Economy Fatmir Besimi.
Johnson Controls is a global leader in production of seats, batteries and other automotive interiors.
Its partners are General Motors, Daimler Chrysler, Fiat, Ford, Honda, Mazda, Renault, Peugeot, Volkswagen and Toyota.
The company employs 123,000 people and has 275 branches and plants throughout the world.
The company's annual turnover (for 2004) was $26.6m.
The Macedonian government has tried on a few occasions to breathe life into the free economic zone of Bunardzik, a few kilometers from Skopje.
The zone covers 140 hectares and only an unused hall has been built so far. In 2003, an international tender for the zone was announced and won by Welsh Glendor Estates Ltd., to manage the zone.
The contract failed because the Welsh company did not fulfil its obligations.
Business Roundup
A review of business and economic news from the Balkans since 19 December.
(Various sources -- 19/12/03 - 09/01/04)
A review of business and economic news from the Balkans since 19 December:
Renault was the best-selling maker of cars in the Croatian market in 2003, according to figures released 8 January.
The best-selling model was the Clio, with 5,800 cars sold.
Two other French companies, Citroen and Peugeot, came 3rd and 4th in the rankings. The 2nd slot went to Germany's Opel.
The Croatian government adopted a bill for cutting the value added tax in the country from to 22 per cent to 20 per cent as of the beginning of 2005.
The bill would have to be approved by parliament before it could take effect.
The Croatian agriculture ministry pledged to undertake urgent measures to avoid shortages in the local grain market.
Line Minister Petar Cobankovic said the government will sell 30,000 tonnes of wheat from its strategic reserves, allow duty free imports, and will impose bans on flour exports for a period of time.
Republika Srpska signed an agreement for selling a full stake in the Birac alumina plant to the Lithuanian financial group Ukio.
The deal obligates the government to reschedule 38m euros in overdue liabilities.
Officials in Republika Srpska reported that Serbia-Montenegro and Croatia were the entity's largest trade partners for the first 11 months of 2003.
The foreign trade deficit rose to a record 716m euros for the same period, with exports amounting to only a third of imports.
All state dairies in Serbia are to be privatised by June.

Milic: this region can know peace
In an exclusive interview with Southeast European Times, opposition Socialist People's Party leader Srdjan Milic discusses Kosovo, NATO, the EU and the future.
By Brian Salmi for Southeast European Times in Podgorica -- 03/08/09
"In the next five or ten years the countries of Southeast Europe will be together in Europe," SNP leader Srdjan Milic said. [REF/RL]
On October 3rd 2008, opposition Socialist People's Party (SNP) leader Srdjan Milic stood in the Montenegrin parliament and made a bold, headline-grabbing statement about the widespread rumours that Prime Minister Milo Djukonovic's government was on the verge of recognising Kosovo.
"Montenegro can recognise Kosovo the day after Serbia does," said Milic.
Less than a week later, Montenegro recognised the former Serbian province as an independent country.
SNP draws a majority of its support from Montenegro's large Serb minority -- about 30% of the population.
The SNP captured 54,545 votes in the March 2009 election and holds 16 seats in parliament.
In an exclusive interview with Southeast European Times Milic made another Kosovo-related statement. "The Albanian question is not closed in Montenegro.
Let's wait and see what the International Court of Justice in The Hague says," Milic said.
Montenegrin membership in NATO?
The question of Kosovo's status is not the only question weighing on the country. Montenegro became a member of NATO's Partnership for Peace Programme, an entry-level step towards potential full membership, on December 14th 2006. There is a great deal of lingering resentment and animosity in Montenegro towards the Alliance because of its 1999 Balkan intervention.
Montenegrins protested the country's recognition of Kosovo. [File]
Milic hints that the campaign for Montenegrin membership in NATO has, so far, been effective. "Two years ago I would have said you were out of your mind if you were to say that Montenegro would join NATO," he says.
Milic says the SNP is yet to come to a position on NATO membership, and he will not have the party faithful learning his thoughts via the media.
However, a survey conducted by the Centre for Democracy and Human Rights (CEDEM) reported that 30% of respondents favoured NATO membership, 43.3% were against joining the Alliance and 26.7% expressed no opinion on the matter.
Those numbers have not changed by more than 4% since October 2007, when CEDEM began tracking Montenegrins' opinion on the issue.
Milic says NATO has changed in the ten years since the its three-month military campaign against Serbia and its then joined-at-the-hip brother Montenegro.
The effort to sell Alliance membership to his countrymen may not necessarily be an exercise in Sisyphean futility because of that fact.
"I don't think NATO is the same thing in 2009 as it was in 1999.
I think NATO today is more a political organisation than it is military," says the opposition leader.
The CEDEM survey shows that a slight majority of Montenegrins disagree with Milic -- 20.3% said NATO is a "military organization", 30.6% called it a "military/political organisation", while 21.7% think it's a "political/military organisation".
"I think we are moving away from a bipolar world towards one that fights against poverty, that gives aid when natural catastrophes occur, that works on the challenges of the modern age and does not resemble the cold war of NATO and the Warsaw Pact," says Milic.
Milic says something must be done to enlighten the almost 50% of Montenegrins who profess ignorance on issues regarding the country's defence and its relationship with NATO. "That is something we must address now.
We must not stay behind our barricades and divide ourselves about this."
Montenegro's EU membership aspirations

Milic's one-year term as the country's National Council for European Integration president ended last week.
While he held the post, he had a strong belief that the country could and will join the Union. He believes that, "in the next five or ten years the countries of Southeast Europe will be together in Europe."
"In 1990, Yugoslavia was on the door of the EU.
In this period we had many young, clever politicians and we have lost 18, 19 years.
My generation is a lost generation.
I don't want to lose another generation."
"We need to be the owners of that process. I don't think it's good to say, 'If you finish your job, you will be, in 2011, a member.' No deadlines about when we will become a member of the EU."
"Montenegro can be a successful European story, but first of all we have to integrate Montenegrins into Montenegro and then we can talk about [European, Euro-Atlantic] integration."
A step towards regional peace
"Would you allow any of your children to marry an Albanian?"
"Yes," Milic says, without hesitation. "That [whom his children marry] is not about me."
After pausing, Milic says, "I want to tell you a story."
On March 23rd 1999, at the outset of the NATO intervention in the Balkans, Milic received a phone call from an old Albanian friend.
The first bombs would be dropped just 10km from Milic's home, mere hours after the call.
The two had studied economics together in Dubrovnik, Croatia. The Albanian had been living in Germany for the previous nine years. "My friend said, 'I see what is going to happen.
Please send your wife and children to stay with me.'"
Milic pauses, then adds solemnly, "That kind of spirit gave me hope that this region can know peace."
Leaders in Kosovo fail to agree on strategy for status talks
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leaders met on Friday to discuss a common strategy for the upcoming UN-backed talks on the province's future status, but failed to reach an agreement.

With the launch of talks on Kosovo's future status quickly approaching, the province's ethnic Albanian leaders were unable Friday (28 October) to agree on a common negotiating strategy.
"I hope that in our next meeting we will have more creativity and understanding for each other's ideas and more tolerance," Veton Surroi, the leader of opposition party ORA, said after a discussion in Pristina.
The team, which will be led by Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova, includes Prime Minister Bajram Kosumi, Assembly Speaker Nexhat Daci, Democratic Party of Kosovo leader Hashim Thaci, and Surroi.
Last Monday, the UN Security Council endorsed starting the status talks, which are expected to begin following the appointment of a special UN envoy.
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has named former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari as the person likely to be assigned to the job.
Meanwhile, international officials have urged the Kosovo Albanian leaders to step up preparations.
"I think it would be good to have a quick parliament session, and a clear and good resolution that would be a guideline for the negotiating team, enabling it to know what its goal is," UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen was quoted as saying Thursday after a meeting with Rugova.
The talks are expected to initially be in the form of shuttle diplomacy before the parties involved take their seats at the negotiating table.
"(Finding a solution) has to start from first listening to the different parties, even if their views are fairly well known," Reuters quoted Ahtisaari as saying Saturday in an interview with Finnish national broadcaster YLE.
"Then we need to discuss with them how these problems could be addressed.
There is still a lot of basic work to be done before any kind of specific discussions can begin," he added.
Ahtisaari, 68, played a key role in international efforts to end the Kosovo conflict in 1999, when he persuaded then-Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to accept NATO's terms.
He is also given credit for mediating a peace deal between the Indonesian government and the secessionist Free Aceh Movement this summer.
Farewell, South Africa
A second loss for Serbia sends the team packing.
By Dejan Stankovic for Southeast European Times in Johannesburg and Nelspruit -- 24/06/10
World Cup fans celebrate in South Africa. [Dejan Stankovich/SETimes]
Day 15, June 22nd
Off to Nelspruit, the site of our final group match with Australia.
Now, definitively, the deciding one.
We chose not to go on the freeway, but rather to take a somewhat longer route so we could see some interesting parts of South Africa.
And yes, it was a good decision.
The countryside is wonderful and now we understand why this is considered one of the prettiest countries in the world.
It's beautiful.
We stopped at a small town called Pilgrims' Rest in the province of Mpumalanga, an hour's drive from Nelspruit, the provincial capital.
It was declared a national monument in 1986 because gold digging began there.
The architecture is pretty much the same as it was at the end of the 19th century.
The biggest highlight was the lively local market, where one could buy everything from African crafts and jewelry to Zulu masks.
The prices were very high.
But then came negotiating.
If you pay even 50% of the marked price ... well, you're a fool.
Some of us managed to buy things officially worth 30 euros for only 3 euros.
The Mbombela stadium in Nelspruit is definitely one of the nicest I have ever seen.
It's newly built for the World Cup.
From outside it looks as though it is being carried by 18 giraffes.
Inside, the black-and-white design recalls the zebra.
The wildlife theme is no accident -- we are near Kruger Park, the biggest national park in South Africa.
The only problem with the stadium is that it is hard to envision its future use.
The city of Nelspruit has been officially renamed Mbombela, though many ignore that.
It is the smallest of all the host cities, with slightly over 200,000 residents.
The next season will be the first one since the mid-1990's in which Mbombela/Nelspruit will have a Premium League club. It's not easy to fill a 40,000-seater.
There's much less to do here than in Johannesburg or Port Elisabeth.
After 10pm, McDonald's is the sole culinary option.
After the games, when all the fans run out to celebrate or console themselves, they need to eat.
One McDonald's just isn't enough.
Day 16, June 23rd
Another disappointment.
Defeat against Australia 1-2.
A shameful farewell for us.
Our coach blames referee Jorge Larionda, who didn't give us a penalty after Tim Cahill played an obvious handball.
We all think that is not an excuse.
We've lost against Ghana and against Australia, two teams that are -- at least if you look at players' names -- worse than us.
We lost, and we should go home early.
Still, there has been some disastrous refereeing here.
Plenty of mistakes by the refs; beginner's mistakes.
Red cards, penalties, offsides.
Ghana was also a victim.
Germany's Philip Lahm got away with a handball on the goal line.
He should have got a red card, and Ghana should have got the penalty.
At the start of the tournament, the quality of play was low.
As things heat up, it is getting better.
The big guns are starting to play their game, and I'm sure that by the end we're going to see some great football.
It's a World Cup, and South Africa is the world.
Africa is the world.
It's not just Europe, the Americas and China, Japan or South Korea.
What with the empty stadium seats and organisational problems -- not to mention the highly unpredictable Jabulani ball -- this Cup has had its shortcomings.
But it's here to stay in our memories.
And isn't that why World Cups are held?
Turkey intensifies measures against PKK
Leaders seek to build a united front as the PKK terrorist organisation shifts to a more violent strategy.
By Erol Izmirli for Southeast European Times in Istanbul -- 24/06/10

Tuesday's (June 22nd) bomb attack on a military bus in Istanbul, the country's largest city with nearly 13 million residents, has fueled concerns that the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) is now targeting urban areas.
Responsibility has been claimed by the "Kurdistan Freedom Falcons", thought to be linked to the PKK.
It was the latest in a series of incidents since late May, primarily in the country's southeastern Anatolian region.
The terrorist organisation ended a unilateral ceasefire on May 31st, saying the government has failed to meet the demands of the Kurdish people.
With the apparent change in PKK tactics, authorities are considering how best to respond, in order to protect the public.
On Monday, the country's top civilian and military officials convened a security summit under the leadership of President Abdullah Gul.
The summit resulted in a new threefold counterterrorism strategy.
It entails an overhaul of intelligence and re-organising combat troops at the Iraqi border, a risky mountainous region where the majority of the attacks are perpetrated as the terrorists filter from the country's north.
In the future, new recruits will only be sent to this region after intensive training, and only when there is a need for more troops.
The idea is to deploy specialised sergeants in this region and strengthen the military outposts.
The strategy also aims to boost co-operation with neighbouring countries and the United States, which has been providing actionable intelligence to Turkey since 2007.
"We stand ready to review urgently any new requests from the Turkish military or government regarding the PKK," US Ambassador to Turkey James Jeffrey said on Monday.
Apart from these measures, an effort is being made to bring all of Turkey's political parties, as well as NGOs and the press, together in a united front against terrorism.
"Terror is a national problem," wrote veteran journalist Fikret Bila. "The best way for the government and the opposition is to find solutions together."
Gul held separate meetings with opposition leaders in the aftermath of the deadly attacks, urging them to help find common ground.
He will also meet with representatives of the country's NGOs.
Leaders have also been trying to prevent ethnic clashes, in the wake of the latest terror wave.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has urged the press to be responsible in its coverage.
"Unfortunately, the media is intentionally or unintentionally supporting the terrorist organisation in a serious way," Erdogan said on Tuesday during an address to parliament.
Nihat Ali Ozcan, an expert on security matters, says fueling ethnic separatism is central to the PKK's strategy.
"The PKK was aiming to build its identity by using terror and violence," Ozcan said in an interview with Today's Zaman on Wednesday. "The identity-building process is over.
The PKK is looking to strengthen this, but it cannot achieve this goal by using the old methods.
If it transforms the existing situation into ethnic clashes, then the identities will be crystallised."
"The role of the media is very important.
It should not use separatist language," he added.
UNODC: heroin, cocaine consumption falls, synthetic drugs use on rise
Though the production and use of opiates and cocaine is declining, the consumption of synthetic drugs is climbing, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime said on Wednesday.

Global drug use is shifting from heroin and cocaine towards synthetic drugs, the UN said on Wednesday (June 23rd), also noting a growing demand for illicit substances in developing countries.
According to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), between 155 million and 250 million people in the world, or between 3.5% and 5.7% of the population aged 15-64, used drugs at least once in 2008.
While cannabis remains the most widely produced and consumed illicit substance globally, synthetic drugs like amphetamine-type stimulants are now the second most commonly used drug, ahead of cocaine and opiates, it said in its World Drug Report 2010.
"People are saying goodbye to heroin and they are nearly not so much enchanted by cocaine, but they are starting to use prescription drugs by volumes, which make them addictive," UNODC head Antonio Maria Costa told reporters as he presented the report Wednesday.
According to the study, at least 130 million to 190 million people smoke cannabis at least once a year.
The number of those using amphetamine-type stimulants totals an estimated 30 million to 40 million people worldwide, but could soon surpass that of opiate and cocaine users combined.
That trend is valid for the Southeast European (SEE) nations as well. The highest annual prevalence of cannabis among people aged 15-64 was found in Croatia, at 5.2%.
It is followed by Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Bulgaria, where the share of cannabis users stood at 4.1%, 2.8% and 2.5%, respectively.
Synthetic drug consumption in the SEE region was highest in BiH and Bulgaria, where one out of every 100 people used amphetamine-type stimulants in 2008.
It was lowest in Albania and Romania, at 0.1% each, with the latest statistics for the two countries dating back to 2004 and 2007, respectively.
"These new drugs cause a double problem," said Costa. "First, they are being developed at a much faster rate than regulatory norms and law enforcement can keep up.
Second, their marketing is cunningly clever, as they are custom-manufactured so as to meet the specific preference in each situation."
Production of what the UNODC describes as the world's "main problem drugs" -- cocaine and heroin -- declined, and is expected to continue to do so, according to the report.
Coca cultivation in the Andes, which decreased by 28% over the past decade, continued to drop in 2009, largely due to eradication efforts in Colombia.
World cocaine production fell by between 12% and 18% from 2007-2009, UNODC figures showed.
Meanwhile, the market for that drug, worth an estimated $88 billion, is shifting towards Europe.
It is severely destabilising countries in West Africa as well, the report said.
The number of cocaine users in Europe has doubled over the last decade to about 4 million people, who consumed about one quarter of the global production in 2008.
North America remains the world's biggest market for that drug and is valued at $37 billion.
But, the European one appears to have almost caught up, and is now worth $34 billion.
The highest prevalence of cocaine use on the "old" continent was found in Scotland (at 3.9%), England and Wales, and Italy, at 3% in each.
In each of the SEE countries, it was lower than 1%.
It was 0.9% in Croatia and 0.8% in Montenegro.
The global area under opium cultivation has shrunk by almost a quarter in the past two years, the UNODC said, adding that opium production will likely decline further, due to a blight that could wipe out a quarter of Afghanistan's poppy crop.
In Europe, the prevalence of heroin use was found to be highest in Scotland at 1.54% and Estonia, at 1.52%.
Among the SEE countries, it was highest in Macedonia at 0.5%, Bulgaria at 0.49% and Albania, with 0.45%.
Costa voiced particular concern about the impact of drug consumption in the developing world.
"Poor countries are not in a position to absorb the consequences of increased drug use," he said. "The developing world faces a looming crisis that would enslave millions to the misery of drug dependence ...
We will not solve the world drug problem by shifting consumption from the developed to the developing world."

Serbia ignores UN objections to holding local elections in Kosovo
Serbia's elections commission published a decree Monday, indicating that Belgrade is planning to brush aside UNMIK's opposition and hold local elections in Kosovo.
(B92 - 15/04/08; AP, B92, Balkan Insight, Javno.hr - 14/04/08; Balkan Insight - 11/04/08; Reuters - 09/04/08)

Serbia made it clear Monday (April 14th) that it intends to hold local elections in Kosovo next month, despite warnings that the vote would violate UN Security Council Resolution 1244 and thereby would be illegal.
UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker insists only the UN has the right to conduct elections in Kosovo.
However, he has said Serbia could help organise UN-run local elections in Serb-dominated municipalities this year, and he acknowledged Belgrade's right to conduct parliamentary elections in Kosovo.
"Local elections of Serbia in Kosovo would be illegal based on UN Security Council Resolution 1244," he wrote in response to a letter by Serbia's Minister for Kosovo, Slobodan Samardzic, that disclosed Belgrade's plans to hold elections in Kosovo. "However, parliamentary elections may take place."
Serbian local and parliamentary elections will take place simultaneously on May 11th.
A decision by Serbia's election commission, published in the country's official gazette Monday, contained instructions on the organisation of local elections in Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia on February 17th.
It listed 16 municipalities, including Pristina, where polling stations for both votes will be established.
Serbia rejects Kosovo's independence, although three dozen countries, including most EU member nations, have recognised it thus far.
A rift between the pro-European and nationalist parties in Serbia's ruling coalition over how to respond to Kosovo's declaration of independence led to the government's collapse last month, and early elections were scheduled.
Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica told Belgrade-based B92 on Monday that the main purpose of holding the vote in Kosovo is to "simply legitimise" it as a part of his country, irrespective of what UNMIK wants.
Samardzic, who is a member of Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia, meanwhile urged the UNMIK chief to call local elections in Kosovo, to be organised by Serbian authorities.
"UNMIK is not able to organise and hold local elections for Serbs in Kosovo because last summer Ruecker made amendments to election regulations… [thus violating] Security Council Resolution 1244," the government quoted Samardzic as saying.
Belgrade's push for holding local elections in Kosovo sparked criticism by ethnic Albanian leaders in Pristina.
Viewing it as an attempt to sow instability in Europe's newest state, they called on UNMIK to prevent the vote from taking place.
"Independent Kosovo is one electoral zone for all of its citizens," President Fatmir Sejdiu was quoted as saying. "It is the responsibility of UNMIK to give a better response to such initiatives, which aim to destabilise Kosovo and to de-institutionalise it in practice."
As it would be difficult for UNMIK and KFOR to prevent Kosovo Serbs from voting in the local elections, international officials indicate that if they do happen, the results of the poll would not be recognised.
UNMIK "has not received any answer to the letter sent by Mr. Ruecker to Belgrade authorities... but if local elections are held in Kosovo, then it is evident they will be considered illegal," Balkan Insight quoted Sven Lindholm, a spokesman of the UN mission, as saying.
Rising prices in Macedonia trigger calls for government action
Prices in Macedonia continue to soar, prompting the public to call for government intervention.

The latest in a series of price increases in Macedonia -- on cooking oil, petrol and heat -- has resulted in a public outcry.
Many say their salaries cannot keep up with rising prices.
"It is very difficult.
If this trend continues, what will the result be?" one consumer asks.
However, government efforts at containing inflation remain unsuccessful to this point.
Local economists fear that inflation will surpass 10%.
In January, authorities reported annualised inflation of 8.7% and suggested that the government lower budget expenses and subsidise the agricultural sector.
"If, in the first month of the year, you have high inflation and if you do not take adequate measures, the year may end with an inflation rate above 10%.
There is room for panic, and the government should strive to lower inflation," Macedonian University economics professor Zoran Ivanovski said.
Many say that the rise in prices is tied to global increases in oil and gas prices but that the country must neutralise the effects nonetheless.
Government officials, however, say that there are no more options for intervention.
"We as a government are using everything that we have on disposal as a market-oriented country," Deputy Prime Minister Zoran Stavreski said.
"The current situation is caused by the drought and worldwide climate change.
The price of wheat went up.
We are looking at the … experiences of other countries, and soon we will come up with some measures, but it won't be something spectacular.
I do not expect that we will have serious annual problems with inflation," Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said.
At the end of last month, Stavreski said the government expected a break in inflationary momentum.
"The figure should not breach the 6% mark by the end of 2008," he told media.
In just a few months, prices of key goods and services rose almost 50%, prompting the government to increase pensions and salaries in the public sector by 10%.
The National Bank also took pro-active steps to lower the inflation rate.
It raised the interest rate on treasury bills from 5.08% to 5.25% and expects the action to curb inflation temporarily.
The increase in direct foreign investment, which was 240m euros in 2007, has helped buoy the economy, which in turn should help control inflation.
The country was earmarked for nearly 100m euros in investments just in the first two months of 2008, Stavreski said.
Report: Agriculture becoming more of a priority in BiH
Bosnia and Herzegovina must put agriculture among its top priorities, said Federation of BiH Minister of Agriculture, Water Management and Forestry Damir Ljubic.

The agriculture sector saw permanent growth in the past five years. [AFP]
Of the 144 municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), 114 can be characterised as rural -- areas where almost 61% of the population resides.
"These indicators sufficiently suggest that BiH must take a strategic and political decision to place agricultural development among its top priorities.
Unless we do it, we cannot expect better days for BiH agriculture," Agriculture, Water Management and Forestry Minister Damir Ljubic said.
Ljubic, presenting the 2007 Agriculture Sector report for BiH in Sarajevo last month, noted that, at this point, rural development is not among the three core priorities in BiH.
The report -- developed by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations (MoFTER) -- contains an overview of activities in the agriculture sector, including main trends in 2005 and 2006 and projections and policy priorities for 2008.
MoFTER is currently the only state-level authority in charge of agriculture, in co-operation with representatives of the entity-level agricultural ministries and departments and with experts provided by the European Commission's SESMARD Project.
According to BiH Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations Vilim Primorac, agriculture enjoyed permanent growth over the past five years and its deficit has been visibly shrinking over the past two years.
"We believe that this year will be a turning point, because BiH is poised to join the World Trade Organisation; it already signed CEFTA, and hopefully it also will sign the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
We will be facing an opening market of some 6 million people, where BiH exporters will have numerous opportunities.
However, we now must make our farmers more efficient and able to cope with competition," Primorac said.
BiH is primarily an agricultural country, with 15% of its land under cultivation, mainly by the private sector.
The richest soils are in the north along the Sava River valley.
In more hilly areas, land is used for both cultivation and grazing.
Principal crops are wheat, corn, barley, soybeans and potatoes.
In Herzegovina and in the more sheltered areas of Bosnia, tobacco is grown.
Sheep are the principal livestock, although cattle and pigs also are raised.
During the 1992–1995 conflict in the country, about 10% of the agriculture sector was damaged.
One of the main hurdles to reconstruction is the continuing abundance of land mines and other unexploded ordnance throughout the country.
A World Bank assessment suggests that mine removal may cost as much as 10 billion euros.
Cyprus celebrates 50 years of independence

Romania's Chief EU Negotiator: We Will be Ready for Membership in 2007
In its latest country report, the European Commission concluded that Romania "complies with the criterion of being a functioning market economy".
However, the 2004 report also expressed concerns about freedom of the press and high-level corruption, and Brussels is insisting that a "safety clause" be added to the Accession Treaty, allowing for postponement of Romania's membership by one year if it fails to meet its commitments.
Meanwhile, the country now faces the task of completing three difficult negotiation chapters before the end of the year.
Despite these challenges, Romania's Chief Negotiator with the EU, Vasile Puscas, remains optimistic.

Romania has to close three difficult chapters -- Environment, Justice, and Home Affairs and Competition -- by the end of the year in order to sign the Accession Treaty in the first half of 2005 and achieve EU membership during 2007.
Although the task is daunting, Romanian chief negotiator for the EU Vasile Puscas says he remains optimistic.
Southeast European Times: The European Commission (EC) finally granted Romania functioning market economy status.
Was this simply a "diplomatic gift", as the headlines suggested?
Vasile Puscas: It is not a "diplomatic gift" at all.
We set out to fulfil the basic criteria of a functioning market economy, from liberalised prices to a low inflation rate and a stable macroeconomic situation, and all of these were accomplished.
States that received the same status -- Bulgaria in 2002, Poland in 1997 -- were analysed according to the same criteria.
SETimes: The EC's report cautions that the Romanian economy does not currently have the capacity to meet the pressures of competition in a single European market.
Puscas: Aspects of Central and Eastern European transitional countries were taken into account when EU criteria were established in 1993.
It was expected that countries should reach the status of a functioning market economy, and then, if reforms were continued, an increased competitive level would take place.
SETimes: Do you expect, then, that the Romanian economy will be able to cope with competitive pressures in the future?
Romania hopes to join the EU in 2007. [EU]
Puscas: It is absolutely necessary.
What concerns us in our involvement as players in the EU market is that we have to cope with our own competitive system and become prepared, with our own products, for an enlarged market of 500 million people.
I emphasise that this year's country report states that Romania will be able to deal, in 2007, with member state status.
SETimes: Will you be able to close the three remaining chapters -- Environment, Justice, and Home Affairs and Competition -- by the end of the year?
Puscas: The strategy paper mentioned for the first time that "the Commission will make every effort" to conclude negotiations by the end of the year.
Until now, it was a common objective to conclude negotiations in 2004.
The chapters will be closed in December. At that time, the European Council, meeting in force, will assess the accession issue both for Bulgaria and Romania.
SETimes: The last country report includes sharp criticism concerning issues such as media freedom and corruption.
Does this make you uncomfortable?
Puscas: It makes us all uncomfortable.
We need to be careful, because this report is not addressed only to the chief negotiator or his team, but to all Romanians, to Romanian society.
And we need to watch to make sure that the government supports measures for guaranteeing media freedom, develops the legal aspects and ensures implementation.
We need to deal with these critiques and to be sure they don’t spread to other sectors, because freedom of expression is a much wider area.
SETimes: The term "high-level corruption" showed up for the first time during this administration within the 2003 Commission report.
This term was never used before.
Puscas: Corruption needs to be approached from top to bottom.
We are trying such an approach and the National Anti-Corruption Prosecution Office understands the importance of the issue.
Corruption is not only a matter of morality or politics.
I previously mentioned the competitive system -- competition will strengthen only if corruption decreases.
SETimes: You accepted a "safeguard clause" allowing Brussels to postpone Romania’s accession for one year if commitments are not met.
Were you pushed by the EU to accept it as a means of continuing the momentum for reforms after negotiations are closed?
Puscas: Special clauses were also enforced for the ten [new member] countries regarding justice, domestic affairs and agriculture.
The novelty in the case of Bulgaria and Romania is this safeguard clause, allowing for postponement of the accession date if, during the monitoring process, the results do not match initial commitments.
SETimes: Elections are coming up in November.
How might a change in government influence the negotiations and the accession process?
Puscas: We hope all technical solutions still under negotiation will be finalised at that time.
I also hope that, in the remaining period, politicians will not influence the negotiation process, but leave it on its natural course until December.

Archaeologists have unearthed an ancient terracotta medicine bottle during excavations at a building site in the centre of Bodrum, Turkey.
The finding is the first of its kind from the Hellenistic period in ancient Halicarnassus.
Scholars are trying to determine whether there is a possible connection between the bottle and Hippocratic school of medicine in ancient Kos, the Greek island nearest to Bodrum.

Romania Won't Vote on Security Council Resolution on ICC
Romania signed a bilateral agreement with the United States in 2002 on non-extradition of citizens to the International Criminal Court.
However, the country now says it will abstain from voting on a Security Council resolution that would extend immunity for US military personnel.

Romania will abstain from voting as the UN Security Council decides on a resolution granting immunity from the International Criminal Court to US military personnel, according to Romanian Foreign Minister Mircea Geoana.
Following consultations with the foreign ministers of permanent and non-permanent member states of the Security Council and with US diplomats, Romania has decided to withhold its vote, Geoana said.
Romania's UN ambassador, Mihnea Motoc, said his country would keep to its neutral position during what he described as a complex international debate.
In 2002, Romania became the first European country to sign a bilateral agreement with the United States on the non-extradition of US citizens to the ICC.
The government came under sharp criticism from EU officials for signing the agreement without consulting the European Commission on the issue.
While the agreement is still valid, it has yet to be discussed or ratified by the Romanian Parliament.
As an EU candidate country and a strong regional military partner of the United States, Romania is in the delicate position of negotiating between different requirements.
The United States needs at least nine favourable votes from Security Council members for the resolution to be adopted and for US soldiers to be granted immunity from the ICC.
The resolution was proposed last month, and then withdrawn.
The United States hopes the proposal will be adopted before 1 July when a prior resolution on the same issue expires.
World Bank Forum Targets Growth in Southeast Europe
The World Bank Forum gathered in Munich in early May to focus on economic growth in Southeast Europe.
Leading economist and former Romanian Minister of Finance Daniel Daianu reflects on the themes of the meeting.

The World Bank Forum convened in Munich, Germany, at the beginning of May.
The gathering brought together top economic officials from Southeast Europe, Germany and the World Bank. Ministers from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia-Montenegro and Slovenia took part, and hundreds of German businesspeople were in attendance.
The forum's theme, Responsible Growth in Southeast Europe, was quite telling.
During the last few years, economic growth has been a general feature across the region.
Economic reforms have been advancing, to a greater or lesser extent, in all countries.
A perceptible change of climate has stimulated Foreign Direct Investment.
However, the Western Balkans still have a long path ahead of them when it comes to institutional build-up, premises for durable growth and social cohesion.
These issues made up the building blocks of the conference in Munich, and were the focus of several panels: governance; connectivity (infrastructure); human development and social cohesion; and private sector development.
World Bank President Jim Wolfensohn has frequently made the case that social and economic issues are inextricably interwoven in development, that growth can happen under various conditions and that its effects on people at large are not inconsequential. In the late 1990s, the Comprehensive Development Framework was put forward as a matrix for thinking about growth strategies.
The framework was resuscitated during the Munich conference, in terms of the emphasis placed on social issues.
Wolfensohn's keynote speech at the Forum was an application of this vision to a region where unemployment remains high by European standards, where crime is widespread and where hopes have yet to brighten for large segments of the population.
The Forum was quite indicative of the variety of conditions in Southeast Europe.
Slovenia and Hungary are now EU member countries, and see themselves as a "springboard" for investments in the region.
Romania and Bulgaria are focusing on closing the remaining negotiating chapters of EU accession, and hope that 2007 will be the year of their membership.
For both countries the terms of accession are of great importance, given the size of their rural sectors, the need to modernise energy sectors and infrastructure, and the very demanding EU competition policy, which could bring many local companies to failure unless competitiveness challenges are addressed in a timely manner.
Croatia, which was recently put on a fast track to EU membership, hopes to join along with Bulgaria and Romania.
Macedonia, too, has high hopes.
In general, the countries of the Western Balkans, in spite of political uncertainties and status-related questions, are driven by the guiding belief that, sooner or later, they will join the EU.
They view membership in the Union as the best anchor for stability and economic development.
The EU's engagement in the region is crucial, and can be judged in terms of a strategic vision -- assistance, economic and trade arrangements and labour flows.
At the Forum, Wolfensohn noted that there are 5 billion poor people around the world who badly need the World Bank's attention.
While this does not mean that the Bank is relinquishing its various assistance windows to the region, his observation was a stark reminder that Europe should not think about itself only, and that the EU has to shoulder more responsibilities where it can and where its strategic interests are unambiguous.

Debates were held on how to stimulate the development of the private sector; on whether public-private partnerships -- in the field of infrastructure development -- can work in countries where income per capita is low; and on ways to foster small- and medium-sized enterprises.
The discussion on improving public and private sector governance showed that high-level policymakers and business people know what the major challenges are; less known are the best venues for overcoming obstacles.
In the end, tenacity, persistence, open-mindedness and intelligence should carry the day.
There is an enormous amount of political, institutional and economic work to do in Southeast Europe; miracles cannot be achieved overnight.
But the change is there and palpable, and joining the EU is a beacon which stimulates further political and economic transformation.

The world's biggest copper producer, US-based Phelps Dodge, has been awarded an exploration license for mining operations in Kosovo, UNMIK confirmed.
The company must begin work within 90 days.
An international official called the contract a "major development and the first of its kind in Kosovo".
The province is believed to contain a minimum of 13.5 billion euros worth of minerals and metals, including copper, zinc and lead.
Greek media employees held a 24-hour strike on Thursday (24 November), demanding a new collective labour contract, better labour conditions and higher wages.
Apart from some reports on the strike, no news coverage took place during the day and the morning papers were not published.
Albania's government approved the purchase of 20,000 MWh from Bulgaria under a direct procurement procedure.
The power will help resolve the acute energy crisis in Albania.
The Turkish government plans to cut corporate tax rates to 25 per cent from 30 per cent next year, with a further 10 per cent reduction to be made over a period of four years starting in 2007.
Turkish leaders now face the task of convincing the IMF to accept the tax cut plan, aimed at boosting foreign investment.
The minimum wage in Montenegro will rise from 50 euros to 52 euros, effective from 1 December, and by another 1 euro no later than August 2006, under a new agreement between the government, trade unions and employers.
The accord is to be formally signed within the coming days.
The Macedonian government adopted the draft state budget for 2006.
It projects a nearly 28m-euro budget deficit, to be covered primarily from external credits.
The draft next goes to Parliament for approval by the end of this year.
The Republika Srpska cabinet extended the deadline for submitting bids in the Bosanski Brod tender from 24 November to 8 December.
The government said it wants to allow more companies that have shown interest in the refinery to participate in the tender.
Greece's Public Power Corporation said its net profits dropped 39.5 per cent to 155.1m euros between January and September.
It cited hikes in crude oil and natural gas prices as well as rising environmental costs as the reasons for the decline.
Romania reached an agreement with Wintershall Erdgas Handelshaus Zug, a joint venture between Russia's Gazprom and Germany's Wintershall, on the extension of a natural gas supply deal until 2030. The deal, which has been in force since 1993, was initially due to expire in 2012.
Athens, Skopje want progress in name dispute talks, Nimetz says
UN envoy Matthew Nimetz met with Greek and Macedonian representatives late last week to discuss the ongoing name dispute.
The envoy is expected to hold another round of discussions by July 9th.

After meeting with representatives from Greece and Macedonia last week, Matthew Nimetz, the UN envoy in the ongoing name dispute, said he believes efficient talks are under way between Skopje and Athens but that no concrete proposals are on the table.
Nimetz's remarks came after he met on Thursday (June 26th) with Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis and Greece's representative in the talks, Adamantios Vassilakis, in Athens, and then on Friday with Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, President Branko Crvenkovski and Macedonian negotiator Nikola Dimitrov in Skopje.
Optimistically, he said, both countries approached the talks seriously.
"I won't say that the gap is closing as the views for the way of resolving the issue are different, but both countries expressed readiness to look into the possibility of making progress now," Nimetz said after the meetings.
Athens has made clear issues that are not subject to negotiation.
The country's main concern is finding a common name for use both domestically and internationally.
The best solution, according to the Greek government, is a name with a geographical determination such as North Macedonia.
Greece has said it will not accept the recognition of "Macedonian" identity and language.
During his visit last week, Nimetz said he will work to separate those two issues and find a name usable for all formal references to the former Yugoslav state.
In April, Greece blocked Macedonia's NATO accession at the Bucharest summit.
According to Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis, the European Council has said that finding a solution to the matter is a prerequisite for Macedonia's European integration.
"We hope that the new government will leave behind the provocative rhetoric of the pre-election period, in order to mutually agree on a solution," he minister said.
In Skopje on Friday, Nimetz met with Gruevski and Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki.
He held a separate meeting with Crvenkovski.
Local media interpreted the separate encounters as evidence of a rift between the president and prime minister on some matters.
According to several media reports, Gruevski opened the issue of Macedonians in northern Greece and their minority rights.
Reportedly, the prime minister demanded that those groups, who left Macedonia during the Greek civil war, should have their nationality and property restored.
Athens said an agreement must precede discussion of its implementation.
The envoy is expected to announce his next step in the dispute negotiations this week, which likely will include another round of intensive diplomatic contacts and direct meetings with representatives of both countries by July 9th.
Romanian prosecutors charge border, customs officers
BUCHAREST, Romania -- Anti-graft prosecutors filed charges Wednesday (April 27th) against 66 customs and police officers serving at the northern Siret customs point.
They are accused of taking and offering bribes and supporting criminal networks between September 2010 and January 2011.
Prosecutors say the group received a total of 890,000 euros and other benefits by waving smuggled cigarettes and alcohol from Ukraine through the customs point. (Ziare - 28/04/11; Hotnews.ro, Romania Libera - 27/04/11)
Sequi: Albania's EU membership requires reforms, free elections
TIRANA, Albania -- The head of the EU delegation in Albania, Ettore Sequi, said on Wednesday (April 27th) that Albania needs to commit to reforms in order to move ahead in its EU integration bid.
"For Albania to become an EU member, it needs to grant citizens rights in their country and then join other nations and citizens,â Sequi said during a round table on the benefits of visa liberalisation, organised by the NGO European Movement.
Albanians have been enjoying free movement since the end of 2010.
Lifting the visa regime was a big step, Sequi said, but pointed out that EU membership involves democratic maturity. (News 24, Balkan Web, Ora News - 27/04/11)
More women entering Serbian politics
A growing number of women hold official state posts, but men still dominate Serbia's political arena.
By Bojana Milovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 05/04/11

Last year, Serbia passed a bill regulating gender equality, but the traditional Balkan notion that women belong at home is slow to change.
Still, the vice-president of the Gender Equality Council and state secretary in the Labour and Social Policy Ministry, Snezana Lakicevic, says women have far more opportunities in Serbian politics than was the case even a few years ago.
"We have a female parliament speaker, deputy prime minister, justice minister and, for the first time ever, a woman in a high position in the defence ministry, the assistant minister," Lakicevic told SETimes.
She added that in the Serbian judiciary women hold the highest posts, including at the helm of the Constitutional Court and state prosecution.
Lakicevic, a member of the ruling Democratic Party (DS), says men are no longer wary of women in politics, but women still have to fight hard for their position in political parties.
"Full equality in political parties still requires a lot of work [for women].
We cannot ignore that every political party in Serbia today has a female vice president," Lakicevic said.
While Serbia made big progress in implementing gender equality, she said, a rise in domestic violence cannot be overlooked.
Women face a more difficult economic situation than men, a higher percentage of women are unemployed and salaries of employed women are lower than those of their male colleagues, she added.
Jelena Trivan, DS spokeswoman and a representative in the parliament, says stereotypes are still strong in Serbia.
"We all have to be disgustingly ugly; otherwise, we are merely the mistresses of respectable men.
There is still the stereotype that women achieve success through shortcuts, rather than on their own merit," says Trivian. "The assumption is that a woman is not able to hold any serious post or do any serious work, and if she manages to do so, she argued her way up in a not so professional manner."
According to Trivan, there is still a lack of women in decision-making positions.
"Women are rarely in the highest posts of party hierarchy and local political authorities.
Serbia has some 150 municipalities and just three female mayors.
Women seldom head party committees and essentially wield very little influence," Trivan says.
Despite Serbia's gender equality regulations, Trivian says the country has a long way to go in fighting prejudice.

Bravo, Serbia!
On Thursday, Serbia finally received the status of a candidate for membership in the EU.
By Bojana Milovanovic and Paul Ciocoiu for Southeast European times in Belgrade and Bucharest -- 03/03/12

After four years of waiting, Serbia's EU candidacy was approved this week.
State officials, headed by President Boris Tadic, are unanimous in the assessment that the candidate status is a chance for a better life of Serbian citizens, bigger investments, the creation of new jobs and a better standard of living.
But economic analyst Miroslav Zdravkovic thinks such expectations are unrealistic, given that all of Europe is struggling with economic problems.
"EU countries are seeing a decline in industrial production -- the situation is again approaching those disastrous indicators from the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009.
That is why it is unrealistic to expect investments and new jobs in Serbia,"Zdravkovic, one of the analysts of the web portal Makroekonomija, told SETimes. "I haven't noticed that the citizens see any particular gain, I haven't noticed any joy or smiling faces since Serbia's becoming a candidate."
Many bloggers believe the candidacy is positive.
"With this kind of success, I do not fear the future of my Serbia," says user spagettini on the B92 website.
Vrki thinks Serbia has finally been given something it earned a long time ago.
"Bravo.
Now, Serbia, be smart and look to the future.
The next step is a date for the beginning of talks, and until then and for that many more issues have to be resolved.
The judiciary, corruption, unemployment… Let's start with the elections, to see who and how, and then take it from there."
Denis, however, notes how long the process from candidacy to full membership is, and said that other countries in the region have gone further in European integration than Serbia.
"Yes, let's celebrate the candidacy as a great success, given that Croatia became a member before we were even granted candidate status, that Montenegro has a date for the start of negotiations, not to mention Romania, Bulgaria."
Despite the positive outcome, the approval process was not smooth for the country.
In December 2011, Germany blocked Serbia's candidacy due to reservations it had over the country's relations with Kosovo.
And early last week, the bid was nearly derailed by Romania's complaint about the treatment of a group of ethnic Romanians.
The move came as a shock.
Romania did not raise the Vlach issue in previous discussions of EU's candidacy.
After quick negotiations, Serbian and Romanian officials reached an agreement concerning the minority, which was sufficient for Bucharest to withdraw its conditions for Belgrade.
Romanian bloggers look behind the whole dispute and try to give some answers.
"Are the minorities' right an internal problem of Romania or is a European problem?" Laura Cernahoschi asks.
"Until now, and especially until joining EU, we have been told it is a European problem and Romania has gone further than any other country in the region in observing the minorities' rights," she added.
"I am sure Romania's initial refusal is strictly related to Schengen and the problem is just a pretext even if Serbs are not so mad about observing minorities' rights," Lazy said.
Momo disagrees with the country's surprise move.
"From the Westerners' perspective, the Romanian diplomacy has mocked their enormous efforts to stabilise a region facing a real civil war danger for the sake of some frivolities like Latin/Cyrillic writing for a minority that is not that thrilled to be called Romanian, but rather Vlachs.
Romania could have found time for the Romanian/Vlachs minorities after Serbia joins the EU," he wrote.

Security Experiment Gives Responsibility to Aracinovo Residents
The town of Aracinovo is synonymous with violence and crime, but a new approach by the police force there may change that.
By Slobodanka Jovanovska for Southeast European Times in Skopje - 15/09/03
Twenty members of the most influential families in Aracinovo will soon wear police uniforms and assist the Macedonian police in providing peace and security.
According to the interior ministry, the task of the new reservists will be to help resolve existing tensions in a village seen as a hotspot for violence, crime and extremism.
The OSCE mission in Macedonia will train and prepare this new security team in Aracinovo.
Composed in accordance with the multiethnic structure of the village, the team will consist of 20 ethnic Albanians and two Macedonians.
They will be trained under the same programme the OSCE used to create a multiethnic police force in Macedonia, a result of the Ohrid Agreement.
Interior Ministry spokeswoman Mirjana Kontevska said the decision to provide additional police in Aracinovo was made after consultating with local authorities and residents.
She described the project as a top priority of her ministry, but stopped short of saying whether it could be used as a model for addressing ethnic tensions, crime and extremist threats in other parts of western Macedonia, especially the areas around Tetovo, Gostivar and Kumanovo.
Reaction to the plan has been mixed, with some arguing that the weapons and uniforms could end up in the wrong hands and become used for purposes other than building peace and security.
Critics say it would be better to boost the number of regular police in Aracinovo, and to train police to act more quickly and efficiently.
Aracinovo was an important crisis point during the conflict in Macedonia, mainly because of its close proximity to the capital.
Many see it as one of the last remaining havens for extremists opposed to the Ohrid Agreement.
After an attack on the Aracinovo police station in July, many officers -- including some of ethnic Albanian origin -- refused to go back and work there.
That, analysts say, may have been a factor in the ministry's decision to look beyond the usual options and give responsibility to local residents.
Kosovo leaders proclaim independent state based on Ahtisaari plan
Sunday's decision triggered mass festivities across Kosovo, but optimism is tempered with realism, as most sense the challenges that lie ahead.

Kosovo was a scene of mass celebrations Sunday (February 17th) as lawmakers endorsed a unilateral declaration of independence from Serbia.
The move followed an almost two-year process of internationally-sponsored negotiations, which failed to yield an agreement, and came amid a continuing deadlock in the UN Security Council.
Thousands of people took to the streets, waving Albanian flags as well as those of Western nations perceived as supporting the bid for independence.
Albanians flew in from countries all over the world to participate in the festivities, which culminated at 11pm on Sunday with an official fireworks display.
More than 1,000 foreign journalists were there for the event, with top world broadcasters covering it live.
With the proclamation, Kosovo's leaders hope to close the last major chapter stemming from the breakup of Yugoslavia.
For decades, the province's ethnic Albanian majority has aspired to independence.
Those aspirations were dealt with ruthlessly by former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, with ethnic conflict and eventual NATO intervention as a result.
The document approved on Sunday is based on a plan put forward by former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, whom the UN appointed to oversee the process of negotiating a settlement to the Kosovo issue.
The Ahtisaari plan provides for a multiethnic Kosovo with six constitutive communities -- Albanians, Serbs, Roma, Turks, Bosnian and Egyptians.
The MP's also approved a national flag that features the blue of the EU as well as a map of Kosovo with six stars representing the communities that make up the state.
"We declare Kosovo to be a democratic, secular and multiethnic republic, guided by the principles of non-discrimination and equal protection under the law.
We shall protect and promote the rights of all communities in Kosovo and create the conditions necessary for their effective participation in political and decision-making processes," the declaration reads.
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said hopes have never been higher in Kosovo.
"We pledge that the implementation of the Ahtisaari proposal will be our national priority," he told parliament.
President Fatmir Sejdiu said independence marked the end of the former Yugoslavia's disintegration, a process that sparked protracted conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, as well as in Kosovo.
"It's now time to work for an environment of reconciliation and forgiveness," he said.
"For the first time in our history, we have a framework that allows as to build freely and with no fear of brutal force by our neighbour [Serbia]," said well-known Kosovar journalist Veton Surroi.
The optimism, however, is tempered with realism as most Kosovars realise big challenges lie ahead.
The economy is in disarray and the fledgling state does not enjoy the legitimacy that an agreement in the UN Security Council would have provided.
Russia has already condemned the move by Pristina, and even the EU is split, with several members indicating they will either delay recognition or refuse it altogether.
Former US envoy for the Balkans Richard Holbrooke said leaders must work to prevent the situation from becoming a stalemate.
"It's up to the Serbs to accept the reality of the new state.
But Albanians and the government in Pristina have to guarantee that the Serbs are not abused, that their historical and religious monuments are protected and that they live in peace with their Albanian neighbours," he said.
The EU on Saturday approved sending a 1,800-strong mission to Kosovo to help the judicial system and the police.
It will also staff a political office tasked with monitoring implementation of the Ahtisaari plan.
According to political analyst Arben Xhaferi Europe can help turn Kosovo into a modern state.
"If we understand that and work with them skillfully, Kosovo could be a model of success in the future," he said.

The runoff on February 24th will pit conservative Ioannis Kassoulides against communist leader Demetris Christofias.
Both have voiced support for the revival of talks to end the island's 34-year-old division.
More than half a million voters, including about 400 Turkish Cypriots, chose among the nine presidential candidates participating in the election in Cyprus's Greek-run south, where voting is mandatory.
Announcing the official results, Chief Returning Officer Lazaros Savvides said the turnout was 89.62%, about 1% lower than that in the 2003 presidential vote.
While polls suggested Papadopoulos led the pack, he ended up in third place Sunday with 31.8% of the vote.
Kassoulides was first with 33.5%, followed by Christofias with 33.3%.
Each of the other six candidates won less than 1%.
Many hold Papadopoulos, 74, responsible for the collapse of the latest UN-led effort to reunify the island in 2004.
He publicly campaigned against the proposed settlement, which Greek Cypriots then rejected.
Although the majority of Turkish Cypriots approved the reunification plan, only the internationally-recognised Greek Cypriot part of the island joined the EU on May 1st, 2004, representing the whole country.
Conceding defeat Sunday, Papadopoulos insisted that his "no" vote had "saved the Republic of Cyprus in April 2004".
Kassoulides, 59, a former foreign minister, is a leading member of the right-wing DISY party, but is running as an independent.
After emerging as the front-runner Sunday, he urged voters to support him in the runoff, promising them a better future.
"All those who believe that Cyprus should become a modern European state, now is the time to join together," said Kassoulides, who supported the 2004 UN-sponsored peace plan. "Now is the time to overcome all that has divided the people on the Cyprus problem these past years."
Christofias, 61, pledged on Sunday to work with the Turkish Cypriots towards a mutually acceptable solution.
"Next Sunday, we leave everything that divides us, we leave behind stalemate, we leave behind talk of the past and we forge a peaceful, happy future for all Cypriots without exception," said Christofias. "We will never accept a solution that will not meet the fundamental principles we have shaped all these years."
Both Kassoulides and Christofias are now hoping to get the backing of DIKO, the socialist party EDEK and the Greens.
To win the runoff, a candidate must receive at least 50% plus one vote.
The outcome of Sunday's poll showed that "65% of Greek Cypriots voted for clear pro-solution candidates," said political analyst Hubert Faustmann, an associate professor at the University of Nicosia.
"The Greek Cypriots are back at the negotiation table."
Serbia calls on UN to annul Kosovo proclamation
Serbia will never recognise a new state on its territory, leaders vowed on Sunday as riots broke out in Belgrade and other towns.

Serbian officials dismissed Kosovo's independence declaration on Sunday (February 17th), saying Belgrade will never recognise a new state on its territory.
Three top officials -- President Boris Tadic, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and Serbian Radical Party member Tomislav Nikolic -- met and agreed to call an urgent parliamentary session to reject the move by lawmakers in Kosovo.
They also agreed to stage an official protest in Belgrade on Thursday.
It will be organised by the government and parliamentary parties.
Tadic called on UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to annul the independence proclamation and disband Kosovo's parliament.
"We insist that the UN Security Council fully protect Serbia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as foreseen by the UN Charter," he said in a letter to Ban. "We expect the Security Council to take urgent and efficient action, to ensure that all provisions of Resolution 1244 are being implemented."
On Monday, the Serbian president is expected to attend a Security Council session called by Russia over the issue.
In a televised address to the nation, meanwhile, Kostunica said his government would make every effort to counter Pristina's decision.
He urged the international missions in Kosovo to protect local Serbs.
He also accused the United States and certain EU-member countries of encouraging the Kosovo Albanians to secede from Serbia and tearing the country apart.
Many Serbian ministers were in the Serb enclaves in Kosovo during the declaration, showing support for the 120,000 Serbs still living in the province.
Minister for Kosovo and Metohija Slobodan Samardzic visited the northern part of the divided town of Mitrovica.
He called on the Serbs to stay in their homes, and promised them that the Serbian government would "strengthen its presence" in Kosovo over the next few days.
Although the president, prime minister and all cabinet members urged Serbian citizens to remain calm, violent protests broke out in Belgrade and several Serbian towns.
The most dramatic situation was in Belgrade, where rioters attacked the US, Slovenian and Albanian embassies. New demonstrations in the capital are scheduled for Monday.
Over the next few days, Belgrade is expected to take action against countries that recognise Kosovo's independence.
The planned response remains a state secret, but media reports have suggested Serbia could withdraw ambassadors and even cut diplomatic ties altogether with some countries, while orchestrating an economic blockade of Kosovo.
Speaking Sunday evening, Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said he had told diplomats that countries that recognise Kosovo's independence cannot count on having unchanged relations with Serbia in the future.
Albania, Macedonia pledge support for Kosovo's independence
Albanian Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha and Macedonia Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski both visited Kosovo last week for talks with officials on the province's future status.

Albania's Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha called for peace, stability and restraint in Kosovo, as he wrapped up a two-day visit to Pristina on Friday (May 18th).
Basha, who met with the Kosovo Parliament Speaker Kolj Berisha on the second day of his trip, stressed the importance of maintaining calm at this decisive moment in the status settlement process.
Basha also reiterated his country's full support for former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari's plan for supervised independence of Kosovo and said Tirana is ready to co-operate with the United States and the EU in the efforts to preserve stability in the region.
"Tirana supports the independence of Kosovo, and we [urge] the United States and the EU to adopt the resolution as soon as possible," Basha said after meeting with UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker.
Meanwhile, Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, visiting Pristina for the first time Thursday, said that demarcation of the border between Kosovo and Macedonia will be sorted after the status issue is resolved.
"We have confirmed our support of Ahtisaari's plan, and we believe that immediately after the status resolution of Kosovo, it will begin the implantation of demarcation in the border.
We believe that co-operation between two countries will be improved further in the future." Ruecker said that Gruevski and his government are very constructive regarding the issues of Kosovo.
Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu told Gruevski that Kosovo's final status will be resolved soon, which would create conditions that ease relations in the region.
Responding to a question on whether Macedonia, which has good relations with Serbia, can influence Serbian authorities to accept Ahtisaari's plan, Gruevski said he hopes that the new Serbian government will find a way to support a solution to this issue, without causing any turbulence in the region.
"The support of Macedonia for Ahtisaari's plan will help Kosovo [on a path towards] integration in EU and NATO, in order for the entire region to be ready for Europe," Kosovo's Prime Minister Agim Ceku said.
Basescu wins referendum on impeachment, promises to reform the political class
President Traian Basescu won a landslide victory in the referendum on his impeachment Saturday, a first in Romanian history.
The result could be the starting point of long-awaited reform of the political class.

Romanian President Traian Basescu won a referendum on his impeachment Saturday (May 19th), with 74.3% voting in favor of his return to office, according to a count of 99% of votes. About 25% voted for Basescu to be removed from office.
However, turnout was low, with only 44% of registered voters taking part, according to the Central Electoral Bureau.
"We are in front of a reality that cannot be analysed by the politicians on TV anymore.
We are, this time, in front of a reality imposed by the vote of the Romanian people," Basescu said after the exit-polls confirmed his victory by a wide margin.
"I'm calling on the Romanian Parliament to co-operate according to today's vote of the Romanians," he said.
Basescu joined hundreds of supporters Saturday night in Bucharest's main square after the referendum, to call for the resignation of Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu.
The referendum was a result of last month's alliance by five political parties that accuse Basescu of violating the constitution by usurping the role of the prime minister and criticising the courts.
Basescu has said the main reason for his clash with Parliament was his intention to protect the judiciary from political meddling.
The president said he will propose that the constitution is amended to create the framework for a unicameral legislature, or at least reduce the number of MPs by 35% to 40%.
"Romanians obviously want political class modernisation, the open-party ballots, and the revision of the country's constitution," he said Saturday night.
The priority, he maintains, is the uninominal vote.
"If by the end of July the political parties don't change the law so that the uninominal vote could be applied as of 2008, when the new parliamentary elections take place, then we will meet at another referendum in autumn, at the president's request, for the people to force the Parliament to chose the uninominal vote," he had.
Basescu has presented a 12 part plan for a "truly European Romania" which includes a coherent political majority, an independent judicial system, dismantling of the oligarchs, extension of the educational system reforms and observing international engagements.
His resounding victory led to problems within the parties that initiated the impeachment procedures.
The Bucharest branch of the National Liberal Party is considering withdrawing from the government and joining the opposition.
The Social Democratic Party is calling on its leaders to assume responsibilty for the failure of the referendum.
Tariceanu played down the importance of the outcome, saying "the Romanians gave Basescu a second chance".
Social Democratic Party leader Mircea Geoana said Basescu had "won a victory without glory", since less than 50% of voters participated in the referendum.
Montenegro celebrates first anniversary of independence
In the first 12 months of independence, Montenegro joined the UN and other key international organisations, and took the first steps towards building closer ties with the EU and NATO.

Celebrating the first anniversary of their country's independence, Montenegrin leaders pledged on Sunday (May 20th) to take the Adriatic republic into the EU and NATO.
Montenegro held an independence referendum on May 21st, 2006, when the majority of eligible voters supported secession from the loose union with Serbia, which was established in 2003.
The country -- which has an estimated population of 685,000 people -- became the last of the former Yugoslav republics to end its close alliance with Serbia.
"We are proud to have realised the dream of our forefathers," the AP quoted Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic as saying Sunday, as he addressed government officials and diplomats gathered for a ceremony in Podgorica. "We remain committed to the rule of law, liberal economy ... and maintain good co-operation with our neighbours", as well as with world powers, Vujanovic said.
Iceland and Switzerland were the first nations to recognise Montenegro, shortly after it officially declared its independence on June 3rd, 2006.
Recognition by the other former Yugoslav republics, other countries in the region and the world soon followed.
By the end of June, Montenegro was recognised as an independent state by the EU and the OSCE and became the UN's 192nd member.
The country also participates, or is a full member of at least two dozen other international organisations, including the IMF, the World Bank Group and the Council of Europe.
Euro-Atlantic integration is a top priority as well.
Along with Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, Montenegro joined NATO's Partnership for Peace programme in December, taking a first major step towards eventual membership of the 26-nation pact.
On March 15th, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn and Montenegrin Prime Minister Zeljko Sturanovic initialled a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), the first key step on the accession path.
Signing is expected this autumn.
"Our determination is clear: full membership in NATO ... in the EU," Vujanovic said.
Despite the headway made in terms of Euro-Atlantic integration, opposition leaders have criticised authorities for failing to deliver on their promises.
"Time has shown that the citizens have not gained what was promised -- an improvement in their poor economic and social standards," the AFP quoted Predrag Bulatovic, of the pro-Serbian Socialist People's Party, as saying.
Milo Djukanovic, who led his country to independence and stepped down as prime minister in November, said securing Montenegro's economic growth and strengthening state institutions are the main tasks for his party and the coalition government it leads.
Montenegro is expected to get its first constitution as an independent state later this year.
After months of discussion in Parliament, the constitutional draft is now subject to public debate, which is scheduled to close on May 28th.
The document will then be put to a vote in the 81-seat legislature.
It requires a two-thirds majority for adoption.

Drug use in Romania poses new challenges
Ten years ago in Romania, drugs were something people knew about from movies or the media.
Nowadays, 1 out of 80 people in Bucharest have used heroin, while 1 in 60 Romanians aged between 15 and 64 have tried cannabis.
The figures are still low compared with those in Western Europe, but they are growing.
By Razvan Amariei for Southeast European Times in Bucharest – 24/04/06
According to studies, there are about 25,000 heroin consumers in Bucharest -- a city with a population of 2 million -- and at least a similar number in the rest of the country. [File]
Every morning, Elena Vanea, the janitor of a blockhouse from the Pantelimon neighbourhood of Bucharest, finds dozens of syringes in the downstairs hall.
"There are some traffickers here in the area and their clients don't wait to reach home, but inject the drug right here, in our building," she says.
"At the beginning I was terrified, then I thought someone, maybe myself, could get hurt with one of the needles and get God knows what disease, but now I'm getting used to them and I treat them like any other garbage I find," she says.
According to studies, there are about 25,000 heroin users in Bucharest -- a city with a population of 2 million -- and at least a similar number in the rest of the country.
"This will have dramatic long term consequences on the national health -- by the increment in number for the HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis A, B, and C and tuberculosis cases -- and on the crime rate," the Romanian Anti-Drug Agency's (ANA) experts say.
Cannabis is more widely used than heroin.
According to ANA statistics, about 1 in 60 Romanian adults and teenagers have used this drug at least once, the prevalence in the ages 15 to 24 being 1 in 37.
Taking into account that in rural areas and small towns finding drugs is very difficult, and that not everyone questioned would admit to drug use, it seems very likely that 10 per cent to 20 per cent of high-school and college students in the cities are occasional or frequent drug users.
However, the real threat seems to come from amphetamine and ecstasy consumption, which has grown tenfold since 2000, official statistics show.
This new preference was quickly noticed by the traffickers.
"In the first nine months of 2005, the number of drug confiscations increased seven times compared to the same period of 2004.
Meanwhile, we've noticed a growth in the ecstasy and heroine trafficking," says Romanian Police Deputy Commander Eugen Corciu.
"These are new and trendy drugs, much easier to use than heroin or cannabis, and more affordable than cocaine. They, in many cases, are easier to find, too.
I guess we should expect the growth to go on steadily for the next years," said Aurora Tancu, a psychologist in Bucharest specialising in drug addiction.
According to the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Drugs, Romanian youths have one of the lowest drug prevalence rates on the continent, along with Greece and northern European countries.At the opposite end of the spectrum are the Czech Republic, France, Ireland and the United Kingdom, where drug use is prevalent.
Experts say that EU accession, and the expected rise in Romanians' living standards, could lead to increased recreational drug use in the country.
Turks mull Iran election crisis
Amid protests in Tehran and charges of election rigging, Ankara pursues a cautious policy with its neighbour.

Turkey is watching developments in neighbouring Iran with growing concern.
While media reports have highlighted the unrest and allegations of election fraud, the government is sticking to a finely tuned policy aimed at maintaining sensitive ties.
Speaking on Monday (June 15th), Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu left no doubt as to how the government sees the stakes.
"Iran is a neighbouring country whose political stability is extremely important for us," he said.
"Controversy over the election results is Iran's domestic matter.
We hope that this debate will end as soon as possible and deep-rooted relations with Turkey and Iran will continue as they have been," the minister added.
He refrained from criticising either the use of force by Iranian security forces or the allegations of ballot fraud, instead praising the "dynamic climate" and high turnout during the poll.
Iran and Turkey had difficult relations in the 1980s and 1990s.
Turks suspected the neighbouring country of trying to undermine its secular society, while Tehran accused Ankara of stirring up opposition to the Iranian regime, including among ethnic Azeris.
Since 2000, however, ties have been on the mend, with trade volume between the two countries surpassing a record $11 billion last year.
Person-to-person relations between Turkey and Iran are significant -- around one million Iranians visit Turkey annually.
Turkish private TV channels are highly popular in Iran, and students there often choose Turkey for their education.
At the same time, thousands of regime opponents are thought to reside in Turkey; UNHCR statistics show that around 30,000 Iranians fled to Turkey between 1994 and 2005.
The rise of political Islam in Turkey is also a factor.
Although Turkish Muslims are mostly Sunni, there is wide interest in the Shiite model of an Islamic state, and almost all the leading Islamist political figures have nurtured warm ties with Tehran.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and President Abdullah Gul phoned Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to congratulate him on the election outcome, with Turkey becoming one of the first countries in the world to do so.
Meanwhile, Turkish media have been more inclined to support the Iranian protestors and their demands for real democracy in Iran.
"Reformers don't give up, despite blood on the streets," the liberal daily Radikal urged in its headline.
Reporting from Tehran, Ceyda Karan said Iran was facing its biggest public protest since the 1979 revolution.
Around 170 reformist leaders were under arrest and many foreign journalists were facing restrictions and bans, she wrote.
The conservative paper Bugün, meanwhile, carried reformist candidate Mir Hosein Mousavi's call for his supporters to rally against "lies and dictatorship".
Hürriyet columnist Cüneyt Ülsever, however, argues that election fraud is not sufficient to explain the outcome in Iran.
Whatever role the authorities had in skewing the vote, he writes, Ahmadinejad likely has a solid base of support.
"Many observers from outside world predicted that the Iranian people were unhappy with the economic situation, and that they supported reforms and integration into the Western world," he wrote in his column on Monday.
"These observers cannot understand the importance of ideology, in particular the Islamist political ideology."
"From now on, nobody can change Ahmadinejad's mind that he has to build a nuclear bomb in order to stand against the United States, Israel and even the EU.
He is ready to play a chess game with the West in order to gain more time," the columnist wrote, adding that "very difficult days are ahead for the Middle East".
EU wants Croatia-Slovenia border dispute settled this week
Croatia and Slovenia must reach a solution to their border dispute this week, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said.
Another meeting is expected to take place Wednesday.
(AFP, DPA, Bloomberg, Euronews, Javno, B92, MINA - 15/06/09)
"I honestly hope we will soon end this process.
The moment of truth is at hand," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said before the meeting. [Getty Images]
Croatian and Slovenian foreign ministers failed to reach a deal on the lingering border dispute between their countries during talks with EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn in Luxembourg on Monday (June 15th).
"Today, we didn't find a solution, and we agreed to continue with our discussions," Croatian Foreign Minister Gordan Jandrokovic said after the meeting.
The talks focused on Rehn's latest proposal for a settlement to the dispute, dating back to 1991, when both nations proclaimed independence from the former Yugoslavia.
The row over several small villages and the line of the maritime border between the two Adriatic states has become a major stumbling block for Croatia's EU accession progress.
Slovenia, which joined the Union in 2004, has been vetoing the opening of new negotiation chapters in Croatia's membership talks with Brussels since December 2008.
It threatened to keep blocking the process until the border dispute is resolved.
The stalemate could jeopardise Croatia's chances of wrapping up its entry talks by the end of this year, as planned, analysts warned. The Balkan nation, which hopes to join the Union as its 28th member by 2011, has closed only seven of the 33 negotiation chapters to date.
In a bid to break the deadlock, Rehn proposed a plan for a settlement in April, under which an ad hoc international arbitration tribunal would be set up to solve disputes.
Describing it as a "take it or leave it" offer, Croatia accepted the proposal.
But politicians in Slovenia were unhappy with the plan, saying that their country was not explicitly recognised as a maritime nation, which could prevent it from securing direct access to international shipping waters in the northern Adriatic.
In May, Slovenia submitted amendments to Rehn's proposal.
Describing the demanded changes as "crucial" for his country's interests, Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor warned that Ljubljana would reject the plan altogether if they are not incorporated.
On Monday, Slovenian Foreign Minister Samuel Zbogar said Rehn's new proposal included some of the suggestions sent to Brussels last month.
"Now we need to study the proposal and discuss it in government and parliament," he told reporters after the talks in Luxembourg.
Rehn said a solution must be reached before the two-day EU summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday.
He indicated later that a new meeting would likely take place on Wednesday after the two ministers hold the necessary consultations back home.
"Our productivity could be higher, but at least we are doing very thorough work," the DPA quoted Rehn as saying.
Pahor said he was "satisfied in principle" with the new version of the plan, telling reporters in Ljubljana that it came closer to reflecting the national interests of both countries.
"This could represent the basis for a definitive solution that would justly set the common border," AFP quoted the Slovenian prime minister as saying.
Serbia hopes to be visa-free
Visa liberalisation could become a reality for Serbia before the end of this year, but some hurdles remain to be crossed.

Serbian hopes of being placed on the EU's "White Schengen" list received a boost as EU foreign ministers met in Luxembourg Monday (June 15th).
They gave the thumbs-up to European Commission (EC) plans to lift visa requirements this year for countries which have fulfilled the conditions.
Earlier this month, European Justice Commissioner Jacques Barrot said Serbia and two other Western Balkan countries are in the running.
While Serbia and neighbouring Montenegro have met most of the benchmarks, Barrot said, Macedonia has completed them all.
Serbia will work to "implement all technical and other conditions" so the visa regime can be dropped in the fall, Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Delic told reporters.
"We had a very important and successful day in our European integration," the daily Blic quoted him as saying. "We can say for the first time that between us and White Schengen there is nothing else but a serious technical work.
There is no other political condition or decision."
The government has staked much on the process.
Last year, Djelic came under fire for his campaign promise that the visa regime would be lifted quickly if the Democratic Party (DP) were re-elected.
Voters gave the DP a renewed mandate, and are now waiting to see if it will make good on that pledge.
Interior Minister Ivica Dacic, whose Socialist Party is a junior member of the ruling coalition, has taken a more cautious line.
He says he expects the visas to be removed sometime next year and has warned against rushing the process.
"I consider the dilemmas about the exact date of being placed on the White Schengen List less important than the progress made in that process," Dacic said. Discussing the visa issue on June 4th, Barrot indicated that Serbia would have to work hard to have the restrictions lifted.
He also stressed that all EU member states must consent to the EC's proposal.
The EC has assessed the readiness of all three countries to have their visas annulled, assigning each a number from 1 to 3.
Macedonia received the top mark, 1, while Serbia and Montenegro each scored 1.7.
Serbia's low score is reportedly due to the way it is handling passports for Albanians in Kosovo and Serbs from Republika Srpska.
Along with easing the visa rules, Serbia is pushing to have its Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU -- and an associated trade agreement -- unblocked.
Both are on ice because of Belgrade's failure to extradite wanted war crimes indictees Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic.
UN chief war crimes prosecutor Serge Brammertz briefed EU foreign ministers at Monday's meeting in Luxembourg.
He reportedly praised Serbia's co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia but said more remained to be done.
The Netherlands, joined by Belgium, has staunchly opposed moving ahead with the SAA until all conditions are met.
Dutch Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen has been downplaying rumours that his country is ready to budge on the trade deal.
According to the minister, the Netherlands will accept lifting visa restrictions but will not bow to pressure over the trade pact or SAA.
The European Council will take up the matter during its summit on Thursday and Friday.
Romanian government, weathermen wrangle over floods
Amid terrible floods in northeast Romania, the government blames the weather authority for issuing the wrong alerts.

More than 20 counties in Romania have been affected by heavy rains and deadly floods over the last week.
At least 22 people are dead after swollen rivers overflowed and swept away villages.
Suceava, Botosani and Neamt in northeast Romania have taken the hardest hit.
Authorities were generally quick to intervene -- 13,000 people were evacuated after several dams burst on the Siret and Prut rivers that cross the eastern historical region of Moldova from north to south.
Despite the concerted intervention by 3,000 personnel of state agencies --emergency situation units, gendarmes, police officers, supported by military troops -- the government blamed the national weather authority for issuing the wrong alert codes in accordance with rainfall levels.
"The local authorities have to be on the lookout because, even if there was a yellow code alert, in reality there should have been a red code alert.
For instance, for the town of Dorohoi, yellow code alert means 20-40 liters of rain per square meter when in fact it was 163 liters per square meter," Interior Minister Vasile Blaga told the county prefects during a video-conference.
National Weather Authority Director Ion Sandu defended the forecasts his agency issued over the last weeks.
"When a yellow code is issued, nobody can tell whether it will rain 100 liters per square meter.
Let's make one thing clear: we could have issued even a black code alert; people cannot be saved under these circumstances," he added, referring to the storms that battered the Moldovan town of Dorohoi, near the Ukrainian border.
The weather agency issues three types of alerts -- yellow, orange and red -- depending on the intensity of the phenomenon, whether it is rain, snow or storms.
Environmental Minister Laszlo Borbely conceded defeat at the hands of nature.
"Despite the authorities' intervention, unfortunately we couldn't avoid the disaster caused by the flooding -- too much water fell in a too short a time," he said.
The government assesses the damage at around 0.6% of the GDP. If it climbs above the 1% threshold, Romania will seek emergency assistance from the EU.
The latest provisional review of the flood damage shows 160 localities have been affected in 22 counties -- 72 in Suceava County alone. More than 3,200 homes have been inundated -- almost 300 of them completely destroyed, while 15,000 hectares of arable land are underwater.
"It rained heavily all day long last Monday.
In the evening, I was watching the World Cup football game when I heard my neighbours screaming in the street 'the waters are coming'," Alexandru Suharoschi, a pensioner living in a district of Dorohoi, told SETimes.
"It all happened so quickly.
We all perched on a hill nearby just to see the torrents rushing beneath our feet. A neighbour of mine, a 16-year-old boy, rushed to the fields to release his family's horses. He never returned.
He was found dead the next day, a few kilometers away.
Two old ladies were also swept away," he says.
He is disappointed with how the authorities managed the situation.
"First, no one warned us about the flooding.
Secondly, had an evacuation operation been thoroughly organised by the town hall in time, maybe all the people could have escaped the torrents.
But we were left to simply walk away from the disaster ourselves," Suharoschi said.
His house is full of mud now and, despite the town hall inspectors having visited him, he doubts he will receive funds for repairs.
The government will send emergency humanitarian aid worth 175,000 euros to the affected areas.
Families who lost a member in the floods will get 1,200 euros per victim.
Kosovo's agreement with IMF at risk
PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Kosovo is at risk of breaking its agreement with the IMF less than two years after gaining membership.
The deterioration in relations stems from the government ignoring IMF recommendations to lead development policies that would spur economic growth. On Tuesday (May 31st), media quoted a blog by the former head of the economic unit at the International Civilian Office (ICO), Andrea Capusella, where he said that Kosovo's programme with the IMF is off track, describing it as a failure for the country.
According to Capusella, it is rare that governments breach their commitments to the IMF.
He also said the IMF is expected to officially announce the break of the agreement with Kosovo.
Salaries of most public sector employees have risen since January, as promised by the ruling Democratic Party during the December elections campaign. (Express, Zeri, Koha Ditore - 31/05/11)

Albania ranks second in Europe for smoking rate
TIRANA, Albania -- Albania is home to the second largest number of smokers in Europe after Turkey, according to figures published by the Public Health Institute in Tirana to mark Tuesday's (May 31st) World No Tobacco Day.
The data suggests about 40% of Albanian citizens smoke regularly.
Specialist Roland Shuperka says one of the most concerning trends is the increasing number of young, female consumers.
According to him, urban women smoke about 2.5 times more than those in rural areas. (Telegrafi, Ora News, ABC News - 30/05/11)
Shareholders happy as Barr takes over Pliva
Facing international market pressures, Pliva opted to become part of a bigger and stronger company.

After six months of negotiations, New Jersey-based Barr Pharmaceuticals Inc. has acquired over 70% of Pliva Pharmaceuticals, Croatia's largest drug company.
The deal was finally closed earlier in October.
Pliva, s regional leader in the industry, has more than 80 years of tradition behind it.
Once the deal is officially closed, Barr will become the third largest producer of generic drugs in the world.
Barr had to pay $2.6 billion to take over the Croatian company.
Its offer was challenged by another competitor -- Iceland's Actavis.
Following a bidding war that increased the value of Pliva shares, Barr managed to finally deposit 13.5 million shares, or 72.6% of the company.
Shareholders were able to sell their shares for $140 each.
By contrast, prior to the acquisition, the price of Pliva shares on the Zagreb Stock Exchange was $90.
Pliva will still carry its name and brand.
The company in Zagreb will do business with European partners and will sell its product mainly on the European markets.
Both Pliva and Barr stand to profit from the acquisition, say financial experts.
However, some within Croatia have criticised the sale, including former Economy Minister Ljubo Jurcic.
He says Pliva should remain a national asset that would continue its research work and maintain its international reputation.
However, the firm has been unable to withstand market pressures in recent years. In the middle of the 1980s, Pliva was in its golden period -- producing drugs, researching new ones and buying other pharmaceutical companies in the former Eastern bloc.
It had laboratories and research facilities in the former Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary.
During the 1990s it maintained a stable level of production, but did not introduce new products to keep up with international competitors.
Pliva's most famous drug remains the antibiotic Sumamed, widely known among European physicians and consumers.
When the company announced it would sell its research centre, it was clear that Pliva no longer planned to introduce new drugs, but would simply continue with its existing product line.
It soon became apparent that Pliva would do better under the auspices of a larger and stronger company.
Pliva operates in over 30 countries worldwide and is the leading pharmaceutical company based in Central and Eastern Europe.
It specialises in the development, production and distribution of generic pharmaceutical products, including biologicals, cytostatics, and other generics.
Turkey Revives Plans for Nuclear Power Plant
Turkey's previous government attempted to build a nuclear power plant but failed.
Now Ankara is ready to try again.
By Fatih Baran for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 17/06/04

In a surprise move, Turkey's government has announced that it intends to resume plans to build a nuclear power plant, most likely in the Mediterranean coastal region.
The project had been undertaken by the previous government, but had to be scrapped just before the bidding stage following the economic crisis of early 2001.
"We will start holding talks with producer companies of these power plants in the near future," said Turkish Energy Minister Hilmi Guler.
He declined to give the date on which the tender would be held.
Responding to environmental groups, Guler insisted the new plant would be safe.
A nuclear power plant has been on the agenda of successive governments for a number of years.
But environmentalists have strongly opposed the idea, arguing that the high level of seismological activity in Turkey presents hazards.
The projected site at Akkuyu, near the city of Mersin, is only 20km away from the Ecemis fault line, which is active.
A tremor of 8.0 magnitude on the Richter scale would seriously damage any kind of nuclear reactor in the area, geological engineers caution.
According to a report from the housing and public works ministry, 96 per cent of Turkey lies within "high risk" seismological zones, and 98 per cent of the population live in areas with a strong risk of quakes.
Meanwhile, the Electricity Production Corporation (EUAS) released a statement saying that the water reserves in the country's dams are very good and that the country does not currently face an energy problem.
All hydroelectric plants are working at full capacity, and Turkey has no need to import energy this year, said EUAS General Manager Onder Piyade.

The centre's activities will focus on promoting ancient and modern Greek civilisation and co-operation between Greek and Serbian institutions in the field of culture.
The Istanbul Museum of Modern Art will host an exhibition titled "Held Together with Water" in September.
The event will bring to Turkey, for the first time, artwork from the Verbund Collection -- one of the major collections of contemporary art.
The exhibition runs from September to January 2009 and will include sculpture, photography, films and voice installations.
Top tennis players, including Gilles Simon, Wilfred Tsonga and Nicolas Almagro, will compete in this year's BCR Open in Bucharest, from September 8th to 14th.
Victor Hanescu is the only Romanian to compete in the tournament.
The total prize value is 370,000 euros. The winner will receive 59,100 euros and 175 ATP points.
Cultural tourism in Albania is on the rise this season, local media reported.
Tourists have turned their attention to the country's cultural monuments, archaeological parks, fortresses and museums.
For example, more than 30,000 visitors, the highest number ever, visited the National Museum in the first six months of 2008.
Authorities plan to introduce security guards to protect the national heritage sites.
The movie "I Have to Sleep, My Angel" by Croatian director Dejan Acimovic won a prize at the Herceg Novi Festival last week in Montenegro.
The prize is 5,000 euros.

The young and the restless in Montenegro
Even though human resources are one of Montenegro's greatest assets, the young and well-educated cannot seem to find employment easily.
Getting a job still depends largely on having the right "inside connections", more so than on skills or academic background, and many young students rack up impressive credentials only to find themselves spurned on the job market.
Some struggle for a foothold, others switch fields, hoping at least to find a position that will utilise their skills.
Those who are able to do so go abroad, fueling a "brain drain" that saps the country's economic potential.
By Antonela Arhin for Southeast European Times – 26/06/06

The idea of making connections and having somebody putting in a good word for you is certainly not a novelty anywhere in the world.
In small economies such as Montenegro's, however, the phenomenon is more evident than in larger ones.
Dragana, a recent economics major graduate from Podgorica, says she is having difficulties finding a job since she does not have friends in high places. Knowledge and expertise mean little without connections, she adds.
Similarly, law school graduate Zoran has an outstanding grade point average, has passed the bar and state exam, and completed his apprenticeship in a law firm, but remains unable to find a job in his field of expertise.
He has applied for several jobs, but keeps getting turned down.
There are many similar stories among university graduates in Montenegro.
Those who gave up on finding a perfect fit or were discouraged by unfair competition are already abroad trying their luck.
Others fall into several groups.
Some are struggling to prove themselves by working for a low wage in their field, hoping that the new political situation -- Montenegro's sovereignty -- will influence the job market.
Another group includes those who are not able to go abroad but have given up on opportunities at home, choosing instead to switch to some other profession.
The most fortunate are those who find a way to marry their expertise with the right position and salary; they are most likely working for a foreign organisation.
Others opt to prolong their studies and live on their parents' budget for as long as possible in order to avoid the situation altogether.
According to data from Montenegro's Statistical Office (MONSTAT) data, in 2004 Montenegro had 630,548 inhabitants, out of which 259,092 were active, 187,333 employed (the rate of employment being 37.4 per cent), 71,759 unemployed (a 27.7 per cent unemployment rate) and 242, 266 inactive.
The rest were under the age of 15.

Aside from the need for connections or an inside edge, a major factor contributing to the high unemployment rate is the lack of information about job opportunities.
Exacerbating it further is the inefficient functioning of human resources departments at many firms.
Recently, there have been attempts to revive the job market for the young and educated.
For example, earlier this year the economics department at the University of Podgorica -- in collaboration with the international student association AISEC and with support from the Montenegro Employment Agency -- organised the first career fair ever to be held in Montenegro.
Entitled Career Ways, it gathered 27 companies, including the Telekom Group, Opportunity Bank, Gorenje, the Customs Administration, the Central Bank of Montenegro, Hipotekarna Banka, Procter and Gamble, and Deloitte.
With the catchy slogan "Come, See, Get a Job", the fair drew many young professionals, recent graduates as well as those still engaged in their graduate or postgraduate studies.
It aimed to match them with companies seeking to fill their human resource needs, giving participating companies a chance to establish a database of potential employees.
The most visited booth was that of the Telekom Group, which says it needs people with skills in marketing, finance and sales.
Montenegro Stars Group, meanwhile, plans to employ about 700 people at the Hotel Splendid in Becici, which is to be opened on 13 July.
The personnel needed range from waiters to managers of sales and marketing; preference is being given to those who speak English and perhaps German and Russian.
Deloitte is looking for about 10 people with a high grade point average and a background in economics who are ready for extensive travel, know English and have excellent computer skills, especially in Excel.
Procter and Gamble is looking for people of all educational backgrounds with good English and computer skills.
The Employment Agency of Montenegro is also striving to contribute to the betterment of the job market.
During Career Ways, the agency presented its latest project, entitled A Chance for Youth.
It offers employment opportunities to trainees with high school diplomas and college/university degrees.
For those who have no previous experience, the Employment Agency will subsidise 80 per cent of the gross pay.
Developing human capital is one of the goals of EU assistance to Montenegro.
As part of efforts to support public administration reform, the European Agency for Reconstruction -- which manages a cumulative portfolio of some 121m euros -- assisted the Employment Agency of Montenegro in implementing legislation meant to establish a professional career system for the public service.
Events such as Career Ways have the potential to help stem the brain drain of young people from Montenegro and help decrease unemployment which is continuing to be a major constraint to economic development.
But some disillusioned job seekers remain unconvinced.
As Milica, an English major, put it, although employers at the fair held open the promise of job opportunities, in many cases the firms already have people ready to fill positions advertised as "open to the public".
All too often, having the right set of skills, a distinguished academic record and references from professors still counts for little if you are missing one other crucial element -- the inside edge.
Until that changes, young people will continue to view going abroad as the only real solution.
Milosevic Indicted for Ordering Political Murders
Slobodan Milosevic was charged Tuesday (23 September) with ordering the murder of former Serbian president Ivan Stambolic and the attempted murder of Serbian Renewal Movement leader Vuk Draskovic.
(RFE/RL, Bloomberg, Tanjug - 24/09/03; AFP, Reuters, BBC, UPI, Radio B92 - 23/09/03)
Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who is standing trial in The Hague for genocide and war crimes, now faces a local indictment over his alleged role in political violence against political opponents.
Announcing the indictment on Tuesday (23 September), Serbia's special prosecutor, Jovan Prijic, said Milosevic has been charged with ordering the murder of former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic and the attempted murder of Serbian Renewal Movement leader Vuk Draskovic.
Stambolic, Milosevic's former mentor and a friend-turned-foe, went missing during a jog in a Belgrade park in August 2000.
His remains were unearthed from a ditch in northern Serbia earlier this year, following the 12 March assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic and the authorities' subsequent crackdown on organised crime. Stambolic, who served as Serbia's president from 1986 to 1987, was expected to be Milosevic's major rival in the October 2000 presidential election.
Serbian police said earlier that five members of a now disbanded special police unit linked to Milosevic's regime had abducted and executed Stambolic.
Milosevic has denied all allegations linking him to the murder, claiming he had not considered him a threat to his political career at the time.
"Ivan Stambolic was no longer a person of interest ... He was a completely forgotten politician," the AFP quoted Milosevic as saying in a letter sent from his prison cell in The Hague last month.
Two months before Stambolic's disappearance, Draskovic survived an attempt on his life in the Montenegrin sea resort of Budva.
In an earlier incident, in October 1999, the veteran opposition leader escaped a staged car crash, in which four of his associates were killed.
Local media quoted Prijic as saying in a statement on Tuesday that Milosevic had spurred the perpetrators' decision to target Stambolic and Draskovic.
Along with Milosevic, four others are named in the indictment, including former special police commander Milorad Lukovic, also known as Legija.
He is the key suspect in the murder of Djindjic, and is still on the run.
The other three are former State Security chief Radomir Markovic and his deputy, Milorad Bracanovic, as well as former Army Chief of Staff Nebojsa Pavkovic.
Prijic said he would submit the indictment and supporting documents to the Belgrade district court on Wednesday.
The court can then open the judicial procedure.
Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic, who was earlier believed to have incited Stambolic's murder, was not mentioned among the indictees.
Several months ago police issued a warrant for her arrest in connection with the killing.
She is believed to be hiding somewhere in Russia.
The special court was set up after Djindjic's slaying to focus specifically on cases of terrorism and organised crime.
Belgrade-based Radio B92 quoted Prijic as announcing plans Wednesday to issue another three indictments linked to organised crime by mid-October.
Djukanovic steps down as Montenegro's prime minister
PODGORICA, Montenegro -- Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic announced his resignation on Tuesday (December 21st).
Speaking at a press conference, he said the decision was a personal choice and was not made under pressure from the international community, as some media reports have suggested.
Djukanovic led Montenegro for 20 years, during which he served five mandates as prime minister and one as president.
Igor Luksic, currently serving as finance minister, has been mentioned in local press reports as a likely replacement.
Earlier in the day, Deputy Prime Minister Svetozar Marovic also announced his resignation, also for personal reasons. (Mina, RTCG, Cafe del Montenegro - 21/12/10)
Balkan countries support international response to crisis in Libya
Turkey is the only Southeast European country to express open opposition to the UN sanctions.
(Various sources -- 26/01/11 - 03/03/11)
Balkan countries oppose the violence in Libya. [Reuters]
The governments of all Southeast European countries, except Turkey, have directly or indirectly expressed support for steps taken by international community in response to the indiscriminate use of force against civilian protests in Libya since February 15th.
On Tuesday (March 1st), the 192-member UN General Assembly suspended Libya from the organisation's Human Rights Council (HRC) over Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's violent repression of peaceful demonstrators who are demanding his ouster.
The decision was adopted following a recommendation to that effect by the 47-nation Geneva-based rights' body on Friday.
Speaking at the ongoing session of the HRC, Macedonian Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki commended that move, as well as the Council's decision that an independent inquiry commission be urgently sent to Libya.
He also praised the UN Security Council for its "swift and unanimous decision" Saturday to impose a series of restrictive measures against Libya.
The sanctions, including an arms embargo, a travel ban on Gaddafi and 15 others close to him, as well as an asset freeze targeting the Libyan leader and five members of his family, were supported by Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), one of the current non-permanent members of the 15-nation Council.
Speaking at Saturday's meeting, Ivan Barbalic, BiH's permanent representative at the UN, said his delegation was appalled at the "unacceptable level of violence" against civilians in Libya and called for urgent action to end the bloodshed in the country.
Addressing the HRC in Geneva on Tuesday, Albanian Deputy Foreign Minister Edith Harxhi noted that people in her country, which emerged from nearly half a century of dictatorship only 20 years ago, were fully aware of the "total denial of human rights in Libya".
"The international community should take an active role and should not allow that human rights violations become a case where humanity would regret late reactions," she stressed.
Montenegro also expressed its full support for the Security Council and the HRC decisions on Libya.
The human rights violations and the "suppression and use of force against civilians" by the Gaddafi regime require "an immediate and adequate response by the international community," Nebojsa Kaludjerovic, state secretary of the Montenegrin foreign ministry, said in Geneva on Tuesday.
On Monday, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, Romania and the other 23 EU members unanimously adopted a decision, imposing even tougher sanctions on the Gaddafi regime than those announced by the Security Council at the weekend.
Serbia said on Wednesday it has suspended all military and economic co-operation with Libya in compliance with the UN resolution.
Voicing concern about the situation, Defence Minister Dragan Sutanovac also denied allegations that members of the Serbian Army or retired military personnel were involved in the Gaddafi regime's crackdown on protestors.
"We are not participating in it in any way; there is not a single pilot or any other army member taking part in the activities in Libya, especially not in the military activities there," he stressed.
Labour Minister Rasim Ljajic told reporters that his country condemns all forms of human rights violations, adding that Serbian officials have struck the right balance on the issue.
Turkey is the only Southeast European country to have voiced opposition to the UN sanctions against Libya, with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan arguing that the restrictive measures would harm the Libyan people more than their leader.
Meanwhile, a defiant Gaddafi made clear on Wednesday he is not planning to quit.
The Libyan leader, who has been promising to fight till the last man, again blamed al-Qaida as being behind the unrest in the country, saying Osama bin Laden's militants are giving teenagers milk and coffee spiked with "hallucinogenic pills".
UN High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres warned Tuesday about the risk of "a huge humanitarian disaster" unless measures to evacuate those trying to escape the violence in Libya.
He said an estimated up to 90,000 people, mostly Egyptian and Tunisian migrant workers, had crossed into Tunisia since February 20th.
The number of Libyans who have fled their country since exceeded 3,500 people, he said.
EU report released on Croatia in the shadow of protests
As protesters call for Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor to resign, she warns that their actions might endanger EU accession.
By Natasa Radic for Southeast European Times in Kumrovec -- 03/03/11
Protests continued on Wednesday (March 2nd) in Zagreb. [Reuters]
As anti-government protests continued in Zagreb on Wednesday (March 2nd), the European Commission (EC) released its interim report on Croatia's EU accession progress.
The report recommends additional reforms in Croatia's judiciary before accession talks on the negotiation chapter can be finalised, said EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele.
The EC acknowledged that authorities in Zagreb have advanced with reforms in the judiciary but that further effort is needed to set up track-records in the fight against corruption.
The rallies, initially organised by a Facebook group, began last week to protest the country's economic situation and corruption.
The group -- which numbers between 2,000 and 5,000 according to sources -- is calling for Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor's government to step down.
On Wednesday, they marched through the centre of Zagreb, taking down and destroying flags of the two biggest Croatian political parties, the ruling HDZ and then opposition SDP.
They also gathered in front of Kosor's appartment, shouting their request for her resignation.
Smaller protests were organised in other towns, too.
"We want prospects," a protester named Marko told SETimes. "I want to have work; I want to live a decent life with the salary I will get ... I don't want to go abroad to find a future.
I want to stay home and I want the officials of this country to focus on the needs of the people," he said.
"So if these guys don't know how to make the situation better, the least they can do is to go away and find another job," said his friend Marina, a student from Zagreb.
The group carried posters with their messages: politicians are being blamed for corruption and not taking care of the people, impoverishing the country and destroying the economy.
Earlier this week, Kosor said if the protests continue, they migh endanger Croatia's EU accession.
The EC report said that in addition, the government has yet to settle fully the issue of the return of refugees and advance co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal.
Once the country fulfils all these conditions, the chapter on judiciary and fundamental rights can be closed, Fuele said.
Overall, the interim report suggests that local authorities have to intensify efforts to finalise the accession talks by the end of June.
Shock in Kosovo over Frankfurt shooting
As German prosecutors look into Islamic extremism as a possible motive, Kosovo's leaders condemned Wednesday's killing of two US servicemen.

As students in Pristina lit candles to commemorate the victims, Kosovo's leaders on Wednesday (March 2nd) condemned a shooting incident at Frankfurt Airport that left two US airmen dead and injured two others.
Arid Uka, a 21-year-old who is reported to be a Frankfurt Airport employee, allegedly opened fire on a bus carrying the airmen.
German prosecutors say they are looking into Islamic extremism as a possible motive, and media reports indicated the gunman may have shouted religious slogans before launching his attack.
Uka has family connections to Kosovo -- reports say that Uka's grandfather was from the village of Zhabar, near Mitrovica.
Kosovo President Behgjet Pacolli expressed his "deep sorrow" over the incident, and extended his condolences to the American people, army, authorities and the families of the victims.
"The people of Kosovo condemn in the harshest terms this evil, individual act … carried out against people in a military uniform who had an essential role in Kosovo’s liberation, against the army which has a key role in preserving security and stability all over the world," he said in a press release.
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci and his cabinet echoed those words.
"This macabre case is an individual act against the values of civilisation and against the tradition of the people of Kosovo, which will always and eternally be grateful to the United States of America, to the American people and the United States government for the powerful support it has given to the people of Kosovo during the process of freedom, independence and now, for the development and the integration of Kosovo," an official statement said.
Foreign Minister Enver Hoxhaj, who joined University of Pristina students as they lit candles in front of the city's National Theatre, said "the one who committed such an act is a criminal in the eyes of the Kosovo citizens and in no way represents [their] beliefs."
Koha Movement, a youth NGO based in Mitrovica, held a ceremony there and condemned the incident.
"We strongly condemn this criminal act as citizens of Kosovo and young people of Kosovo.
This is not reflective of our people," said the group's leader, Ferdi Kadriu.
Reaction among the public was one of shock.
"Crazy man … he is crazy," said Mensur, a young man in Pristina who spoke to SETimes.
"It's so bad for us, and our image," said Artana, a young mother walking with her children in the capital.
In Washington, meanwhile, President Barack Obama said he was "saddened and outraged" by the attack.
"I want everybody to understand that we will spare no effort in learning how this outrageous act took place and in working with German authorities to ensure that all of the perpetrators are brought to justice," he said.
Greece's recovery: who should carry the burden?
Strikes provide outlet for public anger, analysts say.

While the government attempts to impose austerity measures agreed on with the EU and the IMF, public anger is still erupting over perceived inequity.
Many Greeks say the cost of economic recovery continues to be unfairly distributed.
Their anger erupted on February 23rd in the largest mass strike since December 2009.
Most public services were interrupted, all flights in and out of the country came to a halt, and shops and hotels in downtown Athens shut down due to the threat of violence.
Workers at major facilities such as refineries, shipyards, harbours, steel plants and the Coca Cola factory also joined in.
"It has been proven beyond a doubt that this 'medicine' is worse than the disease," said Yiannis Panagopoulos, leader of the General Confederation of Employees of Greece. "It makes the rich richer and the poor poorer.
This situation can not continue," he told SETimes.
A Bank of Greece analyst, who wished to remain anonymous, said calls for "sacrifices" can only succeed if everyone contributes according to their ability.
"It is not the protests that threaten the country's stability but the uneven burden-sharing that triggers social unrest," he said.
"Strikes evidently reduce production and, thus, income.
Why do people go on strike and purposefully lose a day's pay?
My view is that they think that losing a day's pay can be justified if they gain a reduction of the recovery cost allotted to them, as they feel they have already contributed enough," the analyst added.
According to political observer Ioannis Michaletos, the strikes serve mainly as an outlet for discontent.
"The Greek labour unions are for decades now, being subject to party politics and mainly adhere to the tactics as laid down by the main Greek political parties," he told SETimes. "They defuse people's anger towards the current economic situation so as to pre-empt any radicalisation by fringe groups or emerging political forces."
After enduring salary and pension cuts, benefit reductions, public sector cuts and no collective bargaining, some protesters said they have nothing to lose.
"I have worked for 35 years and contributed to my sector by paying my taxes and the pension fund," said George Skylogiannis, 55, the manager of a private company.
"Now they are telling us that pension funds cannot respond to their obligations as their pockets are empty, but you know this is not my fault.
And what will be the future for the kids, not only mine but for all the kids being raised now in Greek families?
I see no future, no hope and I am not the only one feeling that way."
Powerful blast kills two in Pristina
As Kosovo police and KFOR investigate a strong explosion in the province's capital, the government denies any link to the ongoing talks on the province's status.

A powerful blast struck a busy part of Pristina early Monday (September 24th), killing two people and leaving at least another 11 injured, a Kosovo official said several hours after the incident.
"The blast occurred at about 2 am in the business area in which some coffee shops and restaurants were still working," Kosovo Police Service (KPS) spokesman Veton Elshani told reporters.
Part of a two-storey business centre on Bill Clinton Boulevard in Pristina's Dardania district collapsed in the strong explosion, which also damaged vehicles and other buildings in the vicinity.
Photos showed glass and debris scattered at the site.
The victims are believed to have been in a nearby café, according to Elshani.
One reportedly died on the spot, and the second at hospital.
Joined by KFOR troops, the KPS sealed off the area and opened an investigation, but details about the type and amount of explosives have not been made available.
According to reports, the explosion occurred near the café-bar Sekiraqa.
Its owners are believed to be members of a local gang and are suspected of involvement in the late-August murder of an elite police officer.
Condemning the incident, authorities said there was no evidence to link the attack to the ongoing internationally-sponsored negotiations on Kosovo's final status.
"There is not a single indication that the explosion has any relation with the political process that Kosovo is going through," the AFP quoted government spokesman Avni Arifi as saying on Monday. "The government is fully committed to fight against any crime and to create a peaceful environment."
The incident occurred only days before Serbian and Kosovo Albanian leaders are due to meet for direct talks, on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York on Friday.
The negotiations process has been deadlocked for months, and prospects for a compromise appear slim.
Amid growing frustration among Kosovo Albanians over the delayed settlement, the province's leadership has threatened to declare independence on December 10th.
Belgrade, meanwhile, continues to oppose independence and is suggesting broad autonomy as an alternative.
"Essential autonomy is our maximum offer," Goran Bogdanovic, a member of Belgrade's negotiating team said in an interview. "Anything more than that would mean independence or the creation of a state of Kosovo."
Judicial reform, political dialogue seen as keys to Macedonia's NATO bid
NATO officials say Macedonia's progress in defence reforms has been impressive, and prospects for a NATO invitation now hinge on the country's politicians.

NATO would like to extend an invitation to Macedonia at its Bucharest summit next year, but the country must show more results.
That is the gist of messages coming recently from the Alliance's headquarters in Brussels.
A Macedonian delegation travelled there this month to present the country's annual programme for NATO membership preparation.
According to sources within the Macedonian delegation, most representatives in the NATO Political Committee expressed hope that the latest national programme will be the last.
NATO has signaled that new invitations will be forthcoming at Bucharest, and the three Adriatic Charter countries -- Albania, Croatia and Macedonia -- are considered the most serious candidates.
However, Macedonia does have work to do.
According to the national co-ordinator for Euro-Atlantic integration, Nikola Dimitrov, officials in Brussels cited judicial reform as a particular area of concern.
The message was that the Judiciary Council should be completed and laws reforming the public prosecution should be adopted.
NATO also would like to see an improved political dialogue, with better co-operation among the government, the presidency and the opposition.
Political obstacles blocking judicial reform should be overcome.
The Macedonian Army (ARM) and defence matters are in far better shape.
The Macedonian Army contributes to missions in Afghanistan, Iraq and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The ARM has been completely professionalised and downsized, and a programme for a small, flexible and efficient army that can deal with new asymmetric threats, such as terrorism, has been implemented.
Last week, the chairman of NATO's Military Committee, General Ray Henault, met in Skopje with senior officials.
After talks with the ARM Chief of Staff, General Miroslav Stojanovski, Henault said the delegation was impressed by the progress made in military reforms.
The Republic of Macedonia has been a very good candidate so far, but its NATO membership will be decided on at the political level when all accomplishments are considered, Henault said.
"My expectation is that we will get support for full membership in the Alliance.
The motivation and obligation for the members of the ARM is that there is a consensus between the political parties in Macedonia for NATO membership as well as great support by the citizens," Stojanovski said.
Greece's Karamanlis determined to push through agenda
Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis had hoped to rally the public behind him as the government tackles a series of thorny issues.
Instead, he got a significantly smaller parliamentary majority.

Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis, whose ruling New Democracy party retained a slim majority following snap elections on September 16th, says he wants immediate results from his reshuffled cabinet, which includes several new faces.
Although Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis and other key members kept their posts, others have been replaced in a bid to inject new momentum and win back public support.
''I will be closely watching the work done by every ministry,'' Karamanlis said.
He also warned that deputy ministers now needed direct approval to make public statements.
"Too much television, too many statements, too much public speaking is seriously harmful.
Measure and much caution are necessary," the prime minister said.
Although his party saw its strength in parliament trimmed, Karamanlis stressed his determination to push through his agenda.
Initiatives aimed at streamlining bureaucracy and reducing costs have run into opposition from unions and the left, and Karamanlis had hoped the elections would bring him a strong show of support from the public at large.
Instead, New Democracy received a weaker mandate from a disenchanted electorate.
Many analysts are sceptical about prospects for change.
"The election campaigns made it clear that the parties are not willing to deal with the uncertain present," the daily Kathimerini wrote. "Both New Democracy and the left wing PASOK kept their cards close to their chests when it came to telling voters what are the clear measures that would increase wages or reduce the cost of living, while creating a fairer job market for the young, women in particular."
According to Transparency International, fighting corruption is one of the major areas in which the government will have to demonstrate progress.
The prime minister needs to restore New Democracy's credibility, which was recently undermined because of a pensions fund scandal.
More than 50 people, mostly officials at state pension funds, banks and brokerages, may face charges of fraud, money-laundering and tax evasion.
Following the devastating fires of August, many will be watching to see if the Karamanlis administration takes action to close the legal loopholes that have encouraged arson by would-be developers.
In the past, fires have often been the prelude to new construction.
But with unprecedented damage this time around, the public is in no mood to tolerate business as usual.
Karamanlis, 51, called early elections in August, six months before the end of his government's mandate.
His party now has 152 seats in the 300-seat parliament -- a loss of 13 seats since 2004.
According to Economy Minister George Alogoskoufis, the government's immediate priority is the drafting of the 2008 budget.
Next on the list is passage of a bill on the use of investment subsidies under the EU's 4th Community Support Framework.
The first bill to be tabled in parliament will concern the fight against tax evasion, Alogoskoufis told reporters.
The government also has said it wants to move forward with abolition of the inheritance tax, as well as taxes on first home purchases.
Serbia May Open All Files to the Public
Files that were kept on individuals who were being monitored by the former regime may be released to the public if a new law is passed by the Serbian Parliament.
By Davor Konjikusic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 19/08/03
Immediately upon coming into power, the Democratic Opposition Party in Serbia (DOS) promised to open all files on those under surveillance by the former regime.
Some files were opened, but selectively and haphazardly.
That is why a proposal by the Democratic Christian Party of Serbia (DHSS) to complete the disclosure has been agreed upon in principle by experts and politicians alike.
The proposed law submitted to parliament by DHSS would establish a special national agency to open the files kept by the state security and by other state services which existed prior to it.
According to DHSS leader and Minister of Justice Vladan Batic, the law would define the procedure for individuals to gain access to their own files, as well as for specific cases involving third parties.
Saying that "his party does not have any problems with the opening of files", Democratic Alternative General Secretary Igor Jovicic said that Batic's statements on the repercussions of the law suggest that he already has had access to the secret police files.
Batic denied having seen any files.
"Here the issue is constantly being confused.
It is stated that we want to carry out lustration and to eliminate certain individuals who held public office in the past.
No, we want to establish responsibility for everything.
Some people in DOS are being mentioned, and if they were informants, then that should be clearly stated -- such and such was an informant of state security. There is not a mystery in this," Batic said.
The Democratic Alternative and Democratic Centre have both expressed discomfort with the fact that Batic proposed the new law not in his capacity as justice minister, but rather as the leader of DHSS.
An earlier decree by the government on obtaining access to files concerning "enemies within" was deemed unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court of Serbia on 19 June, after an appeal by the Committee of Lawyers for Human Rights and the Serbian Radical Party.
The court ruled that the government had overstepped its jurisdiction.
Serbian Minister of Police Dusan Mihajlovic said at the end of February 2002 that 7,724 citizens had requested access to their files, but that only 413 actually had files on them.
Serbia's Presidential Elections to Help Shape Future
On 16 November, Serbia goes to the polls to elect a president.
The outcome could shape its political developments for the future.
By Davor Konjikusic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 04/11/03
The presidential elections in Serbia, scheduled for 16 November, are more than an election.
They will feature the widest range of political battles, with the results promising to have considerable influence on future developments in Serbian politics, despite the fact that the position of president is more or less one of form and protocol.
The Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) candidate will be Dragoljub Micunovic, president of the Democratic Centre Party.
Accompanied by several ministers, he submitted his candidacy. "Without elections there is no democracy.
Therefore, we will have elections -- elections for president, and then parliamentary elections, and then local elections; this is all a normal procedure in a democratic society.
However, order must exist," Micunovic said.
He began his campaign Monday (3 November) in Krusevac, a town in the south of Serbia.
Micunovic stressed the need for a successful presidential election this time, following two failed attempts, so Serbia might enter 2004 as "a normal, complete state".
Besides the DOS candidate, the Elections Committee of the Republic of Serbia (RIK) also confirmed the candidacies of Tomislav Nikolic, president of the Radical Party; Marijan Risticevic of the People's Peasant Party; Velimir Ilic of New Serbia and Dragan Tomic of the Socialist People's Party.
At a time when parliament is debating a vote of confidence for Acting President of Serbia Natasa Micic, the government is still surviving with a majority, though critics suggest otherwise.
The upcoming presidential election will gauge the level of support enjoyed by the government.
Mirko Jovic, vice president of the People's Radical Party, backs participation in this month;s vote, while a boycott has been announced by the Democratic Party of Serbia, G17 Plus, the Socialist Party of Serbia, the Serbian Renewal Movement and the Serbian Unity Party.
All of these parties fielded candidates in the first attempt, in September 2002, an election invalidated by low turnout.
While the government uses this election to continue fighting for reforms, the opposition announced that victory in the presidential elections would prompt them to try to force early parliamentary elections.
Calling the presidential election is a brave move by the current government, a move that carries a certain amount of risk.
In case of unsuccessful elections, the government will lose the image of being reform-oriented.
The impression remains that the government has not done a great deal to support its candidate or to fend off divisions within the coalition.
Bulgarian Wine Producers Target West European Markets
Domestic economic problems, in addition to fierce European competition, are challenging one of the oldest agricultural industries in Bulgaria.
By Emil Tsenkov for Southeast European Times in Sofia -- 22/07/03
Earlier this month, Bulgarian Agriculture Minister Mehmed Dikme issued a "red alert" about the state of the Bulgarian wine industry, warning that 5,000 hectares of new vineyards would be needed each year to safeguard it.
Only about 1 per cent of the country's vineyards are young ones, while 72 per cent of the vines are more than 20-years old.
To tackle the problem, the government has adopted a national strategy for the development of vine growing and wine producing.
According to Dikme, Bulgaria will push for a quota of 140,000 hectares of vines, to be augmented by 30,000 hectares of new plantations.
A special fund will be created to promote Bulgarian wines abroad, as exports over the past 13 years have shifted from the former Soviet Union to the highly competitive EU markets.
Wine is very much a symbol of Balkan joie de vivre, particularly so in Bulgaria, where wine growing has a long tradition. In his masterpiece "Under the Yoke", 19th-20th centuries writer Ivan Vazov described a classic family garden dinner during which even young children were encouraged to drink the god's nectar.
Today, thousands of Bulgarian farmers continue to grow their own vines, take pride in their domestic production and even participate in regional and national wine contests dedicated to excellence.
Bulgarian wines are well known in the West, where large commercial chains offer some best value-for-money buys.
Red wines are particularly praised by connoisseurs, who prefer the cabernet sauvignon and the merlot from the Trakia region in southern Bulgaria.
Some indigenous types of wine are also becoming increasingly popular in Europe.
Bulgaria plans to ask Brussels to obtain the monopoly over the production of famed red wines of the type of gumza, grown in central-northern parts of the country; the mavrud, from the region of Assenovgrad near the Rhodope Mountain; and the Melnik vine, from the southwest.
Apart from promotional activities, however, the industry needs robust financing and modernisation.
Recently, the outdated equipment at some local wineries startled a group of Western journalists.
Another problem is the lack of reliable control over the quality of grapes selected by wine producers.
Among the emerging private companies in this sector are some serious players, such as Domain Boyar, which exports wines to the United Kingdom and other Western countries.
Some newer wineries, including Brestovitza in the southern part of the country, have received awards for their wines and are trying to reach foreign customers.
Foreign investments, such as Italy's stake in the Damyanitza winery, are also welcome.
Greece Intensifies Efforts to Finish Olympic Projects
Following a progress review and a number of key decisions, top IOC inspector Denis Oswald says Greece is on track to complete Olympic construction projects on time, though deadlines remain very tight.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC)'s top inspector says Athens is on track to overcome delays and finish Olympic construction projects in time for the opening of the Summer Games in August.
"We have a clear picture of what is feasible, what is at risk," Denis Oswald said Friday (26 March) after meeting with key government ministers during a two-day inspection tour. "We are confident everything is still possible ...
Several projects are tight, but if the rhythm is kept up everything will be ready on time."
Oswald's visit came after the new government of Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis conducted a progress review at the request of IOC President Jacques Rogge.
The review resulted in a number of key decisions, including cancellation of a long-delayed roof over the main swimming pool venue.
In lieu of the roof, new sunshades will built to partially cover the pool area. To guard against the blistering summer heat, expected to reach 40 degrees Celsius, some water sports events will be rescheduled for early morning and late afternoon.
The change in plans has come under criticism from the International Swimming Federation, which called it a "total surprise", but Deputy Culture Minister Fani Palli-Petralia said the government had no choice.
Construction delays meant, "no alternative could be put into place and any emergency event or delay would have canceled the Olympic swimming sport from the Games," she said.
Round-the-clock work is in progress at all the key sites, the minister said. "We are turning night into day," she added.
Inspecting the site of the Olympic Stadium, Palli-Petralia received assurances from contractors that they would finish the job by 20 July.
The main item holding back completion is a landmark steel-and-glass roof designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava.
While not considered essential to the site's functioning, the Calatrava roof is intended to provide a spectacular landmark.
But problems with its construction are hampering other work around the stadium, sources say.
Other steps taken by the Karamanlis government include postponing a suburban train expansion and cutting back proposed changes to the marathon route.
According to Oswald, "the decisions are helping the projects to move forward."
In addition, renovations at the National Archaeological Museum will not be completed as planned.
Several new wings were expected to be finished before the opening of the Games, but they will not be ready.
The museum features a collection of more than 20,000 items covering a period of 6,000 years.
The site is covered with scaffolding as workers try to complete as many of its wings as possible, racing to make up for lost time.
Serbia-Montenegro Getting New World Bank, IMF Credits
A new agreement with the World Bank provides for $11m in technical assistance for Serbia-Montenegro.
It comes a day after the IMF approved a new $137m tranche intended to support the country's economic programme.
(Serbian Government, Radio B92, Hoover's, Seeurope.net - 17/04/03; IMF - 16/04/03)
Serbia-Montenegro will receive $148m in new credits from the World Bank and the IMF, and government officials expect more funds to be made available soon.
The head of the Bank's mission in Belgrade, Rory O'Sullivan, and International Economic Relations Minister Branko Lukovac signed a credit agreement Thursday (17 April), providing for $11m in technical assistance.
A day earlier, the IMF approved a new $137m tranche for Serbia-Montenegro under a three-year extended arrangement, intended to support the country's economic programme until 2005.
Totalling some $889m, the arrangement was approved in May 2002.
The World Bank loan aims to support privatisation and restructuring of banks and companies, including some of the most problematic state-owned enterprises in the country.
It will also support implementation of a comprehensive bank resolution strategy, aimed at creating a viable financial sector.
According to O'Sullivan, the loan is part of the Bank's assistance programme, totalling $200m, for Serbia-Montenegro in 2003.
Lukovac said talks in Washington earlier this week between a Serbia-Montenegro delegation and Bank officials confirmed that even stronger support is forthcoming.
Serbian Finance and Economy Minister Bozidar Djelic said Tuesday that the Bank plans to release two $40m tranches as part of a social sector reform loan, as well as a second financial and private sector reform credit.
Djelic also announced that the IMF would back the holding of a donor's conference for Serbia-Montenegro in September.
Commending Serbia-Montenegro authorities "for the impressive further progress in stabilisation and reform achieved in 2002" and welcoming the "renewed commitment to reform of the new government following Prime Minister Djindjic's tragic assassination", IMF First Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair Anne Krueger called for "continued prudence and vigilance in policy implementation".
She also stressed the need for a tightening of monetary policy and further fiscal consolidation and for even greater decisiveness in the next and more difficult stages of implementing reforms.
"The formation of the state union of Serbia-Montenegro in early 2003 will enhance political stability and provide a unique window of opportunity for carrying forward the reform process," Krueger said, adding that the harmonisation of economic systems in the member states should help improve overall economic efficiency.
In other news, the OSCE expressed satisfaction with the Serbian government's efforts to fight organised crime, and commended the government for announcing it will likely lift the state of emergency next week.
The head of the OSCE mission to Serbia-Montenegro, Maurizio Massari, said Thursday that observers had determined there were no major violations of human rights in Serbian prisons, following multiple arrests in the aftermath of Djindjic's murder.
Pristina gives Kosovo Serb police deadline to end boycott
Kosovo Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci announced a June 30th deadline for all suspended Kosovo Serb police officers to return to work

The Kosovo government announced last week that June 30th is the return-to-work deadline for all suspended Kosovo Serb police officers who are on the payroll.
Approximately 300 Serb officers have refused to serve under the Kosovo Police Service (KPS) chain of command.
They walked out after Kosovo's February 17th 2008 declaration of independence.
The striking officers consider UNMIK their commanding authority and have asked the international community to put UNMIK officers in charge of police stations in Kosovo's Serb-dominated areas.
The KPS is still paying the striking officers in hopes they eventually will resume work under KPS authority.
"The decision to continue with the paid suspension was a political decision … because we wanted to express our readiness for their return," Radio Free Europe quoted Interior Minister Zenun Pajaziti as saying.
Last week's government decision stems from the recommendations of a working group -- composed of Kosovo and EULEX representatives -- set up to address the issue.
EULEX previously tried unsuccessfully to work with the Belgrade authorities to resolve the matter.
Pajaziti presented the working group recommendations to the joint Rule of Law Co-ordination Board.
Its co-chairs are Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci and EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon.
"[T]he government has taken the decision to give until 30 June 2009 to all suspended officers to return to work", stated a joint government-EULEX press release.
Kuci said the deadline decision should not be seen "as a punishment of these officers, but a concrete step … to rebuild a fully multi-ethnic police service that will reflect Kosovo society and work in the interest of all communities".
Kosovo authorities will intensify their efforts "to encourage all police officers who had left to return to the Kosovo Police", added Pajaziti.
De Kermabon pledged EULEX's support but underlined "the need to approach this issue in a friendly manner".
Parliament's Commission for Internal Affairs and Security also addressed the issue last week.
The panel will visit the Kosovo police next week and recommends a parliamentary debate if the Kosovo Serb officers do not return to work.
The solution to this issue should come within the scope of the law, but Pristina should not forget that the "Kosovo institutions have done enough to have the police officers return to their workplace," the commission said in a statement.
The panel also noted there are enough young Serbs willing to work for the KPS.
"Tolerating a boycott, at the same time, means those who want to work are not given the chance to work," the commission said.
Serb court convicts four former policemen of Kosovo killings
Four former Serbian police officers received prison sentences from 13 to 20 years after a Belgrade court convicted them Thursday of killing 48 Kosovo Albanians in 1999.
The court acquitted three other defendants.

The special war crimes court in Belgrade on Thursday (April 23rd) convicted four former police officers of killing 48 ethnic Albanians during the 1998-1999 conflict in Kosovo and sentenced them to a total of 68 years in prison.
Radojko Repanovic, a former police commander in the town of Suva Reka, about 60km southeast of Pristina, and another local police officer, Sladjan Cukaric, each received the maximum of 20 years in prison.
The other two former officers, Miroslav Petkovic and Milorad Nisavic, face terms of 15 years and 13 years, respectively.
"They were found guilty of committing war crimes against civilians," Judge Vinka Beraha Nikicevic said, as she read out the verdict.
But the three other defendants facing charges in the 1999 Suva Reka massacre -- Radoslav Mitrovic, Nenad Jovanovic and Zoran Petkovic -- were acquitted.
Mitrovic, a former special police unit commander and the first defendant whom police arrested, initially faced charges of ordering the killings.
All but two of the victims of the massacre belonged to the same family.
Among them were two infants, a pregnant woman and a 100-year-old woman, the AP reported citing the verdict. On March 26th 1999, the Serb police officers rounded up members of the Berisha family, killing them with gunfire and hand grenades.
Shureta Berisha, who survived by feigning death and jumping off the truck carrying the corpses, was among more than 100 witnesses who testified.
The bodies of the Suva Reka victims were among more than 800 that Serbian security forces later transported to Serbia and reburied in two mass graves there.
Searchers found these graves in 2001, just a few months after the arrest of former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
Reports at the time said many of the bodies unearthed at the two sites showed signs of torture and violent death.
The Serb war crimes prosecutors said they would appeal, expressing particular dismay at Mitrovic's acquittal.
"We cannot be satisfied with the verdict," prosecution spokesman Bruno Vekaric said. "Justice has not been carried out."
Welcoming the Belgrade court's ruling, officials in Kosovo called on Serbia to bring to justice all perpetrators of war crimes committed against ethnic Albanians during the 1998-1999 conflict.
"We welcome every court and justice decision that will shed light [on] the atrocities committed in Kosovo during the war," Kosovo government spokesman Memli Krasniqi said on Thursday.
"Nevertheless, we feel that this should not cease with one case."
US Government Aids Prosecutors in Montenegro
Newly announced financial assistance from the United States will help Montenegrin prosecutors fight against organised crime more effectively.

A new grant by the United States will help Montenegro fight organised crime, including trafficking.
Much of the aid, totaling 30,000 euros, will go towards educating and training state prosecutors, with the aim of boosting their capability and efficiency.
An agreement on the grant was signed on 15 July by Montenegro Chief State Prosecutor Vesna Medenica, Principal Officer at the US Consulate in Podgorica Hoyt Yee, and Sam Nazzaro, the justice department's resident legal adviser at the US Embassy in Belgrade.
Permanent training for state prosecutors is a necessity, Medenica said at the signing ceremony, especially in light of the republic's new procedural laws and the institutions that they establish.
Given this situation, Montenegrin prosecutors have much to gain from studying the experience of others, she added.
Organised crime is a serious problem facing transitional countries, Yee said, noting that it hampers the establishment of a market economy and dissuades foreign investment.
According to Nazzaro, the aid also includes audio and video equipment, vital to a successful fight against criminals and the drug trade.
In addition, it provides for the appointment of an intermittent legal adviser for Montenegro, who will oversee new training programmes -- as well as the existing ones -- being managed by the US Embassy in Belgrade.
This is not the first time Montenegro has received aid from Washington.
Recently, the US Embassy sponsored a seminar on human trafficking in Southeast Europe, drawing participants from around the region.
Another seminar, sponsored by the US Treasury Department, focused on the problem of money laundering.
Some of the conclusions reached during that seminar later formed the basis for recommending modifications to Montenegro's criminal law.
Dubrovnik War Crimes Suspect Arrested in Serbia
The last in a group of officers indicted for their alleged role in the 1991 shelling of Dubrovnik was arrested Thursday in a village southeast of Belgrade.
Former Yugoslav Army Captain Vladimir Kovacevic faces six counts of violations of the laws or customs of war.

A former Yugoslav Army officer, indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal for his alleged role in shelling the Croatian city of Dubrovnik in 1991, has been captured by Serbian special police and handed over to the Belgrade district court.
Vladimir Kovacevic, also known as Rambo, was arrested in the village of Malo Gradiste, southeast of Belgrade, late Thursday (25 September), the Serbian Interior Ministry said in a statement.
He was the last of the Dubrovnik indictees still at large.
Kovacevic was indicted in 2001 along with three other officers -- Yugoslav Army General Pavle Strugar, Retired Vice Admiral Miodrag Jokic and Navy Vice Admiral Milan Zec -- for the murder of civilians and the destruction caused to the historic city.
Citing insufficient evidence, the prosecutors dropped the charges against Zec in July 2002.
Under the last amended indictment of March 2003, Kovacevic, 42, faces six counts of violations of the laws or customs of war.
The prosecutors say he exercised both de jure and de facto power over the forces under his command and have accused him of murder, cruel treatment, attacks on civilians, devastation not justified by military necessity, unlawful attacks on civilian objects, and destruction or wilful damage to institutions dedicated to religion, culture and education, as well as to historic monuments and works of art and science.
The indictment alleges that Yugoslav Army forces under the command of Strugar, Jokic and Kovacevic launched an attack against Dubrovnik on 1 October 1991 and in the course of the next three months unlawfully shelled the city and the surrounding areas from land and sea.
During the attacks, according to the indictment, the Yugoslav Army fired approximately 1,000 shells on Dubrovnik's Old Town area, a UNESCO world heritage site.
Projectiles hit hundreds of buildings, burning down several of them. According to a 1993 estimate, the total cost for restoring damaged buildings, religious edifices and other affected sites and cultural monuments exceeded $9.6m.
At the time of the attacks, Kovacevic was the commander of an army battalion, which was subordinated to the Yugoslav Army's 9th naval sector under Jokic's command.
Jokic surrendered to The Hague-based tribunal in November 2001.
As part of a plea agreement with prosecutors, he pleaded guilty last month to six counts of violations of the laws or customs of war.
In exchange, prosecutors dropped the other charges and recommended a ten-year prison sentence.
Strugar, who was in charge of the Dubrovnik operation, turned himself in soon after the indictment was made public in October 2001 and was provisionally released pending trial.
Kovacevic's arrest came on the day Serbian Justice Minister Vladan Batic and Serbia's new war crimes prosecutor, Vladimir Vukcevic, returned from a visit to The Hague.
Batic described his meeting with the chief UN war crimes prosecutor as "exceptionally successful", saying Carla del Ponte had agreed that co-operation had become a two-way process.
Telekom Austria Closes Acquisition of Bulgarian Leading Operator
Telekom Austria has bought Bulgaria's leading operator, Mobiltel.
The deal is reportedly the largest ever acquisition by an Austrian company.
(Telekom Austria, AP, Reuters, BBC, Reporter.gr, Sofia News Agency, Mediapool - 14/07/05)
Currently, Mobiltel has over 3.2 million subscribers and a 65 per cent market share. [AFP]
Telekom Austria said on 14 July that it has closed the acquisition of Mobiltel AD, Bulgaria's leading mobile phone operator, about six weeks after the share purchase agreement was signed.
Telekom Austria acquired 100 per cent of Mobiltel for a total consideration (Enterprise Value) of up to 1.6 billion euros, the Austrian company said in a statement.
The Bulgarian operator will be consolidated into Telecom Austria's wireless segment.
Welcoming the successful conclusion of the acquisition, Telekom Austria Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Heinz Sundt told reporters that the deal represented the largest ever takeover by an Austrian company.
The move gives the firm access to potential new customers in a country with a population of about 8 million.
Currently, Mobiltel has over 3.2 million subscribers, more than Bulgaria's total of fixed-line customers, and a 65 per cent market share as of 31 March.
Days before the closing of the acquisition, the Bulgarian operator, which also has licenses for fixed-line and third-generation mobile services, was given a BB+ long-term corporate rating by Standard & Poor's.
Mobiltel's revenue for the first quarter of this year stood at more than 119m euros, up 11.8 per cent, and its net income rose 6 per cent to 51.6m euros, Reuters reported.
Its annual revenue for 2004 exceeded 486m euros and its net income was almost 203m euros.
Sundt said Telecom Austria plans no major changes at Mobiltel.
"The company is Bulgaria's success story," Josef Vinatzer, Mobiltel's new CEO, said at a news conference on 14 July. "It is the undisputed market leader, and we intend to keep it that way.
We are going to build on the brand, offer competitive pricing, and come up with new services and products."
Vinatzer led a team of experts from Telecom Austria's wireless subsidiary Mobilkom Austria, who began preparations for Mobiltel's integration back in February, to ensure a smooth transition of ownership.
Before the deal, 40 per cent of Mobiltel was owned by a private equity group led by ABN AMRO Capital, Citigroup Investments and Communications Venture Partners.
The other 60 per cent was in the hands of Austrian businessman Herbert Cordt and two other Austrian interests.
"Telekom Austria has acquired a very profitable operator with good growth prospects," Reuters quoted Erste Bank analyst Konrad Sveceny as saying. "Penetration in Bulgaria is slightly over 50 per cent, so the growth potential is still very good."
According to official statistics, Bulgaria's telecommunications market grew by 13 per cent in 2004 and reached a volume of about 1.25 billion euros.
Citing Bulgaria's telecommunications regulator, the AP reported that wireless services in the country grew by 13 per cent last year.
According to Boris Nemsic, CEO of Mobilcom Austria -- one of Telecom Austria's seven wireless divisions -- the acquisition of Mobiltel was a positive step towards Telecom Austria's expansion into Southeast Europe.
The company already operates in Croatia via its VIPnet division.
As part of its ambitions to become a leading player in Southeastern Europe, Telecom Austria is reportedly also looking to buy 49 per cent of Serbia's second-largest operator, Mobtel

US President Bush makes historic visit to Zagreb
During an official two-day visit to Zagreb, US President George W. Bush praised Croatian reforms and congratulated the country on the invitation it received to join NATO at the Alliance's summit in Bucharest.
By Natasa Radic for Southeast European Times in Zagreb – 07/04/08

US President George W. Bush visited Zagreb for two days beginning on Friday (April 4th) to welcome Croatia to NATO and praise the country's democratic reforms, holding them up as an example to other formerly communist countries in the Balkans.
Bush, on one of his last European tours, stopped in Zagreb between the NATO summit in Bucharest and before his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
President Stipe Mesic and Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said the trip was one of modern Croatia's most important political events.
"President Bush's visit shows that, although we are a small nation, we are partners with the United States," Mesic said.
On Friday, Mesic hosted a dinner for the US delegation that was attended by Croatians prominent in cultural circles, sports, humanitarian efforts and economics.
The following day, Bush delivered a speech at St. Mark's Square, the symbol of Croatian national sovereignty, in historic downtown Zagreb.
The Albanian and Macedonian presidents and prime ministers were among those invited to attend the speech.
Additionally, more than 5,000 Croatians enthusiastically welcomed Bush.
"The Croatian people have overcome war and hardship to build peaceful relations with your neighbours and to build a maturing democracy in one of the most beautiful countries on the face of the earth," Bush said.
Congratulating Croatia on the invitation it received to join NATO at the summit, Bush said it was a vote of confidence in their continued reforms.
"Henceforth, should any danger threaten your people, America and the NATO Alliance will stand with you.
And no one will be able to take your freedom away," Bush added.
However, he expressed regret that Macedonia did not receive an invitation.
"America's position is clear: Macedonia should take its place in NATO as soon as possible," he said.
Saying NATO is open to all countries in the region, he welcomed Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro's efforts to get closer to the Alliance by beginning the process of Intensive Dialogue.
He also thanked Croatian, Albanian and Macedonian soldiers for serving in Afghanistan, and Albanian and Macedonian troops for serving in Iraq.
"It's only a matter of time before freedom takes root across that troubled region.
And when it does, millions will remember the people of your nation stood with them in their hour of need," Bush said.
He ended his speech by saying, "May God bless Croatia."
Sanader then thanked Bush for his support, saying he hoped the US-Croatian partnership will blossom.
Minutes before Air Force One left Zagreb Airport, Bush warmly greeted Croatian soldiers who participated in the ISAF mission in Afghanistan.
Montenegro's Vujanovic wins re-election
Sunday's presidential election in Montenegro appears to have further cemented the strength of the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists, which has been in power for 19 years.

Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic won a second five-year term on Sunday (April 6th).
It was the country's first presidential election since it left a loose union with Serbia two years ago.
Based on a 93% vote count, independent observers said that the 53-year-old lawyer and senior member of the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) had garnered 52.3% of the vote, more than the 50% required for outright victory in the first round.
Of the other three candidates for the largely ceremonial post, the Serbian List bloc's Andrija Mandic fared best with 19.3%, while the leader of the Movement for Change (PZP) and anti-corruption campaigner Nebojsa Medojevic came in third with 17.3% of the vote.
Socialist People's Party candidate Srdjan Milic was fourth with 11.2%.
All three conceded defeat after preliminary results were announced.
The state electoral commission is expected to announce final results on Monday, when the Election Observation Mission deployed in Montenegro by the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights is also due to issue a statement of preliminary findings and conclusions.
Election observers of the Centre for Democratic Transition (CDT) and the CEMI monitoring agency placed the turnout at around 69%, about 22% above that in the 2003 presidential poll.
Vujanovic's victory has further cemented the uninterrupted 19-year rule of Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic's DPS, which steered Montenegro to independence in May 2006.
"This is a victory for all of us, for our Montenegro and for a better future," Vujanovic, who has also served as prime minister and parliament speaker in the past, told supporters in Podgorica after the results were announced. "I also want to express my gratitude to those who voted for my opponents.
I will be the president of all of Montenegro's citizens."
With his close ally Djukanovic standing at his side, he also pledged to keep Montenegro firmly on the path of EU accession.
"We'll work together for our European future," Vujanovic said, addressing a crowd of cheering supporters. "Montenegro belongs to the European Union, and we'll join it."
Montenegro signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU in October 2007, making a first major step towards eventual membership in the 27-nation bloc.
"I see that the consensus behind the pro-European policies of DPS continues to grow," Djukanovic said.
Vujanovic's victory came three days after NATO leaders invited his country and Bosnia and Herzegovina to start an Intensified Dialogue to join the 26-nation military pact.
While DPS supporters hailed their party's victory as evidence of its strong popular mandate, the opposition took a more critical view.
For Medojevic, whose campaign centered on pledges to clean up the country's political system, the results simply reinforced the status quo.
"The vote has shown that Montenegrins are still not ready for change of the corrupt and totalitarian regime," he said Sunday.
While the Adriatic republic's annual economic growth stands at about 8% and foreign direct investment has grown to about 1 billion euros since 2006, widespread corruption and weak institutions remain among the primary challenges facing the country.
Croatian President Meets With EU, NATO Chiefs in Brussels
Croatian membership in the EU will help realise the vision of a united Europe, President Stipe Mesic said during a visit to Brussels, where he met with European Commission President Romano Prodi and NATO Secretary General George Robertson.
(HINA, Hoover's, EUobserver - 11/02/03; VOA, European Commission - 10/02/03)
Croatian President Stipe Mesic has wrapped up a two-day visit to Brussels. He arrived Monday (10 February) to discuss his country's forthcoming application for EU membership.
European Commission (EC) President Romano Prodi assured him of Commission support but linked Zagreb's accession prospects to the implementation of key reforms and improvements in the areas of human rights and refugee issues.
Prodi added that the Commission stands ready to provide Croatia with any assistance it might need along the way, including practical advice and financial support.
He also stressed that, should the EU request the EC's opinion on the application, that opinion will be based on the country's performance in implementing reforms.
Croatia planned to submit its membership application on 18 February, but must delay that due to a hastily arranged EU summit on Iraq now scheduled for the same day.
Croatian media sources report that Prime Minister Ivica Racan's visit to Athens has been rescheduled for 21 February and that the application will be submitted then.
Greece, which holds the EU's rotating presidency, has been busy trying to work out a common EU position on Iraq.
Mesic said that ahead of its actual submission, the EU application had already produced a very positive effect on Croatian public opinion.
"We realise that this is our destiny, to be part of Europe," he said.
His two-day visit to Brussels was at the invitation of the Belgian Royal Institute for International Relations.
Addressing the Institute Tuesday night, Mesic said Croatian membership in the EU would offer the possibility of "starting the implementation of the final phrase of the project Unified Europe." The notion of a united Europe, stretching from the Atlantic to the Urals, could only be realised if all European states are truly included, he said.
Discussing the Balkans, Mesic said his country was following a course of normalisation of relations with neighbours, including Serbia and Montenegro.
Croatia's efforts, he added, are aimed at bringing the standards of conduct in the Balkans closer to Europe so that the region "transforms itself into Europe".
On Tuesday, Mesic also met with NATO Secretary General George Robertson to discuss Croatia's bid to join the alliance.
He briefed Robertson on progress in reforming the military to bring it into line with NATO standards. The talks also focused on other obligations Croatia is expected to meet, including co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
Following his visit to Brussels, Mesic was scheduled to arrive in Tirana Wednesday to participate in the Summit Towards NATO, hosted by Albanian President Alfred Moisiu.
Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski is attending along with Mesic.
US Ambassador to Tirana James Jeffrey will represent Washington.
According to Moisiu spokesman Arjan Konomi, the summit "will define the common goal and the respective obligations regarding the integration path of [the] three countries towards NATO."
Catholics in BiH keep ancient traditions alive
Fasting gives way to a grand Christmas feast for the Catholic community in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as SETimes contributor Jusuf Ramadanovic explains in the first of a series looking at Balkan winter traditions.

For Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) Catholics, Christmas is certainly the high point of the winter season.
The Stup district of Sarajevo, populated largely by ethnic Croats, is decorated lavishly each year.
The main Christmas Mass occurs in the Sarajevo Cathedral, a beautiful old building in Romano-Gothic style dating back to 1889.
It is one of the most recognisable structures in downtown Sarajevo.
Likewise, the Mass held there each year is a major event for the entire city, regardless of faith.
On Christmas Eve, the building is packed to capacity not only with Catholics but with Muslims, Orthodox Christians and even atheists.
It has become a matter of prestige to be seen there.
Many, in fact, end up waiting outside the building because there is no room inside.
In rural areas, meanwhile, Catholics observe some very old traditions and rites.
Preparations start as early as December 13th, St. Lucia's day, with the planting of the traditional Christmas wheat.
It will be trimmed on Christmas Eve, decorated with candles and a red or blue ribbon, and placed under the Christmas tree or on the table as a holiday decoration.
On the morning before Christmas, the head of the house brings in an oak branch as a symbol of good health or a stack of hay as a symbol of abundance.
People fast during the day, and meals that are prepared for the dinner that day are mainly light ones -- beans, fish, potatoes, pies and various salads.
Families prepare meat and bake decorated ceremonial bread in preparation for the big event the next day.
As Christmas dawns, people pray in their homes and then go to church for Holy Mass.
Traditionally, they do not visit friends and relatives that day but rather stay at home and celebrate with the immediate family over a plentiful dinner -- this time including roasted meat, as well as various pastries and cakes.
Kugloff is one of the traditional Christmas cakes among Bosnian Catholics.
It is quite simple to prepare:
Ingredients:
Preparation:
Mix egg yolks with sugar.
Add butter, raisins or chocolate chips, milk, lemon peel and vanilla sugar.
Beat egg whites with a pinch of salt.
Add the egg yolk mixture, add flour and baking powder, and stir all together gently.
Pour into the kugloff mould and bake for about one hour.
Longstanding Croatia-Slovenia dispute imperils Croatia's EU ambitions
The new government in Ljubljana has blocked the accession process for neighbouring Croatia by emphasising a longtime maritime border dispute.
This means Croatia might not fulfil the accession schedule and be ready for EU membership by the end of 2009.

The EU and Croatia opened only one policy area and closed three in an accession conference in Brussels last week because Slovenia decided to use its authority as a member state and block the accession process.
As a consequence, Croatia might be unable to obtain EU membership by the end of 2009.
Slovenia and Croatia have disputed their land and maritime borders since becoming independent in 1991.
Croatia favours a bilateral resolution, while EU member Slovenia wants the issue settled through Zagreb's EU accession talks.
Slovenia's roadblock has introduced a glacial chill into bilateral relations.
Croatia had hoped to open ten new negotiation chapters and close five, which would signify an auspicious acceleration of talks.
But Slovenia feared Croatia would be able to obtain a fait accompli on the disputed borders and acted accordingly.
Slovenian Foreign Minister Samuel Zbogar on Friday (December 19th) said in Ljubljana the EU was "obviously not paying enough attention to the interests of member states, which it should be representing, but [was] looking to reach results in the area of enlargement".
A "shocked" Gordan Jandrokovic, Zagreb's foreign minister, vowed to solve the problem.
Croatia, which launched accession negotiations with the EU in October 2005, now has opened 22 out of 35 chapters and formally closed seven.
The EC expressed regret over Slovenia's announcement.
"Let's all try to calm down," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn advised.
However, emotions are running high on both sides.
Facebook groups have sprung up demanding boycotts of the other country's goods.
Slovenia is the fourth-largest recipient of Croatian exports, while Croatia is the third-largest recipient of Slovenian exports.
Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, though, said pressure for a boycott of Slovenia is "unacceptable".
Business Roundup
A review of business and economic news from the Balkans since 4 April.
(Various sources -- 04/04/03 - 11/04/03)
A review of business and economic news from the Balkans since 4 April:
Greek companies operating in Bulgaria say they intend to invest 184m euros in the domestic economy this year.
Of this 100m euros will go to mobile operator Globul, 62.5m will be invested in metal processing Viohalko Group and the remaining part in Hellenic Petroleum.
Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano officially opened construction work on the final segment of the Elbasan-Librazhd road, which is 30.5-km long.
The road is part of the Pan European Corridor 8 connecting Durres with Macedonia, Bulgaria and Turkey.
The World Bank's (WB) new three-year Country Assistance Strategy for Macedonia envisions $160m in financial assistance.
About 35 per cent of the funds would be used to support structural reforms; the rest will go to investment projects.
The WB Board is to approve the programme on 21 May.
Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Romania signed a bilateral Free Trade Agreement on 8 April.
Romanian State Secretary for Foreign Trade Eugen Dijmarescu sealed it during a visit to Sarajevo.
The target of 20 per cent year-end inflation in Turkey is attainable, according to a 7 April statement by Central Bank Governor Sureyya Serdengecti.
Prudent fiscal policy and full implementation of structural reforms will be required, he said.
A 25 per cent stake of Turk Telekom will be privatised through public offering by the end of this month, according to a 9 April announcement by Turkish Transportation Minister Binali Yildirim.
The convertible bonds will reportedly carry two-year to five-year maturity.
Greece's biggest oil refiner Hellenic Petroleum is expected to complete negotiations with Austrian Vatech Hydro for construction of a 390-megawatt power plant in Thessaloniki, according to a 9 April company announcement.
Its Belgrade office says USAID will extend $150m in aid to Serbia-Montenegro this year.
The funds will be used for an assortment of programmes.
The National Bank of Greece says it plans to open five more offices in Serbia by the end of the year.
In all, the Greek commercial bank will have 15 offices in the republic.
Croatia's largest food production and retail group Podravka reported sales rose by 8 per cent last year, along with a four times net profit growth of 14.5m euros.
The company expanded rapidly in the market for mineral water boosting sales by 39 per cent year-on-year.
Amid signals of economic recovery, Macedonians await a better life
On paper, economic conditions in Macedonia look favourable with increasing investment grades, structural reforms, a growing GDP, a stable macroeconomic policy and low inflation rates.
However, the average citizen has yet to feel a significant improvement.
Despite the positive indicators, foreign investment remains scanty, living costs are on the rise, and the ranks of the unemployed are swelling.
Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski's administration has made creating a more mobile economy the cornerstone of its policy, embarking on tough reforms that it says are laying the groundwork for future prosperity.
While urging patience, the government is coming under increased pressure as Macedonians await tangible benefits.
By Zoran Nikolovski for Southeast European Times in Skopje – 24/10/05
Polls consistently indicate that Macedonian citizens are mostly concerned about poverty. [AFP]
Most Macedonians would not say that they have seen much recent improvement in their daily quality of life.
New jobs are few, petrol, central heating, electricity and telephone charges have increased and salaries have not risen.
Polls consistently indicate that Macedonian citizens are above all concerned about the economic situation and the spectre of joblessness -- in a word, about poverty.
Yet economic indicators show that the economy is indeed recovering, as the country emerges from what has been a protracted transition period.
According to the finance ministry, the economic foundations for accelerated growth and better living standards have been put in place.
In late August, Standard & Poor’s raised Macedonia's long-term national investment grades of Macedonia from BB to BB+ in foreign currency and from BB to BBB- in local currency.
At the same time, the short-term investment grade in local currency increased from B to A-3.
According to the ratings firm, "prospects are stable".
Swift and stable progress towards political stability, marked by fulfillment of the Ohrid Accords, are a major reason for the upgrade.
In addition, the agency cites structural reforms, macroeconomic stability, a stable exchange rate, decreasing debt and reduced obstacles to growth as factors.
Efforts are under way to streamline management practices, free up the labour market and reform the country's judiciary, the firm notes.
Macedonian Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski has been vigorously promoting Macedonia's prospects.
"This year, GDP will come up to around 4 per cent, a good basis for economic development in the upcoming period," he said during a presentation at Citigroup offices in London.
Bullish estimates are also coming from the IMF.
In its most recent semiannual report on World Economic Prospects, it predicted that Macedonia will see 3.8 per cent economic growth this year and 3.7 per cent in 2006.
By comparison, the IMF puts the growth rate of the world economy at 4.3 per cent in 2005 and 2006.
"This year, GDP will come up to around 4 per cent, a good basis for economic development in the upcoming period," Macedonian Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski said. [AFP]
According to the report, the country's balance of payments deficit will be 6.5 per cent of GDP this year, decreasing to 5.2 per cent in 2006.
The IMF expects Macedonia to end this year with 1.2 per cent inflation, while in 2006 inflation will rise to 1.8 per cent.
Per capita GDP, according to the IMF, will be $2,380 this year, and in 2006 it will be $2,508.
Another positive economic indicator is a higher ranking in the UN Human Development report, the most recent of which placed Macedonia 59th out of 117 countries in terms of GDP, educational levels and health security.
The index records an upward trend in these areas over the past five years.
However encouraging the signs look on paper, they have yet to translate into a general improvement in living standards.
One reason, according to the USAID, is that Macedonia lags behind in technical development.
The country has only 60 Internet users per 1,000 inhabitants, whereas in many other countries the figure is between 250 and 600 users per 1,000 inhabitants.
Another factor, say experts, is the red tape entrepreneurs must deal with in order to start a business.
No fewer than 13 procedures are required, requiring 48 days and a cost of around $12,350. The start-up costs and hassles pose a serious barrier to investors.
Macedonia has the lowest level of foreign investment in the region -- around $160m.
The government is taking steps to address the problem. Starting on 1 January 2006, a one-stop-shop system for business registration will be in place.
Three out of 18 amendments needed to streamline the process have already been adopted.
The country has embarked on a path that will make it significantly easier to woo foreign and domestic investors, say officials.

The World Bank cites the inflexibility of Macedonia's labour market as another obstacle, ranking the country 123rd in terms of hiring and firing procedures.
True, Macedonian workers -- those who have jobs, at least -- enjoy security, but at a steep cost.
On a positive note, Macedonia ranks 53rd in terms of credit procedures, 58th in terms of taxes on enterprises, and 30th in protection of investors, the Bank found.
It is 81st overall, behind Bulgaria (62nd) and Romania (78th), but ahead of Serbia-Montenegro (92nd), Albania (117th) and Croatia (118th).
Inevitably, Macedonians are wondering when they will benefit from progress in economic performance.
The finance ministry says a solid starting basis has been created for future prosperity.
Addressing parliament, Buckovski argued that his administration has spent its first three years in office repairing the damage done by previous governments, not to mention the interethnic conflict that nearly tore the country apart.
The government has kept to a strict fiscal policy and disciplined budget policy in line with the IMF and World Bank recommendations, banking that it will be able to tackle unemployment through boosting the investment climate.
The Buckovski administration hopes to attract at least one large foreign bank, enabling lower credit interest rates, which in turn would spur domestic investment.
In the meantime, domestic exporters complain because of the high exchange rates of the denar (which is fixed to the euro), would-be investors point to the high interest rate, and citizens lament their lack of purchasing power.
Buckovski's government recognises that a more mobile economy is the ticket for a better future, and has already carried out tough reforms.
It is only a matter of time, officials insist, before citizens will see the results.
UNDP: Six SEE countries have high human development levels
Greece, Cyprus, Croatia, Bulgaria, Romania and Bosnia and Herzegovina are the highest-ranked regional nations in a new report from the UNDP.

Six Southeast European (SEE) countries are among 63 world nations with high levels of human development, according to the UNDP's annual Human Development Report, released on Thursday (November 9th).
The 440-page report ranks 177 countries according to their levels of human development, placing them into three clusters: high, medium and low human development.
Except for Montenegro and Serbia -- including Kosovo -- all states in the region are listed on the report's Human Development Index (HDI), which offers a snapshot of progress on key development issues.
The HDI is a composite index, gauging countries' average achievements in three basic dimensions of human development: life expectancy at birth, adult literacy and school enrolment, and income, as measured by GDP per capita in purchasing power parity (PPP) in US dollars.
Most of the data used in the assessment are for 2004.
As in the 2005 HDI, the group of high human development nations is led by Norway, with an index score of 0.965.
It is again followed by Iceland and Australia, with scores of 0.960 and 0.957, respectively.
The six SEE countries placed within this group of 63 nations -- in descending order -- are Greece, Cyprus, Croatia, Bulgaria, Romania and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
Macedonia, Albania and Turkey remain among the countries with medium human development.
Greece has the highest ranking among the SEE countries -- it is placed 24th in the world with a score of 0.921, which is 0.009 points higher than the HDI value it was given in the 2005 survey.
Life expectancy in the country is 78.3 and the GDP per capita is $22,205, up from $19,954 in last year's survey.
In terms of education, an overall index of 0.97 also makes Greece the leading country in the region, although its adult literacy rate is lower than that of most of the other SEE nations, including Albania, where 98.7% of people above 15 are literate.
Despite its higher indices for life expectancy and GDP, Cyprus ranks five places below Greece.
Like in the 2005 HDI, it is again 29th, with a score of 0.903, 0.012 points higher than the one it was given last year.
Its GDP per capita rose by more than $4,000 over a year to reach $22,805, which is $600 higher than that of Greece.
Of the former Yugoslav republics, Croatia ranks highest with a score of 0.841.
A slight improvement in the country's HDI value has allowed it to move up a place.
It now ranks 44th among the 177 nations surveyed.
In terms of adult literacy, which is set at 98.1%, Croatia ranks second in the region after Albania.
As compared with last year's UNDP survey, the country's GDP per capita has risen by a little more than $1,000, reaching nearly $12,000.
Except for Greece and Cyprus, Croatia was the only SEE country ranking among the high human development nations in the 2004 HDI.
Bulgaria, which was first included in this group last year, has moved up a further step to 54th. A 0.008 increase in its score, set at 0.816 in the 2006 HDI, reflects a 3% rise in the combined gross enrolment ratio for primary, secondary and tertiary schools, as well as a $300 increase in the country's GDP per capita, now standing at $8,078.
Improvements in both Romania and BiH have allowed both countries to join the group of high human development nations for the first time. Romania, which was 64th in the 2005 HDI, now takes the 60th place, with a score of 0.805.
Its GDP per capita has risen by $1,200 over a year, reaching $8,480.
Although the increase is four times higher than that of its southern neighbour, its lower indices for life expectancy and education place it six positions below Bulgaria.
A 0.014 point increase in BiH's score, now set at 0.800, has allowed it to move up six places, reaching the 62nd position, reflecting its higher education and GDP indices in this year's survey.
Although Turkey's GDP is higher than that of BiH, the country ranks lowest among the SEE countries.
A score of 0.757 places it 92nd in the world, two positions up from last year.
With a score of 0.796, Macedonia is ranked 66th, seven positions lower than the ranking it was given in the 2005 HDI.
With a GDP of less than $5,000 -- the lowest in the region -- Albania is ranked 73rd in the world, with a score of 0.784.
Pro-entity politicians stall Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU progress
Calls for strengthening state institutions have run into opposition from Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, who advocates a federal solution for Bosnia and Herzegovina.

A country with an outstandingly complicated government structure, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) has been facing particularly slow progress in recent months.
The election campaign last year was marked by a return to inflammatory, ethno-nationalist rhetoric, and the political climate has continued to deteriorate.
The EU has made it clear that the country's chances of moving ahead in its accession bid depend on substantial reforms, aimed at strengthening state institutions.
The current state composition -- with three constituent peoples and two entities -- is a product of the Dayton Agreement, which ended the four-year conflict in 1995.
While the deal was credited with halting the violence, most observers agree that the political system it established is complicated, inefficient, expensive and ultimately incompatible with EU standards.
However, the political will to change it is proving hard to muster.
Hardline politicians in both entities are responsible for the stalemate, but most observers agree that Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik has done the most to foster the current adversarial atmosphere. Leader of the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD), which swept the 2006 elections, Dodik has been a fierce advocate of strengthening the Bosnian Serb entity at the expense of the state.
"I am interested in nothing else but the RS.
For me, the BiH is just a construction of Dayton, created by the agreement.
And I respect the agreement," he said recently. On another occasion, he described BiH as a "speed brake on the development of RS".
Local and foreign politicians alike have criticised him for seeking to make the entity a semi-autonomous state.
The election campaign saw calls from Bosniak politicians for RS to be abolished.
Dodik responded with threats of an independence referendum.
Top RS officials and entity representatives in the BiH Parliament have warned they could request the return of all authorities that were transferred from the entities to the state in recent years.
Those calling for reform say the current police system allows criminals to escape justice by slipping across entity lines. [Getty Images]
"If the requests for the abolishment on the RS continue, we would request to return our authorities for defence, indirect taxation and Higher Judiciary and Prosecutor Council to the entity level," said RS President Milan Jelic.
Dodik and his SNSD stand for a BiH that is organised as a decentralised, federal state, with the RS as one federative unit.
Dodik claims that the introduction of a simple pluralist democracy, with the entire country as one electoral unit, would lead to the country being dominated by the Bosniaks.
A man with an extensive network of local business contacts, he believes strongly in the economy as the primary driver of the Bosnian Serb entity's future.
Born in March 1959 at Laktasi, close to Banja Luka, Dodik graduated from the Faculty of Political Science at the University of Belgrade. From 1986 through 1990, he headed the Laktasi Municipality. During the war in BiH, he served as a representative in the RS National Assembly.
He formed the Independent Members of Parliament Caucus, which was the only political opposition to the ruling Serb Democratic Party (SDS), the party led by war crimes indictee Radovan Karadzic.
The caucus he chaired formed the core of his current party. In 1997, he was elected into the National Assembly of the RS.
In January 1998, then RS President Biljana Plavsic nominated him as prime minister.
His government lasted until January 2001.
Dodik concentrated on strengthening his political party, while sharply criticising the SDS.
He won the attention of the international community in BiH, which came to see him as a progressive alternative to the nationalistic hardliners.
In February 2006, when Dodik was tapped as prime minister after his party's election win, he vowed to protect the existence of RS.
"Without an agreement on police reform in accordance with the EU's principles, the EU is unable to conclude a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said. [Getty Images]
"In 1996, Dodik was among the rare politicians in RS who publicly claimed that [war crimes indictee Radovan] Karadzic and Ratko Mladic must be brought to the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague," says Tanja Topic, a political analyst at the Friedrich Ebert Foundation in Banja Luka.
"Being a pragmatist, a combination of politician and businessman, Dodik then gravitated towards the populist politics that brought him huge public support."
According to Topic, there are a number of factors behind the resurgence of nationalist rhetoric.
One is that the underlying beliefs have never really changed.
For years, she says, the citizens of RS have been publicly and politically educated that their entity is in fact a state.
Furthermore, Topic adds, the international community has not been successful in convincing the Bosnian Serbs that the current structure is too expensive and that the money now spent on the huge administration could be better used elsewhere, like social programmes.
The talk of an independence referendum in RS is also being fuelled by the Kosovo status debate, Topi says, arguing that Serbian politicians are using RS as part of the effort to stop Kosovo from breaking away.
The price for citizens in both entities has been a slowdown in BiH's journey towards EU integration.
Police reform is a key precondition for signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU, a step that could still potentially happen this year.
The reform is long overdue, however, because of Dodik's insistence that police authority must remain at the entity level.
Similarly, RS representatives oppose NATO's request to put the Civil Protection Administration at the state level.
With issues such as these proving hard to resolve, the prospects for compromise on the larger problem of constitutional reform are not rosy.
"BiH is stuck between two concepts of constitutional structure that exclude each other -- one that calls for abolishment of entities, and the other that requests future existence of RS," says Topic.
"It is hard to find a way out, and the international community has been disoriented about that so far."
Topic believes that overcoming the stalemate will require a firm engagement by the international community, which must somehow find a course between the approaches of two former High Representatives: Paddy Ashdown, who readily used his Bonn Powers to sack public officials and impose the changes he sought, and Christian Schwarz-Schilling, who left local politicians to resolve disputes on their own, without much success.
Current High Representative Miroslav Lajcak, who took office in July, has sharply criticised Dodik's stance, and particularly his suggestion that RS could secede.
The prime minister "should consider carefully whether he wishes to challenge the international community by statements that question the constitutional order of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Dayton Peace Agreement," Lajcak warned last month.
An end-of-September deadline has been set for reaching agreement on police reform.
If political leaders prove unable to compromise, the SAA will not be signed this year, and the country's EU bid will be in limbo.
"Bosnia and Herzegovina now risks falling farther behind its neighbours and ending up last on the road to Europe," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn has said.
NATO funds reconstruction of Skopje-Veles bridges
Sixty bridges and four overpasses damaged by heavy truck traffic are being repaired with NATO funding.

Damaged bridges and overpasses on the highway between Skopje and Veles are being repaired under a NATO-funded project.
In all, around 35m euros will be spent to help repair bridges that have sustained damage from heavy vehicles that use the highway for transport between Kosovo and the Greek port of Thessaloniki.
A total of 60 bridges and four overpasses will be restored in the effort.
The contractor selected for reconstruction and bridge reinforcement is the Turkish firm CESAS. The first phase, involving 30 bridges, got under way on October 23rd.
Studies by the Faculty of Civil Engineering in Skopje suggest that the bridges on this section are the most damaged, so they are receiving priority.
Thirty other bridges will be reconstructed in the second phase.
In addition, reconstruction of four overpasses at Blace -- the border crossing between Kosovo and Skopje -- is planned.
Two lanes of the highway have been closed for the project, and will remain out of commission for at least a year.
Closure of the section initially caused a series of difficulties: people were unprepared and there was a lack of an adequate signalling system.
The section has now been resignalled.
The maximum speed on the section is 80 km/h, dropping to 60 km/h at places, and traffic police are recommending that drivers use caution.
Police have also promised to introduce regular patrols to help prevent accidents.
There have been disagreements over whether a toll should be charged.
Following the closure of one lane, the public enterprise in charge of toll collection said it was necessary that drivers paid a toll.
The government, however, has decided that that no toll should be paid.
Peter Sorensen to head EU delegation in BiH
BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Danish diplomat Peter Sorensen has been appointed as the head of the EU delegation to Sarajevo, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton announced on Monday (May 30th).
The decision comes in the wake of an EU foreign ministers' decision in March to strengthen the EU's presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
The move also follows Ashton's recent visit to Banja Luka where she talked leaders out of holding a referendum on the Bosnian judiciary.
Sorensen's appointment comes at a crucial time for the Western Balkans region and BiH in particular, Ashton said in her statement.

Macedonian Parliament Approves New Government
The Macedonian Parliament approved the new government of Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski early Friday. The 18-member government includes 13 representatives of the Together for Macedonia coalition and five members of Ali Ahmeti's Democratic Union for Integration.

By a vote of 72 to 28, the Macedonian Parliament approved the new government of Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski early Friday (1 November). The 18-member government includes 13 representatives of the Together for Macedonia coalition, led by Crvenkovski's Social Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDSM), and five members of Ali Ahmeti's Democratic Union for Integration (DUI).
Addressing parliament before the vote, Crvenkovski promised his government would be open and accountable.
Referring to DUI's participation in the new government, he said it would contribute to restoring stability, co-existence and integration of the country's two ethnic groups.
"A party that won an overwhelming majority of Albanian votes and acquired a strong election legitimacy deserves to share power and responsibility," he said.
He also promised to work for full implementation of the Ohrid framework agreement, which ended last year's ethnic conflict in the country. "The real national and Macedonian interest is not to abandon, revise or obstruct the framework agreement, but on the contrary to implement it fully and on time," Crvenkovski said.
He also pledged that a detailed government programme for the next four years will be presented to parliament and the public, and outlined key areas of focus for the cabinet.
They include fighting organised crime and corruption, reducing poverty, increasing employment opportunities and carrying out reforms in education, health and public administration. EU and NATO integration remain the country's long-term strategic goal, the prime minister said.
Crvenkovski emphasised the need for lasting peace and security in the country as a precondition for achieving governmental goals and for attracting much needed foreign investment to underpin pending reforms.
He added that his cabinet would soon resume negotiations with the IMF and the World Bank to ensure necessary financial support.
Despite the host of problems and challenges facing his government, Crvenkovski expressed optimism about Macedonia's future. "Optimists say Macedonia got its chance during the 15 September elections...
Pessimists say Macedonia got its last chance during the 15 September elections.
Despite the mountain of difficulties, I am confident that Macedonia has a chance."
No Sunday shopping in Croatia
Religious authorities have welcomed a move to restrict business on Sundays, but retailers warn hundreds of jobs may be lost.

Under a new regulation that went into effect this month, Croatian retailers must stay closed on Sundays.
The move was in response to complaints from the Catholic Church, which warned that consumerism was taking over peoples' lives and undermining religion.
Instead of attending Mass, the church warned, Croatian families were heading to the mall.
Indeed, Sunday had become a popular shopping day.
The malls were open late to accommodate the crowds.
All that has now come to an end until the summer season, when the government will relax enforcement of the rule.
According to media reports, no significant increase in church attendance has occurred so far.
However, the regulation is already having an impact on the economy.
With retailers struggling to compensate for lost revenue, potentially massive job cuts may be in store.
Immediately after the new regulation took effect, the Getro retail chain dismissed 200 employees.
The toy merchant Magma, meanwhile, said it would let go more than 150.
Those numbers could rise dramatically.
"If just 3% of the retail workforce is fired, then 10,000 would lose their jobs in Croatia," the national spokesperson for the Italian mall chain Emmezette was quoted as saying.
Industry representatives estimate that Sundays comprise about one fifth of their overall business.
Even if the government intends to continue with the ban, business associations argued, it should at least postpone it for the time being, given the current financial crisis affecting the globe.
As a result, Sunday shoppers are now limited to buying basic groceries at food stands, or patronising gas stations and small stores located in bus or rail terminals.
The national TV network, HTV, has been airing complaints from disgruntled consumers, who say they have to drive miles to pick up a loaf of bread.
Newspapers now distribute pouches of coffee with their Sunday editions, hoping to attract more readers.
Hague prosecutors consider combining Karadzic, Mladic trials
THE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The Hague tribunal prosecutor's office is mulling whether to combine the trial of former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic with that of former Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic, Frederick Swinnen, political adviser to the prosecutor, said on Monday (May 30th).
He pointed out that all options are under consideration at the moment, but no decision has been made.
Karadzic's war crimes trial started in 2009 while Mladic's extradition to The Hague is pending.
A court in Serbia on Tuesday rejected an appeal filed by Mladic's lawyer, Milos Saljic, who said his client is too ill to stand trial. (Beta, B92, Tanjug, Politika - 30/05/11)
Amid Turkish reforms, terrorists still defiant
With the authorities becoming more open to Kurdish concerns, has the PKK's terror campaign lost its rationale?
By Ayhan Simsek for Southeast European Times –31/03/08

Even as it pursues a military response to Kurdistan Workers' Party terrorism, Turkey's government has pledged a new openness towards its ethnic Kurdish citizens.
Days after a limited ground offensive against PKK bases in northern Iraq, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced an ambitious new plan to boost economic prospects in the mainly Kurdish-populated southeast of Turkey, including investments of up to $15 billion.
He also pledged to launch a new public television station that will broadcast in Kurdish, and reminded PKK members of amnesty legislation that offers lesser sentences or early release for those who surrender and provide information about the group.
Through such moves, the Erdogan administration hopes to convince Kurds in Turkey that Ankara is addressing their concerns, while at the same time curbing the appeal of the PKK.
However, the terror organisation has fought back, scorning the effort and arguing that its lethal brand of "revolution" remains the only real option.
Erdogan's social economic programme is nothing but a "continuation of the policy of denying the Kurdish reality," said Duran Kalkan, a senior member of the group.
Founded in the 1970s as a Marxist group advocating a "people's republic" in southeastern Turkey, the PKK envisages an independent state for Kurds that would include northern Iraq and parts of Iran and Syria as well.
To win support among Turkey's Kurds for this grandiose vision, the group exploits resentment over economic disparities and government policies aimed at containing Kurdish nationalism.
It also seeks to gain political capital from an ongoing military campaign by Turkey, which has conducted cross-border attacks on PKK bases in northern Iraq.
"The Turkish military will continue its struggle against the PKK, while the government will continue its anti-Kurdish policies in the fields of politics, economics and society," Kalkin said in an interview published on a PKK website.
But are such claims still plausible?
Partly in conjunction with its EU bid, the authorities in Turkey have made concrete moves in recent years to relax limits on minority rights.
For the first time in decades, a political party associated with the Kurdish cause -- and, many in Ankara claim, with the PKK-- has representatives in parliament.
The administration has repeatedly stressed that a military response to separatist terrorism is not enough; the roots of Kurdish frustration must also be addressed.
It is working hard to make the case for a political solution, within the parameters of civil society. And yet the violence, which has claimed more than 37,000 lives over the past quarter-century, continues.

Ceasefires broken as factions disagree
This month, the Kurdistan Democratic Confederation (KCK), an umbrella for various outlawed groups tied to the PKK, called for a conditional ceasefire and dialogue with the Turkish government.
But it also warned of a "decades-long war" if its demands are not met.
While claiming it wants to negotiate, the group also questions the founding treaties and territorial integrity of Turkey, a stance which Turkish officials find totally unacceptable.
The PKK has proclaimed several unilateral ceasefires in the past, but none have been sustained.
Factionalism is partly to blame.
Different groups follow different policies, and some powerful forces within the PKK continue to see violence as the way to achieve their goals.
Even as the KCK issued its call for dialogue, PKK commander Bahoz Erdal, a Syrian citizen, vowed to keep up attacks on Turkish soldiers and other targets.
Kalkin, meanwhile, insisted "the war climate is sustainable and it is the only tool through which Kurds make political gains".
‘PKK in weakest but most dangerous point’
"The PKK is today at its weakest but also the most dangerous point;" says Sedat Laciner, president of the International Strategic Research Organisation.
"Being under heavy pressure, the terrorist group now may try to launch sensational attacks, also by using suicide bombers that would show its strength."
Turkey has conducted military operations against PKK terrorists in northern Iraq since December and in February it launched an eight-day ground offensive, killing at least 240 terrorists, according to the General Staff.
A successful military campaign combined with well-orchestrated diplomacy has cut off the logistical and financial sources of the PKK, Laciner says.
In addition, he adds, the group is now isolated politically.
As a result, it may now aim -- as it has done in the past -- to seek the support of global or regional players, which could use it as a sort of "subcontractor" for their regional policies.
The PKK is able to survive in part because of its octopus-like structure, with criminal activities extending throughout the region and Europe.
According to the US State Department's April 2007 Country Reports on Terrorism, the organisation finances its operations through drug and people smuggling in Europe, as well as through conventional fundraising among sympathizers.
Many security experts, both at home and internationally, have long argued that the nature of the PKK threat makes it inadvisable to rely solely on a military answer.
Rather, Turkey must continue to work with other countries, particularly in Europe, to cut off funding and recruitment.
At home, meanwhile, the government must work to convince Kurds to place their trust in civil society and the rule of law.
Socioeconomic underdevelopment is one of the woes which the PKK has fed on in the past.
Now Prime Minister Erdogan is leading an aggressive $15 billion plan to boost investment and economic prospects in southeast Turkey as a key element in the broader fight against terrorism.
Another grievance is Turkey's track record in the past of emphasizing security at the expense of human rights.
The sense that Kurds are discriminated against and lack self-determination has helped the PKK gain traction over the past two decades.
Until recently, even the idea of Kurdish-language radio and TV programming was controversial in Turkey.
In 2004, a limited amount of Kurdish language broadcasting was introduced.
The Erdogan admininstration says it plans to go even farther.
A special public television station will broadcast not only in Kurdish, but also Arabic and Farsi.
The prime minister insists that his government will proceed with new reforms. He has also instructed one of his deputy prime ministers to spend time in the region and gain a clearer picture of expectations there.

DTP views government programme as 'insufficient'
Despite its efforts, however, the Turkish government still faces scepticism.
The pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) has said it is unimpressed.
"We should first sit down and talk without any restriction," said Sirri Sakık, an influential DTP deputy.
"If the AKP government is sincere in its efforts to solve the Kurdish problem, let us go for a referendum and ask the demands of the Kurdish people."
The DTP demands Turkey's recognition of the Kurds' identity in its constitution and some sort of autonomy in the southeast.
Because of the similarities between its platform and the PKK's demands, it has proved impossible for a dialogue to develop between the government and Turkey's main Kurdish party.
Especially in the context of PKK terrorism, Erdogan faces strong public pressure urging him not to have anything to do with the DTP.
He recently dismissed a request by party members to meet with him, and said he would not do so until they define the PKK as a terrorist group and clearly renounce violence.
Public outrage over PKK violence has been high since last October, when terrorist attacks left at least 47 dead, including 35 soldiers, in only one month.
The conflict has claimed more than 37,000 lives since 1984.
There is growing evidence, meanwhile, that the DTP's failure to separate itself from the PKK is undermining the party's base among ethnic Kurds.
In November 2007, the Metropoll research group conducted an opinion survey in the southeast.
More than a third of those polled (35.1%) said the DTP doesn't represent ethnic Kurds, while only 38.6% said it represents them fully.
According to Metropoll, the DTP "has built its political legitimacy on the democratic rights of the region's population and on solving the Kurdish issue.
But they have had to face heavy negative criticism due to the recent terrorist actions." One of the main reasons, according to the researchers, is the party's failure to call the PKK a terrorist organisation.
The survey found little support for PKK goals.
A majority (64.5%) opposed the creation of a Kurdish state in northern Iraq, and an overwhelming 95.2% said they would rather stay in Turkey than go live in such a state.
Over half of the survey respondents (51.5%) said a cross-border action against PKK bases in northern Iraq is necessary.
Asked who their favourite politician is, nearly 60% of respondents named Prime Minister Erdogan.
Sixty-five percent said that they voted for the AKP during the last elections, and even more (68.3%) said they would do so again.
The research team cautioned, however, that these figures differ from actual election turnout. Some respondents may not have wished to acknowledge supporting the DTP, the researchers said.
Macedonia intensifies anti-corruption efforts
In one of its effort to comply with NATO's provisions for accession, Macedonia is conducting a police operation aimed at combating corruption.
So far, 60 toll operators have been convicted based on evidence from the operation.

In 2008, Macedonia will continue to boost its fight against corruption -- as requested by NATO -- in order to press forward on the road to its Euro-Atlantic accession.
One of the country's highest profile anti-corruption efforts is a continuing police operation code-named "Snake's Eye", which resulted in the arrest of 68 toll operators whom prosecutors say made an estimated 5m euros in illegal profits in five months.
Sixty of the former employees of Makedonija Pat -- the company responsible for maintenance of Macedonia's road network -- were convicted of felonies.
Two additional suspects remain at large.
The operation began in April 2007 as part of Macedonia's effort to combat corruption.
The arrests occurred after undercover police officers collected evidence by posing as taxi and truck drivers while covertly taping toll operators, their supervisors and controllers as the officers passed through toll gates.
In some cases, toll operators made arrangements with drivers and lifted the gate for half the amount of the toll, which they kept for themselves.
At booths where cameras were installed, toll operators gave drivers a blank piece of paper to simulate giving a bill.
The interior ministry estimates the operators collected about 5m euros from toll booths in Skopje, Tetovo, Gostivar and Veles based on electronic records of the flow of vehicles during the five-month timeframe.
The scheme was so profitable that toll collectors bribed Makedonija Pat supervisors to be assigned to lucrative toll booths.
The amounts paid for such favours were between 3,000 and 15,000 euros, depending on the profitability of the booth.
Snake's Eye has been the most extensive and longest-running operation involving the most officers to date in Macedonia and will continue, Interior Minister Gordana Jankulovska said.
Additionally, the Public Revenues Office will start to investigate the origin of property of the arrested operators.
This is the second such operation aimed at combating so-called small corruption, which -- despite the name -- makes sizable profits.
The first operation took place in February when police arrested about 30 border crossing officials who charged small amounts -- 5 to 10 euros -- for goods trafficking or easy entrance to or exit from the country.
Most were sentenced to several years in prison.
The European Commission November 2007 report "EC: Macedonia with Substantial Economic Advancement" praised the government's anti-corruption efforts.
"Progress was made in anti-corruption policy and measures.
The legal and institutional framework was strengthened and strong political commitment yielded some results.
There were court decisions in a number of high profile cases, including those of a former deputy minister, a former customs director, judges, lawyers, notaries, and police officers," the report said.
Additionally, Macedonia moved up 20 positions to 84th in Transparency International's ranking of corruption level perceptions for 2007.
Balkans again bask in the spotlight at Cannes Film Festival
A number of regional filmmakers and actors won awards and nominations at the latest edition of the prestigious film festival in Cannes.

Romanian cinema won an award at the Cannes International Film Festival for the second consecutive year, with Marian Muresan's "Megatron" taking the Palme D'Or for Best Short Film. The 31-year-old director said that he expected an award, because the jury and the audiences were attracted to the movie.
"I expected it somehow.
I believed we had some chance to win," Muresan said of his film, which beat out eight others.
This is the third Palme D'Or for a Romanian short film, after Ion Popescu Gopo's "A Brief History" and Catalin Mitulescu's "Traffic".
Muresan has already participated in several international competitions with his films "The Amateur", "Family Portrait" and "Happy Birthday".
The 15-minute-long "Megatron" tells the story of an eight-year-old village boy who goes with his mother to a Bucharest McDonald's for his birthday.
Once in Bucharest, the boy looks for his father.
The story -- depicting a journey to Bucharest that slowly turns into a journey in search of a father -- has only two characters, the boy and the mother, played by Maxim Trinu and Gabriela Crisu.
The movie premiered in Romania at the 7th Transylvania International Film Festival.
The Best Director award went to Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan for his family drama, "Three Monkeys".
This is Ceylan's third award at the French festival after he received the 2003 Jury Grand Prize for "Distant" and the 2006 FIPRESCI Movie Critics' Award for "Climates", according to the Turkish Daily News.
"I am dedicating this prize to my lonely and beautiful country, which I passionately love," he said after receiving the prize from actress Faye Dunaway.
"The film is about life, about one's inner world, about many things," explained Ceylan, director of six films so far.
The International Critics' Week Grand Prize went to Bosnian director Aida Begic's first film, "Snow", a Bosnia and Herzegovina-Germany-France-Iran co-production.
It deals with the aftermath of a Balkan war in an isolated and conflict-ravaged mountainous village.
Last but not least, Kosovo-born actress Arta Dobroshi earned a nomination for Best Actress for her role in "Lorna's Silence", produced by Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardennes, who won for Best Screenplay.
The film explores the difficult path of an Albanian girl in Belgium striving to obtain citizenship while making compromises.
Tensions simmer as Kosovo's constitution goes into effect
"All institutions in Kosovo from today will function in accordance with our constitution.
This will be beyond doubt," said Prime Minister Hashim Thaci.

Kosovo's first constitution became effective on Sunday (June 15th), 119 days after Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia.
The constitution defines Kosovo as a sovereign parliamentary republic and an indivisible democracy.
Kosovo shall have no territorial claims against and shall seek no union with any state or part of any state, the document says.
"The enactment today of the constitution marks the completion of the cycle of building the state," President Fatmir Sejdiu said at a ceremony in Pristina on Sunday. "The constitution is the main compass ... for our path."
"All institutions in Kosovo from today will function in accordance with our constitution.
This will be beyond doubt," said Prime Minister Hashim Thaci, calling on all citizens and institutions to help implement the document.
"With this constitution we have achieved our obligations as a state," said Parliament Speaker Jakup Krasniqi. "Without the implementation of the constitution on the whole territory of Kosovo, we cannot speak of absolute independence."
The adoption of the constitution represents the second historic moment for Kosovo after the proclamation of independence from Serbia on February 17th.
Forty-three UN member states recognise Kosovo's independence, but Serbia rejects its secession as illegitimate and wants more negotiations on its status.
Even as the constitution was receiving praise, tensions simmered.
The question still remains over which international body will take the reins there.
Although the new EU mission, EULEX, was to begin operations Sunday, obstacles have kept it from doing so.
EU envoy to Kosovo Pieter Feith said he is confident that the Union will deploy its police mission by October and that the UN will remain in Kosovo during this transition period.
However, he warned that much depends on co-operation from Serbia.
Serbia and Russia insist that the EU mission is illegal because the Security Council has yet to approve it.
Furthermore, "Serbia does not accept the proclamation of Kosovo's constitution as a legal fact," said Serbian President Boris Tadic. .
Serbia regards Kosovo as a southern province and is defending its own territorial integrity by diplomatic means, not by force, Tadic said, calling the new charter "a political event with ... harmful consequences".
Serbia's opposition to the EULEX mission leaves the UN in charge of functions such as policing and the EU struggling to deploy police officers, judges and customs officers whose housing remains occupied by UN staff members.
"We now have a situation with one lame-duck authority and its successor unable to take over," said the International Crisis Group's Kosovo project director, Alex Anderson. "This risks unraveling key institutions like the police and judiciary and undermining a fragile democracy."
In Mitrovica meanwhile, Serbian Minister for Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic said Kosovo Serbs will establish a separate parliament in two weeks, in defiance of the new constitution.
Kosovo's agreement with IMF at risk
PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Kosovo is at risk of breaking its agreement with the IMF less than two years after gaining membership.
The deterioration in relations stems from the government ignoring IMF recommendations to lead development policies that would spur economic growth. On Tuesday (May 31st), media quoted a blog by the former head of the economic unit at the International Civilian Office (ICO), Andrea Capusella, where he said that Kosovo's programme with the IMF is off track, describing it as a failure for the country.
According to Capusella, it is rare that governments breach their commitments to the IMF.
He also said the IMF is expected to officially announce the break of the agreement with Kosovo.
Salaries of most public sector employees have risen since January, as promised by the ruling Democratic Party during the December elections campaign. (Express, Zeri, Koha Ditore - 31/05/11)
Athens Mayor: Olympics Preparations on Track
Athens Mayor Dora Bakoyanni said preparations for the Summer Olympics are on track, expressing confidence that the planned security measures will ensure the safety of the Games.

All preparations for the Summer Olympics are on track, Athens Mayor Dora Bakoyanni said in Washington on Monday (7 June), 67 days before the official start of the Games.
She voiced confidence that the security plan put in place will ensure the safety of this year's biggest sports event.
"We believe whatever can be done as preparations for security, we did it, and we hope everything will go well," Bakoyanni said at the Western Policy Centre, which hosted a special forum on the Athens Olympics on Monday. "In this insecure world, Athens will probably be the most secure city in August 2004."
Greece has allocated a budget of nearly 6.9 billion euros to prepare for the two-week Games, which open on 13 August.
Of that amount, a record 1 billion euros have been earmarked for the biggest ever-Olympic security plan.
The AP quoted her as saying 95 per cent of the sports venues are now ready.
The projects that still need to be finished mostly involve landscaping.
"The other things are on schedule and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is happy with the way things are going," she said.
IOC Co-ordinating Committee President Dennis Oswald echoed Bakoyanni's words in an interview for Sky Radio in Athens on Monday, saying that he is satisfied with the level of co-operation and that all projects would be completed on time.
Bakoyanni arrived on a two-day visit to the United States to review the security arrangements with State Department officials and lawmakers.
Following talks with her on Monday, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage expressed appreciation for Greece's close co-operation with international efforts to ensure a safe Olympics.
The United States is a member of a seven-nation advisory group that also includes Australia, Britain, France, Germany, Israel and Spain.
The countries are assisting Greece in Olympic security preparations.
The Greek Ministry of Public Order is responsible for ensuring the safety of this first summer Olympics since the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States. A special unit has been put in place under the comprehensive security plan, which also envisions the deployment of up to 70,000 military, police and coastguard personnel.
They will be backed NATO air and sea patrols.
Meanwhile, Greece's Olympic security team set out Monday on a four-day tour of the country, led by Public Order Minister George Voulgarakis.
"The implementation of the [security] plan is starting now," Voulgarakis said in a statement. "We want to activate all procedures to take the country into the Olympic period proper."
Ahead of the Games, Greek officials have stepped up their co-operation with counterparts from neighbouring Bulgaria, Albania and Turkey to ensure that trafficking routes on both sides of the borders are sealed off.
Croatia's Grabar-Kitarovic to take NATO post
ZAGREB, Croatia -- Former Foreign Minister Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic has been appointed as the NATO secretary-general's assistant for public diplomacy, local media reported on Wednesday (March 30th).
Still unclear is when she will assume the new post and who will replace her as Croatia's current ambassador to the United States. (Hina, Vecernji List, tportal.hr, Jutarnji List - 30/03/11)
Turkey's Expectations High for Athens Olympics
Wrestling and weightlifting have traditionally been Turkey's strongest Olympic sports, but this year the country is also hoping for medals in track and field.
All eyes are on 1500m star Sureyya Ayhan, nicknamed "Girl of the Wind".

Turkey is sending its largest team ever to the Summer Olympics, which open in neighbouring Greece next week.
Sixty-seven Turkish athletes are going, compared to 58 at Sydney in 2000.
They will compete in aquatics, archery, athletics, boxing, judo, sailing, shooting, taekwondo, weightlifting and wrestling.
Expectations are higher this time.
All eyes will be on 1500m star Sureyya Ayhan, the most famous Turkish athlete in history and the first to reach international status.
Her short career is full of successes. Last year, the 26-year-old brought Turkey its first ever medal at the World Athletics Championships in Paris.
She subsequently achieved a personal best of 3.55.33 seconds at the 2003 Golden League in Brussels, and came in first at the IAAF World Athletics Final in Monaco. During 2003, she was in first place for the 1500m in both the European and world rankings.
Referred to by Turks as "Golden Girl" and "Girl of the Wind", she is expected to win a gold medal in Athens.
Also favoured for a medal is Elvan Abeylegesse, who achieved a world record (14.24.68) in the 5000m two months ago in the Golden League in Norway -- another first in Turkish sports history.
Turkish Athletics Federation President Mehmet Yurdadon, a former long-distance runner, has said he expects as many as five medals in track and field, including gold for Ayhan and Abeylegesse.
"Esref Apak in hammer throw is also a favourite.
Other athletes could win one or two medals," he says.
If he's right, Turkey will medal in Olympic track and field for the first time since Ruhi Sarialp's gold-winning triple jump in 1948.
Wrestling and weightlifting are the two sports in which Turkey has achieved the greatest success over the years.
In wrestling, which Turks call "the sport of ancestors", Hamza Yerlikaya (84kg) is strongly favoured.
He won gold at Atlanta and Sydney, was twice crowned world champion, and is a six-time European champion.Another prominent Greco-Roman style athlete, Seref Eroglu (66kg) is expected to medal.
He has been world champion once and European champion three times.
In free style, the Turkish team boasts Harun Dogan, world champion in 1999 and in 2002.
Legendary weightlifting star Naim Suleymanoglu paved the way for a younger generation of Turkish weightlifters when he broke world records and won gold at the 1988, 1992 and 1996 Olympics.
This year, ten weightlifters -- six men and four women -- will compete in Athens.
The most popular is Halil Mutlu (56kg) who took home gold medals from Barcelona and Sydney.
Youth and Sports General Director Mehmet Atalay predicts that Mutlu will be the first Turkish athlete to win a medal at Athens, and will inspire the others.
"I believe the Turkish team will have a historic achievement," he says.
Surprises are also possible in sports such as taekwondo, swimming and judo.
Whatever the final medal count, the Olympic Spirit will boost fraternity and peace between the two sides of the Aegean Sea.
Turkey's new top general firm on secularism, nation-state, US ties, EU membership
General Ilker Basbug, new chief of the Turkish General Staff, says a pluralistic democracy requires the preservation of secularism.
He considers Turkish-US relations "excellent" and calls for fair EU treatment of Ankara's membership bid.

"Turkish-American relations are deeply rooted and built on common values," said General Ilker Basbug. [Getty Images]
General Ilker Basbug became chief of the Turkish General Staff last week and gave a key speech to outline his views on secularism, the nation-state and globalisation.
A months-long power struggle in Turkey between the Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party (AKP) government and secularists led by the military focused attention on the turnover of the military's top position.
Basbug, in a long-awaited address, expressed the military's commitment to democracy and democratic principles but raised concern over the increasing Islamisation of society under the AKP.
"Part of our society fears a new cultural identity and lifestyle in Turkey under the domination of religion emerging.
These fears should be taken seriously," Basbug said.
Commander of the Turkish Land Forces in the past two years, he firmly advocates preservation of the secular, unitary character of the Turkish nation-state.
"General Basbug took over the most difficult position at a most difficult time," veteran liberal columnist Mehmet Ali Birand wrote in the daily Milliyet.
Birand credits the general for possessing "outstanding qualifications" at such a time.
According to Birand, Basbug is renowned for his deep knowledge of political-military issues and realism.
During the handover ceremony, the scholarly Basbug cited philosopher Jurgen Habermas in emphasising the need to preserve the nation-state against the challenges of globalisation.
Leading actors of globalisation try to strengthen their national structures to address the challenges of globalisation.
We cannot ignore that this holds true for the United States and the European Union member-states as well, he stressed.
Weighing the nationalism principle and Kurdish issue, Basbug signalled support for expanding cultural rights for Turkey's ethnic Kurds but ruled out any move to confer "group rights", which he said would undermine the nation-state structure.
Like many top-ranking Turkish generals, Basbug has a NATO background.
He served as chief of logistics and infrastructure at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in Mons, Belgium, and as commander of the 1st Armoured Brigade in Istanbul.
During his first address as the top Turkish commander last week, he described military relations with the United States as "excellent" and praised US help in countering the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Army.
"Turkish-American relations are deeply rooted and built on common values," he said.
He had a message for the EU as well.
Basbug called on Brussels to give Ankara the treatment enjoyed by other EU membership candidates.
He pointed to the EU's strategic needs and warned the 27-member bloc's influence would end in the Balkans, falling short of the Caucasus and the Middle East, if it did not admit Turkey.
Besides, he said, Turkey is the most powerful secular democracy in the region.
Italian general takes command of KFOR
"It is the spirit of the ordinary people and of the children who give me hope for the future of Kosovo," said General Xavier de Marnhac on Friday in Pristina in relinquishing command of KFOR.

French General Xavier de Marnhac on Friday handed over the command of KFOR to Italian General Giuseppe Emilio Gay, who becomes the 13th chief of peacekeeping troops in Kosovo.
De Marnhac expressed happiness at having been part of KFOR.
Addressing the people of Kosovo in a speech, he said, "You have continually demonstrated a high degree of patience and maturity during this historical time in Kosovo's future."
He mentioned he visited all parts of Kosovo during his tenure, including the minority areas.
"It is the spirit of the ordinary people and of the children who give me hope for the future of Kosovo," said de Marnhac.
Present at the ceremony were Kosovo's highest officials, representatives of international institutions, diplomats based in Pristina and the commander of the NATO South Wing, Admiral Mark Fitzgerald.
Fitzgerald said NATO will continue to support a peaceful and stable environment in Kosovo, which will promote economic stability and a free and democratic society.
Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu praised KFOR's work.
"The period to come represents the next challenge for Kosovo, in which KFOR has its role in supporting the establishment of the Kosovo Security Force," he said.
"Kosovo is striving to establish its security force, which will serve all its citizens without making ethnic distinctions," said Sejdiu.
De Marnhac predicted the new commander would be highly successful and would witness many changes in his year-long term.
Gay is the third KFOR commander to come from Italy.
KFOR, a NATO-led international force, entered Kosovo on June 12th 1999 under a UN mandate, two days after the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1244.
The official KFOR website indicates that in 2008, a total of 15,000 soldiers from 34 countries serve on the force.
Kosovo Prime Minister Resigns to Face War Crimes Charges at The Hague
Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj left for The Hague on Wednesday, a day after resigning his post.
International officials have praised his decision, saying it is a sign of Kosovo's political maturity.

Former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj left for The Hague on Wednesday (9 March) to face war crimes charges brought by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
He resigned Tuesday after receiving the tribunal's indictment.
According to local reports, Haradinaj boarded a KFOR aircraft at around 11am Wednesday, accompanied by another former Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) member, Lah Brahimaj, who is believed to have been charged along with Haradinaj.
Announcing his decision, the former prime minister called on Kosovo's people to preserve peace and implement standards set by the international community.
"I want you to think of the primary interests of the nation," he said.
Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova expressed hope that his coalition partner would be released and would one day continue to serve his people.
He called for calm, highlighting the importance of security at this time.
Haradinaj, who led operations in western Kosovo against Serbian security forces during the 1998-1999 conflict, denied any wrongdoing.
"I am not responsible for what I am being accused of, and I believe the court will prove this," he said.
According to media reports, he has been charged in connection with the killing of 20 Serbian civilians near his military headquarters.
Haradinaj's decision to withdraw from his executive post won high praise from international officials.
UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen said Haradinaj's decision to co-operate despite maintaining his innocence is a mark of Kosovo's "growing political maturity".
"Thanks to Ramush Haradinaj's dynamic leadership, strong commitment and vision, Kosovo is today closer than ever before to achieving its aspirations in settling its future status.
Personally, I am saddened to no longer be working with a close partner and friend," Jessen-Petersen said.
In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the former prime minister's actions "demonstrate his deep concern for the future of Kosovo and its people". He urged all countries of the former Yugoslavia to arrest and extradite war crimes suspects as a condition for their integration into the Euro-Atlantic institutions.
Britain's Minister for Europe Denis MacShane, meanwhile, said Haradinaj's surrender sends a message to the indictees who continue to hide.
KFOR Commander General Yves de Kermabon joined the appeals for peaceful acceptance of the indictment.
An additional 500 British soldiers were rushed to Kosovo on Tuesday.
"Everything will be done to keep all events under the control. …We will be able to react depending on the situation," de Kermabon said.
Haradinaj, who celebrated his 100th day as prime minister on Tuesday, was focusing on Kosovo's goal of achieving standards set by the UN -- a prerequisite for opening discussions on final status.
Talks could start at the end of the year, provided a review of the progress achieved is positive.
Deputy Prime Minister Adem Salihaj will temporarily take over the prime minister's duties.
According to media reports, current Urban Planning Minister Bajram Kosumi is considered most likely to replace Haradinaj in the long term.

Albania may not be able to realise the projected economic growth target of 6 per cent this year because of the severe energy crisis, the central bank warned.
It urged authorities to take measures and minimise the country's dependence on hydroelectric power, the sole domestic energy source.
Bosnia and Herzegovina's foreign trade gap widened to 2.9 billion euros from January to October 2005, registering an 8 per cent increase year-on-year, according the BiH Central Bank.
In October alone, the foreign trade deficit stood at 347m euros, up by 12 per cent year-on-year.
Romania will receive 49m euros in EU financial assistance to help with the rebuilding of road and railway infrastructure damaged by this summer's heavy flooding, EU Local Policy Commissioner Danuta Huebner announced.
The money will be given through the Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession programme.
Eleven foreign candidates have sent letters of interest in the privatisation of Vojvodjanska Banka, Serbia's fifth largest in terms of assets, Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic announced.
He did not disclose the names of the foreign banks, saying only that four bids came from Greece, two each from Italy and France, one each from Poland and Hungary and one from an Italian-German-Austrian group.
Albania's government and an IMF mission headed by Istvan Szekely have begun preliminary talks on a new agreement.
A three-year, $42.7m Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility programme from the Fund is due to expire this month.
The Croatian company Pliva, the largest pharmaceutical producer in Central and Eastern Europe, closed the first nine months of the year with a loss of $34m.
By comparison, the company recorded a net profit of $107.3m during the same period in 2004.
Pliva attributes the drop to the unsuccessful launch of a United States subsidiary, which the company was forced to sell this spring.
Bulgaria's Parliament adopted changes in the excise tax and personal income tax laws that will take effect in 2006.
Tax rates for fuel, tobacco and alcohol will be increased, and the lowest income tax bracket eliminated.
The European Investment Bank announced it has signed an agreement with two Turkish finance institutions, Kocbank and Koc Finansal Kiralama, on a 100m-euro global loan for financing of small- and medium-sized enterprises in Turkey.
The money is to be used for projects in the industry, tourism and services sector.
World Cup 2010: Greece is everywhere!
The Greek national football team has qualified for the World Cup for the second time in its history.

Ask any fan about Greek football, and the first words you'll hear will be "Euro 2004".
The next will usually be "Otto Rehhagel".
That's the name of the German coach who led the Greek national team to triumph in the European Championships six years ago, and who is now leading them into their second World Cup appearance.
He and the 23 players selected for the roster left Greece on Saturday (June 5th) for Durban, South Africa, where they will spend the next week preparing for the team's opening match against South Korea.
"Othonas", as the Greek press likes to call him, enjoys a complex relationship with fans.
Everyone toasts him for the Euro triumph, even as some criticise his methods.
He has taken heat in the press for his roster of players, for tactical choices on the field, and for spending too much time back in Germany.
But no one can deny his results.
The Greeks have again qualified for a major event, and they did so by beating Ukraine 1-0 on its own turf.
That was sweet payback for losing to Ukraine 1-0 in Athens four years ago, a result which kept Greece out of the World Cup in Rehhagel's homeland.
The 2006 disappointment spurred him to change his methodology and bring new players onboard.
The average player on the current roster is less than 30 years old.
More than half of the 23 players are members of Greece's domestic clubs.
Eight are from Panathinaikos, this year's national champions, while three other teams -- Olympiakos, PAOK and Aris -- provided two each.
Completing the roster are members of European teams, such as Italy's Campionato and Germany's Bundesliga.
Angelos Charisteas, the top scorer in Euro 2004, is returning along with midfielder Kostas Katsouranis, defender Giourkas Seitaridis, keeper Kostas Chalkias and team captain Giorgios Karagounis.
SETimes caught up with members of the Blue/White Beacon Fan Club as they prepared to board flights to South Africa.
They seemed moderately optimistic about the team's prospects.
"What we expect is to see something better," said Theofilos Adamakis. "I would like us to score at least once in order to celebrate, something that we couldn't do in '94; to win one point, something that we also didn't do in '94; to win a game, also something that we didn't manage in '94, and if possible, to qualify for the second round, another thing that we didn't do in '94.
In other words, to take steps forward."
"A good, decent performance; and if we qualify, it will be ideal," he said.
"I believe our presence will be very dynamic," said Triantafylla Serveta, speaking of fellow Greek fans who will be rooting for their team in South Africa.
World Bank urges increased investment in commercial innovation
Warning countries from Central Europe to Central Asia that they are trailing behind most of the developed world in R&D spending, a new World Bank report urges them to take steps to improve the conditions for increased investment in commercial innovation as a tool for promoting growth and reducing poverty.
According to the Bank's experts, it is important to boost the private sector's role, as well as to institute economic incentives, upgrade information infrastructure, and bring about educational reforms.

Countries from Central Europe to Central Asia are lagging behind most of the developed world in R&D spending, according to a recent report from the World Bank.
Average spending on R&D in the region now stands at less than 1 per cent of GDP, well below the EU target of 3 per cent, according to the study, "Public Financial Support for Commercial Innovation".
Furthermore, some two-thirds of research spending in these mostly post-communist countries is covered by public funding, while in Western Europe 65 per cent to 70 per cent of the total comes from the private sector.
In Japan, the private sector's share stands at 80 per cent.
The aim of the report's authors was to offer policymakers in Europe and Central Asia (ECA) options to foster productivity and growth by creating a favourable environment for the application of knowledge in the economy via innovation and learning.
They analysed the various financial instruments for encouraging innovation in the region and recommended reform measures that should be carried out before applying these instruments.
Seven Southeast European (SEE) countries -- Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, Serbia-Montenegro and Turkey -- are among the 25 ECA nations assessed in the report.
The others include 13 former Soviet republics, among them current EU members Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as well as five other former communist countries -- the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia -- which also joined the Union in 2004.
Using a set of Knowledge Economy Indicators (KEI) -- economic incentives, education, innovation system and information infrastructure -- the study ranks countries according to their ability to invest effectively in innovation.
Each country is given a score of 1 to 10 for each indicator and a general KEI score, which determines its ranking.
Of the 25 ECA countries, the top three in terms of the KEI are Estonia with 8.26 points, Slovenia with 7.88 points and Lithuania with 7.17 points.
They are followed by the other five new EU member nations.
Right after them come Croatia with 6.22 points and Bulgaria with 6.19, in 9th and 10th place, respectively.
Of the other SEE countries, Romania is ranked 12th with 5.27 points, Turkey takes the 16th position with 4.73 points and Serbia-Montenegro the 17th with 4.55 points. A score of 3.02 points put BiH in the 23rd position, ahead of Albania, which is second to last among the 25 ECA nations, with 2.99 points.
By comparison, Finland -- one of the top innovation economies in the world -- has a general KEI score of 9.02 points and 9.73 points on innovation and 9.21 points on education.
"Government funds are scarce and should only be used to fund research when the conditions are in place for them to bear fruit," the study's lead author, Itzhak Goldberg, stressed. [World Bank]
SEE countries received mixed scores for specific indicators.
Croatia's highest score of 7.12 points is on innovation, placing it 4th among the 25 ECA countries, ahead of six EU members.
But the country is given only 4.31 points for its economic incentives regime, suggesting a need for improvement in this area.
Bulgaria's best score of 6.73 points is on education, entitling it to a better ranking on this indicator than the other SEE countries, but two places below its position in the general KEI ranking.
Romania, for example, is 12th in the general KEI ranking of the 25 ECA countries, but only 20th in education because of low public spending in this sector.
Turkey's per capita GDP is at the same level as Lithuania and Slovakia, but it is ranked behind these countries on the general KEI index, due to low scores on average years of schooling and mathematical achievement. It is in 24th position on education.
A score of less than 2.50 points on a specific indicator is a sign of bottlenecks in that area.
BiH and Albania, for example, are given only 1.02 points and 1.65 points, respectively, on innovation, while Serbia-Montenegro's worst score of 2.15 points is on the economic incentives indicator.
If governments provide additional funding to encourage innovation without also improving economic incentives, upgrading information infrastructure and reforming education, the money will be wasted, the report noted.
Furthermore, increases in expenditure are unlikely to bring about an improvement unless the private sector begins to plays a bigger role in the process.
Despite large numbers of researchers and a legacy of educational achievement from the communist period, countries in the former Eastern Bloc will not find it easy to translate these potential strengths into commercially successful innovations unless universities and research institutions work seamlessly with the private sector, the World Bank said.

"Government funds are scarce and should only be used to fund research when the conditions are in place for them to bear fruit," the study's lead author, Itzhak Goldberg, stressed.
The availability of incentives to promote collaboration between researchers and the private sector and broad public access to computers and the internet are some of the needed conditions.
The rule of law is also essential, according to Goldberg, as are the protection of intellectual property rights and efforts to fight corruption.
To discuss how the ECA countries can improve their innovation systems and foster better use of knowledge by firms, the World Bank hosted a Knowledge Economy Forum in Prague on 28-30 March.
The three-day event brought together representatives of 27 nations from the region.
"Translating research and development into commercial success is key to achieving sustained, long-term economic growth," Shigeo Katsu, World Bank Vice President for the ECA region, said in his opening remarks at the conference.
"This will require governments in Eastern Europe and Central Asia to stop spending their limited resources on archaic innovation systems and start encouraging private enterprises to step into the breach, as their counterparts do further west."
This does not mean that governments should stop financing research altogether, but that when they allocate public resources for such activities, the focus should be on research by or for private enterprises.
"The more important role for government is to carry out the necessary structural reforms so that investments in research bear fruit," Katsu said.
"Channelling the resources governments save on direct research into education, health and social safety nets would also help by raising labour productivity.
In addition, government needs to facilitate public access to the internet, to encourage accurate financial reporting by firms, and to uphold the rule of law.
The same goes for fighting corruption and enforcing rules to protect intellectual property rights."
Romanian public health care system under fire
More Romanians are turning to the private health care system, due to lack of confidence in the state sector.

When prominent Romanian opera singer Amalia Antoniu was admitted in April to the CFR2 Hospital in Bucharest for minor surgery, she never expected to end up in intensive care, in critical condition, kept alive by machines.
"They [doctors] think she caught an infection in the operating room because she went in there perfectly healthy," her mother explained.
Hours later, at the same hospital, another patient also ended up battling for life.
The investigators concluded the two patients contracted a nosocomial (inter-hospital) infection, caused by a non-sterile environment.
The story drew considerable media attention, and an investigation was launched.
The manager of the hospital, accused of lax management, lost his job.
The maternity- neonatology section, where Antoniu underwent surgery, was temporarily closed.
Four ward heads were dismissed a few days later.
As a result, Prime Minister Emil Boc ordered a thorough evaluation of the almost 400 hospitals in the country.
Those found unfit to function will be turned into asylums, he said.
Specialists have their own explanation for the phenomenon.
In reality, situations as those seen at CFR2 happen every day at public medical institutions in the country," Evenimentul Zilei health editor Geta Roman told SETimes.
"The rules concerning hygiene and sterilisation exist, but they are not [backed] by strict controls, especially in those hospitals controlled by the ministry of transport, where rules more lax than in other similar institutions," she said.
In March, three babies and five mothers contracted a staphylococcus infection in the maternity ward of the CFR2 hospital.
In Suceava County, a patient scheduled for a long-awaited kidney transplant was removed from the list after he was found to have contracted two forms of hepatitis at a public hospital.
Actor Toni Tecuceanu died at the infectious diseases hospital Matei Bals in Bucharest early this year, after being infected with the bacteria Acinetobacter.
Medics' College President Vasile Astarastoaie says there are 10,000 cases of nosocomial infections every year in the country's hospitals, the lowest level in Europe.
But the figure is low, he says, because staffers do not report all the cases, due to possible sanctions.
Vasile Barbu, head of the Association for Patients' Protection, offered SETimes a closer look into this phenomenon.
"We did a study late last year, over October and November, and we came up with sinister results.
Of all the patients we monitored -- patients that had undergone open-thorax surgeries, such as cardiac interventions -- 30% died after leaving the hospitals due to nosocomial infections," he said.
"We also concluded most of the infections originated in the ventilation devices -- the filters and the hoses -- not changed or sterilised," Barbu explained. "We were shocked to see in a hospital in Bucharest that, in the same room, in a corner there were used hoses being washed just with tap water, while in the other corner, just a few meters away, they piled the infected ones."
He said his association, founded in August 2008, is currently providing legal assistance to patients involved in 60 pending cases, while 900 files are in the final pre-court phase.
The organisation will also launch soon an anti-graft campaign in the hospitals, Barbu said.
As they lose trust in state hospitals, Romanians are heading to the private ones.
MedLife, the largest private health care operator in the country, has seen a 40% increase in revenue compared to last year when it registered 26.3m euros in income.
With investments amounting to 15m euros this year, MedLife wants to extend its network of clinics and open its second private hospital in Bucharest.
"I gave birth to a child in a private hospital, even though it cost me [figuratively] an arm and a leg," Diana told SETimes. "After hearing so many unfortunate happenings in the state hospitals, I realised money comes second and health first.
I was terrified by what a friend of mine went through in a public hospital, where her little baby caught a fungus only a few days after being born," she said.
Serbian companies steer clear of stock market
Serbia's financial markets are being undermined by the reluctance of companies to be held accountable for their performance, as well as by the state's willingness to tolerate breaches of the law.
By Georgi Mitev-Shantek for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 27/12/05

Out of 800 shareholding companies listed on the Belgrade Stock Exchange (BSE), only the shares of 34 companies are actually being traded.
Even among these companies, none is willing to rate itself according to the international standards as applied at the BSE.
"Serbian managers do not wish for the public to judge how successful they are," says Gordana Dostanic, director of the Belgrade Stock Exchange.
The managers, she says, know that rising or falling stock prices can serve as a gauge of whether they are doing a good job.
In Serbia, privatisation is half complete, with only large systems and parts of public enterprises remaining.
With less and less room for direct purchase at auctions or tenders, the stock exchange is the place where transfer of ownership should be taking place.
One major obstacle is lack of information.
Investors do not know which shares they can purchase, and shareholders do not know whether to sell their shares and at what price.
The state tolerates breaches of the law that stipulates that shareholding companies must submit information to the Stock Exchange.
Too often, when companies submit reports, they are so slim that investors cannot reach any conclusions.
According to Dostanic, the state must get involved if it wishes for the capital market to develop.
Laws also need to be harmonised, both within the legal system and with the EU.
Shares of the largest state companies need to be on the stock exchange -- including Serbia Telecom, the oil and gas industry, the railway, and the airline company.
Such moves would also help keep foreign investors, who currently account for 60 per cent of the trading on the BSE.
In order for them to remain, they need better market material.
If this does not take place, the newly established private pension funds may have trouble finding something to invest in.
The same goes for the investment funds that could be set up if parliament adopts the necessary legislation.
"In any case, investments are very low, and it would be catastrophic if funds were to be forced to take this small amount of capital elsewhere," Dostanic says.
Neighbouring countries have provided models to follow.
The Zagreb Stock Exchange has exceptional support in Croatia.
National television reports on the stock exchange every evening.
Effective legislation is in place; just as importantly, it is enforced.
If shareholding companies do not place their shares on the stock exchange or do not provide all information, they are liable to face criminal proceedings.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, privatisation is being conducted through the stock exchange, while in Montenegro, the shares of state companies are being traded on the stock exchange.
The same is the case in Bulgaria and Romania.
Wherever a Southeast European government has had a strategy, the financial markets have exhibited significant increases in foreign investments.
Monte Carlo summit focuses on transnational crime
Around 300 political and business leaders gathered in Monaco's capital in November to discuss transnational crime, considered a defining issue of the 21st century.
By Antonela Arhin for Southeast European Times in Podgorica – 27/12/05
Southeast European countries are becoming important partners in combating organised crime by adopting the required European standards, said Deputy Prime Minister of Montenegro Dragan Djurovic. [File]
Transnational crime will be a defining issue of the 21st century -- as important as the Cold War was during the previous century -- according to the organisers of a high level international summit held in Monte Carlo last month.
The 7th International Summit on Transnational Crime brought together about 300 political and business leaders to discuss topics as diverse as international terrorism, mafia networks, the fight against official corruption, money laundering, human trafficking, counterfeiting of registered trademarks and cybercrime.
The event was held under the patronage of HRH Prince Albert II of Monaco.
Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) was the focus of one of the summit's plenary sessions.
Participants gathered to discuss the role of international organisations in promoting rule of law in the country.
Charles Harns Head, of the International Organisation for Migration, spoke about the important link between migratory movements and transnational crime, in BiH and elsewhere.
"The obvious links are in the trafficking in human beings and smuggling of migrants," Head said. "The more subtle linkages concern the general effect of corruption fueled through the influence of transnational organised crime on quality of life and quality of governance in some countries, and resultantly on the inclination of persons to migrate, at times by most any means available, and the susceptibility of these persons to smugglers and traffickers."
Affluent nations must help less prosperous ones build the capacity to manage migration and smash trafficking networks, Head suggested.
To reduce illegal migration, root causes such as lack of development and economic opportunity must also be addressed, he added.
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe Vice President Jean-Charles Gardetto and Helene Bourgade of the European Commission's Security and Migration unit also addressed the BiH session.
At another session, dealing with the role of financial channels in the fight against crime, one of the speakers was Montenegrin Deputy Prime Minister Dragan Djurovic.
Thanks to European integration processes, Djurovic said, Southeast European countries are becoming important partners in combating organised crime by adopting the required European standards.
Montenegro is in the process of shaping its legal and legislative framework for an efficient fight against organised crime and corruption, Djurovic said.
In addition to a criminal code and a law establishing a special prosecutor for organised crime, he noted, the Montenegrin government has also adopted a criminal procedure law and a law on a witness protection programme.
A strategy for the fight against human trafficking, action plan for the drug addiction prevention, and strategy for control and decrease of small-caliber weapons have also been adopted, he said.
The event was opened by Jean-Paul Carteron, chairman of the Monaco World Summit.
The guest speakers at the opening were Slovak Deputy Prime Minister for European Affairs, Human Rights and Minorities Pal Csaky, Croatian Justice Minister Vesna Skare-Ozbolt, Laurent Marcadier, vice president and secretary general at the Court of Paris, and Kiril Bougartchev from the Paris-based law firm Gide Loyrette Nouel.
Turkish intellectuals urge government to scrap laws limiting freedom of expression
Dozens of prominent Turkish intellectuals urged the government Monday to rescind controversial laws that have enabled lawsuits against numerous journalists and writers, including Turkey's most famous novelist.

A group of Turkish intellectuals issued a declaration Monday (26 December), urging the government to rescind laws that limit freedom of expression.
The laws have enabled prosecutors to indict a number of eminent figures in Turkey, including the country's most famous novelist, Orhan Pamuk.
The statement, signed by 169 prominent academics, artists, journalists and writers, including novelist Yasar Kemal and pianist Fazil Say, described the trial against Pamuk as "a grave interference in our country's democratisation process".
On 31 August, the award-winning author of "My Name Is Red" and "Snow," who is also viewed as a possible candidate for the Nobel Prize for literature, was charged with "denigrating Turkish national identity" over remarks he made to a Swiss paper earlier this year about the mass killings of Armenians and Kurds.
Under article 301 of Turkey's new Penal Code, adopted in June, Pamuk faces a prison sentence of between six months and three years if convicted.
As the writer went on trial earlier this month, the court adjourned the proceedings to 7 February.
According to Reuters, Pamuk may also be facing another court case for allegedly insulting the Turkish military in an interview with the German newspaper Die Welt.
Article 301, which replaced article 159 of Turkey's old penal code, makes it a crime to insult "Turkishness", the republic, the parliament, the government, the judicial institutions, the military or security structures.
Monday's declaration also urged authorities to scrap another Penal Code provision envisioning imprisonment of up to 15 years for the dissemination of propaganda via the media against "fundamental national interests" in return for material benefits from foreigners.
A nationalist group known as the Lawyers Unity Association is reportedly behind some of the lawsuits, including one brought against a leading Turkish-Armenian journalist for "denigrating Turkish identity" in remarks he made about a six-month suspended sentence.
"I am surprised by the charges because I am a defendant who has been convicted and what is more natural for a convicted defendant than to appeal and try to influence the court that tries him?" Hrant Dink, editor of the bilingual Turkish-Armenian weekly Agos said in remarks quoted by AFP
Russo-Ukrainian gas deal announced, but EU still wary
Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko will oversee the signing of a new gas contract with Russia that should lead to the resumption of gas supplies to Europe, nearly two weeks after their suspension.

Russia and Ukraine are expected to sign an agreement in Moscow on Monday (January 19th) that should enable the resumption of Russian natural gas deliveries to Europe after 12 days of severe supply disruptions occasioned by a payment dispute.
Officials announced the deal Sunday after ten hours of talks in Moscow between Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Yulia Tymoshenko.
Gazprom of Russia and Naftogaz of Ukraine are to sign it after their experts finalise contract details.
"Once all the documents on gas transit and gas purchases have been signed, gas transit to Europe will be fully restored," Tymoshenko promised on Russian TV.
Talks on a new contract collapsed on December 31st after the two sides failed to agree on the size of Ukraine's unpaid debts and Russia's demands for a higher price in 2009.
Ukraine rejected Moscow's proposed 2009 price of 188 euros per 1,000 cubic metres of gas, proposing 151 euros per 1,000 cubic metres if Moscow would pay higher transit fees for sending gas to Europe via Ukraine.
Gazprom said that, having rejected its offer, Ukraine should then start paying a European-level rate of around 339 euros immediately.
Russia halted gas shipments to Ukraine on January 1st.
Accusing Kiev of "stealing" gas intended for European customers, it then cut off all deliveries to Eastern Europe on January 7th amid bitter cold temperatures.
The move sparked sharp criticism of both countries from the EU and the United States. More than 20 nations have suffered a disruption in gas supplies.
A Kremlin source told reporters that, under Sunday's deal, the new price to be paid by Ukraine will depend on the formula for European consumers, which is pegged to oil prices with a six-month delay.
Russia also agreed to grant Ukraine a 20% discount this year if the transit fee charged by Kiev equals that applied in 2008.
"From January 1st 2010, the European price formula will be applied without a discount," the unnamed official said.
Sunday's agreement met a cautious reception in Europe, where the "gas war" undermined Russia and Ukraine's reputations as reliable partners.
Czech officials, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, and the European Commission cited previous short-lived breakthroughs.
"We remain realistic," Czech Industry Minister Martin Riman said on behalf of the 27-nation bloc. "The only thing that counts for the EU is the resumption of gas supplies."
EU energy officials are meeting in Brussels on Monday to assess the economic damage.
Bulgaria, one of the countries worst hit by the crisis, says its companies suffered direct losses of about 75m euros, while the indirect ones were much higher.
Demonstrators in Sofia on Sunday demanded the reopening of two Soviet-era nuclear reactors in their country.
They were closed in agreement with EU membership preconditions.
Brussels opposes any reopening.
Post-bailout, Greeks disillusioned
Bloggers argue the latest bailout and a misguided sympathy for Greece internationally fail to dispel illusions about a better future.
By Andy Dabilis for Southeast European Times in Athens -- 25/02/12

A 130 billion-euro bailout Greece negotiated with international lenders on Tuesday (February 21st) has not lifted the general sense of gloom.
Similar to the first 109 billion-euro package that prevented the slide to insolvency, this bailout comes with steep cuts and layoffs.
As the government continues to slash pay and benefits -- planning to reduce the minimum wage by 22% with a 32% cut for workers younger than 25 -- many a disillusioned youth say they contemplate leaving Greece.
Amid the feeling of gloom, however, some analysts are hopeful.
I do not know whether we are just buying time. Hopefully, Greece will avoid what seemed to be inevitable," Athens-based Institute for Democracy head of research Antonis Klapsis told SETimes.
Other analysts argue that Greece may still have a chance if the government continues to implement the reforms, but also if the EU changes its focus.
"We have been discussing these reforms without any sense of urgency for the past ten years," Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy Director-General Thanos Dokos told SETimes.
But most bloggers, like Athens University economics professor Yanis Varoufakis, fail to see a light at the end of the tunnel, given Greece's current strategy.
"By now, reasonable people realise that the Greek bailouts do not work despite the Greek government -- its overall incompetence notwithstanding -- having managed to reduce the primary deficit by a whopping 9%," he said.
Even a 240 billion-euro loan package and a debt write-off will fail to arrest the steady rise of the country's debt and the inexorable shrinking of its national income, concluded Varoufakis.
Thanassis Skokos criticised the Greeks' attitude of blaming others for the position they are in and for clinging to notions like "the silly separation of the world into philhellenes and anti-Greeks, humanity's huge debt to the 'cradle of democracy', syrtaki and big-boy Zorba".
"The point is that myths and whatever preserves them are of no use," he said.
Skokos argued the Greeks' predicament is due to choices they have made and any solution will result from making new choices.
"If we do not manage, it is more likely we will be forgotten rather than be saved by armies of philhellenes. Let us abandon delusion once and for all."
Another blogger said Greece has turned into a political stage and an endless madhouse.
He blamed the political elite for the situation, calling them pathologically incompetent liars and narcissists who protect their own interests.
"[Former Prime Minister George Papandreou] dismantled the country but continues to support the great work of PASOK.
Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos, who has doubled property and income taxes, just wants to be prime minister even if there is no country to govern since he himself (helped) dismantle it."
Macedonia and US Sign Agreement on Article 98
Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski, cabinet ministers and all relevant political parties supported the government's decision to sign an agreement barring the extradition of US nationals to the International Criminal Court in The Hague.
By Valentin Nesovski for Southeast European Times in Skopje - 02/07/03
On Tuesday (1 July), Macedonian Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva and US Ambassador to Macedonia Lawrence Butler signed a bilateral agreement barring the extradition of US citizens to the International Criminal Court (ICC).
All relevant Macedonian parties supported and welcomed the decision, and parliament is expected to ratify it.
The ruling SDSM coalition said the agreement was in line with state interests.
The Democratic Union of Integration said relations with the United States were important, and expressed hope that the EU would understand the decision.
The main opposition party, VMRO-DPMNE, said Macedonia had to take into account its own interests during this important historical period.
Macedonia is the 4th country in the region to sign such an agreement with Washington.
The others are Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania. A total of 43 countries worldwide have sealed the accord. The United States insists it is not seeking exemption of its citizens from responsibility for any war crime; rather, it is concerned about the possibility of fabricated or politically motivated trials.
The US role as a strategic partner of Macedonia was seen as crucial, government sources say.
Macedonia has co-operated with the United States in the anti-terror coalition, and Macedonian soldiers have been dispatched to Afghanistan and Iraq.
Washington supports the country's ambitions for full NATO membership.
Skopje was under pressure from the EU not to sign the agreement.
Only a few days before the decision was made, the Council of Europe said such agreements are troublesome legally and harmful politically.
Before signing, the government informed European Commission Chairman Romano Prodi and the EU Ambassador in Macedonia.
Irena Guzelova, spokeswoman for the EU in Macedonia, said the Union could not impose sanctions or measures against Macedonia because the country was not an EU member.
Because the country is a signatory of the Rome International Criminal Court Statute, Macedonia decided not to include reciprocity for Macedonian citizens in the agreement.
In related news, the United States suspended a total of $47m in military aid to more than 30 countries on Tuesday.
The measure was put in place automatically by a US law decreeing the suspension of aid to nations that have not signed agreements on immunity from ICC prosecution by 1 July. Bulgaria, Croatia, and Serbia-Montenegro were the Balkan countries affected by the move.
President George W Bush granted exceptions to Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, and Romania, which signed the agreements but have not yet ratified them.
NATO member states and a group of countries designated as "major non-NATO US allies" were granted automatic exemptions.

Istanbul summit gives birth to a "new IMF"
"All nations need to adapt and change, and the IMF must change too," IMF Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said.
By Ayhan Simsek for Southeast European Times -- 09/10/09

Leaders and policymakers from 186 countries gathered in Istanbul on Tuesday (October 6th) and Wednesday for the IMF-World Bank annual meetings, aimed at seeking "exit strategies" from the global economic turmoil.
Discussions on reforming the IMF, the world's biggest lender, and the social impacts of the financial crisis, were the major topics.
The IMF policy steering committee agreed on bold reforms that would transform the Fund with a new mandate to be more effective in preventing financial crises, to put more trust in borrowers and give more voting power to under-represented countries.
The Istanbul decisions also foresee more flexible credits to developing countries and new multilateral surveillance in the global financial system.
The Fund failed to prevent the global financial crisis, and had long been criticised by borrower countries who say the IMF was ignoring its larger role in the global financial system, as well as the social responsibilities of their national governments.
IMF Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn has admitted past mistakes, but said the Fund has also learned lessons from history.
The IMF's active role and global co-operation prevented the world from a far worse crisis, and leaders should now seize the opportunity to change and shape a post-crisis world, he said.
"All nations need to adapt and change, and the IMF must change too," Strauss-Kahn said.
Huge protests in Istanbul streets
While a record number of participants were discussing new policies during the meetings, thousands of protestors took the streets in Istanbul, protesting IMF policies.
Anti-globalisation and anarchist groups from Europe joined the Turkish protestors, and in some places demonstrations turned violent, with minor radical groups smashing bank windows and stoning security forces.
Police used tear gas and detained dozens.
Turkey has been the IMF's biggest borrower this decade, drawing about 28 billion euros, but the Fund is highly unpopular in Turkey, with trade unions and politicians blaming the organisation for imposing policies that cuts jobs and social benefits.
Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has been negotiating with the IMF for more than a year for a follow-up agreement, but has yet to reach a deal.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said this week that an agreement for a 7 billion-euro loan will be concluded soon.
Erdogan, who hosted the meetings in Istanbul, pointed out some of the social impacts of the global crisis and called for world leaders and policy makers to turn the 21st century into a period of opportunities rather than a period of new challenges.
Warning of instability
As part of the Istanbul meetings, the IMF announced its new projections for the world economy, which showed that the recession is coming to an end.
Recovery will likely be slow and fragile, with continued risks of growing unemployment and poverty.
According to the Fund's projection for emerging European economies, the category in which most of the South European countries are analysed, the 2009 growth rate will be -6.6%, but it is expected to grow to 1.7% in 2010.
However, Strauss-Kahn warned that many countries will experience rising unemployment through 2010.
In low-income countries, 90 million people are expected to be pushed into extreme poverty.
"With weak social safety nets, we are talking not only about higher unemployment or lower purchasing power, but life and death itself.
If we do not act, we could see social unrest, political instability, or war," he told meeting participants.
Unbowed Croatia puts in strong effort against Brazil
In its opening match at the 2006 World Cup, the Croatian squad fought shoulder to shoulder with tournament favourites Brazil but ended a goal short.

Croatia put in a valiant effort in its opening 2006 World Cup match Tuesday (13 June), but a strike by Kaka in 44th minute gave highly favoured Brazil their first three points on the road to defending their title.
Some 72,000 fans at Berlin's Olympiastadion enjoyed a quality performance by some of the world’s finest players as the Vatreni gave the Brazilian stars a run for their money.
With the first half a salvo of attempts from both sides, Brazil gained an advantage in shots on target.
Then, just as halftime approached, Kaka demonstrated why he is one of the brightest stars in football today.
With a minute to go, he overcame Croatian keeper Pletikosa, who was unable to save his net from a top left-hand projectile Kaka sent from outside the penalty area.
The second half began and ended with strikes by Croatian players.
All they needed was a little luck to equalize in the only statistical category where the Brazilians outplayed them -- goals.
It didn't happen.
Prso, Klasnic, Olic, Babic and Kranjcar all had their chances, but all failed to beat Brazilian goalkeeper Dida.
Meanwhile his Croatian counterpart, Stipe Pletikosa, making his 50th appearance for his team, came under intense pressure. Just after the 60th minute, Pletikosa made the best save of the match when he caught a header attempt by Ronaldinho.
In the 41st minute, Croatian coach Kranjcar was forced to change his captain, Niko Kovac, due to an injury.
Later on, Kranjcar made another substitution as Olic replaced Klasnic in the 56th minute.
On the other side, Brazilian coach Pareira put on Robinho 21 minutes before the end of the game, replacing Ronaldo -- who was far from the level that earned him the title of world's best player a couple years ago.
Brazil now has won a record eight consecutive matches, a World Cup record.
Kaka earned the title "Man of the match", not just for his admirable goal and an excellent try in the 74th minute, but for the constant threat he represented for the Croatian net.
"In addition to the fact that the team hasn't played a lot together, we faced an adversary that was good...and marking very well, with energy.
I think the game was balanced, we had more shots on goal but we had a certain difficulty imposing our own rhythm," Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira said after the match.
In first Group F match on Monday Australia beat Japan 3-1.
Next Sunday, Brazil will take on group leaders Australia, while the Croats will have chance to salvage their campaign in 90 minutes against Japan.
Respect for Ethnic Diversity Key for Peace in Kosovo, Says Annan
Concrete action is needed to prevent a repeat of the mid-March violence in Kosovo and to rebuild ethnic confidence in the province, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said in a new report.
Extremism must not be tolerated, he stressed, and violence will not be rewarded.

UN Secretary General Kofi Annan told the Security Council "forward momentum must be regained, and extremism must not be accommodated" in Kosovo. [AFP]
The root causes of the mid-March violence in Kosovo must be addressed, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has said, calling on ethnic Albanian leaders to take concrete action to prevent a repeat of ethnic clashes.
The violence was a serious setback for Kosovo and such acts will not help solve its future status, the UN chief warned.
The onslaught was "an organised widespread and targeted campaign" to drive out Kosovo's Serb, Roma and Askhali communities, Annan said in his latest report to the UN Security Council on UNMIK, released Wednesday (5 May).
Nineteen people were killed and nearly 1,000 were injured during the two days of riots, which also led to the destruction or damage of hundreds of homes and Serbian religious sites.
The events seriously affected the process of normalisation and reconciliation in the province and threaten to destabilise the region, Annan said.
Furthermore, the violence has raised doubts that standards set by the international community for Kosovo will be implemented within the envisioned timetable.
The riots also indicate that the international community must show stronger determination to ensure Kosovo's path of coexistence and reconciliation.
Criticising the Kosovo Albanian leaders for their lackluster condemnation of the violence, Annan reminded them that, as representatives of the province's majority, they are obliged to ensure that the rights of all ethnic groups are protected.
"Kosovo Albanian leaders have criticised the violence only reluctantly and ambiguously, particularly that against Serbs," Belgrade-based Radio B92 quoted the report as reading.
Annan said the leaders should take concrete steps to prevent a new outburst, such as bringing the perpetrators to justice and disciplining politicians who may have participated in, fomented or ignored the violence.
Most importantly, according to the UN chief, the events underscore the need to address the root causes that led to the violence.
"Forward momentum must be regained, and extremism must not be tolerated," Annan said. "There could be no peaceful and prosperous future for Kosovo without respect for the diversity of its people -- violence will not be rewarded."
In other news, UNMIK head Harri Holkeri reiterated during a meeting with Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica on Wednesday that the security of the Serbian and other ethnic minorities in Kosovo is a top priority issue for the UN administration.
Holkeri also briefed him on the status of the investigation into the March violence.
More than 260 people have been arrested in connection with the events.
About 50 have reportedly been charged.
Prosper Says Serbia-Montenegro Should Move Past War Crimes
US Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues Pierre-Richard Prosper, on a visit to Serbia-Montenegro, has reiterated Washington's commitment to bring all war criminals from the Balkan conflicts to justice.

During his talks with Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica on Wednesday (24 August) in Belgrade, US Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues Pierre-Richard Prosper stressed again that Serbia must fully co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal by resolving remaining cases.
"I hope this country (Serbia-Montenegro) will be able to move past war crimes and atrocities committed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia," Prosper said during a visit to a centre for refugees and displaced persons in Pancevo, a town near Belgrade.
Accompanying him was Michael Polt, the US ambassador to Serbia-Montenegro.
Prosper also said the United States acknowledges Serb sacrifices during the period of conflict.
"We are here to say that Serbs have truly suffered.
We know that many Serbs were persecuted, killed, raped, that many had their homes destroyed or were forced to flee," he declared before the assembled refugees.
Saying that his country empathises with the victims and their families, he stressed that those responsible for war crimes must be held accountable for their actions, either before The Hague tribunal or before domestic courts.
Trying the cases in domestic courts would enable the local population to be included in the process of bringing war criminals to justice, he added.
"The United States wants to see Serbia and Montenegro moving towards the EU, to see a world where refugees will be able to rebuild their lives.
You can rely on the United States as a partner and friend there," Prosper told the refugees.
Kostunica, in talks with Prosper, underlined the need "to round off co-operation with The Hague tribunal" for war crimes.
"We are continually working on solving the remaining cases ...
During this year, our country has made significant progress in co-operation with The Hague tribunal, which is confirmed by the fact that a large number of suspects voluntarily surrendered to the tribunal," Kostunica said.
Thursday in Belgrade, Prosper meets with Serbian war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic.
The UN tribunal seeks eight more indictees from Serbia and Republika Srpska (RS), chief among them Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic.
Serbian and RS authorities claim no knowledge of their whereabouts.
They also claim that some indictees are hiding in Russia.
Central, Southeast European Countries Plagued by Floods
Flooding this week reportedly has killed a total of 34 people in Central and Southeast European countries, including Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania.

A total of 34 people have been killed by floods that hit countries in Central and Southeast Europe this week, including Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania.
The death toll is likely to rise when the missing are accounted for, authorities said Wednesday (24 August).
Both Romania and Bulgaria already have been hit by successive waves of floods since April.
The latest inundation reportedly has had the severest effect on Romania, with 25 people dead and more than 2,000 homes submerged in as many as 21 counties.
In Croatia, meanwhile, authorities declared an emergency Wednesday in two regions after the river Mura overflowed its banks, damaging homes, crops and infrastructure.
More than 300 rescue workers were distributing food and other aid to people in flooded areas in Croatia's west and east, according to the AP.
Officials in Bulgaria are still trying to cope with the effects of earlier flooding, which killed 26, left around 14,000 homeless and ruined crops in many areas.
Vital infrastructure has also been destroyed; damage estimates are in the range of 175m euros.
The state railway company has sustained losses of about 78m euros.
"The state is absolutely unprepared for a disaster of this size," the BBC quoted Krasen Stanchev, the head of the Institute of Market Economy think tank, as saying Wednesday. "There still is the old system of central planning in place, whereby all the decisions have to come from the top and the interests of those using the water resources are not protected. Since the 1970s until now, no money has been used to keep dykes and bridges in good condition.
Now the government is doing the only thing it can -- spend money from the state reserve."
Finance Minister Plamen Oresharski has indicated that he will seek the IMF's approval for channeling part of Bulgaria's budget surplus -- which now stands at half a billion euros -- towards recovery efforts.
A government official said Wednesday that Bulgaria has also asked the EU for additional financial support to help deal with the aftermath of the disaster.
The country, which is scheduled to join the EU in January 2007 along with Romania, first sought the 25-nation bloc's help in July, asking for more than 200m euros.
"We have sent a second application to the EU updating the damage estimates from the floods which happened in early August," Reuters quoted Deputy Finance Minister Kiril Ananiev as saying Wednesday. "It is clear that with the damages from the recent heavy rains, the cost will easily exceed 500m euros."
Albania’s Gjirokastra Included in World Heritage List
The southern Albanian town of Gjirokastra, considered a rare example of a well-preserved Ottoman town, was among 17 cultural sites added to UNESCO's World Heritage List in July.

UNESCO has included the southern Albanian town of Gjirokastra on its World Heritage List.
The town, located in the Drinos river valley, is known as Albania's "museum city".
It is considered a rare example of a well-preserved Ottoman town, built by farmers with large estates.
Gjirokastra was one of 17 cultural sites added to the list in mid-July by the World Heritage Committee, chaired by Themba Wakashe, South Africa's deputy director-general for heritage and national archives.
A 13th-century citadel provides the focal point of the town, which contains outstanding examples of the kullë, or tower house -- a type of building that emerged in the 17th century and is characteristic of the Balkan region.
A kullë has a tall basement, a first floor for use in the cold season, and a second floor for the warm season.
Interiors, particularly in the tourist zones, feature rich decorative details and painted floral patterns.
The town also retains a bazaar, an 18th-century mosque and two churches of the same period.
The town developed after World War II, and today is an economic, cultural, and educational centre of southern Albania.
Gjirokastra is not the first location in Albania to make the UNESCO list. In 1992, the ancient settlement of Butrint, dating back to the 6th century BC, was added.
In all, the World Heritage List now numbers 812 sites, including 628 cultural, 160 natural and 24 mixed sites in 137 states.
In July, three countries -- Bahrain, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Moldova -- joined the list for the first time.
One of the immediate effects will be a financial boost.
Local authorities in Gjirokastra will have the right to request funds from the state and from international donors in order to protect its cultural assets.
Gjirokastra is also the birthplace of the well-known Albanian novelist and poet, Ismail Kadare, winner of this year's Man Booker International Prize.
He has described his hometown as "overshadowed by a great castle, as daunting as it was impressive ... its prison-tower radiated power and menace in every direction".

The two discussed the Balkans, especially the Kosovo situation.
Rupel, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency until July, said the secretary-general has a few "new ideas that we in the EU will take into account".
He said talks between Belgrade and Pristina could resume on certain issues but added that the most important goal would be preventing Kosovo's partition.
Macedonian Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki was in Ireland on Monday (April 14th) for one day.
Milososki met with Irish Minister of European Affairs Dick Roche and signed an agreement to prevent double taxation between Macedonia and Ireland.
Milososki participated in a meeting of the European People's Parties, which also was attended by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Parliament President Hans-Gert Poettering.
German President Horst Koehler arrived on Monday (April 14th) for a three-day official visit to Croatia.
Koehler is scheduled to meet with his Croatian counterpart, Stipe Mesic, and Prime Minister Ivo Sanader.
The German president also will participate in a Croatian-German state forum and meet Parliament Speaker Luka Bebic.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan arrived in London on Monday (April 14th) for a three-day official visit.
He and his British counterpart, David Miliband, will discuss bilateral relations and Turkey's EU bid, as well as regional and international issues.
Babacan, who is also Turkey's chief EU negotiator, will meet British businessmen and lecture at the Royal United Service Institute for Defence and Security Studies.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon appointed Ethiopian Taye-Brook Zerihoun as new UN envoy to Cyprus and head of the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) on Thursday (April 10th).
Zerihoun will replace Michael Moller of Denmark.
The new envoy is expected to help unify the divided island after decades of diplomatic effort.
Zeljko Komsic, the Croat member of BiH's tripartite presidency, left on Monday (April 14th) for an official visit to the Czech Republic.
His meeting with President Vaclav Klaus will focus on bilateral co-operation, BiH's progress in Euro-Atlantic integration and the latest regional developments.
In Prague, Komsic also will meet with representatives of the BiH diaspora and attend some cultural events.

Nuclear deal caps Medvedev's visit to Turkey
A trip to Turkey by Russia's president yields a landmark deal on building Turkey's first nuclear power plant.
But critics say the deal will create even greater energy dependency on Moscow.
By Erol Izmirli for Southeast European Times in Istanbul -- 14/05/10
After more than a year of negotiations, Turkey and Russia have concluded a deal to build a nuclear power plant on Turkey's southern coast.
The project could cost as much as $20 billion.
The agreement between Russia's state-owned Atomstroyexport and the Turkish government was signed on Wednesday (May 12th), midway through Russian President Dimitry Medvedev's two-day trip to Ankara and Istanbul.
"It's an extremely important contract for us," Russian nuclear agency chief Sergei Kiriyenko told reporters. "This will be the first case in which Russia not only builds a power plant, as we have in Iran and India, but will also own it," he added.
Atomstroyexport will be in charge of building the plant's four reactors, in the eastern Mediterranean town of Akkuyu, in Mersin province.
Construction will take an estimated seven years to complete.
The reactor builder will own 100% of the project and may later sell as much as 49% to investors.
Turkey's leaders are hailing the deal -- which must be endorsed by parliament -- as a milestone in efforts to develop nuclear power.
They say it will be presented to lawmakers within a week to ten days.
"Let me be frank: We [have been] trying to enter the nuclear business for the last 40 years but unfortunately we do not know how to do it," Energy Minister Taner Yıldız told reporters on the sidelines of a conference in Istanbul.
"We have to see the big picture.
Previous tenders were cancelled fours times by the court.
We believe in the need of nuclear energy for Turkey and are confident that we will be successful in this," he said.
The plans, however, have drawn strong criticism from civic and environmental organisations.
The Chamber of Electrical Engineers (EMO) is questioning the terms and has warned the deal could actually increase Turkey's energy dependence on Moscow.
"Full authority of the to-be-built nuclear power plant belongs to Russia.
This agreement will not make Turkey a hub of nuclear technology as the government suggests; it will make us more dependent on Russia," the chamber said in a statement Thursday.
With nearly 65% of Turkey's natural gas coming from Russia, critics say Moscow could use its role as energy supplier as a political tool.
According to the EMO, the cost of electricity from the planned nuclear power plant will be significantly higher than the global market averages.
"We'll have to pay nearly $51 billion to the Russians over 15 years for 415 billion kilowatts of electricity," the organisation said.
Meanwhile, Greenpeace Turkey said the government ignored opposition from local Mersin residents, academics and NGOs. "It's a very undemocratic process," the group said.
Turkish General Ozkok Visits Bases in Southeast Europe
Turkish General Hilmi Ozkok's visit reinforced military co-operation between Balkan countries and Turkey.
By Mustafa Azizoglu for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 16/12/03
Chief of the Turkish General Staff General Hilmi Ozkok brought peace, co-operation and solidarity messages during his three-day visit to the Balkans -- Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Albania. Ozkok landed at Pristina Airport on 8 December, and visited the Turkish Battalion Mission Force Command Post in Prizren.
After his inspection of the Sultan Murat Barracks where Turkish troops are deployed, Ozkok planted a tree in the garden as a peace symbol.
Sultan Murat Barracks was the place where Turkish soldiers lived during the Ottoman Era.
The barracks served as an industrial site during the Yugoslav era, but is now once again inhabited by Turkish soldiers -- this time, as part of a peace mission.
Ozkok met with political and military figures briefly and then toured the city centre of Prizren where he was surrounded by hundreds of people who cheered and waved Turkish flags.
Responding to the crowd, Ozkok said, "Turkey will always be side by side with Kosovo." It was the first visit to Kosovo by a high-ranking Turkish military officer since the war.
The main Turkish population of Kosovo is based in Prizren.
There are thought to be 10,000 Turks in the city of 120,000.
Turkey has long been eager to join peacekeeping missions and has sent troops to Somalia, Albania, BiH, Kosovo and Afghanistan.
Turkey's Parliament authorised the government to deploy troops in Iraq, but the move was cancelled after Iraqi leaders voiced concerns.
"Our distinguishing character is to serve the whole humanity without any exemption, so we take our helping hand to wherever it is wanted," said Ozkok.
His next stop was BiH, where Turkish forces are deployed in Zenica.
Situated in the heart of BiH, Zenica is a mostly Muslim city surrounded by steel and timber factories.
Turkish troops are responsible for security, but they have also assisted with renovating mosques and schools, rebuilding parks and gardens, and providing health service.
Ozkok concluded his Balkan trip with a stop in Albania. During his visit he met with Defence Minister Pandeli Majko, Chief of Albanian General Staff Lieutenant General Pellumb Qazimi, and President Alfred Moisiu.
Moisiu awarded Ozkok Albania's Golden Eagle medal, saying that the largest support during the modernisation of Albania's armed forces came from Turkey.
During his talks with Albanian officials, Ozkok said the military co-operation between Turkey and Albania will continue, and that Turkey would help Albania approach military standards of NATO and become one of its members.
Ozkok also visited the Zall Herr Commando Regiment Base and the Kucova Military Airport where Turkey has helped fund reconstruction.
State Union of Serbia-Montenegro Still Lacks Emblems, Anthem
Serbia-Montenegro has yet to decide on a flag, coat-of-arms and anthem, a fact that demonstrates how hard it may be to preserve the state union.
Meanwhile, both constituent republics have adopted their own symbols.

Both Serbia and Montenegro have chosen new state symbols. On 17 August, Serbia adopted a coat-of-arms featuring a white two-headed eagle with lowered wings, a tricolour flag, and an anthem from the monarchical era, "God Give Justice".
In July, Montenegro adopted its own insignia, also dating back to the 19th century: a golden two-headed eagle with spread wings, placed centrally on the new red flag.
The tiny republic’s new anthem is an old national song, "Oh Sparkling Dawn of May".
The issue of state symbols has provoked heated political reactions, with some arguing that Montenegro's intention in adopting the symbols was to reassert the government's pro-independence stance.
Indeed, Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic himself announced that the symbols would represent a united Montenegro, which, he predicted, would become independent as early as 2005.
Other Montenegrin officials have expressed similar views.
Serbia has expressed surprise at the prime minister's statement, and the pro-Serbian opposition in Montenegro is crying foul.
They predict that the new symbols will be short-lived -- "just like the current government".
Djukanovic rejects accusations that his government had imposed the new emblems on the Montenegrin people.
However, not even all ruling MPs have welcomed them.
Muslim deputies from the ranks of the Social Democratic Party opposed including the crown and crucifixes in the coat-of-arms, but compromised for the sake of political unity.
Under the Belgrade Accord, which marked the founding of Serbia-Montenegro, a special commission is to propose emblems for the state union, combining those of the constituent republics.
The joint flag was not expected to be a major issue.
Both republics have traditionally used the tricolour, though the Montenegrin version featured "sky blue" instead of the Serbian "indigo blue".
The two states have discussed the possibility of compromising and adopting a joint "royal blue".
The coat-of-arms was to contain a two-headed eagle, but it was not clear whether the bird would have Montenegrin-style spread wings, or Serbian-style lowered ones.
Musicologists grumble about a blended anthem, which they say would produce an off-key cacophony, since the Serbian and Montenegrin anthems represent different musical styles.
Although a bill establishing the anthem managed to enter parliamentary procedure in early August, it lacked support and has been taken off the agenda until September.
As a result, athletes from Serbia-Montenegro are once again honouring the old Communist anthem, "Hey Slavs", as they receive medals at the Athens Olympics.
The song, mainly used by the Milosevic regime, is routinely mocked by Serbs when the national team is playing.
The issue shows just how difficult it may be to preserve the state union of Serbia-Montenegro, analysts say.
The lack of joint state symbols would in itself not be much of a problem, if the two constituent republics could function together in practical terms.
So far, however, this has not been the case.
Meanwhile, Montenegro is preparing to hold a referendum on independence next year.
UN Agency: Kosovo Minorities Need Continued Protection
Warning that interethnic relations remain tense, the UN High Commissioner is urging continued international protection of minority groups in Kosovo.

The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has voiced concern over the security of Kosovo minority groups, saying the situation in the province remains volatile.
The agency issued three linked reports on Tuesday (24 August) demonstrating that Kosovo's minorities, particularly its Serbs, Roma, Ashkaelia and Egyptians, need continued international protection.
One of the reports, a detailed 62-page document on the situation of Kosovo's minorities between January 2003 and April 2004, shows there were at least 145 separate incidents during that period, excluding those linked to the ethnic clashes in mid-March of this year.
Despite general improvements with regard to security, freedom of movement and access to services in 2003, members of minority communities continued to be targets of various ethnically motivated attacks.
"Incidents apparently targeted at members of minorities range from simple stone-throwing to a number of brutal murders and other extremely violent assaults, involving shooting, grenade attacks and arson," UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said at a press briefing Tuesday in Geneva.
The three days of violence that erupted on 17 March and spread quickly to all regions in the province left 19 people from various ethnicities dead and more than 950 others injured.
About 730 houses belonging to minorities were damaged or destroyed, as were 36 churches, other religious sites and public buildings.
The violence forced a total of more than 4,100 Serbs, Roma, Ashkaelia, Egyptians and Albanians to flee their homes, according to one of the reports.
About 2,300 remain displaced, said Redmond.
The sudden flare-up of violence and the apparently co-ordinated choice of targets, the UNHCR said, have left many minority communities with a heightened sense of fear and isolation.
Freedom of movement has been seriously undermined, with many now reluctant to travel without a KFOR escort.
Such restrictions affect their economic situation, making them unable to obtain supplies and travel on business.
Although the limited freedoms the Kosovo Serbs, Roma, Ashkaelia and Egyptian and other minority groups enjoyed prior to the mid-March unrest have been restored in some areas, many members of those communities are said to have stepped up preparations for new emergencies.
"In the light of all this information, UNHCR concludes that there is clearly a continued need for international protection for asylum seekers belonging to Kosovo minority groups, especially Serbs, Roma, Ashkaelia and Egyptians," Redmond said, as well as a few selected groups of Kosovo Albanians, including those living as minorities in some parts of northern Kosovo.
In addition, the UNHCR is recommending that people in especially vulnerable situations -- for example, people with severe disabilities, some categories of elderly people, and separated children -- should not be made to return, given the inadequate standards of health care and social welfare situations available in Kosovo.

Bulgaria slips in corruption ranking, says watchdog
Bulgaria is perceived as the most corrupt country among 31 EU and Western European nations, according to Transparency International.
(Transparency International, Euobserver, Sofia Echo, SNA, Dnevnik, Mediapool, AFP, Bloomberg, Reuters, AP - 23/09/08)
Bulgaria scored 3.6 on the Corruption Perceptions Index. [TI]
There is no corruption-free zone in and around the EU, Transparency International (TI) said in a report Tuesday (September 23rd), singling out Bulgaria as the 27-nation bloc's most corrupt member state.
EU membership did not provide an automatic remedy for corruption in Bulgaria, the Berlin-based watchdog group said in its annual Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), citing a significant decline in the country's marks.
With a score of only 3.6 points on a scale of zero to 10, down from 4.1 last year, Bulgaria ranked last among 31 EU and Western European countries, behind Romania with 3.8 points. In the global rankings of 180 countries, Bulgaria slipped to 72nd from 64th in last year's survey.
"Despite its accession to the EU, the country is still wary of tackling political corruption, which is closely linked to a very high level of organised crime," TI said. "During the past two years, corruption in public procurement and strategic concession deals, a judiciary paralysed by corrupt structures and the misuse of EU funds dedicated to the country's development … have countered Bulgaria's success, heavily damaged its international image and reduced trust in national institutions."
Nearly two years after joining the EU in January 2007, Bulgaria and Romania continue to be closely watched by Brussels for their progress in judicial reforms and the fight against corruption.
The European Commission (EC) has also expressed concern about Sofia's failure to deal with organised crime in the country.
Citing fraud and irregularities in the handling of EU funds, the EC froze about 500m euros of European assistance to the Balkan nation in July.
Bulgaria and Romania's marks speak for themselves and will be taken into account when the EC prepares its next monitoring reports on the two countries, to be published in 2009, Euobserver quoted Commission spokesman Mark Gray as saying at a press conference Tuesday.
Bulgaria shares its 72nd place in this year's CPI with seven other countries -- China, Macedonia, Mexico, Peru, Suriname, Swaziland, and Trinidad and Tobago.
It ranks lower than Romania and the rest of the EU member states, as well as Turkey (58th) and Croatia (62nd), which have not completed their accession negotiations with Brussels.
With scores of 9.3 each -- the highest in this year's global rankings -- Denmark, New Zealand and Sweden appear to be the countries with the lowest levels of corruption in the world.
At the bottom of the scale is Somalia, with a score of 1.0 for the second year in a row.
The new CPI indicates Bulgaria is no longer a country that has problems with corruption, but is a highly corrupt country, according to Dimitar Kyumyurdzhiev, deputy chairman of TI's Bulgaria chapter.
"The fact that Bulgaria, which is an EU member, is lower ranked than its neighbours that are not part of the EU is unacceptable," he told reporters Tuesday, calling for a new strategy against corruption and zero tolerance of such practices.
In early August, the cabinet adopted a 200-page action plan, detailing specific measures the country will take by the end of this year to address the problems and shortcomings that led to that suspension of EU assistance about two weeks earlier.
The release of TI's 2008 CPI coincided with two dramatic incidents in Bulgaria.
On Tuesday, the deputy chairman of the State Agency for Sport and Youth, Ivan Lekov, was arrested in connection with a football match-fixing scandal.
The day before, masked men beat up the editor of a Bulgarian-language news website, frognews.bg. Ognyan Stefanov, who investigates corruption, is fighting for his life in hospital with spine injuries and three broken limbs.
Drug trafficking ring busted in BiH

Fifty-six people were arrested last month in a police sting against drug traffickers in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
The action, dubbed "Leotar", was initiated on the orders of the Court and Prosecution Office.
Over the course of four days, police from both entities in BiH searched 200 locations across the country.
The searches were conducted in Zenica, Mostar, Sarajevo, Banja Luka, Capljina, Trebinje and Stolac.
The most extensive action, however, was conducted in Bileca, a southeastern town close to the border with Montenegro.
Police say they broke up the so-called "Bileca Group", suspected not only of cross-border drug trafficking but also arms trafficking and resale of stolen vehicles.
Eleven members of the gang were arrested.
They have been linked to several criminal organisations that were recently disbanded in Croatia.
Marica Culum, a prominent Banja Luka attorney, was among those arrested.
She allegedly directed the group together with three close associates -- Nikola Glusac, Zeljko Ilic and Goran Svorcan.
Operation Leotar was the result of several extensive activities planned and conducted since January.
It is part of continued efforts by police in BiH, Croatia and Montenegro to fight the drug trade, terrorism, human trafficking and other serious crimes.
Following the sting, representatives of the three countries' police forces met in Trebinje to discuss co-ordinating efforts.
They issued a declaration pledging continued co-operation and joint action.
"It is too little to say that our police forces co-operate; they work together and the preceding activities are not to be singled out as only momentary ones; they are continuous and shall go on," RS Police Director Uros Pena told reporters after the meeting.
Vicenzo Coppola, head of the EU Police Mission in BiH, praised Operation Leotar, calling it a serious blow against international drug trafficking
Audio story: Turkey's ban on YouTube
In Turkey, the ban on YouTube is an upshot of the collision between the country's restrictive legal system and the Information Age.

For more than three years now, internet users in Turkey have been blocked from the video-sharing site YouTube because of clips that allegedly insult the country's founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.
Since Ankara drafted its first internet laws in 2007, the number of sites blocked has increased from 433 a year after the ban, to as many as 6,000 sites today.
In the case of YouTube, there's no solution in sight.
The company refuses to accept Turkey's demand that it remove the videos altogether, rather than merely blocking access to them.
UN General Assembly adopts Kosovo resolution
Serbia's foreign minister presents a "status-neutral document" that acknowledges the recent ICJ ruling and calls for dialogue.

The UN General Assembly adopted a resolution sponsored by Serbia and the 27 EU members on Thursday (September 9th), calling for direct talks between Belgrade and Pristina.
The move came after Serbia agreed to amend an earlier draft which had called for resuming negotiations on status.
The new version calls instead for EU-backed dialogue aimed at promoting co-operation.
The non-binding resolution was passed by acclamation at the 192-nation assembly.
"The process of dialogue in itself would be a factor for peace, security and stability in the region, and that dialogue would be to promote co-operation, achieve progress on the path to the European Union and improve the lives of the people," it said.
The resolution recognises the EU's leading role in mediating Kosovo-Serbia talks and acknowledges the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which ruled in July that Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence did not violate international law.
The document was read aloud to the Assembly by Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic, who described it as "fundamentally a status-neutral document".
He stressed that Serbia still does not recognise Kosovo's declaration of independence.
The General Assembly meeting was postponed for hours because the Serb delegation complained about the presence of the Kosovo delegation, which included President Fatmir Sejdiu, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci and Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni.
After several hours of discussion, the Assembly President decided to continue, allowing the Kosovo representatives to remain.
Jeremic told Serb media later that the stalemate was resolved after the United States, Germany, Great Britain, Italy and France "invited the representatives of the Kosovo Albanians as guests".
Despite the tensions evident at the Assembly session, the reaction in Pristina to the new resolution was generally positive.
The government said it was "in full harmony with the reality created in Kosovo and the region".
"This draft resolution takes into account the advisory opinion of the ICJ, which has clearly ruled that the declaration of the independence of Kosovo is in full compliance with the international law.
In addition, the new draft resolution rejects any possibility for negotiations on the political status of Kosovo," the government said.
Kosovo leaders confirmed their readiness to co-operate with Serbia, on the basis of two independent states, with regard to issues of interstate bilateral interest and as part of the Euro-Atlantic perspective.
But issues relating to sovereignty, territorial integrity and domestic constitutional order are off the table, they stressed.
Speaking prior to the Assembly session, Thaci said that Kosovo and Serbia face common challenges and should engage in constructive co-operation on practical issues such as energy, telecommunications, waters, fighting organised crime, education, missing persons and the return of displaced people.
US Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Rosemary DiCarlo said Washington welcomes the EU's offer to assist the two sides in a constructive dialogue.
"Now is the time for the region to move forward and for Serbia and Kosovo to open a new phase in their relations, focused on their shared future within the EU," DiCarlo said.
Crans Montana reaffirms Southeast Europe's EU prospects
This year, for the second time in a row, the Crans Montana Forum met in Zagreb to discuss the European prospects for SEE countries.
With Croatia recently having become an official candidate for EU membership, the mood was one of optimism about the future.
The promise of joining the bloc has done much to spur democratic reforms and ensure peace and stability, participants said, stressing the importance of moving ahead with the enlargement process and keeping the promises Europe has made to the region.

Since 1989, the Crans Montana Forum has been organising gatherings aimed at spurring dialogue and creating partnerships at a high level among key figures in politics and the economy.
For the second time in as many years, the Forum met in Zagreb recently to discuss the European prospects for SEE countries.
The session, titled "Croatia: Europe’s Gateway to the South East", took place from 5 to 7 April.
Participants discussed a broad spectrum of topics, including tourism, transport and energy infrastructure, modernisation of the customs system, waging an effective fight against crime and corruption, judicial reform, the climate for regional investment, economic co-operation with the Arab world, and battling bird flu.
The choice of venue had great symbolic significance.
Croatia, a country once enmeshed in the Balkan conflicts, is now in membership negotiations with the EU.
The time has come to do everything needed for Croatia to complete its road to accession, Crans Montana founder Jean-Paul Carteron told reporters.
Addressing the forum, Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said his country would be active in promoting the Central Europe Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) and the Southeast Europe Co-operation Process (SEECP), with an eye to fostering the EU accession of all the countries in the region.
Despite the current debates within the bloc about absorption capacity and "enlargement fatigue", this part of Europe must not be forgotten, Sanader said.
Also representing Croatia at the forum was Foreign Affairs and European Integration Minister Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic, who spoke about the benefits already being seen from enlargement, in terms of enhanced stability and prosperity.
It is vital for the process to continue, and for the EU to keep its promises, she said.

Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic commended Croatia for demonstrating that progress towards EU membership depends on fulfilment of the set criteria, rather than on a country's size.
The latest wave of EU expansion has encouraged and stimulated countries of the region to speed up the adoption of joint European values, he said, adding that Serbia and Montenegro will also demonstrate their capability for doing so.
Montenegrins will be going to the polls on 21 May to decide whether their republic will become independent or remain part of a loose union with Serbia, and Djukanovic -- a longtime advocate of independence -- is confident about the outcome.
With statehood, Montenegro will be poised to enhance ties with its neighbours, while the democratic referendum will provide a positive example for the region, he said.
The process of EU integration cannot serve as a global historical precedent if a black hole is left on the map of Europe, warned the prime minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Adnan Terzic.
Citing the results of a public opinion survey, which found that some 80 per cent of BiH citizens support joining the EU, Terzic stressed that the political representatives of all three constituent peoples, as well as all the main political forces in the country, agree that EU integration is key to the long-term stabilisation of BiH.
Now is the time for Southeast Europe to join the EU, Terzic concluded.
Macedonia, which officially became an EU candidate country at the end of 2005, was represented at the Zagreb forum by Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski and Deputy Prime Ministers Radmila Sekerinska and Musa Xhaferi.
Candidate status "was not a gift", Sekerinska said.
"Macedonia deserved it … and now as a candidate we have new tasks," she added, emphasising the importance of quickly implementing reforms.
The Crans Montana forum amounted to a powerful message of support for the EU hopes of Balkan countries -- a message which was given added strength by the presence of key EU and international figures.
Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel, whose country is the current holder of the six-month rotating European Council presidency, was at the event, as was the chairwoman of the European Parliament's delegation to Southeastern Europe, Doris Pack.
The future of Southeast Europe lies in the EU, Schuessel said in his address to the forum, stressing that a European perspective does much to fuel reforms and unite democratic forces in pursuit of a shared goal.
Pack echoed those sentiments, and added that Croatia's membership could be expected to galvanise other countries into meeting the membership criteria.
In all, more than 400 people assembled in Zagreb for the Crans Montana session. Besides heads of state and members of governments, they included diplomats, representatives of international organisations and businesspeople from some 35 countries.
Next month, Crans Montana will again be holding an event in Southeast Europe, with a "high-level experts' forum" scheduled to take place in Tirana on 12 and 13 May.

Kosovo loan rates highest in the region
Kosovo's Competition Commission is investigating whether the country's high interest rates stem from some kind of interbank agreement.
By Muhamet Brajshori for Southeast European Times in Pristina -- 20/09/11
Kosovo’s banking system is largely driven by Raiffeisen Bank and ProCredit Bank. [Reuters]
Since 1999, nine banks have been operating in Kosovo, offering high loan rates that negatively impact the country's economic development.
This prompted the Kosovo Competition Commission (KCC) to investigate whether the banks have a mutual agreement, or cartel, which keeps rates higher.
"Kosovo banks are being investigated under the suspicion that they made cartel-type arrangements.
If we manage to figure out the facts, penalties under the Competition Law may be up to 10% of the annual gross-profit," Osman Ejupi, head of KCC told Zeri.
Most of the banking system is driven by the Raiffeisen Bank and ProCredit Bank, which charge higher rates in Kosovo than they do in their home countries.
"Banks in the country have very similar interest rates, and, at the same time, have higher interest rates from those in the region," Ejupi explained.
The Pristina-based think tank, Institute for Advanced Studies (GAP Institute), conducted a three-year study of the Kosovo banking system published in Bank Watch, which included comparative data on the most popular loan types -- personal, business, house, agriculture, and car -- offered by commercial banks, including a table of comparative data on interest deposits.
Many businesses depend on bank loans, though high interest rates do not create favourable conditions for business development, experts argue.
"The changes in loan rates from 2009 to 2011 consistently range from 9% to 24%, depending on the type of loans.
Personal loans, car-credit or credit to purchase homes have lower interest rates compared to rates for businesses and agro-credit, which simultaneously constitute 70% of total loans issued in Kosovo in the last three years," the GAP Institute's Rudina Heroi-Puka told SETimes.
She argues that low interest rates would boost Kosovo's economic development and financial stability.
"Low interest rates have a positive impact on credit demand, which affects further improvement of economy through increased investment and consumption," says Heroi Puka.
Lumir Abdixhiku, executive director of Riinvest Institute, told SETimes "There is no co-ordination among the banks, where they would agree on fixed interest rates.
Instead, the banks are comfortably profiting; each gets a share and has no motivation to compete with one another.
This status quo is dictated by competitive two to three oligopolistic, market-leading banks in the country," he says.
Abdixhiku added that the government needs to take steps that would enable a change in the banking system, while strengthening financial stability.
"Approval of the law on letters with values that would allow issuing treasury bonds is the first step in this direction.
Secondly, to reduce the risk of lending, I would say that the functionality of the court is a prerequisite.
Finally, the cadastral registration would allow property mortgage seriously to increase the demand for credit, and lower the interest rates," says Abdixhiku.
According to the Bank Watch report, the financial crisis in Kosovo prompted banks to be more cautious in issuing loans last year, yet still did some damage.
"The global financial crisis adversely affected the Kosovo economy and the quality of bank loan portfolios.
Thus, non-performing loans represented 5.9% of total loans, compared with 4.4% in 2009 and 3% in 2008.
Banks view the growth of non-performing loans as risky, which also resulted in increased interest rates in early 2011," said Heroi-Puka.
Croatia: another step closer to the EU
Even though the country now has a draft of its EU accession treaty, reforms must continue.

Croatia's accession treaty will be signed in December. [Reuters]
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk arrived in Zagreb on Saturday (September 17th) to bring the draft of the EU accession treaty to Croatia.
The document will be signed in December, opening the way for Croatia to become a full EU member in 2013.
"When Croatia joins the EU, it is going to be an important influx of optimism and confidence for the future of the EU," Tusk said at a press conference after the meeting.
Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said that by getting this draft of the EU accession treaty, Croatia has finally achieved its strategic and historic goal.
But there are a lot of things left to be done, not only because EU requires them, but also because Croatia should achieve them for the country's own good.
"Looking back, Croatia went through many difficulties not experienced by other member countries.
Croatia's delay … was of political nature, and it took quite an amount of luck, wit and courage to sustain it," political expert Vedran Obucina told SETimes.
"Croatia needs to stick to the reforms even more than before.
It is the only way to avoid unnecessary sanctions, like happened in Bulgaria."
SDP MP Tonino Picula told SETimes that he was appalled by the fact that Tusk's visit was sparsely covered by local news outlets.
"I think this is the indicator of the situation we are in; but I am also quite sure and I hope that this public arrogance and the indifference is pointed at the current government, not at the EU itself," Picula said.
Although support for the country's accession has waned slightly, many in Croatia support the move.
"I am looking forward to the fact that Croatia is finally ending the EU negotiation story.
I … want my children to have the opportunity to study abroad, have foreign experiences and learn about life in the EU.
That is what EU should be all about," Zagreb resident Anamarija Tokic told SETimes.
However, Picula pointed out no candidate country has been in a situation like the one Croatia is currently facing.
During the past year -- in the final phases of EU accession -- the ruling party has been the subject of many controversies.
Beginning in 2009, authorities uncovered one of the biggest embezzlement scandals in the country.
Eight people were arrested, suspected of misusing 54m euros from local food producer Podravka.
Among those accused is former Deputy Prime Minister Damir Polancec, who resigned amid the scandal.
"In a way, Kosor has the same political destiny in this moment as [former Prime Minister Ivica Racan]: they both did very important tasks on the EU front in the last months of their mandates, and then lost the parliamentary elections," Picula said, alluding to the upcoming December vote.
EU, IMF press Greece to meet aid conditions
Greece hopes to reach a deal with its international lenders on Tuesday to allow it to soon get the next tranche of badly needed rescue aid.

The EU and IMF told Greece on Monday (September 19th) to slash its public sector and speed up reforms to be able to get the critically needed next aid tranche under the 110-billion-euro bailout accord it signed with them last year.
The new warning came during a three-hour conference call between Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos and senior representatives of the so-called troika -- the European Commission (EC), the European Central Bank (ECB) and IMF.
The talks, which the Greek finance ministry described as "productive and substantive", focused on the measures the government must take for its international creditors to approve the sixth, 8-billion-euro installment of aid, according to Greek daily Kathimerini.
Greece badly needs that new injection as soon as possible to avoid defaulting on its sovereign debt.
Officials have recently warned that the country will run out of money by the middle of October.
Citing unidentified sources, Kathimerini said the troika officials stressed the need of speeding up public sector reforms, as they also pushed for a range of other measures, including raising the tax on heating fuel to equal that on gasoline.
That, according to the paper, would imply that the cost of heating fuel would increase by 40 cents per litre.
Venizelos has reportedly pledged that the government will take the required actions to meet its commitments to the EU and IMF, as well as every needed measure to prevent the country's default.
"We have both the will and the steady commitment to implement whatever we have to implement, not just towards the eurozone but towards ourselves and our children," the minister was quoted as saying Monday.
Greece was expecting to receive the new tranche from the rescue package earlier this month.
A mission of inspectors from the troika arrived in Athens in early September to review its progress in meeting the terms of the bailout before a decision is taken on the next portion of aid.
But they left abruptly after a row over the size of the country's budget shortfall and its cause.
About ten days later, the government announced a new set of austerity measures, aimed at meeting the fiscal targets agreed with the EU and the IMF last year, as well as securing the vital funding.
One of them was a new property tax that the Greek authorities hope will help them raise the 2 billion euros needed to close the budget gap for this year.
The IMF was not impressed with that idea for dealing with the deficit problem, however, saying the focus should be instead on improving tax collection.
"In our view, you should not be drawn to higher and higher taxes on the limited tax base," the IMF representative for Greece, Bob Traa, said in Athens on Monday. "This will neither be economically or politically sustainable."
What was needed instead was a "much stronger resolve to tackle the problem of tax evasion", he said.
Furthermore, inefficient state-owned enterprise should be closed and there should be "reductions in the excessively large public sector workforce and generous public sector wages".
Traa also criticised the Greek authorities for dragging their feet on the implementation of the government's privatisation programme.
"The privatisation is behind schedule because politicians can't agree how to do it.
If you wait ... the country will go to a default," he warned.
Sandzak and the south are trouble spots for Serbia
Even as it confronts Pristina over northern Kosovo, Serbia is grappling with discontent elsewhere.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 20/09/11

After a week marked by tension in northern Kosovo, Belgrade saw the re-emergence of two other potential trouble spots.
First, some Bosniak factions in the western Serbian region of Sandzak announced they would push for autonomy.
Next, Albanians in southern Serbia began organising protest rallies, dissatisfied with the conditions in local education.
Analysts in Belgrade believe developments in these two parts of Serbia are linked to the Kosovo crisis, and also with Serbia's aspiration to gain EU candidate status by the end of the year.
"At this moment Serbia is under a lot of pressure over northern Kosovo, as well as over some other issues related to the possibility of gaining EU candidate status," said Predrag Simic, a political science professor at the University of Belgrade. "I think that pressure is present at this particular moment, when Serbia is highly sensitive to that sort of criticism from Brussels."
The Sandzak issue flared on Thursday (September 15th) with a statement by Mufti Muamer Zukorlic -- leader of the Islamic Community in Serbia.
He accused Belgrade of discriminating against Bosniaks in Sandzak and announced the region would seek autonomy.
Sandzak, he added, would open regional offices in Brussels, Washington, Istanbul and Sarajevo.
Zukorlic has received support from Bosnian Muslim leader Reis Mustafa Ceric, who blasted Belgrade for "carrying out increased discrimination" against the Sandzak Bosniaks.
Belgrade is aiming to create "an environment of fear and lynching" in Sandzak, Ceric said, warning of a "new crisis point in Europe".
He compared the atmosphere to that which preceded the outbreak of conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the 1990s.
His comments were met with disapproval by Bosniak party representatives in the Serbian government.
Meho Omerovic, a Bosniak MP with the ruling coalition, said Ceric's statements were "disturbing and dangerous" and would bring "nothing good" to the Bosniaks in Sandzak.
"Instead of reconciling his believers, the reis is an additional factor in new divisions," Omerovic said.
According to Dusan Janjic, president of the Forum for Ethnic Relations, it is no accident that the controversy is heating up now.
"By making that statement, Ceric aims to put the issue of Sandzak on the agenda of Serbia's open issues," Janjic said. "Because when Serbia becomes a member candidate and gets a date for the beginning of negotiations with the EU, it may be too late."
Simic, meanwhile, agrees that comparisons with the pre-Milosevic era are off base.
However, he said, Sandzak does suffer from economic woes and resulting social tensions.
"There is a difficult social situation in Sandzak that is not much worse than the situation in other parts of Serbia, but due to multiethnic makeup and the vicinity of Bosnia, it is given additional ethnic characteristics," Simic told SETimes.
Prior to the Sandzak announcement, several thousand Albanians from southern Serbia held a protest rally in Bujanovac on September 13th, disgruntled over omissions in the education system meant for the minority.
The Albanian representative in the Serbian parliament said the rally "was not political", and its objective had been to show that Albanians were having trouble with education, "primarily due to the lack of textbooks in Albanian".
After that event, the Serbian government announced there had indeed been omissions in the system, stressing it would try to speed up efforts to solve the problem.
International Commission to Report on Balkans
A new international organisation is using the Carnegie Commission as a model to develop a vision for the integration of Balkan countries into the EU.

On 15 April, the International Commission on the Balkans was launched in Brussels, supported by the King Baudouin Foundation in Belgium, the Marshall Fund in Germany and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation in the United States.
Former Italian Prime Minister Giuliano Amato is chairman of the commission.
Its executive director, Ivan Krastev, is the head of the Sofia-based Centre for Liberal Strategies, which will become the commission's collective secretariat.
Commission members include former German President Richard von Weizsacker; former Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov; former prime ministers Carl Bildt of Sweden and Jean-Luc Dehaene of Belgium; Foreign Minister Mircea Geoana of Romania; Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic of Serbia-Montenegro; and future Slovenian EU Commissioner Janez Potocnik.
The objective of the commission is to develop a vision for the integration of the countries of Southeast Europe into the EU and other international structures.
"We intend to be helpful both to the decision makers and to the societies in Southeast Europe as well as to the incoming European Commission," Amato said.
"The main purpose of the commission is to make an inquiry into the situation in the Western Balkans and to prepare recommendations about its future development as early as the spring of 2005," said Vesela Cherneva of the Centre for Liberal Strategies.
With this task in mind, a team of politicians will tour the Western Balkans this summer, starting in Serbia-Montenegro.
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Albania and Kosovo will also be included on the itinerary.
The commission will examine the legal environment, democratic reforms and the security situation in the Western Balkans.
It will try to hear as many local views as possible, including those of local businessmen, journalists and government representatives.
The commission has developed special criteria to help it assess the current situation in the region.
The report must be approved by two-thirds of the 18 commission members before it is presented to the European Commission in Brussels, to the governments in the region and to officials in Washington.
This initiative is patterned after the famous Carnegie Commission, which reported on the Balkan situation at the beginning of the 20th century.
A similar organisation presented recommendations to then US President Bill Clinton in 1997.
Crackdown on Crime in Serbia Opens Doors
[AFP] The assassination of Zoran Djindjic brought to light the corruption and criminal activity that has continued to flourish despite the overthrow of Slobodan Milosevic.
In an effort to get to the root of the problem, Belgrade police have questioned more than 7,500 people, and the pressure is on to bring about much needed reforms.
Analysis by Davor Konjikusic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 12/05/03
Crowds in the street, shouting and swearing, a large number of policemen everywhere, occasional snow gusts -- rare for this time of year -- and a procession paying their final respects to the remains of former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic.
These were among the images in Belgrade on 8 April.
Stambolic, once Slobodan Milosevic's political mentor and later a bitter enemy, was kidnapped in the summer of 2000 while jogging in one of Belgrade's largest parks.
"In the past 1,000 days, we faced the bitter truth -- mass graves were discovered, refrigerator trucks were dredged from rivers, one president of a government and a president of state were killed.
All that was the price of a wrong choice 16 years ago," Grujica Sasojevic, editor-in-chief of the Danas daily, said.
In March, Stambolic's remains were discovered in a hole covered with quicklime on a mountain near Novi Sad.
The suspects, members of the elite police unit known as the Red Berets and of the Zemun mafia clan, have been arrested, as the public speculates that the murder was ordered by Milosevic and his wife Mirjana Markovic.
Markovic is believed to have fled to Russia to live with her son Marko Milosevic, for whom Interpol recently issued a warrant.
Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs public security chief Sreten Lukic announced that 7,763 people have been called in for questioning during the police action dubbed "Saber", since the state of emergency was declared, and 2,002 persons have been detained.
The arrested persons were found to possess a weapons arsenal sufficient to arm a small private army: 13 machine guns, 217 automatic rifles, 436 other kinds of rifles, 536 guns and revolvers, 318 hand grenades, 260 rifle grenades and anti-tank mines, 17 hand and rocket launchers and 105,000 pieces of various ammunition.
Also discovered were 17 kg of heroin ready for street sale.According to unofficial reports, the crackdown has had a dramatic impact on the narcotics market and on an estimated 150,000 Serbian heroin addicts, with nearly all narcotics trafficking channels cut off since the state of emergency was imposed.
Former Yugoslav Army Security chief Aco Tomic and Rade Bulatovic, advisor to former Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica, were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the assassination of the late prime minister, Zoran Djindjic.
The arrests are likely to amplify accusations made by the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) against Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS).
The Democratic Party (DP) accused Kostunica and his party of having contributed to the lynch mob atmosphere by supporting the Red Berets in their protest at the end of last year and by continually attacking the government -- actions which, the DP charges, contributed to setting the stage for Djindjic's murder.
Kostunica characterised the elite police unit's protest as legitimate.Neither the Serbian government nor the DSS, it appears, realised that the protest involved the most sinister remnants of Milosevic's regime, and that these had to be disbanded and removed from service or dire consequences would follow.
After Zivkovic announced the lifting of the state of emergency, the political bickering between DOS and DSS continued, with the latter accusing the government of responsibility for the resultant political damage -- by openly siding with one criminal group against another in the battle against organised crime.
Conflict also broke out between the prime minister and the governor of the National Bank of Serbia, after Zivkovic proclaimed the National Bank a non-existent institution.
Critics are expressing concern that the state of emergency is being exploited in the battle for power.
The government is also being criticised by members of the media, which has been fined for allowing leaders of opposition parties to appear on its programmes.
One young man was given eight days in prison for posting ironic paraphrases of Serbian government officials on the Internet.
The government's explanation for closing down the daily newspaper Nacional is also being disputed.
It initially planned to organise a committee to assess the role of the media in contributing to the atmosphere of lynching, but reneged on the idea after intense criticism.
Public opinion analysts argue that it is important to concentrate on the battle against organised crime and on damage control while there is still significant support from citizens, instead of becoming caught up in mutual political backstabbing.
Apart from political bickering, Serbia faces significant problems.
It is without an elected president, the new constitution has not been completed, the economy is in dire straits and laws are lacking.
All this indicates that during the coming period Serbia must bear down on resolving internal problems.
It is clear that Djindji's murder left a considerable mark on this society and on local politics.
But the effects of the tragedy can be softened by successfully bringing the anti-mafia action to a close, and by accelerating the reforms.
Del Ponte: Croatia Fully Co-operating With ICTY
According to chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte, Croatia has demonstrated full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.

In a rare statement on Thursday (3 June), chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte said Croatia was now fully co-operating with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
"Finally, I have come to a Balkan state that is fully co-operating," del Ponte said in Zagreb.
According to Reuters, it was the first time that the UN prosecutor has given such a positive assessment of Croatia's relations with the ICTY.
Speaking to reporters after her meeting with Justice Minister Vesna Skare Ozbolt, del Ponte said the only open issue is the case of retired General Ante Gotovina, which she described as having "a particular importance".
"The international community is watching us.
I hope we will achieve that we have Gotovina in The Hague soon," del Ponte said.
She also said prosecutors would ask the UN tribunal to transfer several important cases to Croatian courts.
Although she did not give specifics, her spokeswoman had said earlier that retired Generals Rahim Ademi and Mirko Norac might be tried in their home country.
Both have been indicted for their alleged roles in atrocities against ethnic Serbs during the September 1993 Croatian Army operation in the Medak Pocket.
It is extremely important for Zagreb to prove that it can hold free trials, del Ponte noted.
On 17 June, a two-day summit begins, at which EU leaders are due to decide whether Croatia is to be granted formal EU candidate status -- a stepping stone for opening accession talks with Brussels.
Croatia is hoping to join the EU in 2007.
The EU has set full co-operation with the ICTY as a key condition for Croatia's bid.
The ICTY is to complete all trials by 2008 and appeals by 2010.
On Thursday, del Ponte said five new indictments relating to war crimes during the 1990s Balkan conflicts would be issued by year's end.
Bucharest mayor seeks foreign investment for capital renovations
Foreign investment is crucial to carrying out ambitious plans for renovating Bucharest, says the mayor of Romania's capital.
Also in business news: a roundtable in Bosnia and Herzegovina points to continuing obstacles to economic growth, Kosovo plans a new thermal plant, and an EU committee approves funding to fight bird flu and assist the poultry industry.

Bucharest Mayor Adriean Videanu urged foreign investors Thursday (22 June) to become involved in public-private partnerships to carry out renovation plans for Romania's capital.
UNDP-backed renovation projects -- which include infrastructure improvements, new parking lots, building a subway, and improving the environmental conditions -- are expected to begin later this summer.
"My decision is to support investors, as their contribution is essential to the development of the city," Videanu said.
A roundtable discussion of Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) business potential was held in Sarajevo.
Representatives of companies from BiH and other countries in Central and Eastern Europe warned that political and economic barriers still block the entry of foreign investors and constraing economic growth in the country.
Kosovo's Energy Minister Ethem Ceku announced the start of a project to construct a new thermal power plant in the province.
The plant would be the largest investment in Kosovo since 1999, and would have the capacity to produce between 1,800 and 2,100 megawatts of electricity.
Companies from France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Turkey and the United States have reportedly already expressed interest in the project.
Kazakhstan's largest bank, Turan Alem Bank, will buy a 34 per cent stake in Turkey's Sekerbank, under a sales agreement signed on 21 June.
According to local media, the deal amounts to $261m.
It is expected to be finalised by 31 October.
Cyprus and Greece are among 14 EU member states that will benefit from a new EU financial package, worth 50m to 65m euros, for support of the poultry market and overcoming the losses from the bird flu.
Under the initiative, approved by the bloc's management committee for eggs and poultry on Thursday (22 June), the EU budget will finance 50 per cent of measures against bird flu undertaken by the two countries.
The Romanian government decided to extend by three months the deadline for completing the privatisation of the Romanian Commercial Bank (BCR) by the Austrian Erste Bank.
It said the move was necessary because the state antitrust body has not yet presented a position on the deal.
The Czech power utility CEZ announced plans to open trading offices in Serbia and Kosovo this summer, as well as its possible participation in a future tender for two new power stations in Macedonia.
According to the company, the new offices are part of CEZ's overall expansion in Southeast Europe.

Agriculture and the Doha Trade Round
Albania's deputy economy minister, Ilir Ciko, speaks on the second day of the general assembly of the 5th Ministerial Summit of the WTO in Cancun, on 11 September.
The trade talks stalled over farm subsidies and an EU push to include new issues concerning investment, procurement and competition. [AFP] The Doha Trade Round has serious implications for the poorer agrarian countries in Southeast Europe.
Economist and former Romanian Finance Minister Daniel Daianu explains why.
By Daniel Daianu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest - 22/09/03
Events have kept much of the world's attention focused on Iraq and the Middle East.
Geopolitical concerns and the threat of terrorist acts are shaping the agendas of many governments.
These concerns, however, cannot obscure the deteriorating economic situation in many parts of the globe, which face low or slowing GDP growth rates, high or rising unemployment, trade clashes, spreading social destitution, inability to respond to natural disasters, and other problems.
Since the United States is the engine of the world economy, some hopes are tied to signs of a US economic recovery, but ongoing stagnation and even recession in Western Europe dims the broad perspective.
In such an environment, developing countries fare worse -- socially, economically and politically.
Economic distress in most of Africa, as well as in parts of Latin America and Asia, is accompanied by faltering institutional structures, by social fragmentation and disintegration, and by interethnic conflicts and violence.
Multiplying cases of failed states compound an increasingly worrisome dynamic.
These trends provide an important context for the WTO meeting in Cancun.
When the Doha trade round was initiated, many hailed it as a means not only to arrest rising protectionist tendencies, but also to redress a major imbalance in world trade.
Within the context of the recurring debate over free versus fair trade, the Doha round is supposed to tackle what are probably the most inequitable aspects of world trade: a highly restricted access, for developing countries' farm products, to rich countries' markets, and the heavy subsidisation of agricultural production in rich economies, undermining farm production in developing countries.
Farm products are the main export item of many developing countries.
In poorer countries, meanwhile, food expenditure accounts for a large share of people's overall spending.
The United States and the EU spend about 280 billion euros annually on farm subsidies, but their aid for development amounts to only around 50 billion euros.
The heavy subsidies maintain excessive levels of output in rich countries and allow their farmers to compete unfairly against poor countries' farmers.
One should not underestimate the serious obstacles in the way of meeting poor countries' legitimate demands.
Farmers comprise important, politically influential lobbies in rich countries, making reforms difficult to implement.
Security considerations also enter the picture, particularly in a period when non-conventional threats and the need to avoid excessive dependency on foreign sources of procurement are receiving an ever higher profile.
Nevertheless, it is hard to dispute the major flaw in the current arrangements, which penalise poor countries' peasants and harm development prospects.
For years now, the World Bank has underlined this inimical state of affairs, and top US and EU officials have acknowledged the stark facts. But narrowly-defined national interests have dented meaningful reform progress.
Recently, the US and the EU reached an agreement on farm trade, which should enhance the talks in Cancun.
As analysts have aptly observed, however, the deal does not offer any concrete figures for tariff and subsidy cuts, not to mention non-tariff barriers.
As a result, the deal looks more like a letter of intent, devoid of numerical significance.
The Cancun meeting could be further weakened if progress in trade (especially in farm trade) is linked with demands on non-trade rules.
The EU seems adamant about undertaking joint negotiations on investment rules, competition policy and other non-trade regulations.
These rules -- the so-called "Singapore issues" -- are important, but not so critical at this stage of the overall debate.
Unless wisely formulated and implemented, non-trade rules may not advance the economic development of poor countries.
As things stand now, the non-trade issues would arguably overload the Doha agenda and diminish the Cancun meeting's chances of success.
The countries of Southeast Europe have large agricultural sectors.
Agriculture provides, in general, between 8 and 20 per cent of GDP; in Albania's case, the figure is nearly 50 per cent.
Large segments of the population live in rural areas.
At the same time, productivity is low, and public budgets cannot help much.
Unless farming gets a technology/productivity boost and market access improves in the EU, the lot of farmers in Southeast Europe is bound to worsen.
Together with high unemployment in the region, this would strain local economies more and aggravate social frictions.
The less developed countries of Europe need easier access for their farm products on EU markets, a fact which provides a strong argument for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).On the other hand, those of Europe's poorer countries which have a good chance of joining the EU are interested, for social reasons and because of their large rural populations, in the maintenance of substantial farm subsidies.For them, subsidies would offer a safety net at a time of deep retrenchment of public budgets.
Among the countries which are to join the EU in 2004, Poland and Hungary face this predicament.
It is even more serious for Romania and Bulgaria, which have larger rural populations.The Western Balkans would experience the same dilemma: a need for better market access, combined with the aspiration to join the EU and get farm subsidies.
One sees, therefore, that the CAP, which is perceived as a major nuisance for world trade, can induce ambivalent policy attitudes among EU accession countries.
Most of the latter wish to join a rich club; however, their economies are not sufficiently competitive.
Social destitution in rural areas could get out of hand unless non-farm job creation is intense, effective social safety nets are put in place, and outward labor movement takes place with few restrictions.
At the same time, the Doha trade round remains vital for the development of poor countries, and EU accession countries need to look at the broad picture.
For Balkan countries which have remote prospects of joining the EU (and, consequently, are less interested in farm subsidies), a successful Doha trade round would imply better protection of their domestic production and easier export access for their farm products.
But for the Doha trade round to be completed successfully, visionary statesmanship among the leaders of the developed countries, deep concern for the poor of the world, and related adequate policies have to get the upper hand.
Macedonian Olympic Team Includes Veteran Athletes, Newcomers
Macedonia's 10-member Olympic team will compete in wrestling, swimming, track and field, shooting and kayak racing.
The country is pinning its medal hopes on wrestler Mogamed Ibragimov, who won a bronze at the Sydney Games.
By Marija Lazarova for Southeast European Times in Skopje -- 03/08/04

Macedonia became the first nation Monday (2 August) to hold a national flag-raising ceremony at the Athens Olympic Village. The 24-member Macedonian delegation was welcomed by the mayor of the Village, Ioannis Manos.
"It is with great pleasure and honour that we welcome you.
We deeply appreciate your participation and hope that all your Olympic dreams are fulfilled," Manos said.
The 397m-facility drew praise from the head of the Macedonian delegation, Zoran Gapik.
"It's wonderful . the volunteers are very kind.
I think it will be a great Olympic Games," Gapik said.
The country is pinning its medal hopes on wrestler Mogamed Ibragimov, the bronze medallist in the men's 84kg category at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 and fourth-place finisher at the 2002 European Championship in Baku, Azerbaijan.
He is part of a 10-member team which will compete in five sports: wrestling, swimming, track and field, shooting, and kayak flatwater racing.
Also in wrestling, Sihamir Osmanov will be making his Olympic debut.
He will compete in the freestyle 74kg category.
Osmanov's best previous result is 5th place at the 2003 World Championship in the United States.
The largest group of athletes on the Macedonian team are the swimmers.
Aleksandar Miladinovski, Vesna Stojanovska and Zoran Lazarovski took part in the Sydney Olympics four years ago, while Aleksander Malenko participated in the 1996 Games held in Atlanta.
In Athens, Miladinovski will compete in the 100m butterfly and 200m individual medley.
Malenko will compete in the 200m freestyle; Stojanovska in the 200m freestyle, 200m butterfly and 400m individual medley; and Lazarovski in the 200m butterfly.
Macedonia will be represented in track and field by Vane Stojanov (800m middle distance racing) and Aleksandra Vojnevska (100m sprint).
Stojanov is the national champion in middle distance racing. He took part in the Sydney Games, where he ranked 27th out of 62 participants.
The two are hoping for a new national record.
Divna Pesic, Macedonia's best shooter, will compete in the 10m air rifle and 50m rifle three-position events.
"I am expecting good results," Pesic said. "I have trained very hard and I am fully prepared."
One of the most experienced athletes on the team is kayaker Laze Popovski, who took part in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics and was the winner of the 2004 Balkan Championship.
"I would be happy," Popovski says, "with a semi-final ranking."
Region grapples with swine flu
Public anxiety is rising along with the number of H1N1 cases.

With an increasing number of cases in the region, authorities in Southeast Europe have been taking steps to control the spread of swine flu.
Measures include vaccination campaigns and closing public institutions in order to reduce exposure.
Bulgaria, for instance, has ordered all schools to halt classes until at least November 16th.
All hospital visits and regular medical checks for pregnant women and babies have been suspended, and minor surgeries will be postponed until further notice.
Likewise, Serbia's education minister ordered students to add an extra week to their fall vacation, and visits to hospital patients have been curtailed.
Vaccinations are one answer.
Turkey says it has already begun an inoculation campaign, starting with health workers and religious pilgrims.
Children will be able to get the shot at local clinics.
But efforts elsewhere have been slow to get off the ground.
Serbia is awaiting its shipment of the vaccine, which is being provided by the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis.
The country is slated to receive enough for three million doses by mid-March.
Some countries, such as Albania, have not yet put in a request for the vaccine.
According to Albanian authorities, the country has 10,000 doses of Tamiflu in reserve should the flu numbers increase.
But even Tamiflu can be hard to find in some countries.
"We just don't have it," a pharmacist in the Montenegrin capital, Podgorica, told the daily Vijesti.
Meanwhile, the flu-related death toll is rising.
While most patients who contract the H1N1 virus recover within days, it can be fatal to some, especially the elderly and small children.
Dangers include respiration problems, pneumonia and severe dehydration.
As of this week, Serbia had 258 confirmed cases, with seven fatalities, although doctors say the actual number of infections is exponentially higher.
In Croatia, more than 2,000 people have contracted H1N1, including the son of Health Minister Darko Milinovic, and three people have died.
The largest number of fatalities has been in Turkey, where flu-related complications have claimed 40 lives.
In Romania, more than 1,100 cases of the virus have been confirmed, with the northeastern city of Iassy hit hardest so far.
The government has asked the Cantacuzino Institute, which specialises in producing vaccines, to double the number of available doses from 5 million to 10 million.
A Romanian man living near Salzburg, Austria, succumbed to a heart attack Tuesday after contracting H1N1, in what is being described as the first Romanian fatality related to the disease.
In Bulgaria, authorities are reporting 12 deaths from swine flu so far.
According to Chief Epidemiologist Dr. Angel Kanchev, there are 634 confirmed cases, and another 1,673 people are being tested.
However, the actual number of swine flu cases is much higher, doctors say.
Of the approximately 175,000 Bulgarians who have come down with some form of the flu, the overwhelming majority -- around 90% -- are likely to have contracted H1N1. On November 6th, the country declared a nationwide epidemic.

EU offers Serbia new political deal
Unable to agree on finalising a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia, EU foreign ministers have instead proposed an interim agreement.

EU foreign ministers decided on Monday (January 28th) to offer Serbia an interim political agreement providing for expanded co-operation in the areas of trade and education and relaxed visa requirements for Serbian travellers.
"We have adopted a very interesting text that opens the door to Serbia's entry into the EU," Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, said after the meeting in Brussels.
Most of the ministers arrived intending to support the finalisation of Serbia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the Union, which was initialed in November.
But a decision to that effect was blocked by the Netherlands, which insisted that Serbia must first meet the EU's requirement for full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
The Hague-based court is still seeking the arrest and handover of four remaining war crimes fugitives from the Balkan conflicts in the 1990s, including former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander, Ratko Mladic.
Eventually, the EU foreign ministers agreed on the new proposal to Serbia, which Rupel later described as a major first step towards eventual membership in the bloc.
According to EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, the people of Serbia should see the bloc's new proposal as an "exceptionally strong message" that their country is an important part of Europe and has clear prospects of joining the Union.
The EU plans to sign the new framework agreement on February 7th, four days after Serbia's presidential run-off election.
Brussels hopes setting that date will boost the chances of incumbent President Boris Tadic, who is pro-European.
The EU fears that a win by Tomislav Nikolic of the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party could return the country to isolation and set the stage for regional instability.
Nikolic's party is headed by Vojislav Seselj, a war crimes indictee now in detention at The Hague.
Some EU officials have voiced doubt about the prospects of either the SAA or the new deal being signed, should Nikolic win the presidency.
"In the case of a victory for Nikolic, things would be very different," the AFP quoted Spanish European Affairs Minister Alberto Navarro as telling reporters on the sidelines of the Brussels meeting.
"There's much at stake in Serbia these days," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said. "The Serbian people are choosing between a nationalist past and a European future ...
I trust the Serbian people will choose and indeed embrace their European future.
Human Trafficking in Turkey: Target Gangs, Not Refugees
The United States recently pointed to several countries, including Turkey, that are not doing enough to halt human trafficking.
But the Turkish government says it is adopting measures to crack down on offenders.
By Fatih Baran for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 19/06/03
Following the US government's report declaring that 15 countries, including Turkey, do not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking and are not making significant efforts to do so, Turkey said that it has taken every measure to prevent trafficking. Turkey became the first country to sign the Refugee Rights agreement in 1951 and continues to be a very popular with illegal immigrants because of its easy access to the Greek Islands and the rest of Europe.
Turkey is a bridge between Europe and Asia, and therefore has become a transit country for refugees wanting to immigrate illegally to Europe. After 1989, it also became a destination for citizens of the former Eastern Bloc countries, who came to Turkey to work illegally due to economic conditions back home.
Statistics released by the Turkish Directorate General of Security show that 405,264 illegal immigrants were apprehended between 1995 and 2002. In 2001, 92,362 people were caught, while in 2002 the figure was 82,825. During the first four months of 2003, 13,716 people were apprehended by security forces while trying to illegally enter or exit the country.
Most illegal refugees, if not caught by security forces, die while trying to cross the sea in small vessels or while travelling under lorries.
They are from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Morocco, Iraq, Iran and the Palestinian territories and are headed for to Europe or the United States.
According to experts, poverty and political pressure or threats are the most important reasons for the increase in human trafficking.
Capturing asylum seekers will not solve the problem unless the gangs involving in human trafficking are apprehended, experts say.
Human trafficking is very profitable for criminals because of the high-income -- approximately $2,000 per refugee -- low risk and minimal punishment. The punishment for engaging in human trafficking was not increased until 2002.
Turkey changed Article 201 of the Turkish Penal Code to levy heavy punishment as a deterrent to trafficking. Turkey has also signed security and co-operation agreements with 61 countries to prevent illegal immigration and human trafficking.
With the National Programme prepared by Turkey for its entry into the EU, the government needs to bring its refugee policies into line with EU criteria.
EU launches first-ever naval operation
The EU's first-ever naval operation formally began on Monday.
The main task of the EU NAVFOR mission is to protect international shipping from rampaging Somali pirates.

EU foreign ministers endorsed on Monday (December 8th) the launch of the 27-nation bloc's first-ever naval operation, tasked with protecting ships travelling through the Gulf of Aden, where Somali pirates have attacked nearly 100 vessels this year alone.
On December 15th, the year-long EU NAVFOR mission, code-named Operation Atalanta, will replace the four-vessel NATO armada currently patrolling one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.
The EU flotilla will include six warships and three reconnaissance planes, with a total crew of 1,200.
The eight contributing nations are Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Greece, Sweden, Spain, and the Netherlands.
British Rear Admiral Philip Jones will co-ordinate the operation from his headquarters near London, while Greek Commodore Antonios Papaioannou will run anti-piracy activities in theatre.
Operating under a UN mandate, EU NAVFOR's specific tasks include protecting vessels of the World Food Programme, as well as merchantmen cruising off the Somali coast.
It will also keep watch over areas in which there are dangers to maritime traffic and will take necessary measures aimed at terminating piracy and armed robbery where it patrols.
"The rules of engagement are very robust, with the possibility of using all means including force to protect [against], to deter and to prosecute all acts of piracy," EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said on Monday. The fate of any captured pirates, though, remains an open question.
"The EU is reviewing agreements whereby suspects could be taken by third countries that are willing and in a position to launch criminal proceedings," German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told AFP.
India, Malaysia, Russia and the United States are among the nations that already have ships patrolling in the area, where piracy has surged since July.
Somali pirates are currently holding captive the crews of 14 hijacked ships, totalling 290 seamen.
The Saudi supertanker Sirius Star was carrying oil worth more than 78m euros when pirates overpowered its crew last month, making it the biggest vessel ever hijacked.
Experts say the pirates have not only increased their attacks but have also significantly expanded their operational area in recent months.
"Previously the pirates were attacking off southern Somalia, but now you are seeing attacks 400 to 500miles (640 to 800km) from the Kenyan coast ... and they are going even as far off as Tanzania," Noel Choong, head of the Malaysian-based International Maritime Bureau piracy reporting centre, told AFP.
Jones has indicated that the EU anti-piracy mission under his command could station armed guards on freighters seen as likely targets of hijacking.
Macedonia's school system undergoes reforms
Macedonian children are now entering school at age 6 instead of 7, and English will be part of the core curriculum from the first grade.
By Zoran Nikolovski for Southeast European Times in Skopje - 04/09/07

More than 300,000 young people hoisted their bookbags and headed for the classroom Monday (September 3rd) as the primary and secondary school year kicked off in Macedonia.
Approximately 23,000 first graders are becoming the first to enter a new primary education system.
Under the new system, children will begin first grade a year earlier, at 6 instead of 7, and attend nine rather than eight years of primary school.
The changes aim to bring Macedonia in line with many West European countries, where students start school at 6 and, in some countries, even 5 years of age.
However, the reform has caused some difficulties.
Most schools in the country were built to accommodate a smaller number of students, and for now the school authorities must cope with restricted space.
Nevertheless, the education ministry says instruction will proceed as planned.
Conditions will improve over time, Education Minister Sulejman Rusiti told reporters.
Many problems with school facilities have been solved in the last ten months and the process will continue, he added.
The country's educational authorities have completed a new curriculum, and new textbooks have been published.
The first grade curriculum is preparatory.
In the first semester, the young students will mostly socialise and learn to adapt to the new environment.
The second semester will introduce the basics of writing and the use of textbooks, slowly adjusting first graders to the new teaching material.
A major innovation in the educational system is the introduction of English as a compulsory subject in the first grade.
In collaboration with the British Council, a team of 18 trainers have themselves received training.
They will then go on to train 190 English teachers who will work in the schools.
Macedonia suffers from a shortage of primary-school English teachers.
Although the country has sufficient numbers of qualified instructors, it is hard to attract them to the school system, where wages are low.
Market demand for their English skills has increased in better-paid fields.
In first grade, the plan is to teach English without textbooks through games and drawings, and with simple aids such as pictures and abacuses.
English composition instruction will begin in second grade.
Economic, political and institutional adjustments needed for countries joining the EU
As Balkan countries move closer to their goal of EU accession, they must confront the economic implications of joining the bloc.
Economist and former Romanian Finance Minister Daniel Daianu outlines some of the issues at stake.
By Daniel Daianu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest -- 14/08/06
Despite worries about the EU's commitment to the enlargement process, the Balkan countries still appear to be moving closer to their accession goals. [File]
Two countries in Southeast Europe -- Romania and Bulgaria -- are expected to join the Union on 1 January 2007.
Another, Croatia, is likely to be put on a faster track.
Despite worries about the EU's commitment to the enlargement process, the Balkan countries still appear to be moving closer to their accession goals.
Assuming that remains the case, it will be up to regional governments to make the necessary economic, institutional and political adjustments.
Let us consider, for instance, the implications for economic policy.
To begin with, it is important to distinguish between a "functioning market economy" and one that has the capacity to absorb shocks in a highly competitive environment, as is the case with the Union. Moreover, economic competitiveness must be understood in a profounder sense.
Joining the European club demands compliance with a set of rules that dent traditional policy prerogatives.
For instance, free capital movement (liberalisation of the capital account) is a must in the EU, whereas a premature opening is dangerous.
Likewise, new entrants are bound to enter the eurozone sooner or later.
An economy that is not competitive enough would have a very hard time inside the single currency area.
It is imperative for countries joining the EU to have key institutions and mechanisms in place: a financial intermediation sector and an independent central bank, a substantial private sector where property rights are clearly defined and protected, a functioning judiciary and enforceable laws.
Being able to fight corruption and organised crime effectively is also a prerequisite.
The economy needs to be stable.
That means bringing down inflation to a reasonable level in a consistent manner, and maintaining low budget deficits while quasi-fiscal deficits are under control.
Premises for economic stability are the operation of hard budget constraints and the spread of good governance practices in both the public and the private sectors.
Low budget deficits imply coming to grips with the ballooning pressure on the pension system.
Public utilities are an important area of concern.
It is unwise to privatise them blindly.
As a matter of fact, there are utilities which should stay in the public domain; what has to be done in their case is to introduce good governance.
Those utilities which are turned over to private hands need to be well-regulated, so that consumers are not abused by excessive tariffs.
Building a stable economy is one of the major challenges facing many candidate countries. [EU]
However, some cautionary remarks qualifying the above observations are needed.
The fact is that economic policymaking always involves tradeoffs.
Low annual inflation, at rates of 2 per cent to 3 per cent, is not easy to achieve in economies that are catching up, where income per capita is 5 to 10 times lower than the average EU figure (in PPP terms).
In more rapidly growing economies, demand pressures collide with disinflation.
This can also happen because prices of domestic services (non-tradeables) go up unabatedly -- the so called Balassa-Samuelson effect.
As in Central and Eastern Europe, the Balkan economies have grown by more than 5 per cent on average in recent years.
It is fair to acknowledge, however, that sustained growth asks for more fixed capital formation and human capital investment.
The currently low budget deficits may be misleading for two reasons.
One is that they are likely to hide chronic serious under-funding of essential public goods, such as infrastructure, education and health care.
Another reason is that after entry in the EU the new members have to boost public spending for the sake of complying with their obligations under the acquis.
Therefore, one may confront situations where budget deficits get out of control.
Unless policymakers succeed in improving tax collection and reforming the welfare state (including the pension system) rising budget deficits can cripple overall economic stability.
Rising deficits with growing current account deficits are not an anomaly in rapidly expanding emerging economies.
Actually, current account deficits are increasing in most of Central and Eastern Europe because of economic growth differentials, compared to the older members of the EU, and surging bank credit extended to the private sector.
Against the background of capital account liberalisation, current account deficits that are not financed mainly by inward direct investment bring significant risks.
It is the size of external deficits that complicates the task of policymakers when they have to decide on what is a prudent budget policy.
This explains why the IMF has insisted that Bulgaria should run a surplus budget -- current account deficits have gone beyond 12 per cent of GDP lately and the currency board does not permit a fluctuation of the exchange rate.
Here we return to the issue of competitiveness.
Because capital inflows can be quite substantial, or inflation differentials fairly high, the exchange rate may become excessively over-appreciated.
This can erode competitiveness and destroy jobs.
The effect would be particularly bad in economies that are plagued by very high unemployment, as in the Western Balkans.
Low wages are not a panacea when Chinese and other Asian goods flood European markets.
To a large extent, globalisation annuls the competitive advantage of low wages in Europe.
The transfer of new information and communication technologies, combined with heavy investment in human capital buildup, are a must for securing long-term competitiveness.
Last but not least, massive migration can bring about important benefits, but it can also be a nuisance.
Large remittances (to the tune of billions of euros for Romania and Bulgaria) can finance between 25 per cent and 40 per cent of trade deficits.
But they imply the loss of highly skilled labour and, in numerous cases, disruption of family life.
This said, for economies that suffer from huge unemployment, such as those in the Western Balkans, labour export is positive in net terms.
The bottom line is that policymakers in the Western Balkans must look beyond the economic numbers of recent years, understand the deep currents at work, be pragmatic, and learn from the experiences of current EU members, both old and new.
Impact of fires on Greece's upcoming elections not yet clear
With New Democracy still ahead in the polls, smaller parties appear to have benefitted the most from public outrage.

The Greek flag is flying at half-staff on public buildings, as the final death toll from five days of devastating fires rose to 65.
With the assistance of 13 countries, the fires have finally been put out.
Given the scope of the disaster, many expected significant political fallout.
Thousands lost their homes as villages were consumed.
The blazes destroyed 500,000 acres of forests and farmland and more than 4.5 million olive trees.
Countless domestic animals perished.
The inferno, the worst the country has seen in a century, came just weeks before early general elections scheduled for September 16th.
While Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis and his ruling New Democracy (ND) party blamed arsonists and "environmental terrorists", parties across the political spectrum focused their ire on the government's handling of the crisis, accusing it of incompetence.
Surveys taken after the fires, however, all pointed to an interesting phenomenon.
Despite the barrage of criticism, ND remains ahead in the polls, by a margin of anywhere from 0.7% to 3.5%.
The same surveys suggest that two-thirds of the population were not happy with the way the fires were managed, and one out of two think it's mainly the government's fault.
Nevertheless, the ruling party has lost only one or two percentage points.
PASOK, the main opposition party, does not appear to have benefitted politically from the situation.
It ruled the country for more than a decade before being defeated by the ND in March 2004, and has been faulted for neglecting to amend weak environmental protection laws while in power.
Taking advantage of public anger, far-right extremists and other fringe parties are seen as making the best of the current situation, drawing concern that they could enter parliament for the first time.
Smaller parties are among those favoured.
When asked, many voters of the two main parties seem to have drifted to marginal left- and right-wing parties, while about 11% say they are undecided.
"These fires have seen the popularity of the smaller parties rise," a report Tuesday (September 4th) by the British daily Independent quoted Dimitris Sotiropoulos, a senior analyst at the regional think-tank Eliamep, as saying.
"This is as a result of the incapability of the state to prevent the fires, then to deal with them and finally to resolve the situation."
Widely circulated emails and blog posts are urging people to vote for anyone but the two main parties.
Such calls express a general feeling among Greeks that it was not just the current government's fault that there was no infrastructure to handle these fires.
Rather, many believe, this was a failure of successive past governments as well.
Politically, this means that five parties could make it into parliament.
Greece could soon find itself with a weak government, dependent on an alliance with smaller political forces.

Kosovo gets first woman president
Atifete Jahjaga will head the country following a landmark deal among the major parties.

In an unprecedented development, the main political parties in Kosovo have joined together and agreed on a new president.
Their choice was the deputy director of the Kosovo police, General Major Atifete Jahjaga. Following parliament's vote Thursday evening (April 7th), she becomes Kosovo's first female head of state.
Jahjaga easily defeated a rival candidate, Suzane Novoberdaliu, garnering 80 votes out of 100 deputies who participated.
Only one round of voting was needed.
All parliamentary parties, except for Vetevendosja, participated in the session.
"My career reflects the changes Kosovo went through during the last decade," Jahjaga told deputies after taking the presidential oath.
She voiced her support for the ongoing talks between Kosovo and Serbia.
"As we can not change the past, we will build the future, learning from the mistakes of the past," Jahjaga said.
She was the joint candidate of three parties -- the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK), the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) and the Alliance for New Kosovo (AKR).
The head of Radio Free Europe's Kosovo bureau, Arbana Vidishiqi, told SETimes that the deal "marks an important step towards political compromise, something that Kosovo has lacked lately".
Jahjaga "certainly has a good start, having in mind the political support she begins with", Vidishiqi said.
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said that what seemed impossible has now been achieved.
International representatives in Kosovo also welcomed the political deal, with US Ambassador Christopher Dell saying the country has navigated a difficult period that tested the strength and the viability of its young institutions.
"Not only did the structures and institutions stand up to the pressures, but your leaders proved they are capable of putting the interests of the nation ahead of their personal or their partisan interests," Dell said.
"At a time when Kosovo's institutions have been damaged and many question whether Kosovo is capable of providing justice for its people, I believe Atifete Jahjaga will be an important symbol of the country's commitment to justice, and that her presidency will mark the beginning of a new and constructive chapter in this country's history," he added.
Not all politicians, however, were happy about the outcome.
Parliament Speaker Jakup Krasniqi says the agreement was anti-constitutional and he accused Thaci of breaching the party statute.
Krasniqi had been serving as acting president ever since a court ruling led to Behgjet Pacolli's resignation as head of state last month.
Meanwhile, Vetevendosja deputy Visar Ymeri blasted the deal among the main parties as antidemocratic.
Jahjaga's presidency "will be the product of a party agreement which brings an end to Kosovo as a republic", he claimed.
Turkish Cypriot, Greek Cypriot leaders agree on single sovereignty, citizenship
Rival Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot leaders agreed "in principle" on the key issues of the decades-long Cyprus standoff, raising hopes for a comprehensive settlement soon.
By Ayhan Simsek for Southeast European Times -- 03/07/08
Cypriot President Demitris Christofias (right) and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat agreed on some key issues. [Getty Images]
"[The two leaders] discussed the issues of single sovereignty and citizenship, on which they agreed in principle," the UN disclosed on Tuesday (July 1st), following a meeting between the leaders of the divided Mediterranean island, Greek Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat. "They agreed to discuss the details of their implementation during the full-fledged negotiations," the UN continued.
The surprise announcement generated mixed reactions and expectations throughout Cyprus.
The sovereignty dispute and citizenship questions have been the thorniest issues on the island.
The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus has long demanded a "confederation" to protect the rights of Turkish Cypriots.
Violence in the 1960s forced many of them into enclaves throughout the island.
They therefore oppose any strong unitary government under Greek Cypriot control.
Preservation of the single sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus, though, has been a key position of the Greek Cypriots.
The last major effort to unify Cyprus, namely the Annan Plan, which Turkish Cypriots approved but Greek Cypriots vetoed in 2004, envisioned a "single international sovereignty" but provided a guarantee for Turkish islanders by also recognising a "constituent Turkish Cypriot state".
The details of Tuesday's agreement on single sovereignty were not immediately clear.
Analysts say the UN has deliberately preferred "constructive ambiguity" on sovereignty and citizenship in order to encourage negotiations.
Tuesday's agreement constitutes a shift for the Turkish Cypriots, but with this move Talat pushed Christofias to agree on the quick resumption of full-fledged negotiations.
So far the Greek Cypriot government has slowed the process and insisted on comprehensive preparations before the start of talks.
Turkish Cypriot nationalists criticised Talat on Tuesday, for accepting -- though in principle -- single sovereignty, which they said meant "crossing the red line" of the Turkish Cypriots' historical cause.
The ruling Republican Democratic Party, however, considered the meeting a disappointment, since the Greek Cypriots displayed no real interest in rapidly starting comprehensive talks.
Christofias came under pressure from his own hard-liners.
Greek Cypriots long fought granting citizenship to Turks who migrated to northern Cyprus in the last three decades, but Christofias recently expressed readiness to accept 50,000 Turkish immigrants.
Turkish Cypriot Parliament Speaker Fatma Ekenoğlu called Tuesday's meeting a good first step.
"The details of the issues of sovereignty and citizenship will be determined once the negotiations start," she said.
The Greek Cypriot-ruled Republic of Cyprus became an EU member in 2004, but the northern part of the island sees no benefits from membership, since the EU follows the international practice of not recognising the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state.
Turkish and Greek Cypriot leaders will meet again on July 25th.
Macedonia, Kosovo border to be marked by summer's end
The disputed 150km-long border between Macedonia and Kosovo has posed a problem since Macedonia's independence in 1991.

Seen as a precursor to recognising Kosovo's independence, the demarcation of the Macedonia-Kosovo border began this week.
Workmen laid the first boundary stone on the northern border of Macedonia with Kosovo on Monday (June 30th) in a pyramid set up by officials where the borders of Macedonia, Kosovo and Albania meet. The 150km-long border has gone unmarked since Macedonia's independence in 1991.
"This is a joint process ... and we expect it will be solved in the best way possible," Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu said on Monday.
Macedonia and Serbia signed an agreement defining their border in 2001, but Kosovo has refused to recognise the stretch between itself and Macedonia.
Defining the boundary between the two states was part of former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan in 2007.
Officials in Pristina say that recognition of Kosovo's independence is necessary and must precede demarcation.
However, the Macedonian government required the demarcation first.
After a protracted exchange of messages among Skopje, Pristina and Belgrade, construction teams have finally come out in the field.
Skopje sought to quickly mark the border; however, Pristina questioned the status of around 2,000 ha of forest and pastureland in two regions, and Belgrade insisted on the presence of its representatives before any demarcation occurred.
The standstill ended after the Skopje and Pristina authorities formed a joint demarcation commission at the end of March.
According to Todor Nanev, chairman of the Macedonian Commission for Demarcation of the Border, crews laid the six main stones on the first 12km section of the border.
They also are installing concrete numbered pyramids on the border.
Officials expect completion of the demarcation over the summer, with the pace depending on weather conditions in the mountainous terrain, Macedonian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vasko Andonovski said.
According to local media, the demarcation started out of public view and it is unclear whether any changes have been made to the 2001 marking.
Science and Technology: Meteors soar over Sofia

Thousands rushed to the Vitosha Mountain near the Bulgarian capital on Thursday (August 12th) night to watch a meteor shower called the Perseids.
The phenomenon, which happens every year in the hot summer months, was particularly spectacular this year with 100 falling stars per hour.
An exhibition called "1,001 Inventions" will open in Turkey on Tuesday (August 17th).
Held in Istanbul's Sultanahmet Square, it will display the Muslim world's most significant scientific discoveries and highlight their contributions to the modern world.
Istanbul's Sabiha Gokcen International Airport is hosting the "Tales from the Future" project this month in Turkey. Industrial robots play percussion instruments during the event, which is part of a sound installation called "One City, 1,000 Sounds", an initiative of the Istanbul 2010 European Capital of Culture programme.
Vranje will become the first town in Serbia to stop using plastic bags by September.
Following a decision by the city council, the bags will be replaced by biodegradable ones.
It is estimated that it takes from 400 to 1,000 years for a plastic bag to decompose.
Students from Serbia, Israel, Germany, Spain and Croatia took part in an international summer science camp organised by Serbia's Petnica Science Centre from August 2nd to 15th.
The programme taught young people how to do scientific research and offered various theoretical lectures along with laboratory exercises.
Croatia hosted the 18th World Congress on Medical Law from August 8th to 12th.
The event brought about 400 experts from 57 countries to Zagreb.
One of the main topics discussed was the effective management of health systems in Europe and around the globe.
The Central Public Library of Greece's northern city of Veria received a $1m award from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation on Thursday (August 12th). The 2010 Access to Learning Award went to the library for its creative use of information and technology services to meet the needs of more than 180,000 people.
All 60 main and high courts in Serbia began operating under a unified Case Management System as of Thursday (August 12th).
The system automates the conducting of lawsuits and was first introduced at the Commercial Court in Valjevo.
It was delivered in 2009 with joint financing provided by the justice ministry and the World Bank.
Archaeologists unearthed a temple at the city's Acropolis at the ancient site of Heraion-Teikhos in the western Turkish province of Tekirdag earlier this month.
It belonged to the ancient Thracian civilisation and was previously believed to have disappeared in a fire in 2 B.C.
Scientific development will become one of the main priorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Science and Technology Minister Bakir Ajanovic said on Wednesday (August 11th).
The goal is to improve the country's 107th ranking in the 2008-2009 Global Competitiveness Index, he said.

Serbia enjoys its winter traditions
The Orthodox Church's Julian calendar allows members to celebrate not one, but two, New Years.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade – 09/01/06

The Serbian Orthodox Church still adheres to the Julian calendar, which gives Serbs the chance to celebrate New Year's Day twice: once with the rest of the world on December 31st and again on January 13th.
However, the differing calendars pose a certain problem for the church: namely, at a time when the faithful should be fasting before the Orthodox Christmas on Wednesday (January 7th), many of them are celebrating the New Year instead, according to the secular Gregorian calendar.
In communist-era Serbia, before the introduction of the multiparty system, observance of religious holidays could represent political dissent. Under the Milosevic regime of the 1990s, opposition parties often turned public celebrations of the so-called Serbian New Year into rallies against the then-Serbian and Yugoslav president.
Now, however, public New Year's Day celebrations are a big draw for Serbian tourism, because people from the former Yugoslav republics swarm to Serbia -- particularly Belgrade -- by the tens of thousands to enjoy the festivities.
Christmas is the holiday richest in Serb customs.
Serbs consider it a holiday spent with family.
Instead of the usual greetings, at Christmas people greet each other with "Christ is born" and "Indeed he is born" in reply.
Christmas Eve is called Badnji Dan (the Day of Badnja).
The term purportedly stems from the name of a deity worshipped by the old polytheistic Serbs, Badnja.
When they converted to Christianity, according to folk tales, the Serbs threw wooden statues of Badnja into a fire.
That is the origin of burning the badnjak, a dry oak branch, on Christmas Eve.
One end of the branch is smeared with honey, which children lick.
This custom also holds another kind of symbolism -- by warming themselves around the burning branch, members of a household warm themselves with love, honesty and unity.
Before Christmas, they cover the floors of their home with straw, symbolising Jesus Christ's birthplace.
Families bake a special bread, called chesnica, for Christmas, placing a gold or silver coin in the dough as a gift to Christ.
Each family member receives a slice.
Superstition holds that the year will be fruitful if it snows on Christmas Day.
Rain or a sudden rise in temperature is a bad sign.
Starting some kind of project after Christmas lunch enables diligence and success through the coming year.
Romania's Moldavia cherishes winter food traditions
Though Romania's northeast region, Moldavia, is known as the poorest part of the country, it is also famous for hospitality and warmth -- especially during the winter holidays.
By Paul Ciocoiu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest - 09/01/06

Hospitality is legendary in Romania's Moldavia region, located in the northeast of the country.
It is commonly said that anyone crossing a threshold there is sure to receive a warm welcome.
Small wonder that the greatest Romanian poet, Mihai Eminescu, and the renowned storyteller Ion Creanga, hail from this region, which is replete with winter traditions and cuisine.
The holidays start with the traditional pig slaughter, an increasingly controversial affair since Romania's EU accession.
Rural dwellers slaughter a pig on Ignat Day, December 20th.
According to folklore, a pig must die that day -- otherwise, it will dream of its own death that night, putting an end to the fattening process.
A fat pig attests to the breeder's prosperity and hard work.
Pork is basic to many dishes in Moldavia.
Sour borscht and mixed pork organs roasted in a stove, the latter usually accompanied by red wine and homemade sheep cheese, become tochitura moldoveneasca.
Moldavians also make sarmale, a mixture of pork, rice and different vegetables all wrapped in either a cabbage or a vine leaf and then boiled in sour raw borscht.
This dish is a must for any special family event.
Whatever food may be on the table, corn polenta (mamaliguta) and the pickles are customary.
Caltabosi is a thick sausage, normally pig intestines stuffed with pork, rice and onions.
Moldavians also combine chicken and pork to form racituri, a jelly-like dish with a strong garlicky flavour.
Poale-n brau and turta cu julfa are typical Moldavian desserts.
The first is a local cheese pie baked in the oven, while the second contains thin dough layers baked on a stovetop and then sprinkled with honey and walnuts.
The layers are put together to form a big cake.
Cozonac, a sponge-like cake adorned with raisins and walnuts, is the most common dessert on Christmas and Easter.
Moldavians cherish their winter customs, many of which originate in the distant past.
On New Year's Eve, groups of men and children go from house to house to wish the locals an auspicious year in a traditional procession called plugusorul (the little plough).
The well-wishers sing, blow whistles and pipes and ring little bells.
The next day, they return to sprinkle grains of wheat that symbolise fertility, health and purity.
Typical for the region is another custom in which someone wears a genuine or mock bearskin and dances to the music of a pipe.
Business: Albanians embrace holiday travel
Albanians spent twice as much on travel in 2009 than the year before.

Albanians spent 453m euros on tourism from July to September last year, or 54% more compared to 2008, the Bank of Albania announced on Tuesday (February 2nd).
The figures are a result of increased number of tourists travelling abroad.
In late March, Slovenia's home appliances manufacturer Gorenje will start making refrigerators and freezers at its factory in Valjevo, Serbia, according to media reports Tuesday (February 2nd).
The Serbian factory opened in 2006.
The Croatian government will call a tender by February 15th for the privatisation of five shipyards.
The state will offer majority stakes in Brodotrogir (95.24%), Kraljevica (99.54%), 3 Maj (83.82%), and Brodogradjevna Industrija Split (99.78%) at a starting price of 1 kuna.
The Irish realty company West Incorporated purchased the Telephone Palace in Sofia for 22.5m euros, local media reported on Monday (February 1st).
The building was the property of Vivacom, the former state telecommunications company.
In 2009, Vivacom put more than 100 of its properties on the market to clear debt.
The Romanian Central Bank (BNR) lowered the monetary policy rate by 0.5% on Wednesday (February 3rd), to 7%, according to an official statement.
The cut was anticipated and is the second this year.
BNR cut the rate by 0.5% in early January.
Russia's veterinary authorities lifted a five-year-old ban on Turkish poultry, effective Monday (February 1st).
The decision was prompted by the "stabilisation of the avian flu situation in Turkey".
A ban on importing live chickens, eggs and chicken feed remains.
About 10m euros from Macedonia's 2010 budget will be invested in the country's rural development programme, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy announced on Saturday (January 30th).
The money will be used to improve competitiveness, modernise small farms, strengthen rural infrastructure, and promote rural tourism.
Applications for financing of activities under the programme are being accepted until the end of February.

Russian gas supplies to four Balkan nations halted
Russian natural gas deliveries to Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia and Turkey came to a complete halt early Tuesday during a deepening payment dispute between Russia and Ukraine, which has cut gas supplies to other European countries as well.
(AFP, BBC, International Herald Tribune, The Sofia Echo, Dnevnik, Focus News Agency, Nine O'clock, Zaman - 06/01/09; Reuters, AP, DPA, Bloomberg, UPI, FT, The Times, VOA, Mediapool, Agerpres, B92 - 05/01/09)

Bulgaria is facing a gas crisis, Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev said on Tuesday (January 6th), just hours after all Russian gas deliveries to the Balkan nation and three of its neighbours ended.
Bulgaria fell victim to the bitter price dispute between Russia's Gazprom and Ukraine, according to the prime minister, who held an emergency cabinet meeting.
"As of 3:30 am, supplies ... to Bulgaria as well as the transit to Turkey, Greece and Macedonia have been suspended" at the Ukrainian-Romanian border, the Bulgarian energy and economy ministry stated.
Bulgaria relies on Russia for almost 100% of its natural gas needs.
Its sole storage depot in Chiren can cover only a third of the country's daily needs.
Dimitar Gogov, the head of Bulgargaz, urged the company's big customers to curb consumption and consider switching quickly to alternative energy sources.
Gazprom cut off deliveries to Ukraine on January 1st following the breakdown of negotiations on Ukraine's unpaid gas bills and a supply contract for 2009.
The dispute comes three years after another squabble and cutoff of gas deliveries to the Russian neighbour.
Romania has seen a drop in supply too.
"Imports of Russian gas are now reduced by around 75%," Ioan Rusu, the head of Romania's state-controlled Transgaz pipeline operator, told Reuters on Tuesday.
Romania's overall natural gas reserves reportedly stand at 2.2 billion cubic m.
Bucharest assured households on Monday the reduction of Russian gas imports would not affect them.
Turkey and Greece have also reported drops in their natural gas supplies.
Alarmed representatives of the 27 EU nations held an emergency meeting in Brussels on Monday.
The DPA said an increasing number of EU nations believe that "Russia and Ukraine are discrediting themselves as reliable energy sources." Member states from Central and Eastern Europe in particular stressed the pressing need to diversify supply sources and strengthen energy security.
The EU relies on Russia for about a quarter of its overall gas consumption.
EU foreign ministers meeting in Prague on Thursday will further discuss the crisis.
Naftogaz, the Ukrainian state gas company, issued a warning Tuesday that nine European countries, including Germany, Hungary and Poland, would soon experience a drop in gas supplies.
"[Gazprom has] reduced deliveries to 92m cubic m per 24 hours compared to the promised 221m cubic m without explanation," Naftogaz spokesman Valentin Zemlyansky said.
The new reduction of deliveries via Ukraine came after Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's meeting on Monday with Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller, who reportedly recommended the move to punish Ukraine for allegedly siphoning off gas.
"Start reducing it from today," Putin reportedly told Miller.
Serbian elections crucial for country's EU perspective
The choice facing Serbia as it prepares for elections on January 21st is a stark one.
With ultranationalists led by a Hague indictee likely to win the largest single bloc of votes, the oft-quarreling democratic parties are under pressure to overcome their differences.

The upcoming parliamentary elections in Serbia, scheduled for January 21st, could turn out to be crucial for the country's European future.
Public opinion polls give the parties of the democratic bloc only a slight advantage among voters against the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) and the Socialist Party of Serbia, which represent the political legacy of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
Six years after the ouster of Milosevic, who died of a heart attack in a Hague tribunal prison cell on March 11th, the democratic parties find themselves facing three major challenges. The status of Kosovo, the southern Serbian province that has been under UN administration since 1999, will most likely be resolved after the elections.
After that, if a new democratic government is in power, it will have to deliver former Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladic, indicted for genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to The Hague tribunal.
At the same time, the new government will have to make a major effort to resume negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU.
These were interrupted in May of this year, due to the failure to extradite Mladic.
According to a recent opinion poll by the Medium Gallup agency, the largest bloc of seats in the new parliament is likely to be won by the far-right SRS, whose leader Vojislav Seselj is awaiting trial at The Hague.
The poll suggests the Radicals would win 34.9% of votes, giving them as many as 102 of the 250 seats in parliament.
"I expect the victory of the democratic forces, the victory of a policy that is defined by one goal -- membership in the EU and improvement of the citizens' living standards," Serbian President Boris Tadic said of the elections. [Getty Images]
Second in popularity is Serbian President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party, with about 22.9% of the vote.
In third place is Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia, with 13.9%.
The Socialists, who will be selecting their first party president since Milosevic at a congress early this month, have 5.6%. Former Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic's G17 Plus has about 5.2%.
Various parties representing ethnic minorities are also likely to cross the parliamentary threshold.
With this balance of power, the democratic parties could form a government only if they arrange a coalition of all the representatives that enter the new parliament, other than those from the Radical and Socialist parties.
In order to strengthen their positions, the Democrats have joined a coalition with the regional Bosniak party in Serbia, the Sandzak Democratic Party.
Meanwhile, the DPS has forged an alliance with several regional parties from central Serbia.
Because these elections are potentially so important, the international community has moved to provide support to the democratic parties.
Martti Ahtisaari, the UN special envoy for the status of Kosovo, postponed the announcement of a status resolution until after the vote is held.
Many Western analysts and media sources have said Ahtisaari is likely to propose some sort of conditional independence for Kosovo.
This could wreak political havoc within Serbia; hence Ahtisaari's decision to put off revealing his blueprint for the future.
The EU has also been sending signals.
The Belgrade-based news agency Tanjug reported the details of an informal document drafted by the Finnish EU presidency, stating that over the coming days Serbian citizens will be sent a clear message regarding their European prospects.
Serbia was invited to join NATO's Partnership for Peace programme at the Riga summit last week. [Getty Images]
The document foresees the intensification of meetings between political and economic leaders, acceleration of the talks on visa benefits, and the beginning of the realisation of financial programs from the EU pre-accession funds -- all part of a bid to strengthen relations between the EU and Belgrade.
In the most recent development, NATO concluded its summit in Riga with an invitation to Serbia -- along with its former state union partner Montenegro, as well as Bosnia and Herzegovina -- to join the Partnership for Peace, a first step towards eventual membership in the Alliance.
For years, membership in PfP had been explicitly linked to co-operation with The Hague tribunal, and in particular to the capture and extradition of Mladic.
The dramatic change in policy -- which shocked chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte -- sends a strong message that the West is concerned about sustaining the democratic process in Serbia.
Reformist politicians have repeatedly cautioned that the political future will be bleak if they cannot deliver anything but bad news on the foreign policy front.
The international community appears to have heeded this warning.
When he announced the elections, Tadic said that on January 21st Serbia will be choosing between a European future and a return to the not so distant "dark past" of the Milosevic era. "I expect the victory of the democratic forces, the victory of a policy that is defined by one goal – membership in the EU and improvement of the citizens' living standards," he said.
In less than two months, Serbian voters will show whether or not he was right.
And the world will be watching.
Greek Court Approves Extradition of Djindjic Murder Suspect
A Greek court has approved the extradition to Serbia-Montenegro of a key suspect in the March 2003 assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.

A Greek appeals court has ruled that Dejan Milenkovic, a key suspect in the March 2003 assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, should be extradited to Serbia-Montenegro.
"The appeals court council ruled in favour of Milenkovic's extradition," the AFP quoted a court official as saying in Thessaloniki on Monday (23 August).
Milenkovic was arrested in the northern port city on 16 July on an international warrant, after more than 15 months on the run.
A police chief said that at the time of his detention, he was carrying a travel bag with "a lot of money", but was unarmed and had no identification papers on him.
Less than two weeks following the arrest, Belgrade sent a formal extradition request to Greek authorities.
In addition to the more than 100 pages of documentation accompanying the original request, Belgrade has since provided other material, including copies of the laws under which the suspect has been charged.
Milenkovic, 34, did not use his right to appeal the Greek court's ruling, saying he was willing to face trial at home and prove his innocence.
It was not immediately clear when the extradition will take place.
According to an AFP report, it must first be approved formally by Greek Justice Minister Anastassios Papaligouras.
Following his return to Serbia, Milenkovic is expected to appear before a special organised crime court that is trying the suspects in the Djindjic assassination case.
Milenkovic, also known as Bugsy, is among 13 alleged crime bosses and paramilitary officers charged with involvement in the killing of Serbia's first democratically elected prime minister since World War II.
Serbian prosecutors say he was a member of the Zemun Clan organised crime group, believed to have orchestrated the plot against Djindjic.
Five of the 13 suspects -- including Zvezdan Jovanovic, the man believed to have fired the fatal shot -- are now on trial at the special court in Belgrade.
Milorad Lukovic, a former paramilitary commander and the alleged mastermind of the assassination plot, surrendered to police in May, about five months after the trial started.
Djindjic was killed by sniper fire as he stepped from his car outside the Serbian government headquarters on 12 March 2003.
Milenkovic is also the key suspect in a failed attempt on Djindjic's life on 21 February 2003.
The truck he was driving swerved into the lane in which Djindjic's motorcade was traveling and nearly hit the car carrying the prime minister.
Shortly after his arrest he was released and then disappeared.
Attributing the prolonged extradition to a technical error, Serbian Justice Minister Zoran Stojakovic said Milenkovic's trial would likely be postponed "to give his defence team more time to prepare their case".
The aim of Djindjic's assassination, according to Serbian authorities, was to overthrow Serbia's pro-Western government and to return allies of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to power.
Djindjic, who was instrumental in Milosevic's extradition to The Hague, wanted to improve Serbia's co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal and to crack down on organised crime in his country.
Bulgarian Authorities Target Tax Evasion
The average monthly income in Bulgaria is only 100 euros, yet Sofia and other cities are home to trendy cars and luxurious villas.
The widespread discrepancy between declared incomes and highly visible assets has resulted in nationwide inspections.

At a recent press conference, chief Bulgarian Tax Director Nikolai Popov revealed some intriguing details concerning tax evasion.
A series of 62 inspections conducted in April found that only 14 per cent of the country's most affluent citizens properly report their assets to tax authorities.
As a result, unpaid taxes cost Bulgaria 3m euros, or 30,000 euros per individual tax evader.
Three years ago, authorities launched "Operation Mosquito", followed by two similar operations.
The aim was to compare declarations with actual assets.
Officials set out to inspect all real estate worth more than 50,000 euros and all luxury cars worth over 30,000 euros.
More than 200,000 affluent Bulgarians were originally selected for auditing, but because of budget constraints that figure was reduced to 1200.
The investigations have turned up dramatic examples of fraud and evasion, according to Popov.
In one case, a family owning a sumptuous, 1500 square meter villa situated in one of Sofia's poshest neighbourhoods has never declared any income whatsoever.
In another, the owner of a luxurious home explained his sudden wealth by claiming to have stumbled on buried treasure in his garden.
Luxury cars, meanwhile, are often registered in Germany or Austria, allowing their owners to avoid paying taxes on them.
Popov's deputy, Valentin Vidolov, told journalists that up to ten teams of tax inspectors are working on the current Mosquito operation, compiling a portfolio of more than 1,000 luxury houses and flats.
Most are owned by businessmen and public officials.
After inspecting the assets of these "hidden millionaires", financial inspectors, in co-operation with the Agency for Financial Intelligence, plan to begin inspecting their real estate in other countries.
Still, this seems a distant prospect.
The Mosquito campaigns are not without their critics, who charge that they lack transparency and independent oversight.
One reason for such opacity may be the presence of corruption among the tax authorities themselves. In a recent survey conducted among 699 officers from all the 28 territorial taxation directorates, 70 per cent of respondents admitted having received small bribes.
The results seemed to confirm a general public perception that tax officers are vulnerable to corruption.
Although authorities take issue with that perception, it is generally true that financial inspectors are low-paid and often come under tremendous pressure to accept money or gifts.
Unless in the months ahead the tax authorities succeed in bringing cases to prosecution, there is a risk that "Operation Mosquito" will amount to little more than a tiny bite.
Macedonia Prepares Urgent Reforms to Meet European Agrarian Standards
Macedonia's Agriculture Ministry has developed a strategy for reforming policies, regulations and institutions to make them more compatible with those of the EU.

Macedonia's Agriculture Ministry has drafted a strategy for the agrarian and food sectors as part of the country's preparations for eventual EU membership.
The government says changes to agricultural policy, institutions and regulations will be implemented starting in September.
"The strategy is based on three principles: not to invest in the existing conditions in the agricultural sector, to define legal regulations on the model of those of the EU, and to base negotiations with the EU on partners' relations, " Minister of Agriculture Slavko Petrov said.
"This is a very significant paper since experience has shown that almost 60 per cent of reforms carried out by EU members during their adjustment periods were in the agricultural sector," he added.
According to officials, the overall transition process in Macedonia has had negative consequences on the farming sector.
The strategy is aimed at improving the unfavourable position of Macedonian agriculture by establishing better training for farmers, improving competitiveness, and allowing the state to allot more resources to the agrarian sector.
The strategy also proposes direct subsidiaries for some branches.
"We have to establish a regular supply of agricultural products and preserve the town-village balance as well as enhance efficiency of production and environmental protection," Petrov said.
A major overhaul is necessary to prepare the country for the effects of opening the borders and lifting customs barriers as part of Macedonia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
As a result of those changes, the government warns, Macedonian products will be subject to stiff competition.
"Even though EU adjustment reforms have long been known, the agricultural sector will have to undergo a radical change," Petrov says. "This should be swift and effective because only in that way agriculture will get access to the Common Agricultural Policy fund amounting to 43 billion euros, which is 50 per cent of the total EU budget."
Dental diplomacy links Balkan neighbours
The long dispute over the name Macedonia has not stopped thousands of Greeks from crossing the border in search of bargains.

Despite the glacial political relations between Athens and Skopje, residents of northern Greece are flocking across the border to find less expensive dental care, as well as other goods and services.
The two Balkan neighbours remain at loggerheads over the name "Macedonia", but that has not stopped ordinary citizens from practicing their brand of economic diplomacy.
According to Greek dental associations, private practices have seen as much as a 50% drop in business due to "dental excursions" to Bitola, Gevgelija or Strumica.
The influence of the ongoing economic crisis is hard to gauge, though it is a growing factor.
Nor is inexpensive dentistry the only draw.
Many also come in search of cheaper petrol, or for recreation and entertainment.
A customs officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, told SETimes that an average of 1,000 Greek citizens pass through the Evzoni border crossing on any given weekday, with the number doubling at the weekend.
"It is the casino in Gevgelija," he said, referring to one of the many gambling establishments north of the border.
He added that 500 Greek citizens, per day on average, cross the Niki border post, further west.
Georgios Xanthopoulos, president of Florina's dentist association, has practiced dentistry for 27 years.
He says the phenomenon of local residents making the 24km drive to Bitola for dental care began after 2000.
"With the economic crisis in Greece, and especially with the situation in state-run dentistry here, people often sacrifice convenience for lower prices," Xanthopoulos told SETimes.
He said many residents of the prefecture of Florina are insured by the civil servant's health fund, including the Public Power Corporation's large workforce.
But the fund has frozen dental care reimbursements at 1994 prices.
Although it costs around 50 euros to fill a tooth cavity, the state-run fund only pays beneficiaries 7 euros, Xanthopoulos said.
In Bitola, he noted, the same procedure costs around 15 euros.
Similarly, a fitted denture costs between 1,000 to 1,200 euros in Florina and Kilkis, but runs as low as 300 euros in Bitola.
A routine root canal procedure is only reimbursed to the tune of 20 euros by the public sector health fund, whereas a Greek dentist charges a minimum of 150 euros.
Among Florina residents who are not insured by the fund, there are "few to zero" instances of medical tourism, Xanthopoulos said.
Foreign physicians can't prescribe medications, treatments or further diagnostic/clinical tests that local funds will approve or reimburse.
The president of the Kilkis prefecture's dentist association, Charalambos Iakovidis, echoes his colleague's assessment.
Iakovidis said he has already given three television interviews on the subject, and agrees business is definitely down because of lower prices available elsewhere.
"People are heading across the border even on foot, as well as in organised coach tours.
The impact on our prefecture is 50% or more," he told SETimes.
Both dental association presidents insisted, however, that facilities are better in Greece and that Greek practitioners are more experienced.
"CE certification exists here for equipment, something that is not required in the neighbouring country because dentists are not obliged to follow EU regulations and bylaws," Xanthopoulos said.
He acknowledged, though, that the cost of living in general is dramatically lower in Bitola compared to Florina.
"That's one reason that you'll even see wedding parties now being organised over there, as there are a lot of people here with relatives in the Bitola region, he said.
Aleksandar Ivanovski, owner of the Estadent dental practice in Bitola, told SETimes that medical visits by Greeks account for a large proportion of his practice, and he attributes the visits to a "combination of quality of service, lower prices and the economic crisis in Greece".
BiH Education Reform Moving Ahead
Education reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina is now a comprehensive effort, with more than 200 organisations working together under the umbrella of the OSCE.
By Beth Kampschror for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 06/01/03
Six pilot schools in Republika Srpska participate in a project to use interactive teaching methods.
A primary school in Tuzla implements a programme where teachers work together to make lesson plans.
At a primary school in Mostar, parents have a Union of School and Home to make sure that parents and the school can communicate.
These are the beginnings of what is now a comprehensive effort to reform education in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
The country's problems with education -- which range from a fragmented system with 13 different education ministries to using outdated teaching methods to lack of access for returnee children -- are now being tackled by more than 200 organisations under the umbrella of the OSCE.
OSCE and local education officials presented a broad education reform agenda to the Peace Implementation Council in Brussels in November.
"This is a very exciting development, to have one strategy for BiH that's endorsed by all the ministries and stakeholders in education," said OSCE education adviser on non-discrimination and access Jo-Anne Bishop, adding that 80 per cent of the working groups' members were Bosnians.
One of the groups involved in education in BiH is the European Commission (EC), which has allocated 19.3m euros to the education sector here since 1996. The EC's Technical Assistance to Education Reform project, which deals with reforming primary and general secondary education, ran a series of workshops this year with groups of teachers, administrators and education ministers.
They came up with many recommendations that were incorporated into the OSCE paper.
Among the recommendations were that general education should last for nine years instead of the current eight, that teachers should use more modern teaching methods than lecturing, that school management could be improved by establishing school boards with more say in how schools are run and that special-needs children should be included in general education, said Jadranka Ruvic, EC social cohesion task manager.
"These are very general recommendations, because this is a very long-lasting process," she said. "It can't be developed within one year."
The education concerns of BiH's minority groups -- among them Roma, Hungarians, Czechs and Ukrainians -- were aired at a recent workshop in Sarajevo organised by the European Centre for Minority Issues.
Ivan Brelak, who represented a Banja Luka-based Ukrainian association, said that the group has taken the initiative to bring in its own language professor for Ukrainian children in Prnjavor, and that this may be the key to addressing the needs of minority schoolchildren throughout the country.
"We're doing this with our own means, on our own initiative, without waiting for the international community or other authorities", he said.
Romania-US deal seen as security milestone
Joining NATO's missile defence system enhances the country's regional role, analysts say.
By Paul Ciocoiu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest -- 15/09/11
Romania has agreed to join a US-NATO missile defense shield system meant to protect the continent against threats. [Reuters]
Romania and the United States signed a missile defence agreement during President Traian Basescu's visit to Washington on Tuesday (September 13th).
The accord is being widely hailed in Bucharest as a major security breakthrough.
It was signed by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her Romanian counterpart, Foreign Affairs Minister Teodor Baconschi.
"Once the agreement is ratified, the United States will build, maintain, and operate in Romania the land-based Aegis Ballistic Missile Defence System … which will help protect the entire continent and augment the security of the United States," Clinton said."With the support of the Romanian parliament and people, we anticipate deploying the completed system as part of the second phase of European missile defence in approximately four years."
"The agreement we have just signed will position Romania as a central player in NATO's evolving missile defence capability," she added.
The two countries first discussed setting up such a system in October 2009, when US Vice-President Joe Biden visited Bucharest.
In February 2010, Washington officially invited Bucharest to join the antimissile shield by hosting SM-3 type ground interceptors.
After seven rounds of negotiations, during which the location of the US military base was established, the text of the agreement was finalised in June 2011.
Addressing the Romanian people, President Basescu highlighted the importance of the accord.
"The agreement, once in place, raises Romania's security level to its highest ever in the country's history," Basescu said.
He also pledged his commitment to publishing the content of the agreement after consultations with the State Department.
"I want to remove any speculation concerning secret annexes.
It is the Romanian State's obligation to inform its citizens about the content of the agreement."
Also during the visit, Basescu and US President Barack Obama signed a Joint Declaration on Strategic Partnership for the 21st Century.
Political analysts in Romania said the country will now be better poised to meet today's security challenges.
"What the US-Romania Ballistic Missile Defence Agreement brings to Romania, with the United States firmly pledging to defend Romania in case of an attack, is a significantly enhanced level of security, one without precedent in the Romanian history," Cristian Campeanu, head of the foreign affairs department at Romania Libera, told SETimes.
"The two countries are moving their political relationship to the next level of co-operation that goes beyond the military-intelligence-security issues that -- until now -- characterised bilateral relations for the most part," he added.
Florin Ciornei, who heads the political department at Evenimentul Zilei and who joined Basescu on the trip to Washington, sees other benefits.
"First and foremost, this agreement definitively removes the suspicions of those who claimed Eastern Europe is ignored by the Obama Administration," he told SETimes.
"Secondly, it gives Romania more geopolitical weight in the Black Sea and even among the European states since the system also serves the rest of the continent," he added. "Romania gets a major role at NATO's southeastern borders."
"In terms of public perception, President Obama's declared support for a change in legislation so that Romania can join the visa waiver programme is appealing to Romanians who have waited for the visas to be lifted for years," Ciornei concluded.
Press Freedom in the Balkans: Where it Stands
Most of the countries in Southeast Europe rank among the top 45 in the first worldwide press freedom index, published recently by a Paris-based group, Reporters Without Borders.
(Novinite.com - 25/10/02; RFE/RL - 24/10/02; Reporters Without Borders, BBC - 23/10/02)
Most of the countries in Southeast Europe (SEE) rank among the top 45 in the first worldwide press freedom index, published recently by a Paris-based group, Reporters Without Borders (RWB).
The index ranks 139 countries according to their respect for press freedom.
One of the conclusions drawn from the survey that produced the index is that media freedom depends on a country's material prosperity: a democratically elected government does not guarantee press freedom.
The index was compiled on the basis of answers given by journalists, researchers and legal experts to 50 questions covering the whole range of press freedom violations - arrests and killings of journalists, censorship, pressure, state monopoly ownership, legal restrictions and media regulation.
The list does not include countries for which there was no reliable information.
Of the SEE countries, these are Albania and Macedonia.
Finland, Iceland, Norway and the Netherlands share first place in the index. Turkmenistan, Burma, China and North Korea rank at the bottom of the scale.
According to the RWB report, in the worst countries "press freedom is a dead letter and independent newspapers do not exist". The very few independent journalists are constantly harassed, imprisoned or forced into exile by authorities, while foreign media are either banned or allowed only in small doses, and always subject to close monitoring.
Of the SEE countries, Greece ranks highest at 19th, after the United States and Hong Kong.
Croatia rank 33rd after Namibia and Paraguay, Bulgaria is 38th after Mauritius and Peru, Bosnia and Herzegovina is 43rd after the Czech Republic and Argentina and is just two places ahead of Romania, which ranks 45th after Mali.
Yugoslavia is further down the list and ranks 60th after the Comoros and Gabon, but is well ahead of Turkey, which comes 99th after Kyrgyzstan and Jordan.
The RWB's report notes that despite the Turkish government's reform efforts, many of the country's journalists are still being sent to prison and censorship is regularly exercised in the media.
Geographically, press freedom is particularly poor in southeastern Turkey.
Of the other EU candidates, Slovenia's ranking is particularly noteworthy.
The country ranks 14th, after France, Austria and Belgium and is ahead of Costa Rica, Switzerland and the United States.
EU member Italy takes 40th position, two places behind Bulgaria.
"Even in the European Union, we have noted violations of press freedom.
So it does not only occur in countries where we already knew there have been violations, but also in unexpected places such as Italy, where pluralism of information is being threatened", said Soria Blatmann, who is responsible for Europe at RWB.
The report notes that the situation is particularly bad in Asia and that no Arab state is ranked among the top 50. In Iraq, which ranks 130th, and in Syria, 126th, the state uses every means to control the media and stifle dissenting voices.
"Every Roma Child to School" campaign under way in Macedonia
Many obstacles block Roma from receiving a good education, including a lack of required paperwork and the inability to prove citizenship.

Roma NGOs in Macedonia have been conducting a campaign aimed at boosting the number of Roma children who attend school.
The UNICEF-supported campaign has been implemented in towns with large Roma populations such as Skopje, Kumanovo, Prilep and Stip.
The slogan is "Every Roma Child to School".
Roma children face a variety of hurdles in their schooling.
This year, around 2,000 who should have started first grade on September 1st were not able to, because they lacked the right paperwork or because their parents do not have the money, according to the National Roma Centre.
In many cases, it cannot be established whether the children and their parents are Macedonian citizens and are entitled to a free education.
School principals say they are in a bind, as without proof of citizenship, they may be in violation of the law.
Another problem is that Roma children often drop out of school early.
Sometimes it is because their parents do not have money for books and other school materials.
In other cases, it is due to the tradition of getting married at age 12 or 13.
While as many as 72% of Roma children attend primary school as full-time students, the figure drops to 31% after age 15.
Similar conditions prevail across Southeast Europe.
Throughout the region, Roma enrollment in primary schools is 20% to 30% lower compared to non-Roma children, while dropout rates are more than twice as high.
Research conducted in 2000 by UNICEF and the World Bank found that, among Roma, males tend to be better educated than females.
Only 21% of women completed their schooling, compared to 44% of men, the research found.
Nor is the problem unique to the Balkans.
According to a study published in August by the Vienna-based European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, Roma children lack equal access to educational capacities in EU member countries.
Some 12-15 million Roma live in Europe, with 7-9 million of them in EU member countries, the study noted.
That makes them the largest ethnic minority on the continent.
A new report by the UNDP, meanwhile, found that Roma continue to be among the poorest people in the Balkans, with 44% of Roma households living in poverty.
Out of that, 15% live in extreme poverty.
The UNDP said Roma in Macedonia have the highest percentage of unemployment (70%), while 22% face denial of healthcare services because they lack proper documentation.
BiH Urged to Impose Full Civilian Control Over Military
The discovery that a Bosnian Serb company has been selling arms to Iraq has led to calls by international officials for civilian oversight of the BiH military.
The government, meanwhile, has announced a ban on all exports of arms and military equipment.
(The Guardian - 31/10/02; Reuters, RFE/RL -30/10/02; Defence News, BBC - 29/10/02)
Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) military must be put under civilian control, High Representative Paddy Ashdown said Wednesday (30 October).
Similar calls have come from representatives of other international bodies following the discovery that a Bosnian Serb company, Orao, sold military equipment to Iraq.
Several senior Orao officials were fired last week, and on Monday the Bosnian Serb defence minister and the army chief of staff resigned.
"Mechanisms for civilian oversight of the military and the military-industrial complex are hopelessly inadequate," Ashdown said after a meeting with EU and NATO officials.
"We must now insist on proper civilian oversight at state level of the military-industrial complex and also a strengthening of borders, of the customs service."
Ashdown's deputy, Donald Hays, said the arms sales constituted a breach of agreements with the UN, the OSCE and other international bodies.
"It is Bosnia and Herzegovina that will be held responsible, and it is Bosnia and Herzegovina that has to make this right," he said.
Hays welcomed BiH's decision on Tuesday to ban indefinitely all exports of arms and military equipment.
According to BiH Minister for Foreign Trade and Economic Relations Azra Hadziahmetovic, the ban will remain in effect until a state-level licensing regime for arms trade is introduced and "this whole business of foreign trade in arms is fully under control." According to reports, BiH authorities intend to have a code of administrative weapons control mechanisms in place by 15 November.
The government of Republika Srpska, meanwhile, has adopted a 20-point plan, to be implemented by 27 November.
NATO and OSCE will support an assessment of the scope of violations and help establish appropriate measures for ensuring compliance, Defence News quoted OSCE spokeswoman Meta Anley as saying.
"We will be very closely watching what's going on, what action [Republika Srpska] takes, and if we deem the actions not fully appropriate, I'm prepared to take actions as required," SFOR commander Lt Gen William Ward warned.
He also called for the establishment of a unified state-level defence ministry, rather than having a separate ministry in each entity.
This is also a firm NATO requirement for BiH's membership of its Partnership for Peace programme.
Turkey mulls pardon for tax evaders
ANKARA, Turkey -- Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan said on Monday (November 15th) that parliament may approve a pardon for tax evaders in an effort to recover revenue owed to the state.
The pardon would cover fines on unpaid taxes, social security premiums, traffic fines, water and other utility bills.
If the measure is passed, the evaders would have to pay only the original amount of the unpaid taxes, in smaller instalments.
Babacan refused to specify the exact sum the government hopes to recover, but denied media reports it could reach $35 billion. (AP, Hurriyet - 15/11/10)

Serbia Adopts Strategy for EU Integration
Serbian officials hope to launch Stabilisation and Association talks with the EU later this year.
The government has adopted a national strategy that outlines the road to EU accession.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade – 14/07/05
Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus said Serbia could join the EU in 2012, "if all goes according to plan". [AFP]
Serbia's national strategy for association with the EU specifies the manner in which the country should develop en route to integration with Europe.
The document, developed by experts from several Serbian institutes and faculties, lists Serbia's overall development as the main goal, while accession to the EU is considered a means to that end.
The strategy, more than 200 pages long, enumerates political and economic tasks authorities must undertake on the path to accession.
A projected date for membership is not given.
According to Milica Delevic-Djilas, one of the strategy's co-authors, polls have shown that 65 per cent of Serbian citizens favour EU accession, although they admit they do not know what changes will be required.
A far smaller number approve specific steps such as labour force reductions, public spending cuts, closing unprofitable companies, and the suppression of the so-called gray economy.
"That is why the strategy must clearly show both politicians and citizens not only what awaits us on the way to the EU, but also what is expected of them on that road," Delevic-Djilas said.
Serbia has yet to resolve two major issues -- the future status of Kosovo, and the uncertain survival of the state union with Montenegro.
The strategy "does not foresee exact solutions for those two issues," says Tanja Miscevic, secretary of the Serbian Office for Association with the EU.
Serbia also has to face the problem of full co-operation with The Hague tribunal.
The court expects Belgrade to extradite several fugitive indictees, including Bosnian Serb wartime General Ratko Mladic.
The strategy urges reaching a consensus on the need for co-operation, but does not suggest how that consensus can be reached.
"It seems that the matter of co-operation with the tribunal is increasingly a thing of the past in Serbia and that authorities are determined to bring the matter to a close," said Vladimir Todoric, another co-author of the strategy.
Serbian officials generally have declined to speculate about when Serbia might join the EU, though Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus has said this could happen in 2012 "if all goes according to plan." So far, there is little concern in Belgrade about the rejection of the proposed EU Constitution by Dutch and French voters -- a development that many see as potentially impacting the enlargement process.
"It will not affect us now, but we are aware that it could have consequences in the long term.
That is why we must carefully watch the situation in the EU," Labus said.
The government's current priority is to initiate Stabilisation and Association talks with the EU, slated to begin in early October.
Meanwhile, it presses ahead with legislation meant to bring the country closer to EU standards.
Decentralisation Under Way in Macedonia
Under Macedonia's decentralisation process, which officially got under way on 1 July, municipal authorities are taking on a wide range of functions previously assigned to the state.
By Marina Stojanovska for Southeast European Times in Skopje -- 14/07/05
"[Decentralisation] will certainly be a comprehensive and difficult process, but I am convinced we will manage to accomplish it," said Macedonian Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski. [AFP]
Decentralisation in Macedonia formally started on 1 July, with Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski pledging co-operation between the central and local authorities.
As a result of the process, municipalities will gain extensive competencies previously handled by the state.
Decentralised authority means that local mayors and their teams will assume responsibility for almost all functions previously performed by the finance, transport, labour, education and culture ministries.
Among other things, local authorities will now issue construction licenses, collect taxes and select primary school principals and police chiefs.
"We are facing a great and serious reform process encompassing not only the transfer of important competences from the central to local levels, but the transfer of around 540 facilities that previously belonged to the state, and of around 30,000 government staff members from the central to local governments," Buckovski told the Local Self-Government Association (ZELS) managing board on 1 July. "That will certainly be a comprehensive and difficult process, but I am convinced we will manage to accomplish it," he added.
The prime minister pledged that the government would provide assistance in resolving the most striking problems facing the municipalities -- their financial debt burden.
"We are aware most municipalities have their giro-accounts blocked because of their debts, mainly owed to public utilities.
Together with interest, the debt to the ESM Power Utility alone is around 6.72m euros.
I hope we will manage to free the municipalities from their interest burden, and we will reprogramme the principal," Buckovski said.
ZELS Chairman Andrej Petrov believes the government has to assist the municipalities, primarily in coping with their financial problems, if it wants them to become effective units of government.
"I am satisfied with the government's promise to assist the municipalities with taking on the first central government staff members from the ministry of transport and communications," Petrov says. "Also, we have reached an agreement with the government that a fairer part of VAT should go to municipalities."
Minister of Local Self-Government Rizvan Sulejmani said the government has already prepared for the start of decentralisation.
"Of 42 laws adopted, 36 are directly related to the start-up phase of decentralisation and only two regulations related to transfer of staff from the ministry of transport sector and distribution of VAT remain to be adopted," Sulejmani said.
International representatives in the country have welcomed the start of decentralisation.
"The first phase …means the start of a new process leading to a more accessible local authority, strengthening local democracy and intensified participation of citizens in local governance," said a joint statement signed by EU Special Representative Michael Sahlin, head of the EU Delegation Donato Chiarini, US Acting Ambassador in Macedonia Paul Wohlers, OSCE Ambassador Carlos Pais and NATO High Representative Dennis Blease.
EU Ministers Vow to Step up Fight Against Terror
Condemning last week's bombings in London, the EU justice and interior ministers agreed Wednesday on a wide range of anti-terrorist measures.
(EurActiv, The New York Times, International Herald Tribune, The Daily Telegraph, Independent, BBC - 14/07/05; AP, Reuters, AFP, CNN, RFE/RL, VOA, DPA - 13/07/05)
"All of us across the EU are absolutely determined to accelerate our work to make terrorism more difficult," said British Home Secretary Charles Clarke. [AFP]
Pledging to step up their co-operation in the fight against terrorism, EU justice and interior ministers agreed Wednesday (13 July) on a wide range of measures to be adopted by December.
At the initiative of the British EU presidency, the 25 ministers met for crisis talks in Brussels, six days after the 7 July bombings in London, which killed at least 52 people.
"All of us across the EU are absolutely determined to accelerate our work to make terrorism more difficult," said British Home Secretary Charles Clarke, who chaired the emergency meeting.
In a four-page declaration adopted Wednesday, the ministers set as an "immediate priority" the development of an EU framework for pursuing and investigating terrorism across borders, in order to impede terrorists' planning, disrupt support networks, cut off funding and bring terrorists to justice.
The framework would build upon already existing plans, adopted in the wake of the 11 September attacks on New York and Washington and after the March 2004 train bombings in Madrid.
The implementation of anti-terrorist measures proposed after the Madrid attacks has been slower than EU officials would like, said EU Justice and Home Affairs Commissioner Franco Frattini.
"The time has come to name and shame" laggards, the AP quoted him as telling reporters in Brussels. "Without true European co-operation, we cannot prove and show to the public and to the terrorists that we are willing and ready to move ahead very quickly."
One of the most controversial steps discussed Wednesday concerns the retention of telecommunications data.
Under the proposed measure, telecommunications companies would be required to store details of all telephone calls, e-mails and Web traffic for at least 12 months.
Last month, the European Parliament rejected a proposal to that effect, citing civil liberties, privacy and other concerns.
But Clarke said civil liberties had to be treated proportionately.
"I argue that it is a fundamental civil liberty of people in Europe to be able to go to work on their transport system in the morning without being blown up," he said.
Other issues likely to raise controversy include measures for countering radicalisation and recruitment, for strengthening the visa information system and the Schengen information system, and for the adoption of common standards for ID cards.
Britain is expected to push for the inclusion of biometric details in all ID cards.
Other specific measures to be adopted by December include a framework decision on European evidence warrants, a data protection policy, a new money laundering directive and measures to prevent the misuse of charities by terrorists.
Pop star will sing for Greece at 2009 Eurovision
Greek singer Sakis Rouvas will represent his country for the second time at Eurovision.

Sakis Rouvas will represent Greece at the 54th Eurovision in Moscow by performing "This Is Our Night".
The 37-year-old native of Corfu is competing for the second time in the famous annual contest.
In 2004 Rouvas took third place for Greece with his rendition of "Shake It".
Besides singing, Rouvas occasionally acts and hosts TV programmes.
In fact, he co-hosted the 2006 Eurovision, which took place in Athens, though he did not compete.
The star has an army of dedicated fans who call themselves Rouvitses.
He is best known in Greece and Cyprus but also enjoys considerable popularity in Russia, this year's host country, from widespread exposure as a contestant in the 2004 Eurovision and from his hit duet with Russia's Philip Kirkorov, "I Want You Like Crazy".
That popularity could help Greece's cause in the voting.
Rouvas, whose recording career dates back to 1991, epitomises the stars who have represented Greece in recent years.
Initially, the country showed relatively little interest in Eurovision and sent promising but generally obscure artists.
None of them finished better than third (Antique, "Die For You", in 2001).
However, the contest took on added importance for Greeks in 2003: historic rival Turkey won first place, while Greece finished a comparatively embarrassing 17th.
The country now sends established performers to represent it.
Two years later, Greece won its only Eurovision championship to date, with Swedish-born Elena Paparizou's "My Number One".
It was actually her second Eurovision representing Greece; in 2001, she had been a vocalist for Antique.
Greeks celebrated their triumph in the streets of Athens, with the nation's tourism ministry naming Paparizou its official ambassador.
The country's three entries since 2005 could not match that success; they finished ninth, seventh and third.
Greece has high expectations for its Eurovision entry this year.
The general public expects the song to finish among the top three.
"This Is Our Night" is the work of Dimitris Kondopoulos (melody) and the team of Craig Porteils and Cameron Giles-Webb (lyrics).
Serbia now expects to pass anti-discrimination law by end of April
Despite religious leaders' misgivings, the Serbian government expects parliament to pass an anti-discrimination law by the end of April.
Enacting the law is among the conditions Serbia must meet to join the so-called Schengen white list.

The Serbian government now expects to pass a long-discussed anti-discrimination law by the end of April, according to Interior Minister Ivica Dacic on Sunday (March 8th).
Enacting the law is one of the conditions for placing Serbia on the so-called Schengen white list, which will allow Serbian citizens to travel to EU member countries without visas.
The daily Blic reported on March 10th that, barring any "substantial changes" to the text, the ruling For a European Serbia caucus was ready to support the bill.
However, it also reported the government would not send it to parliament before the Serbian Orthodox Church debated the controversial parts of the bill at its March 10th Holy Synod.
The government adopted the draft law late last month, but representatives of the "traditional" Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Islamic, Evangelical and other faiths objected to Article 18, which guarantees freedom of religious conversion, and Article 21, which prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation.
The government then pulled the bill from parliament's docket.
NGOs called the religious intervention in legislation undemocratic.
"I wonder if I will have to ask different churches for their opinion every time a law is being adopted," complained Labour and Social Policy Minister Rasim Ljajic.
He also noted that nobody notified him of a government teleconference in which it was decided to pull the bill from parliamentary consideration.
According to the labour and social policy ministry, the group suffering the most discrimination in Serbia is the Roma, with inequality also affecting women and the disabled.
Discrimination against the Roma is the most frequent because a large portion of that population lacks identity documents.
Roma often cannot exercise their right to education and have no access to health insurance or welfare payments.
The draft bill defines general and special cases of discrimination and envisions the creation of a representative for the protection of equality, whom members of the public will be able to contact if they experience discrimination.
The representative could issue a warning or launch judicial proceedings against alleged offenders.
Because of the economic crunch, the representative will not start working until early 2010.
Until then, should the law take effect, members of the public will be able to launch judicial proceedings on their own.
The law would enjoin discrimination on the basis of nationality, religion and age, as well as on the basis of sexual differences.
Fines for acts of discrimination, depending on whether the offender repeats them, will range from 53 euros to 1,056 euros.
Serbia is the only country in Europe still without a gender equality law.
ICG: quick closure of OHR would put BiH at risk
The Peace Implementation Council should appoint a new high representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina and affirm that his or her office will remain in place until BiH meets the requirements for its shutdown, the International Crisis Group said Monday.

The international community must not rush to close down the Office of the High Representative (OHR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) as current conditions do not warrant doing so, the International Crisis Group (ICG) said Monday (March 9th).
With ethnic tensions running high and the situation in BiH deteriorating, a move in that direction "would put at risk the country's relative stability and the progress achieved so far", the prominent Brussels-based advocacy group warned in a report.
The ICG released the paper ahead of a key two-day meeting of the Peace Implementation Council (PIC), the body of 55 countries and international organisations overseeing the execution of the 1995 Dayton Peace Accords.
The meeting begins in Sarajevo on March 25th.
The PIC should not decide to end the mandate of the high representative and his or her office by June 30th, "as has been foreshadowed", the ICG said.
"Rather, it should ... resolve to maintain the office" until BiH fulfils all requirements for a transition from the OHR to an EU Special Representative (EUSR).
The new high representative should retain executive (Bonn) powers but should be able to use them in only a few situations, such as preventing serious threats to and violations of the Dayton accords.
BiH still has yet to fully comply with the Dayton accords, resolve the status of the Brcko District and deal with the state property problem, the ICG stressed.
Therefore, a decision to close down the OHR "would risk crippling the EU's ability to apply firm policies toward Bosnia " and would weaken its regional credibility, the study warned.
"Once the OHR closes, hopefully by the end of 2009, a strong EU mission will be needed both to protect Bosnia'’s stability and to encourage its membership candidacy," the ICG said.
Furthermore, the EU will need to address the still-deep fissures dividing the country's three main ethnic groups.
"The EU should resolve to act as guarantors of Dayton against unilateral challenge and begin now to focus on the specific powers its Special Representative requires, as well as increase financial support," the report noted.
The EU mission, which will replace the OHR, should operate under a senior official acting both as the EUSR and as head of the European Commission delegation in BiH.
In addition, said the report, the EU should negotiate an agreement with BiH that would guarantee the Dayton accords, in which the EU would reject any entity's "withdrawal from the state" or various acts undercutting BiH entities.
The ICG also recommended that the EUSR report regularly to the UN Security Council and other interested parties.
It recommended US co-operation with the EUSR and a boost in NATO's presence in BiH.

Greece paralysed by national strike
ATHENS, Greece -- The country is enduring paralysis Thursday (May 14th) caused by a general strike of public servants against the government's strict economic policy.
The protestors are demanding higher salaries and pensions in the public sector.
As air traffic controllers join the strike, air carriers are cancelling around 150 flights.

Croatia's public sector workers end strike
ZAGREB, Croatia -- Unions representing public sector employees struck a deal with the government early Thursday (May 14th) regarding salary hikes, which ended the ongoing strike and averted a massive demonstration scheduled for Saturday.
Within the next month, all relevant unions will hold a referendum on the agreement.
Negotiators will sign the pact if the majority of union members approve it.
Under the agreement, starting in January, salaries of public servants will be harmonised with inflation. A 6% wage hike, abolished as of April 1st, will return if the GDP registers a 2% increase in two consecutive quarters.
Education workers walked out first Wednesday.
An estimated 80% of Croatia's teachers and professors took part in the protest. (HRT, Index, Jutarnji list, Vecernji list, DPA - 14/05/09; UPI - 13/05/09)
EC launches deficit procedure against Romania
BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission (EC) decided on Wednesday (May 13th) to initiate a procedure against Romania for running up an excessive deficit, though the government blames the 2008 budget gap of 5.4% of GDP on expenses related to public employees' salaries in the context of the global financial crisis.
According to the EC report, Romania undertook "a pro-cyclic budget policy between 2005 and 2008", leading to the budget deficit's increase from 1.2% of GDP in 2005 to 5.4% of GDP in 2008, despite an average real GDP growth of 6.5%.
In the same report, the EC acknowledges recent efforts by the government to address its macroeconomic imbalances, including fiscal consolidation measures in the 2009 budget adopted in February and amended in April.
The EC blames much of the deficit issues on generally weak budgetary planning and implementation by the former government. (Hotnews, Mediafax, Agerpress, Ziare - 13/05/09)
Djukanovic-led coalition racks up another Montenegrin election victory
Montenegro's ruling coalition, which has never lost power, won another term in office Sunday.

The "For a European Montenegro" coalition led by Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic prevailed in Sunday (March 29th)'s snap parliamentary elections with slightly under 51% of the vote.
Djukanovic will begin a sixth term as prime minister in a country that he has led continuously since 1991.
Djukanovic's Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) and its smaller coalition partners -- the Social-Democratic Party, Bosniak Party and Croatian Civil Initiative -- won 47 to 49 of the parliament's 81 seats, according to various sources.
The ruling coalition emerges even stronger than it did after the last elections in September 2006.
It will now have at least six more seats in parliament.
Party performance largely followed pre-election forecasts.
The leading opposition party in parliament will be Srdjan Milic's Socialist People's Party (SNP), which polled approximately 16.2%.
Following it are Andrija Mandic's New Serbian Democracy (9%) and Nebojsa Medojevic's Movement for Changes (approximately 6.1%).
Parties representing the ethnic Albanian minority, under rules applying only to them, will also hold seats in parliament.
About 65% (324,850) of the nation's registered voters cast ballots under the eye of more than 1,200 foreign and domestic election monitors.
Djukanovic ran on a platform of entering the EU and NATO and attracting foreign investment in the tourism and energy industries.
He promised to lead the country through the global economic crisis.
"We will do our best to quickly set up a responsible and competent government that will ... quickly move Montenegro to its European and Euro-Atlantic goals," Djukanovic told cheering supporters, who set off fireworks in front of DPS headquarters Sunday night.
Medojevic, even though his Movement for Changes party finished fourth, interpreted its showing as a "great success because it is a big deal in Montenegro to have 20,000 supporters ready to stand up against even organised crime and tycoons".
He contended that if the opposition had followed his suggestion and had formed a common list, it would have defeated Djukanovic's coalition, which reaped about 60% of the seats in parliament with less than 51% of the vote.
Bucharest hosts summit of prosecutors-general
Bucharest hosted a summit for prosecutors-general from 112 countries and 16 international organisations on their role in criminal justice.

Prosecutors-general from 112 countries and 16 international organisations active in criminal justice convened at a summit in Bucharest last week to discuss the role of the chief prosecutors as pillars of the justice system.
The third World Summit of Prosecutors General, which ran from Tuesday (March 24th) through Thursday, served as a forum for delegates to hold discussions on prosecutors' investigative independence and effective management of the challenges posed by criminal tendencies.
Romanian Prosecutor-General Laura Codruta Kovesi, in her opening remarks, said the summit's goal was to help meet the need of citizens for a climate of confidence in justice.
She added that, according to a recent study, 30% of Romanians think the political environment makes prosecutors very susceptible to pressure.
Also, 63% believe prosecutors who make mistakes should be punished in order to raise public trust in the justice system.
The prosecutors decided at the plenary to base the prosecutors' Permanent Technical Secretariat in Bucharest -- a decision publicly welcomed by Kovesi.
The secretariat will administer a database with prosecutors' contact information and type of work they perform per country.
It will help co-ordinate the organisation of future summits.
Chile will host the next summit in November 2011.
Romanian President Traian Basescu, Foreign Minister Christian Diaconescu and Prime Minister Emil Boc welcomed the prosecutors-general.
Basescu underlined the importance of sharing experiences and deepening co-operation to combat crime worldwide.
"Today, the global threats [force] us to adopt a common position," he said.
National efforts alone are not enough to fight these challenges, added Basescu.
Boc stressed that public trust in the independence and impartiality of legal investigations is more important than political and media pressure and temptations leading to corruption.
In the summit's closing remarks, Diaconescu told participants that Romania had received a nomination to chair the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice's 18th session in Vienna, from April 16th to 24th.
Romania has a three-year commission membership starting this year.
"This nomination represents an acknowledgement of the special importance my country shows to consolidating criminal justice," Diaconescu said.
He expressed hope the results of the Bucharest summit will be useful to the UN commission.
PIC reiterates need for political progress in BiH
The Peace Implementation Council Steering Board met in Sarajevo to mark the beginning of new High Representative Valentin Inzko's mandate.

The Peace Implementation Council (PIC) Steering Board began two days of meetings in Sarajevo on Wednesday (March 25th) to officially mark the start of Valentin Inzko's mandate as high representative to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
Inzko succeeded Miroslav Lajcak, who became Slovakia's foreign minister on January 26th.
"I will be partner to those in BiH who want to work on the country's European perspectives," Inzko said.
He reiterated his willingness to use the so-called Bonn powers to impose laws or dismiss officials, but only as a last resort.
The chairman of the BiH Council of Ministers and leaders of the governing political parties also attended the meeting.
The PIC discussed the international community's prospects for future work in BiH and welcomed the process launched in Prud last November to further the dialogue in the country.
Increased dialogue, in addition to a greater readiness to reach common ground and to take action on certain issues, is the key to progress, it said.
However, the PIC also expressed concern about some political developments.
It urged BiH authorities to quickly implement the Office of the High Representative (OHR)'s five-objective work plan.
The objectives include acceptable and sustainable resolution of property apportionment among different levels of government, as well as of military property.
Additional objectives call for full implementation of the Brcko District constitutional amendment and for fiscal sustainability through proper functioning of the national taxation and fiscal bodies.
Finally, the plan calls for cementing the rule of law through implementation of the national strategy for dealing with war crimes, the justice sector reform strategy and the law on aliens and asylum.
Implementation of the work plan and a positive PIC assessment of the situation in BiH are the conditions for closing the OHR, the PIC said.
BiH officials must avoid inflammatory statements and actions that may cause the situation to deteriorate, it said.
"Any challenge to the basic features of the Dayton Peace Accords will be considered unacceptable, including unilateral actions aiming at endangering the constitutional order of BiH," the PIC Steering Board said in a communique.
In his farewell address after the meeting, Lajcak said "the only people [who can] make BiH's effort to join Europe as a prosperous and stable democracy successful are its citizens."
The next PIC Steering Board meeting is planned for June in Sarajevo.
Newborn deaths spark debate on Turkey's health system
Prosecutors have launched an investigation after 13 newborn babies died within 24 hours in a state hospital in Izmir.
Last month, 27 babies died in another hospital in Ankara.
The health ministry says hospital infections happen even in developed countries, but the doctors' union blames a worsening health system for newborn deaths.

The Turkish government has launched an investigation after 13 newborn babies died within 24 hours in a state hospital in Izmir late last month.
It was only a few weeks after another health scandal in Ankara, where 27 newborn babies died at the Zekai Tahir Burak Hospital -- most from infection.
The initial results of the recent investigation showed an infection spread by intravenous fluids caused the babies' deaths at the Tepecik Research and Education Hospital in Izmir -- also the case in the Ankara hospital.
The head of the investigation, Professor Recep Ozturk of the Istanbul Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, said the team has identified the bacterium that caused the infection.
After reviewing the past records of the Izmir hospital, the investigators ruled out possible negligence by the doctors or the hospital team and said the deaths could best be described as an "accident".
Despite the team's findings, the public has demanded the resignation of Health Minister Recep Akdag.
Local media have said that the tragic deaths illustrate the deterioration of the country's health system.
A columnist from Milliyet, Ece Temelkuran, criticised allegedly mismanaged privatisation in the health sector, the delegation of responsibility to unprofessional firms, the lack of adequate health facilities and the failure to train new personnel.
Temelkuran says that Akdag shoulders the responsibility and should resign.
But her call, joined by those of many other critics, fell on deaf ears.
Although Akdag acknowledged the problem of hospital infections in Turkey, he claims success in efforts to reduce infant mortality at birth.
"We are saddened by the death of any newborn baby or mother, but we should also look at the statistics," Akdag said.
"The number of children who die at birth was 29 [of every] 1,000 live births in the year 2003. This has decreased to 17 to 18 deaths in each 1,000 live births this year.
That means we have managed to save the lives of thousands of babies," he said, conceding the number of children who die at birth was still high and pledging continued efforts to decrease this number.
According to the minister, the rate of infant mortality in Turkey is relatively low, compared with that of other developing nations.
But the EU has long criticised candidate country Turkey's health system.
In its 2007 Progress Report, the Union said that the percentage of infants who die at birth is "still high".
The tragedies have sparked calls for Health Minister Recep Akdag to resign. [Getty Images]
According to UN statistics, the infant mortality rate in EU member countries averages 5.84 deaths per 1,000 live births.
In Turkey, estimates differing with Akdag's claims put infant mortality at around 36.98 deaths per every 1,000 live births.
Officials at the Izmir Medical Chamber blamed the health ministry and health policies for the recent increase in newborn deaths.
"In Izmir, maternity hospitals are overloaded.
Throughout Turkey, we do not have enough maternity hospitals or maternity experts," chamber director Suat Kaptaner said.
He also blasted the government's controversial call for families to bear "at least three children".
"Under today's conditions, where we lack adequate health services and have widespread poverty, how one can expect people to have at least three children? ...
We do not have adequate personnel," Kaptaner said.
The opposition has filed written questions to parliament on the tragedies.
Republican People's Party Izmir representative Selcuk Ayhan asked whether political appointments to the high positions at the health ministry may have contributed to the recent events.
Increasing political and public pressure on the government has forced officials to consider reform in maternity hospitals.
The health ministry has organised a meeting for representatives of state and private hospitals for later in October.
The meeting will focus on identifying the basic needs of the hospitals -- such as personnel levels and the number of beds, incubators and other medical items.
The ministry plans to meet the demands of the health centers, redistribute the assigned personnel and co-ordinate the flow of patients among public and private hospitals.
Karic wanted for questioning by Serbian government
Business tycoon turned politician Bogoljub Karic faces an arrest warrant after failing to appear at the Belgrade District Court for questioning about the activities of his former company, Mobtel
By Georgi Mitev-Shantek for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 10/02/06

Serbian police issued a warrant for prominent tycoon turned politician, Bogoljub Karic, on 4 February, after he failed to appear in court for questioning.
Karic, a friend and business partner of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, is owner of the BK Company and head of the Power of Serbia Movement.
Karic was due to appear at the Belgrade District Court on 3 February for questioning about the activities of his former company, the mobile phone operator Mobtel. However, he did not appear.
Police say Karic was not at his Belgrade address and officers were searching for him.
Belgrade-based B92 Radio quoted a Power of Serbia Movement official, Dejan Milekovic, as saying Karic was out of the country, along with his brothers Sreten and Dragomir Karic.
"The lawyers have told me that Sreten Karic is in Moscow and I believe them.
Bogoljub Karic is outside the country collecting documents, as is Dragomir, who has lived outside the country for a long period of time," Milekovic said.
Karic and his brothers are thought to face charges of tax evasion, mismanagement of millions of dollars and money laundering.
The warrant is the latest development in an ongoing struggle between Karic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's government, which has revoked Mobtel's operating license.
The government has also threatened to confiscate the Karic family's assets if it does not pay an alleged 3.3m euros in back taxes.
Karic, meanwhile, has accused Kostunica of orchestrating a "lynch campaign" because of the popularity of his party, which ranks third in opinion polls and is ahead of Kostunica's party.
With the investigation, the roots of the Karic family's enormous wealth -- amassed over two decades -- have come to light.
Using political connections and state capital, the family created a business empire that today operates construction, finance, media and agricultural companies across three continents.
In Belgrade's exclusive residential quarter Dedinje, the Karics own nine villas, with a combined property value of around a billion euros.
For many years, Mobtel was the only telecommunications company in the world that did not register any profit.
Revenues were siphoned off into companies owned by the Karic family, including prepaid card merchandiser Astra, the Family Tours car rental company, the Avropa osiguranje insurance company and BK Television.
Balkan teams join race for Olympic medals
After four years of hard work, 2,500 athletes from around the world are set to compete for 252 gold, silver and bronze medals at the Turin Winter Olympics.
Will Balkan athletes be among the lucky ones?
(The Irish Times - 08/02/06; Reuters, AFP, BBC, VOA, UPI, Sofia News Agency, NetInfo - 07/02/06; AP, AFP - 05/02/06; AGI, HINA - 04/02/06; Turin 2006 Official Web Site; International Olympic Committee; National Olympic Committees)

They have worked hard over the past four years and now hope to see their efforts rewarded.
Although Balkan countries are sending fewer than 100 athletes to the XX Winter Olympics opening in Turin on Friday (10 February), several competitors stand a chance of winning a medal.
A total of 2,500 athletes from 85 countries will compete for 252 gold, silver and bronze medals during the 17-day Games.
The Winter Olympics include 15 sports disciplines: alpine skiing, biathlon, bobsleigh, curling, cross-country skiing, freestyle skiing, ice hockey, figure skating, luge, Nordic combined, speed skating, short track, skeleton, ski jumping and snowboard.
Croatia's Janica Kostelic, who won triple gold and a silver at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, could improve that record by medalling in each of the alpine skiing disciplines in which she will compete.
Her first start is in the Ladies' Downhill event at San Sicario Fraiteve on 15 February. The 23-year-old champion is also scheduled to race in the Ladies' Combined, Slalom, Giant Slalom and Super G events.
She has won in all of them during this season's World Cup circuit.
Her brother, Ivica Kostelic, and fellow skier Nika Fleiss are also on the Croatian team.
They will compete in five alpine disciplines.
The Croatian team also includes competitors in five other disciplines -- biathlon, bobsleigh, cross-country skiing, figure skating and skeleton.
Bulgaria, which won one silver and two bronze medals at the Salt Lake City Games and one gold at Nagano in 1998, is also hoping to do better this time around.
"I hope Turin 2006 will be Bulgaria's most successful Winter Olympics," said Bulgarian Olympic Committee head Stefka Kostadinova as she left for Italy on Tuesday.
The country's star in short track, Evgenia Radanova, won three gold medals less than a month ago at the European Championships in Poland.
At the 2002 Winter Olympics, she won a silver and a bronze medal.
However, the competition at Turin is expected to be intense, with two Chinese and two Korean short track stars vying for gold.
Ekaterina Dafovska, who won Bulgaria's first-ever Winter Olympics gold medal in the women's biathlon 15km individual event in Nagano eight years ago, will carry her country's flag at the opening ceremony Friday.
Bulgaria's 21-member team also includes Irina Nikoultchina, who won bronze in the women's biathlon 10km pursuit event at Salt Lake City, as well as the country's top ice dancing duo, Albena Denkova and Maxim Staviski.
With 27 athletes, Romania has the largest of the Balkan teams.
The Romanian athletes will compete in eight of the winter Olympic disciplines, including alpine skiing, biathlon, bobsleigh, cross country, figure skating, luge, short track and speed skating.
Cross country skiers Zsolt Antal, Florentin Mihai Galiceanu, Monika Gyogy and Camelia Ana Csernescki will each compete in four of the discipline's events.
Serbia-Montenegro will be represented by six athletes, including alpine skiers Jelena Lolovic, Maria Trmcic and Zelimir Vukovic.
Alpine skiers Zana Novakovic, Moica Rataj and Marco Schafferer will compete for Bosnia and Herzegovina, while Erjon Tola, also an alpine skier, is expected to represent Albania in the Turin games.

Archaeologists discovered the remains of a British military ship off Albania's Ionian Sea shores.
The HMS Volage sank in 1946 after running into a mine.
The incident near the Albanian port of Saranda caused a serious crisis between Tirana and London at the time.
The ship remains were discovered by an international team of scientists from the US Institute of Nautical Archaeology, the Albanian Institute of Archaeology and the Albanian Defence Ministry.
Tax authorities in Istanbul imposed a 32m-euro fine on Google over the company's failure to pay its profit taxes.
The internet giant refused to pay the taxes, arguing its Turkish operations are managed from Google headquarters in Ireland.
Local authorities say Google's Turkey-based company, Google Reklamcilik ve Pazarlama, is liable for taxation.
Researchers in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) launched an internet "atlas of war crimes" on Tuesday (November 3rd) that helps inform about the country's 1992-1995 conflict. The atlas -- www.idc.org.ba -- contains Google Earth maps and allows finding sites of mass executions and mass graves in BiH, along with the names of victims.
A Science Festival will be held in Belgrade on December 4th and 5th.

Fruit-Freezing Factory Opens in BiH
The first Foreign Direct Investment in the Srebrenica area has resulted in the opening of a freezer factory for the export of organic berries grown by local farmers.

A fruit-freezing factory that opened in Potocari last month is not only the result of the first Foreign Direct Investment in this part of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) since the 1990s conflict, but also marks a shift from the region's old reliance on industry, and benefits dozens of people in a region known mostly for a horrific wartime massacre.
Swedish company Olle Svensson invested 500,000 euros in the Bos Agro Food factory, which will freeze organic raspberries bought from local farmers.
A lot choked with waist-high weeds contains the abandoned battery factory where thousands of Muslim men were executed by Bosnian Serb forces in July 1995.
But the gleaming white building in the middle of all of this can be seen as a sign that the municipality has the chance for future prosperity.
"After everything we've survived, we have the right to better times," said Srebrenica Mayor Abdurahman Malkic. "This opens the door to agricultural production, especially the production of health foods."
The municipality, eager to attract investment to one of BiH's poorest post-war areas, donated the land to the factory, which employs about 30 people.
The amount of raspberries and blackberries growing here has increased enough since the war destroyed the region's industrial economy that Bos Agro Food intends to buy and freeze about 1,000 tonnes of berries from about 500 small farmers this year.
They'll sell the frozen fruit in Scandinavia and central Europe.
"Our serious aim is to help [the farmers] get started.
How can you do that better than to foster what they can grow and what they know how to do," said Bo Ahlstedt, marketing and sales director of Olle Svensson.
The farmers Olle Svensson is helping to get started include Muslim returnees to the area.
As of last year, 3,200 Muslims returned to the three area municipalities, and scores are involved in such small-scale farming.
Olle Svensson General Manager Armin Glamoc said the goal was to make it materially possible for more people who want to return to do so.
They also hope this first investment will inspire others to follow.
Officials have mentioned that a foreign chocolate producer is interested in the adjacent lot, and said they hoped that Bosnian companies would also open branch factories in the area.
The head of the Office of the High Representative's economic department said he believed this business model would work out and wished them a "fruitful" success.
"It is distinctive because the Swedish investor has identified a niche market -- organic berries -- and has worked its way back from consumer to producer," said Patrice Dreiski. "[The economic situation] will not change overnight.
It's incremental, but its modest success will create conditions for more success."
Partitioning Kosovo could be an option, troika member says
The international troika assigned to mediate the second round of Kosovo status talks visited Belgrade and Pristina at the weekend, launching a new round of negotiations on the future of the province that has been under UN administration since 1999.
By Igor Jovanovic and Blerta Foniqi-Kabashi for Southeast European Times – 13/08/07
"If both sides repeat their classic positions, there is little hope for compromise or bridge-building," EU representative Wolfgang Ischinger said. [Getty Images]
The EU representative of the so-called international troika, which is mediating the new round of talks between Belgrade and Pristina, said on Sunday (August 12th) that partitioning Kosovo may be part of the solution of the province's final status.
The West and Russia previously ruled out any division of the province along ethnic lines fearing that it might encourage separatist movements elsewhere in the Balkans.
However, EU representative Wolfgang Ischinger told reporters that the troika would endorse any agreement between ethnic Albanians and Serbs, and would not rule out anything.
"We are urging both sides to think outside the box.
If both sides repeat their classic positions, there is little hope for compromise or bridge-building," Ischinger said.
The Contact Group's negotiating troika -- Ischinger, US representative Frank Wisner and Russian member Aleksandr Botsan-Kharchenko -- were in Belgrade and Pristina at the weekend.
The three diplomats held talks with local leaders to decide how to proceed with the new round of negotiations, which will be run by the six-member Contact Group that includes US, Russian, German, French, British, and Italian representatives.
Ischinger said that the negotiators plan to continue with the talks as soon as possible.
The group's next meeting officials could take place by the end of the month.
After the Belgrade visit on Friday, Ischinger told Belgrade's TV B92 that the troika must submit its report to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon by December 10th.
However, he did not say whether that meant the date will also mark the deadline for finalisation of the talks.
According to Wisner, the three learned from Serbians and Albanians their aims and platforms for future.
"We have a sense of urgency.
Peace is important and all of us are committed to it."
"We explained our mission …we are here to establish the road towards the status.
We will accept [any solution] the sides agree on," Wisner said, adding that the troika was not in Pristina to make proposals.
"I hope that in coming months we will closely work and effectively will close this process," Botsan-Kharchenko said, calling for compromise between both sides.
Serbian President Boris Tadic said after the meeting that the new negotiations will open the way for a compromise acceptable to both sides, which, according to Belgrade officials, must be confirmed by the UN Security Council.
Both the Serbs and the Russians feel that the new compromise cannot be based on former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan because it "has fallen through in the Security Council".
In March, after nearly a year of fruitless negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina, Ahtisaari presented the UN Security Council with the option of supervised independence for Kosovo, whose population is 90% Albanian.
Pristina and the western countries accepted the plan, but it was rejected by Belgrade and Russia.
Russia blocked the plan's adoption in the Security Council, after which the new talks were handed off to the Contact Group.
Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu told the troika that independence, territorial integrity and Ahtisaari's package are non-negotiable.
"Independence is the political will of Kosovo's people and it is not negotiable,'' the province's leaders said.
''Kosovo's territorial integrity is untouchable and not negotiable.''
"The Kosovo delegation expressed their commitment to continue co-operation with the Troika to finish this mandate, which will have only 120 days," said Sejdiu, adding that Kosovo officials will demonstrate constructive co-operation in the talks.
Bulgarian tourism sector faces possible negative impact of over construction
Owners of hotels on Bulgaria's Black Sea coast could face bankruptcy next year, the head of the Balkan country's tourist agency has warned.
(Dnevnik, Sofia Echo - 13/08/07; Deutsche Welle, Sofia News Agency - 12/08/07; Sofia Echo - 06/08/07; Sofia News Agency - 27/07/07; Mediapool - 26/07/07)
Tourism provides 2 billion euros each year, approximately half of Bulgaria's trade deficit. [Getty Images]
A construction spree along Bulgaria's Black Sea coast in recent years has resulted in supply far outweighing demand, with many hotel beds now empty in the peak of the season.
This is only one of the problems facing the country's tourist industry, said a report posted on Germany's Deutsche Welle website Sunday (August 12th).
Millions of euros have been invested in the construction of hotels, bars and other tourism facilities, but the needed infrastructure is missing, Marin Neshkov, a Bulgarian tourism expert in the northern Black Sea city of Varna, told the German media site.
For example, Sunny Beach -- a resort 35km north of Burgas -- has seen an enormous and ongoing expansion of Bulgaria's transition to a market economy, and is now home to more than 200 hotels, including several luxury ones.
But the corresponding transportation and communication networks are lacking.
There's also insufficient water supply and sewage treatment, Neshkov said.
Tourism provides 2 billion euros annually, approximately half of Bulgaria's trade deficit, according to Deutsche Welle.
But, according to the chairman of Bulgaria's tourism agency, the country is now seeing a decline in foreign tourists.
The revenues from international tourism from January to May of this year stood at 532m euros -- an increase of 16% compared to the same period in 2006, State Agency of Tourism (SAT) head Anelia Krushkova said on July 26th.
However, after years of solid growth, the actual number of foreign tourists decreased over the same five months, she said.
The steep rise in the number of hotels on the Black Sea coast over the past decade has pushed competition to unprecedented levels, Krushkova said.
Given the fewer number of foreign visitors, many owners were forced to slash room rates last month.
Still, many beds, especially in hotels without an ocean view, remain empty.
According to Krushkova, the recent building spree along the coastline has had a negative impact on about 50% of hotels located outside central resort areas.
The shortage of holidaymakers could result in many hotel owners going bankrupt next year due to the inability to pay off large debts, she said.
As more Bulgarians appear to be choosing resorts in neighbouring countries for their holidays, hotel owners have been advised to lower prices not only for foreigners, but local tourists as well, to attract more guests.
An insufficient number of skilled workers poses another problem for Bulgarian tourism.
Hotels are built so quickly that skilled workers can not be trained fast enough.
Also, many students no longer stick around in the summers to work in the tourism industry. Instead, they go abroad.
"Tourism pays the lowest average wage in Bulgaria," Neshkov told Deutsche Welle. "It is not logical, when one thinks about it, [seeing how] tourism amounts to 14% of the country's gross national product."
Macedonia chairs Decade of Roma Inclusion
An unprecedented Roma integration program promises specific results in Macedonia.

Macedonia assumed chairmanship of the Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005-2015, an international programme involving 12 European countries to improve Roma integration and welfare.
The Decade brings together governments, transnational organisations and NGOs to improve Roma participation in education, employment, housing and healthcare, but also commits governments to address other core issues like discrimination.
"Macedonia's chairmanship will focus on Roma education and housing in the upcoming 12 months, National Implementation Co-ordinator Nedzet Mustafa told SETimes.
Mustafa explained that since 2005, the Roma community experienced positive achievements throughout Europe.
"In Macedonia, the providing of scholarships and mentorships to secondary school students as well as securing employment via appropriate training [is particularly important]," he said.
During its chairmanship, Macedonia will organise several international workshops and conferences on developing Roma employment initiatives, explained Mustafa.
He also said education remains the bedrock of the Roma community in Macedonia and elsewhere.
The Roma are Europe's most numerous minority, 12 million strong, concentrated primarily in Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Spain and Turkey.
In Macedonia, the number of Roma is 53,000 or 2.6% of the total population, but only there are they recognized as a distinct ethnicity in the preamble of the constitution.
The Skopje neighborhood of Shuto Orizari is Europe's first Roma municipality and the only one in the world where the Roma language is official.
World-renowned singer Esma Redzepova told SETimes that Macedonia's systematic support for Roma issues -- including the Roma primer, dictionary and grammar -- should be the basis for replication globally.
"The first song I performed setting me on the path to be recognized eventually as 'queen of the Roma song', was through the airwaves of, and with the support of Radio Skopje," she said.
One of the problems facing Macedonia leading the Decade chairmanship concerns some citizens -- mostly Roma -- who seek asylum in the EU.
After Brussels specified strict recommendations to address asylum or face abolition of Macedonia's visa-free status, the government undertook a variety of employment and social support measures which, together with tightened EU asylum practices, produced results.
According to Belgium's Immigration and Asylum Ministry data issued last month, the number of asylum applicants has fallen to less than 500 this year, down from 4000 in 2010.
Ajet Osmanovski of Macedonia's NGO sector says the Decade, however, is yet to achieve significant progress.
The exception, Osmanovski explained, is the Decade's action plan which participating countries pay much attention to.
"The problem is the so-called institutionalisation of the Decade. In Macedonia, there is a national co-ordinator and a department for implementation.
I would suggest to join these two because the co-ordinator must have under control all sectors which work within the framework of this process [Roma integration], for example a Deputy Prime Minister for Roma issues," Osmanovski told SETimes.
Osmanovski said Macedonia's chairmanship does not mean much to many of the Roma because they do not know the Decade's basic goals and results, nor understand the issues well enough.
"There are still poor and discriminated against Roma whose educational level is low, and they want results now," he said. Osmanovski also said that the NGO sector has played the leading role in undertaking successful initiatives to bring about Roma prosperity even before the Decade began.
They include motivating and increasing the number of enrolled and graduated Roma students in universities.
"The Macedonian government should continue supporting these initiatives," Osmanovski concluded.
Frenchman rebrands Serbia's image
Karl Haudbourg left his native France for Serbia, where he now lives and works to change the negative image of Serbia in the world.

While scores of Serbs dream of leaving their country for a better future in Western Europe or the US, one Frenchman exchanged his native Paris for the noisy Belgrade quarter of Zeleni Venac.
Every day for the past two years, Karl Haudbourg has taken a walk around Belgrade's medieval Kalemegdan fortress.
When the weather is nice, his eight-year-old daughter Luna races far ahead of him on her little scooter.
"People in France know little about Serbia, and mostly negative stories from the time of the conflict.
I'm not trying to improve Serbia's image by writing something imaginary, but rather present the truth about what I see in Belgrade, about the Serbs," Houdbourg told SETimes.
His website has several thousand hits a day.
He says most visitors are from the US, 30% from Serbia, while the rest from Russia and EU countries.
Haudbourg says he has had to respond to numerous prejudices about the Serbs.
"People frequently ask me whether it's safe to come to Belgrade, whether the war is over and what they should see if they come to Belgrade.
I've also had to answer bizarre questions; some asked me whether we have electricity and the internet in Serbia, whether chocolate could be bought in stores and whether the Serbs bred cows.
Only after those questions did I realise how long I would have to work on changing the image of Serbia.
But if I didn't think it could be changed, I wouldn't have started this in the first place," he says.
Haudbourg moved to Belgrade with his daughter in 2009. He launched the Serbian Ambassador to the World website (http://www.ambassador-serbia.com) and a Facebook group dubbed Beautiful Serbia, now counting more than 30,000 friends.
"When my wife died of cancer in 2008, I decided to dedicate my life to fighting for something I truly love.
I simply love Serbia and I chose to fight for it," says Haudbourg.
He says he fell in love with Serbia in 2002 after watching a documentary on French television. Three years later he had a chance to visit Belgrade.
"When departing for Serbia, my friends asked whether I was out of my mind and what I would do there.
But as soon as I arrived in Belgrade, I felt it was a city I want to live in.
I had this strange feeling that I had lived in Belgrade in a past life, I've never got lost here," Haudbourg said.
Belgrade journalist Mirjana Pantic says that his story is unusual and that "it is difficult for people in Serbia to comprehend that someone from abroad moved to Serbia because he had grown to love it.
We're used to people falling in love with the United States or France, and deciding to stay and live there, but certainly not Serbia.
Perhaps we ourselves lack a good opinion of the country we live in," she told SETimes.
Belgrade science fiction writer Jovan Ristic says he respects Haudbourg's work.
"He alone, however, will not be able to change the perceptions of the Serbs, unless the state realizes it has to back his efforts and add numerous other activities to them, our image will remain predominantly negative for a long time," he told SETimes.
Border gate could boost Turkey's trade with Iraq
Plans are in the works for a second crossing point in the southeast.

With bilateral trade on the rise as Iraq becomes more stable, a new border crossing is set to be opened on the country's border with Turkey.
Business organizations are enthiusiastic.
But certain issues, including some related to infrastructure, have not yet been resolved.
"We have been holding negotiations for about a year with the Iraqi authorities on the new border crossing," explains Ramazan Isik, a representative from Turkey’s Customs Undersecretariat. "We must wait for the talks to finalize.
The starting of the groundbreaking might take place within two to three months."
The parties are now discussing the location of the crossing,the two main locations under consideration being Ovakoy and Sinava, both villages of the southeastern province of Sirnak.
Iraq was Turkey's fifth largest export market in 2010, following Germany, the U.K., Italy and France.
Turkey’s exports to Iraq have increased more than seven fold from 718m dollars in 2003 to 6 billion dollars last year, according to data by Turkey’s Foreign Trade Undersecretariat.
Meanwhile, Iraq's exports to Turkey rose from 84m to 1.4 billion dollars for the same period of time.
"A second border crossing is crucial to relieve the load on the existing Habur Gate, where trucks wait in queue for days, thus limiting trade," Mehmet Aslan, the chair of Gaziantep Chamber of Commerce, told SETimes.
Turkey's southeastern region mostly exports to Iraq, Aslan said, adding that exports will likely increase even further after the second gate is launched.
"Welfare can be shared among countries of the region, by expanding trade among them.
Thus, we can become a regional power," he said.
Cargo trucks sometimes have to wait 15 days to cross the Habur Gate, thus, the delivery of goods is postponed and Turkish firms have to pay for the extra costs of such delays, according to Cahit Nakiboglu, the chairman of the Gaziantep Organized Industrial Region and president of Naksan Holding, a plastic goods company that trades with Iraq.
"I will use the second border gate as soon as it is opened.
A third border crossing would even be good for our businesses," Nakiboglu told SETimes, adding that he expected Turkey’s exports to Iraq to increase substantially as the reconstruction of Iraq continues.
Trade volume between Turkey and Iraq will reach 10 billion dollars by the end of 2011, according to Rifat Hisarciklioglu, the Chairman of Turkey’s Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges, who disclosed this goal in June after meeting with the Iraq Trade Chambers Federation President Jaafar Rasol Jafaar El Hamdani in Istanbul.
However, the chairman of the Turkey-Iraq Business Council at Turkey’s Foreign Economic Relations Board (DEIK) Ercument Aksoy says there are still issues to be immediately addressed before becoming too enthusiastic.
"Authorities intend to open a second border crossing, as the starting of a route from Turkey to Egypt, but there is no infrastructure accross Turkey's border," Aksoy says.
Once they cross the border, more than 90 percent of the Turkish cargo truck drivers transfer the trucks to the locals for security reasons, said Aksoy, who has been doing business with Iraq since 1984.
"A safe system already exists, for which businessmen might not prefer to use a second crossing in the beginning."
The second border crossing will serve to expand trade between the two countries, especially after Iraq normalizes, but it might negatively affect business in Iraq’s Kurdistan region, according to Aksoy.
"Transport and insurance companies in northern Iraq do serious business with Turkish trucks.
They would not like to give it up," he said.
Only one woman minister in Turkey's new cabinet
NGOs representing women criticize lack of government representation, saying the country is sliding backwards.

Fatma Sahin has a unique position in Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's new cabinet: she is the only woman minister.
That represents a drop from the previous cabinet, which included two.
NGOs and women's associations are concerned.
"It is a pathetic scene in Turkey, which claims to reach advanced democracy," said Fezal Gulfidan, a member of the board of directors from the Association for the Support and Training of Women Candidates (KADER), in comments to SETimes.
Sahin, who is also the first female MP from Gaziantep, will head the Ministry of Family and Social Policy.
The new name of her ministry – formerly known as the Ministry of Women, Family and Social Policies – is a source of added controversy.
"This is the assimilation of woman within the family by seeing her [only] as a member only of domestic life," Gulfidan said of the renaming. "The only female minister has been given a political role that suits her [traditional] role within the family," she added.
"There are many women living on their own in Turkey," she says. "In this manner they are being ignored."
In an open letter to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in June, the Equality Mechanisms Women's Platform – an umbrella organization comprising around 80 activist groups – condemned the decision to remove the word "women" from the name.
At least five women are killed every day in Turkey, and women are barely represented in parliament and positions of power, the Women's Platform said, arguing that the renaming sends the wrong message.
Turkey, it added, is near the bottom by world standards in the areas of poverty, education, and women's health.
Under such conditions, Gulfidan argues, the government needs a ministry devoted strictly to women's issues.
Selma Acuner, a political scientist at the Women's Studies Centre at Ankara University, is more sanguine.
Promoting Fatma Sahin to the head of the new cabinet is a "promising development", she tells SETimes.
"I believe Sahin will work well because she is close to women organisations, it's as if she is coming from civil society," says Acuner, pointing out that the minister previously headed a research commission on honour killings and violence against children.
"It is necessary to give time to Sahin, to see her work," she concludes.
Turkey detains suspected al-Qaeda members
Suspects were reportedly planning to attack the US Embassy in Ankara.
(Anadolu news agency, Milliyet, AP, Reuters, AFP, CNN Turk - 13/07/11)
Turkish police detained 15 suspected al-Qaeda terrorists on Tuesday (July 12th).[Reuters]
Fifteen suspected al-Qaeda terrorists were detained in several Turkish cities on Tuesday (July 12th) for reported ties in a planned attack on several diplomatic targets, including the US Embassy in Ankara. The arrests came days ahead of a planned visit by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to Istanbul.
The interior ministry confirmed the detentions late on Tuesday, saying they were made in the western city of Bursa and the nearby town of Yalova.
The statement said that weapons, ammunition and maps of Ankara were also seized in a simultaneous raid near the capital.
According to the Anadolu News Agency, which cited unnamed official sources Wednesday, some 700kg of chemicals used for making bombs were also confiscated in the raids.
The report suggested the operation was carried out after one suspect, believed to have undergone special weapons and explosives training abroad, was under surveillance for half a year.
He was detained earlier and gave police hints on how to catch the rest.
Currently, the suspects are being held in police custody for questioning.
Allegedly, the group was planning to attack the US embassy and other foreign buildings in revenge against the May 2nd killing of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden by US forces.
There have been extensive speculations in the local press recently of a possible terror plot after bin Laden's death.
Clinton is due in Istanbul on Friday and Saturday for a meeting of the Libya Contact Group.
The US State Department said they have not received any official information about a plot against the embassy, but stated they are in touch with Turkish officials and are following the situation.
Al-Qaeda is believed to have been behind several high-profile attacks in Istanbul, including four truck bombs in November 2003, targeting the British Consulate, the Turkish headquarters of HSBC bank and two synagogues, killing 57 people and wounding hundreds.
Police have accelerated regular operations against the militant group since July 2008, when three policemen and three assailants died in a gun battle outside the US consulate.
In January 2010, 120 alleged members of al-Qaeda were detained in Istanbul and other cities, possibly including senior members. There were similar raids in 2009.
In April this year, security forces detained over 40 people in a crackdown against the group, including Halis Bayancuk, 26, considered one of the ringleaders of al-Qaeda in Turkey.
In June, ten suspected members of the terror group were detained in the southern city of Adana, the home of the Incirlik Air Base that is used by the US to transfer non-combat supplies to Iraq and Afghanistan.

Car bomb kills two Croatian journalists
Ivo Pukanic, the owner of a leading Croatian political weekly, and his newspaper's marketing director, Niko Franjic, were killed by a car bomb in Zagreb on Thursday, the latest in a series of violent incidents in the country.

Croatia will rise up against terrorism and organised crime, the country's leaders vowed on Thursday (October 23rd) following the murder of a prominent journalist.
It was the latest in a string of violent incidents that have shocked the nation.
An explosion under his own sedan killed Ivo Pukanic, 47, the owner of Croatia's leading political weekly, Nacional, outside his newspaper's offices in downtown Zagreb.
The blast at around 6:30pm also killed the weekly's marketing director, Niko Franjic. Two passersby reportedly suffered injuries.
"Croatia will be even more determined and tough in dealing with organised crime and terror," Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said on Thursday evening. "We will not allow Croatia to become another Beirut."
Thursday's attack came less than three weeks after a gunman killed Ivana Hodak, the 26-year-old daughter of a prominent lawyer, in broad daylight near a Zagreb police station.
Condemning Pukanic's assassination, President Stipe Mesic called an emergency session of the National Security Council for Friday, saying "Terrorism has become a fact on the streets of our capital."
"Now it is either we or they -- the law-based state, or criminals, terrorists and mafia," Mesic said in a statement, urging the authorities to act quickly and energetically.
Showing the ability to fight organised crime and corruption is one of the key requirements countries must meet to join the EU.
Croatia hopes to enter the Union as its 28th member in 2011.
Some fear the escalation of violence could affect its EU bid.
Davor Butkovic, an editor of the popular Jutarnji List daily, told Reuters that the double murder was a "big blow to Croatia's political system".
Voicing concern over this escalation of violence, a New York-based media watchdog meanwhile urged Zagreb to make sure that those behind Thursday's incident face justice.
"The Croatian authorities must mount a thorough investigation and bring those responsible for these murders to justice swiftly," the Committee to Protect Journalists said in a statement.
Sanader said the country's top experts will work on Pukanic's murder and other unsolved cases.
"This is no longer merely a fight against organised crime," said the prime minister.
"This is something all of us in Croatia will rise up against."
Pukanic was both eminent and controversial.
His newspaper fought corruption and human rights abuses, winning him several prizes.
But he also was criticised for his close ties with some politicians and an alleged organised crime boss.
Pukanic received police protection after escaping an attempt on his life in April. However, two months ago, the protection ended upon his request, Croatian Interior Minister Tomislav Karamarko said on Thursday.

In one of his final actions as the international community's top envoy in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), outgoing High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling put the state in charge of the Srebrenica-Potocari memorial centre, which commemorates Europe's worst atrocity since World War II.
He stepped in after the BiH Parliament failed to do so due to the absence of the Bosnian Serb prime minister.
"To allow for this law to remain forgotten because of mistakes in parliamentary procedure would be unthinkable," Schwarz-Schilling said on Monday (June 25th).
The memorial centre will now be run through a governing board that reports to the BiH Council of Ministers.
Security services will be provided by the State Agency for Investigations and Protection (SIPA).
Republika Srpska (RS) political leaders are crying foul.
They argue that the envoy's decision breaches the entity and state constitutions, as well as the Dayton Peace Accords.
The RS government and parliament have asked the Peace Implementation Council (PIC) to annul the decision.
"RS does not argue about the existence of the memorial centre and it pays all due respect to the victims, but its existence cannot be a reason for territorial rearrangement of the entity and the state," RS lawmakers said.
Bosnian Serb authorities have asked all institutions, especially the police, to continue their duties on the entire territory of the entity, including at Srebrenica-Potocari.
By contrast, most political parties in the country's other entity, the Federation of BiH, welcomed Schwarz-Schilling's decision.
The president of the lower house of the BiH Parliament, Beriz Belkic, says the move meets a moral and human obligation towards Srebrenica victims and their families.
The Office of the High Representative has stressed that the decision has nothing to do with a controversial request for the municipality of Srebrenica to be granted special status outside RS jurisdiction.
The fact that the state will govern the memorial centre does not imply extraterritorial status, it said.
The dispute comes just prior to the 12th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre, which has been termed a genocide by the International Court of Justice.
As many as 30,000 people are expected to pay their respects to those who perished in the July 1995 atrocity.
Between 400 and 600 Srebrenica victims will be buried.
RS police said that they will secure the commemoration ceremony, just as they have for years, and that they do not expect any incidents.
However, SIPA is also expected to participate, exercising the role given to it as a result of Schwarz-Schilling's decision.
Tens of thousands bid farewell to murdered Turkish-Armenian journalist

Some 100,000 people attended Tuesday (January 23rd) the funeral of Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink, whose murder has stirred a debate about freedom of expression, excessive nationalism and ethnic tolerance in Turkey.
Dink, 52, was the founder and editor of the bilingual Turkish-Armenian newspaper Agos, and devoted his life to the reconciliation between his community and majority Muslim Turks.
He was gunned down in broad daylight on Friday, metres away from his paper's offices.
Ogun Samast, a 17-year-old from the eastern city of Trabzon, has confessed to killing the journalist for his statements regarding the 1915-1917 killings of 1.5 million Armenians, which Dink described as genocide -- an account sharply disputed by Turkey.
Police are questioning at least six other people.
Among them is Yasin Hayal, a militant nationalist who spent nearly a year in prison for a 2004 bomb attack outside a McDonald's restaurant.
Police said he has confessed to inciting the killing and providing a gun and money to Samast.
Dink's assassination shocked many in Turkey and sparked a wave of condemnation from EU and other foreign officials.
"The bullets aimed at Hrant Dink were shot into all of us," Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said, condemning the murder.
On Tuesday, mourners gathered at the square outside the Agos offices as the black hearse carrying the journalist's body set off on its 8km journey to the Armenian Church of the Virgin Mary.
Before the ceremony got under way, Dink's widow, Rakel, delivered a brief emotional speech, again asking that those attending the ceremony refrain from turning it into a political event.
"We are seeing off our brother with a silent walk, without slogans and without asking how a baby became a murderer," she said, surrounded by the couple's three children.
The mourners were mostly silent as they marched through the streets of Turkey's most vibrant city of 12 million people, where additional police forces were deployed and some roads were cordoned off.
Some of the people were holding identical black-and-white placards reading "We are all Hrant Dink" and "We are all Armenians".
There were also signs reading "Murder 301," in reference to a controversial article in Turkey's penal code.
Scores of Turkish journalists, writers and intellectuals, including Dink and Orhan Pamuk, the winner of the 2006 Nobel Prize for literature, have been prosecuted under the clause, which makes it a crime to "insult Turkishness".
"We still hope that (Turks) ... will accept that the Armenians are Turkish citizens who have been living on this land for thousands of years and are not foreigners or potential enemies," the Armenian patriarch of Istanbul, Mesrob II, told mourners during the service.
Among those attending the ceremony were Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin and Interior Minister Abdulkadir Aksu.
Besides representatives of Turkey's Armenian diaspora, Armenian religious leaders and government officials, including Deputy Foreign Minister Arman Kirakossian, also attended the funeral following an official invitation by Ankara, which has no diplomatic relations with Yerevan.
"Hrant Dink was a man who supported dialogue and co-operation," Khajag Barsamyan, the archbishop of the Armenian Church of America, said in an interview with the International Herald Tribune. "His soul will be in peace when he sees that his assassination created some positive steps between two countries."
Dink was laid to rest at Balikli Armenian Cemetery, where his parents were also buried.
Kosovo Serbs hope election will bring "better life"
As Serbia voted in Sunday's parliamentary elections, the polls were open in Kosovo too.

Around 267 voting places in 22 Kosovo municipalities opened on Sunday (January 21st), making it possible for Kosovo Serbs to participate in the Serbian parliamentary elections.
The voters say they hope the elections will help improve their quality of life.
"I am waiting for something better … we need a change in the Serbian government," said Slobodan Ivanovic of Gracanica.
His neighbour, Mira Dragoljub, said she backs the Socialists.
"They know our problems in Kosovo and I believe in them," she said.
Nebojsa Jovic, vice president of the Serb National Council in Kosovo, told Serbian media that he expects the new Serbian government to have stronger political aims.
"We should not leave Kosovo," he said.
Another Kosovo Serb leader, Oliver Ivanovic, said he hoped the vote would usher in "a democratic government, which will be reflected in Kosovo too".
Serbs in the municipality of Sterpce also expressed hope that the vote would result in a better quality of life.
"We are waiting for the best things…we vote for them and they should think of us," said Dragan Lajic.
His wife emphasised the need for jobs.
"We have many unemployed persons," she said.
Natasa Milosavljevic, from Lypjan, said she doubts the outcome will lead to improved conditions, but wanted to vote while Kosovo is still under Serbia's authority.
"This process is very difficult.
We voted again in Serbia's elections, because we think that Kosovo is still part of Serbia," she said.
She added, however, that her family would vote in future Kosovo elections if the province becomes independent.
"Why not?
We will accept the new reality in Kosovo," she said.
Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku said Sunday's election gave Serbian citizens a chance to break with the past.
"I believe that Serbian citizens have the ideal opportunity to choose between the past and the future and to vote for those democratic forces that ... look towards the future and not the past, to give Serbian citizens a European perspective," Ceku told the AP.
According to the Centre for Free Elections and Democracy (CeSID), voter turnout in Kosovo stood at 48.6%.
Incumbent Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DPS) won the largest number of votes in the province, CeSID said.
The DPS garnered 19,099 votes, followed by the ultranationalist Radicals with 13,348 votes.
President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party was third, with 5,489 votes.
In the past, Kosovo had been considered a bastion of Radical support.
With the elections over, UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari is now expected to come forward with his proposal for Kosovo's future.
It was delayed because of the vote.
Montenegrin judiciary under fire
Parliament appoints judges in Montenegro, while the government determines their budget and even plays a role in providing them housing.
Critics both inside and outside the country say major reforms are needed to ensure judicial independence and bring the sector into line with EU standards.

State Prosecutor Vesna Medenica says court delays lead to dismissed cases. [File]
EU foreign ministers on Monday (January 22nd) urged Montenegro to reform its judiciary and to combat corruption.
Their call came amid criticism by Montenegrin state prosecutors, who say courts are inefficient and unable to keep up with the number of cases.
"Because of delays in the courts, processes are frequently terminated due to expiration of the legal deadline, while verdicts frequently reject accusations without due consideration," State Prosecutor Vesna Medenica said in a 2005 report.
According to her, as many as 46.6% of trials have not been concluded.
"The number of unfinished trials testifies to the inadequacy of our courts, with the consequence that the fight against crime becomes inefficient, and the legal security of the citizens is undermined," Medenica said in the report.
Opposition politicians have long charged that the country's judges are controlled by the ruling structures, particularly since their appointment depends on the parliamentary majority.
Representatives of the judiciary acknowledge that this is the case.
They argue that the power to appoint judges should be taken from parliament and given instead to a newly established Judiciary Council.
Other factors undermining judicial independence include lack of a separate budget and the government's role in the provision of housing for judges.
In its annual progress report, published in early November, the European Commission (EC) said corruption continues to be a widespread problem in Montenegro
"The overall legal and administrative framework contains loopholes which allow corrupt activities to take place and limit the capacity of the state to fight corruption efficiently," it said.
While welcoming steps Montenegro has taken to improve the training of judges, the EC stressed the need to depoliticise the appointments process.
Appointments and promotions should be based on "professional and objective criteria", rather than political ones, it said.
Montenegrin Supreme Court President Ranko Vukoti agrees with the EC recommendations.
"The current constitution and the expert draft of the new supreme legal document of Montenegro do not provide for the implementation of the international standards in independence and autonomy of the judiciary power," Vukoti said.
"I hope the new constitution will allow the best lawyers to become judges, halting the outflow of the best legal cadre into advocacy and other profitable professions," he added.

Breaking News: War Crimes Suspect Arrested Following Drama in Belgrade
Acting on a tip, members of the Serbian Police's Special Anti-terrorist Unit have stormed an apartment in Belgrade and taken war crimes indictee Veselin Sljivancanin into custody.
By Dusan Kosanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 13/06/03
After a tense 12-hour stand-off, police in Belgrade have arrested Veselin Sljivancanin, a former Yugoslav National Army officer indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal for war crimes committed in Vukovar in 1991.Police acted after receiving a tip informing them that Sljivancanin had shown up on Thursday (12 June) at his apartment in the Belgrade district of Cukarica.
At around 2 pm the same day, members of the interior ministry's riot brigade entered the building and blocked it from the ground to the top floor, barring any entry or exit.
Soon after the media reported on the developments, about 200 supporters of the fugitive war crimes indictee gathered outside the building.
Tension grew by the hour. The demonstrators threw stones at police, who remained calm and refrained from use of force.
Members of the so-called "Board for Sljivancanin's Defence" were spoken to by Party for Serbian Unity leader Borislav Pelevic and Serbian Radical Party official Aleksandar Vucic.
The group's secretary, Vesna Gojkovic, claimed that Sljivancanin was not in the building, and that the apartment was occupied "only by his 23-year-old daughter and a child".Police later confirmed that family members were in the apartment, adding that this was one of the reasons why the operation lasted as long as it did.
Around 11:15 pm, some of the demonstrators tried to break through the police cordon and enter the building.
Police then activated a stun grenade to disperse them. Rioting ensued, with cars and dumpsters around the building set on fire.
Police used teargas, but no lethal weapons, to disperse the protestors.
An estimated ten commandos and police officers were injured and taken away by ambulance.
Half an hour past midnight, members of the Special Antiterrorist Unit stormed the apartment and took Sljivancanin into custody.
After a convoy of armoured police cars rushed him away towards Belgrade's central prison, the protests gradually died down.
The Hague-based tribunal's indictment charges Sljivancanin with responsibility for the crimes committed at the Ovcara farm near Vukovar.
Around 200 Croat citizens were taken there and killed after being removed from the hospital at Vukovar.The other members of the so-called "Vukovar Three" -- Mile Mrksic and Miroslav Radic -- are already in the tribunal's custody.
According to Serbian Police Minister Dusan Mihajlovic, some of those directly involved in the killings have been arrested as part of the "Sabre" police action, which followed the assassination of former Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.
They will be tried in Serbian courts.
Prior to Sljivancanin's arrest, the Serbian government had appealed to the fugitive to turn himself in.
Group Finds Human Rights "On Hold" in Turkey
The human rights issue has dogged Turkey for decades.
It is still too early to see whether or not the Justice and Development Party (AKP) can make a difference.
By Fatih Baran for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 13/05/03
The Human Rights Association of Turkey (IHD) has released a new report evaluating the country's human rights situation during the first three months of 2003.
According to the report, which primarily covers prohibitions on free speech and instances of torture, there were no positive developments.
"We have underlined the fact of torture in this report as has been done previously," the IHD said.
"Unfortunately, we could not observe any progress in this field.
Again in the field of freedom of expression, we observe that public prosecutors and judges do not interpret the codes in favour of freedom."
Turkey has made strides, however, to improve human rights in broadcasting and provide education in Kurdish, in keeping with aspirations to become a full member of the EU.
The coalition government of former Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit implemented a number of reforms last year.
The government of former Prime Minister Abdullah Gul has finalised them, while stressing their critical importance to Turkey's success with the EU.
However, the IHD report indicates a continuing lack of freedom of expression.
It finds that "four radio stations and one local television channel were suspended for 180 days from broadcasting by the High Council for Radio and Television.
Six newspapers and journals were closed for 79 days; nine journalists were taken into custody; and seven books, 17 magazines, seven newspapers and three posters were confiscated and banned on charges such as offending Turkish morality, inciting people against different political factions, etc."
Turkish law forbids torture, but there have been notable lapses in punishing those responsible, with the accused given minor sentences or released altogether.
In one well-known case, police were accused of torturing teenagers arrested for putting up anti-government posters.
The case dragged on for seven years.
It was only in March that ten policemen drew prison sentences of five to ten years.
The case's speedy resolution, just four months after AKP assumed power, raises the question of how the government can bring its influence to bear on the courts and how independent the judiciary is in Turkey.
It's still too early to tell.
Name dispute not deciding factor in Macedonia's NATO bid
Macedonia's NATO prospects hinge on reforms, and not on the name dispute with neighbouring Greece, NATO Parliamentary President Jose Lello told lawmakers Monday.
By Marina Stojanovska for Southeast European Times in Skopje - 27/11/07

Macedonia should demonstrate its ability to resolve its domestic disputes in a democratic manner, NATO Parliament Assembly President Jose Lello said on Monday (November 26th).
He also refuted suggestions that the name dispute with neighbouring Greece is stalling Macedonia's bid to join NATO.
"The so-called name issue is not a problem of NATO.
This is a bilateral issue, discussed between the two countries under UN patronage.
As far as I know, however, the name has never been presented as a blocking element to the NATO membership," Lello told the Macedonian parliament during a visit to Skopje.
The real challenge for Macedonia, Lello said, is to adopt the necessary legal framework and push through the required reforms.
Rule of law, protection of minority rights, and the fight against corruption are the main factors in the country's accession bid, he said.
Macedonia -- along with fellow Adriatic Charter members Albania and Croatia -- hopes to receive an invitation to join the Alliance at its summit in Bucharest next year.
But NATO officials say they have not yet determined which countries will be invited to join.
NATO Assistant Secretary-General Martin Erdman paid a visit to Macedonia earlier this month to assess implementation of the Annual National Programme on NATO membership.
It was the ninth such assessment and potentially the most important.
A report that Erdman's team will issue in January could give a clear signal about the country's prospects at Bucharest.
Before a decision is made, NATO will closely monitor whether the reform process is sustainable, whether sufficient dialogue exists among political parties and whether political stability is ensured over the long term, Erdman said during his visit.
Macedonia's national co-ordinator for NATO, Nikola Dimitrov, says it is a "good signal for us" that the Alliance has not made a decision on membership invitations "In the next period, we should double our reform effort in order to achieve progress ahead of the summit," he said.
President Branko Crvenkovski said Macedonia's hopes depend on the country itself.
"It is us who are required to perform our task.
We are required to complete the Judiciary Council, adopt the law on public prosecution and implement the law on police," Crvenkovski said.
He suggested placing a moratorium on all laws in parliament that are not connected with meeting the requirements for NATO and EU accession.
Albania's Topi says Kosovo independence good for Balkan peace
Bilateral relations and regional issues, including Kosovo's status, topped the agenda of talks between Albanian President Bamir Topi and his Greek counterpart, Karolos Papoulias, in Athens on Monday.

Reiterating Tirana's position, Albanian President Bamir Topi voiced support for Kosovo's independence during an official visit to Athens on Monday (November 26th).
"An independent Kosovo would be a valuable contribution towards bringing a final and lasting peace to the region," he said following talks with Greek President Karolos Papoulias.
Topi, who arrived on a three-day official visit Sunday, four months after being elected president, also expressed confidence about the European future of Balkan nations.
"I am convinced that the region of Kosovo and Albania, but also Serbia, see their future in the European family," Topi said. "That is why the award of independence status would be a valuable contribution to peace."
Albania signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU in June 2006, thus completing the first major step towards its eventual entry into the bloc.
Serbia, whose accord was initialled on November 7th, expects the document to be sealed by the end of January.
Kosovo, technically still part of Serbia, has been under UN administration for more than eight years.
Its ethnic Albanian majority hopes to become an independent state with the possibility of joining the EU.
Topi's remarks in Athens came on the first day of a critical phase in the internationally sponsored talks on Kosovo's final status.
Senior Belgrade and Pristina officials began a three-day meeting with the EU-US-Russian troika mediating the negotiations in Austria's spa town of Baden on Monday, amid widespread scepticism about the chances for an agreement by the December 10th deadline.
Rejecting Kosovo's independence bid, Serbia insists on retaining some sovereignty over the province, while offering it broad autonomy.
Because Belgrade remains unlikely to ease its stance, leaders in Pristina have threatened to unilaterally declare independence after negotiations end.
Greece is among a handful of EU member states that have expressed reservations about Kosovo's possible secession.
A prominent analyst on the Balkans suggested on Monday, however, a possible change in Athens' position.
"Greece is signalling quietly that while it will not recognise Kosovo immediately, it will, given a decent interval of time," Tim Judah wrote in a report posted on the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network's website.
Kosovo was one regional issue Papoulias and Topi discussed.
Other topics included the Macedonia name dispute, Turkey's EU accession path, the Cyprus problem, and relations between their countries.
Emphasising the strategic importance of Greek-Albanian ties, Papoulias also expressed his country's support for Albania's Euro-Atlantic integration.
"Greece supports Albania's EU and NATO bids, because it will contribute to stability in the region," Papoulias said.
Topi also met with Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis on Monday, and the leaders of the Greek Communist Party and the Popular Orthodox Rally, Aleka Papariga and Giorgos Karatzaferis, respectively.

Journalist documents long years of heroin addiction
A Croatian journalist describes to Southeast European Times correspondent Ivo Scepanovic how heroin ruined his career.
By Ivo Scepanovic for the Southeast European Times in Split -- 16/03/09
Croatian journalist Slaven Relja's journey through drug addiction is the focus of a documentary by Ivan Peric. [Ivo Scepanovic]
Croatian journalist Slaven Relja is owning up to years of fabricating interviews while under the influence of heroin.
Relja, 46, used to write for the culture sections of his country's top daily newspapers, Vecernji List and Jutarnji List. It all went wrong for him when he was 33.
He tried drugs and soon became hooked on heroin.
Years of agony followed in which he stole money from colleagues in an office, sold the "family silver'', worked while addicted to drugs and ended up in a specialised community to undergo treatment.
He tells his story in a new documentary produced by the TV channel Splitska Televizija (STV), where he now works after years of rehabilitation in Cenacolo community centres in Croatia and Italy.
Directed by Ivan Peric, A Journalist's Escape from the Hell of Drugs (http://www.splitskatelevizija.hr/index.php/novinarov-bijeg-iz-pakla-droge ) is awaiting screening at film festivals.
Relja, though, agreed to tell his story to the Southeast European Times before the film's release.
Southeast European Times: Why have you decided to open up and tell your frightening story to everyone?
There is no doubt that heroin destroyed everything in my life, Relja says. [File]
Slaven Relja: Giving testimony about the hell we've passed through is an unwritten order we all take with ourselves when leaving the Cenacolo community.
I got used to sharing my testimony with others in the Cenacolo community, and when returning back home I decided to go for a documentary after some friends mentioned the idea.
To be honest, the filming of the documentary has forced me to break up some friendships and even to sever some family ties.
That's simply the result of the atmosphere in the society where we live.
However, those facts do not affect me, as I'm absolutely sure I'm doing a fair and good thing.
I see no harm in a true story about a man who stands back up after physically and morally heading towards the bottom.
Doesn't it also serve as a road sign to all those who keep claiming drugs always have the last word and that you can't beat them? I've shown otherwise.
SETimes: What's the key message you want to send with the documentary?
Relja: My message might sound weird to some. But what I wanted to say is that absolutely everything that happens to us, including something evil like drugs, still brings at least something positive.
However, we are not always capable of a positive outlook.
There is always a positive moment in all those tragic years.
There is no doubt that heroin destroyed everything in my life, but through life in the Cenacolo community, I've experienced some moments with my family that otherwise I might have missed forever.
Passing through Cenacolo's international community, I've got friends from all around the world.
I have to say as well that my mother gained a new sense of her life after I stopped using drugs.
It is strange to say, but I came to understand the world around me thanks only to this horrific experience.
Therefore, the message would be that someone getting up after a fall sees the world with another set of eyes.
SETimes: Since you never even smoked a cigarette or tried alcohol, how could you become addicted to drugs at the age of 33?
Relja: Drugs are not a thing, not a powder.
They represent a character and a mistaken way of thinking.
When you sink to the level of trying drugs, it is all over already.
You feel an empty space in your emotional life, loneliness or dissatisfaction with the world around you and decide to solve your problem with a yellow powder that gives you a phony sense of freedom.
I did that instead of bearing my cross through life.
Unfortunately, many people choose [drugs] instead of simply walking through the wide-open door of salvation.
SETimes: How could you work as a journalist and meet deadlines for a national paper while being a drug addict?
Relja: At the beginning, heroin still leaves you some space for your creativity before you turn into a total junkie.
The brain functions, and I believed I was still doing a great job.
Well, I can admit that I used to fabricate whole interviews.
Of course I did it only with people, artists, whom I knew well, so they would never complain.
Later, when I needed more money to buy drugs, I used to steal money from colleagues in the office.
The Cenacolo community helped Relja begin his recovery. [File]
SETimes:Did you decide by yourself to join the rehabilitation community and try to abandon drugs, or it was others who helped you?
Relja: Very few people arrive at the rehabilitation community of their own will.
The same applied to me.
A drug addict lives under a false impression he can face the problem himself and refuses any help.
I additionally tried to avoid heading to a Christian community where you pray and work for 16 hours a day.
I strongly opposed moving to a community, but the situation at work and at home simply forced me to head to Cenacolo.
I later acknowledged the community actually saved my life.
SETimes: What was the key to your success in abandoning drugs?
Relja: It was faith.
Responsibility and a firm decision [to quit] helped as well, but I beat drugs only when I started to believe.
One could say there are elements of fanaticism in these words, but I tell you only that which I experienced in reality.
SETimes: Did you run into problems when returning to journalism after years spent in a rehabilitation community?
Did you need to fight to be trusted?

Serbian asylum seekers jeopardising visa liberalisation
Serbia is working to stem the flow of bogus asylum seekers, who threaten Schengen access.
By Biljana Pekusic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade – 23/05/11

Due to the torrent of Serbians seeking asylum in EU member countries, Brussels has warned Belgrade that the future of visa-free travel in the Schengen area is at risk.
Visa requirements were lifted for citizens of Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro in December 2009.
Over the course of the following 12 months, 17,000 people from Serbia requested asylum in the EU, mostly in Sweden, Belgium and Germany.
They weren't fleeing political persecution, rather, they were poor people who believe that in the richer Western European countries, life would be eased by government subsidies.
About 95% are Gypsies, the rest mostly members of the Albanian minority in Presevo and Bujanovac in southern Serbia.
And in their zeal to move, many have become targets of corruption and fraud.
"My friend in Nis paid 1,500 euros to a police officer to get a passport, because he had no ID card, nor a permanent home address.
He wanted to go to Switzerland because he cannot find a job," Cakan Dujic, a member of the Gypsy community, tells SETimes.
He must now pay back the debt because the money was borrowed, and the police officer pretends not to know him."
Serbian police have arrested 24 people, including 16 fellow officers, for allegedly issuing false documents necessary for obtaining passports.
Investigators say some of those police officers charged up to 5,000 euros for their 'service'.
After more than a year of recurring issues with bogus asylum seekers, Belgium sent a letter to the European Commission, which warned that it would request the annulment of the recently granted "white Schengen" for Serbia.
The real possibility that Serbians could lose this new right to freedom of travel has struck a chord.
"It is only by [this] we feel European, if we run out of that, we will again be like in the ghetto," said Goran Bozinovic, a student from Belgrade.
The government has announced new legislation that will tighten access to passports and travel outside the country, which immediately raised concerns about equal treatment and questions of discrimination.
"We must not apply stricter terms of travel to Gypsies and poor Albanians from southern Serbia than to other nationalities and citizens," said former State Secretary in the Ministry of Justice Marko Karadzic.
Beyond that, he added, "The state must create better economic conditions and provide greater rights to those people, so they would not be [seeking] it in other countries."
Interior Minister Ivica Dacic agrees, saying Serbia will work harder on behalf of the Gypsy minority.
"We want to work for the inclusion of Gypsies, [so they] feel equal with other citizens, and explain to them that asylum is not a solution," he said.
Serbia is also considering making it a crime to organise illegal migration, punishing groups that exploit people with false promises of asylum."Those who organise the departure of asylum seekers will be arrested and prosecuted," said Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic.
And at border crossings, police will ask for proof to determine whether travellers have return tickets, insurance, enough money to make the trip, where they are heading and why.
Serbia, Turkey sign economic agreements
Despite their differences over Kosovo, the two countries have developed a strategic partnership.

Turkish President Abdullah Gul wrapped up a two-day visit to Serbia on Tuesday (October 27th), during which several economic agreements were signed.
Gul noted that Turkish companies are interested in investing in Serbia, especially in its infrastructure, given Serbia's ideal location in the Balkans.
Bilateral ties are strong, he assured Serbian counterpart Boris Tadic.
"Although we [Serbia and Turkey] do not share a common border, we live as good neighbours," said Gul.
That bond has broader implications, he noted. "As long as relations between Serbia and Turkey are this good, one should not fear for peace in the region," said Gul.
Tadic added that the two countries share strategic goals.
"We strongly support each other in the process of European integration and co-operate within the Partnership for Peace programme.
We believe that Turkey is one of the most important global factors," Tadic said.
Reiterating that Serbia will never acknowledge Kosovo's independence, Tadic emphasised that Ankara's diplomatic relations with Pristina should not affect Turkish-Serbian relations.
The Turkish delegation to Serbia included members of the business community and road construction experts, as well as experts on transforming military airports to civilian ones.
The Turkish and Serbian delegations signed economic, infrastructure, technical, social and financial co-operation agreements.
Previously, the two countries signed a free trade agreement that will come into effect by the end of this year.
The largely Muslim Turkish delegation also visited the southwest region of Sandzak, home to the largest number of Bosniaks in Serbia.
The delegation conveyed Turkey's readiness to invest in the construction of a highway through Sandzak.
Novi Pazar Mayor Meho Mahmutovic announced that Turkish companies will invest in the town's infrastructure, which is currently in dismal shape.
During Gul's stay, the Serbian Economy Ministry and Turkish company Turker signed a deal on the company's investment in the southern Serbian Bujanovacka Banja spa.
Belgrade has been busy hosting important foreign officials -- US Vice President Joe Biden visited the country in May and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev visited the capital earlier this month.
Serbian officials were in China in August -- a trip that resulted in the signing of a strategic co-operation agreement.
Turkey calls for implementation of global non-proliferation regime
The nuclear strategy aims to ensure energy supplies while strengthening the non-proliferation treaty.
By Aaron Stein for Southeast European Times -- 23/05/11

Turkey's proximity to the Middle East, a region with a long history of instability and proliferation, has prompted Ankara to adopt strong non-proliferation policies.
The Group of 10 (G10) -- Turkey, Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Germany, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland and the United Arab Emirates -- met late in April to push the global community "to work towards achieving nuclear disarmament and a strengthening of the international non-proliferation regime".
With an eye towards the 2012 Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference, the G10 nations adopted four concrete proposals to strengthen global nonproliferation efforts: the halt of fissile material production, entry into force of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), nuclear transparency and accountability, and NPT compliance.
The G10 also renewed calls for the establishment of a Middle East Weapons of Mass Destruction Free Zone (MEWMDFZ).
According to international relations professor and non-proliferation expert at Hacettepe University Sebnem Udum, Turkey views a MEWMDFZ as a perfect complement to the NPT because Turkey "is aware of the fact that it is not entirely the NATO nuclear umbrella that deters threats from the Middle East or sustains its non-nuclear status".
"The status as a non-nuclear-weapon state is by itself a security asset, because it gives Ankara the image of a committed and reliable member of the regime and of the international community," she tells SETimes.
However, the push comes just 12 months after Turkey signed its first nuclear reactor tender with Russia, prompting some to question Turkey's nuclear intentions.
Much of the skepticism stems from neighbouring Iran's enrichment programme, which has clouded global nuclear and non-proliferation issues.
Despite Turkey's strong anti-proliferation policies, Ankara and its traditional Western allies differ on their interpretation of the NPT.
"Ankara's approach … is strongly influenced by the fact that, unlike the United States, it is a non-nuclear weapon state, and it does not currently possess a robust peaceful nuclear infrastructure.
As such, Turkey interprets Article IV of the NPT, which affords non-nuclear weapon states an 'inalienable' right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, in the broadest possible sense," Jessica Varnum, a research associate and adjunct professor at the Centre for Nonproliferation Studies, tells SETimes.
Turkey is worried that efforts by nuclear supplying countries to limit the spread of peaceful nuclear technology may hinder its own quest for nuclear power.
"While Turkey is unlikely to construct commercial enrichment or reprocessing facilities, which would be prohibitively expensive, it interprets the NPT text -- which does not offer clear guidance on this issue -- as permitting non-nuclear weapon states to have enrichment and reprocessing technologies as part of a peaceful nuclear programme, and does not believe that non-nuclear weapon states should have to give up this alleged right," Varnum told SETimes.
Udum says Turkey's "main preoccupation is with establishing nuclear power plants, despite the protests mainly after Fukushima. It [Turkey] also has been lukewarm to receiving nuclear fuel from an international consortium."
She adds that Turkey is working hard "to strike a balance between good neighbourly relations with Iran (and the rest of the Middle East), but at the same time convincing Iran to keep non-nuclear if Iran feels isolated or threatened by the West".
Public support for Iran's enrichment programme has prompted some in the United States and elsewhere to lump Turkey together with other proliferation prone states in the Middle East, a stance that Varnum cautions against.
"It is important to remember that at the big picture level, Turkey has demonstrated a strong commitment to the nonproliferation regime and the NPT process."
Washington Says Yugoslav Companies Helping Iraq Develop Cruise Missile
The United States delivered new evidence to Belgrade indicating that state-run arms dealer Jugoimport has been involved in helping Iraq develop a cruise missile.
(BCC - 29/10/02; The Guardian, Hoover's, Radio B92, Tanjug - 28/10/02; The Washington Post, BBC - 27/10/02; Reuters, AFP, RFE/RL - 25/10/02; Institute for War and Peace Reporting - 24/10/02)
Yugoslav scientists have been working on the development of a cruise missile for Iraq and have frequently visited the country to implement the project, the United States said in a document delivered to authorities in Belgrade.
The non-paper, or aide-memoire, alleges that state-run arms dealer Jugoimport handled the contracts for the project, according to a senior Yugoslav official familiar with the document.
In an accompanying letter, US Ambassador to Yugoslavia William Montgomery urged Belgrade to put an end to violations of the arms embargo on Iraq imposed by the UN in 1990.
The document charges that Jugoimport and an Iraqi firm, Al Fatah, signed a contract on cruise missile development in February 2000.
It says that Jugoimport then assigned project components to five subcontractors - Infinity, Brunner, GVS, Temex and Interdeal - all run by or connected with Yugoslav Army officers.
One of the subcontractors - Brunner - reportedly also helped Libya build a rocket propellant manufacturing facility and acquire US software to improve rocket targeting accuracy.
In the Iraqi cruise missile project, Brunner was involved in developing an MM 400 turbojet engine, the US aide-memoire said.
The allegations follow earlier ones involving Jugoimport. Last week, the US State Department accused the Yugoslav arms conglomerate of helping Orao, a Bosnian Serb aviation plant, supply Iraq with spare parts and repair services for its MiG fighter planes.
Jugoimport chief Gen Jovan Cekovic and federal Deputy Defence Minister Ivan Djokic both resigned as a result of the scandal, and the Yugoslav government launched an investigation.
On Monday (28 October), Republika Srpska Defence Minister Slobodan Bilic and Army chief Novica Simic announced their resignations.
Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica has downplayed the issue.
The Washington Post quoted him as saying the contracts came down "to overhauling older-generation aircraft engines, rather than to selling state-of-the-art weapons."
But senior officials in Belgrade said the US-gathered evidence does not support Kostunica's statement. Instead, they say, it indicates that Yugoslav firms were helping Iraq refurbish its military arsenal and develop a missile capable of accurately targeting neighbouring states.
Military and political analyst Miroslav Lazanski, meanwhile, said that Yugoslav scientists could have produced turbojet engines for cruise missiles.
But Iraq will have difficulty operating the missiles, he added, because it lacks the required satellite system. "A cruise missile is worthless without a satellite to give you navigation data," Lazanski said.
Science and Technology: Wine beneficial to health, researchers find
A team led by a University of Thessaly professor says a few glasses of wine per week can help people maintain good health.
Also in science and technology this week: Albania makes documents for procurement tenders available online, and Macedonia plans to provide over 100,000 computers for its school system.
A team of Greek scientists found that grapes – and, subsequently, both white and red wines -- conduct plant polyphenols, which positively influence human cells, bacteria and enzymes. [File]
Regular consumption of a few glasses of wine weekly has a positive effect on human health and can help fight tumours, according to research by a team of Greek scientists.
The findings were presented at the Detrop food and drink exhibition in Thessaloniki last week.
The project co-ordinator, University of Thessaly biochemistry professor Dimitris Kouretas, said his team had been working on the study since 2004.
They found that grapes -- and, subsequently, both white and red wines -- conduct plant polyphenols, which positively influence human cells, bacteria and enzymes.
Companies interested in procurement tenders in Albania will now be able to obtain all the necessary documentation online, under a joint project of the Albanian government and USAID.
Previously, firms had to buy tender documentation from the Public Procurement Agency, but the material will now be downloadable for free from the Agency's site.
Swisscom AG, Switzerland's largest telephone company, plans to invest more than 62m euros over three years in urban internet networks in eastern European countries, including Poland, Bulgaria, Romania and Ukraine, CEO Carsten Schloter announced on Wednesday (March 14th).
The firm is also examining the possibility of acquiring smaller local IT firms to bolster its solutions division, which provides network and technology services to business customers.
Montenegro is receiving its first topographic digital map, as well as a database for urbanisation and spatial planning, under a joint project of the Montenegrin government and the Japan International Co-operation Agency.
Completion of the project was announced on Tuesday (March 13th).
The Macedonian government officially launched the Computer for Every Pupil programme on March 13th.
The cabinet announced a public tender for the supply of 100,000 PCs for primary and secondary schools, which would be delivered by the end of 2007 and early 2008.
In the second phase of the project, another 50,000 PCs will be purchased in 2009.
The initiative is meant to help train students to use computers in their everyday learning and to encourage teachers to use modern teaching methods and techniques.

Catholic bishops call for "just society"
Roman Catholic leaders in Bosnia and Herzegovina are concerned about the difficulties of their flock but are of one mind when it comes to protecting fundamental rights.

The Conference of Bishops of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) held its annual meeting in Mostar last month, a summit chaired by BiH's Catholic leader, Cardinal Vinko Puljic.
The meeting assessed the conference's work during the previous year.
Two other annual meetings are organised in Banja Luka and Sarajevo, each addressing current issues.
"It was very productive and well-organised, addressing key issues," Puljic told SETimes."I am particularly thankful to the organisers for the hospitality shown in Mostar."
This is Puljic's fifth and final year as Conference chairman.
Replacing him will be Bishop Franjo Komarica, who will also serve a five-year term.
Archbishop Alessandro D'Errico, the Apostolic Nuncio, conveyed Pope Benedict XVI's message to the gathering and provided a report of the work of the nunciature.
According to Puljic, the archbishop reported that the Holy See is in the process of signing several agreements with the BiH government, including one on providing spiritual counseling for Catholic soldiers in the BiH military.
Also present at Mostar were Bishop Ilija Janjic of the International Conference of Bishops based in Belgrade -- representing Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo and Macedonia -- and Bishop Slobodan Stambuk of the Croatian Conference of Bishops.
Puljic explained that a variety of Conference committees provided annual reports.
The documents covered the bishops' work with the media; family; clergy; religious education; and the Catholic charity Caritas, among others.
After hearing the report of the Conference's Justitia et pax committee, the bishops said they were concerned over an increased lack of fundamental rights and freedoms in BiH, and especially about prejudices affecting employment and the workplace.

Amid the difficult political and economic situation in BiH, the bishops sent a message of hope, urging Catholics not to abandon BiH as their country and to hold on to their Croatian identity.
Calling for "a just society with an emphasis on human and civil rights", the conference participants appealed to all BiH officials to more actively protect the rights of the Catholic Croats throughout the country and treat them as equal to Bosniaks and Serbs.
Mostar Bishop Ratko Peric expressed concern about the declining number of Croats in BiH.
"Croats have been endangered since the beginning of the [1992-95] war, through the Dayton [Peace Accords] up to now," said Peric. "We have been reduced to a half; there used to be up to 830,000 of us, and now there are 450,000.
This figure is constantly decreasing."
The bishops also took a stand against announced changes in the Law on Residence and Domicile in Croatia.
They believe the proposed changes create a perception there will be no future for Croats in BiH.
The Conference expressed its gratitude to the relief organisation Caritas for helping the most disadvantaged, as well as organising a week of solidarity this year between the church and the people of BiH.
EC urges Pristina to implement more reforms
PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Government officials met with representatives of the European Commission (EC) on Tuesday (July 6th) in Pristina, the first plenary meeting of the Stabilisation and Association Process (SAP) Dialogue.
Discussions focused on Kosovo's EU ambitions and achievements since the last EC progress report in October.
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci reaffirmed his government's commitment to fighting organised crime and corruption.
He also said he expects that the number of countries recognising Kosovo's independence will rise after the International Court of Justice delivers its opinion on the legality of Pristina's declaration of independence.
EC representatives urged Kosovo to step up efforts against corruption, implement judicial and public administration reforms and improve public procurement procedures. (Koha Net, Radio Free Europe, B92 - 06/07/10)
Contact Group wants Kosovo status resolved this year
During a visit to Kosovo last week, representatives of the Contact Group stressed the need to resolve the province's status this year, while also calling on provisional authorities to step up the implementation of standards and ensure a viable future for the Serb minority.

Kosovo's status should be settled this year, and the solution must be acceptable to its citizens, representatives of the Contact Group reiterated on Friday (7 April) during a visit to the province.
"The Contact Group reaffirmed its wish that all possible efforts be made to achieve a settlement in 2006 and noted that the final settlement needs, inter alia, to be acceptable to the people of Kosovo," said a press release issued after talks among representatives of Contact Group member states, Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu, Prime Minister Agim Ceku, the Kosovo negotiating team, and representative of Serbs and other minorities.
At the same time, the Contact Group restated its commitment to preserving a viable Serb presence in Kosovo, and said arrangements must be negotiated in the status process to guarantee the rights and security of all of Kosovo's people.
"Kosovo's leaders should deliver tangible results on the [UN-set] standards, particularly those affecting minority communities, in order to improve the situation of minorities and all citizens," the representatives said.
The Group urged the province's leaders to be flexible and generous in the status negotiations, particularly when it comes to decentralisation and the protection of Serbian Orthodox heritage in Kosovo.
They also encouraged Kosovo Serbs and non-Serb minorities to participate actively in the status process and in Kosovo's governing institutions.
A fourth meeting between Pristina and Belgrade delegations will take place in Vienna, on 4 May, amid sharp differences between the two sides.
"The last meeting only showed how far the positions are from each other," said Deputy Prime Minister Lutfi Haziri.
While in Kosovo, the Contact Group representatives visited the ethnically divided city of Mitrovica and met with regional mayors.
Mitrovica suffers from a host of problems -- including economic stagnation, unresolved property claims and restricted freedom of movement -- that cannot be addressed without engagement and co-operation between residents on both sides of the River Ibra, the representatives said.
The Group pledged sustained attention to Mitrovica both now and after Kosovo's status is resolved.
It reaffirmed previous statements that there will be no partition of any kind of Kosovo, either de facto or otherwise.
The international representatives arrived in Pristina after a two-day stay in Belgrade, where they met with Serbian President Boris Tadic, Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic and the Serbian negotiating team for the Kosovo status talks.
They urged Belgrade to play a constructive role in the process and help arrive at realistic solutions, especially in the areas of decentralisation and the protection of minority rights.
Visa relief, free trade on EC's agenda for Western Balkans
Brussels is moving ahead with steps meant to put the Thessaloniki Summit conclusions into action and demonstrate the EU's commitment to the countries of Southeast Europe, including the Western Balkans.

In late March, Macedonia became the first country in the Western Balkans to hold talks with the European Commission on easing the requirements for visas. Two days of negotiations were held on 28-29 March, setting the stage for what Brussels says would ultimately be a region-wide initiative.
Visa relief was one of the steps proposed in the EC's January communique, "The Western Balkans on the road to the EU: Consolidating stability and raising prosperity".
It sets out a number of measures intended to help membership candidates and potential candidate countries move further along the road to entry into the bloc.
Other measures outlined in the document include providing more scholarships for students and providing continued assistance to small enterprises via the recently established European Fund for Southeast Europe, to which 60m euros have been allocated for 2006.
In addition, a Regional Higher Education and Public Administration School will start activities this year.
Planning meetings about the school have already been initiated in each beneficiary country in the region, and the first regional-level meeting is set to take place in May.
Of all the EC's proposals, however, the one that has provoked the most discussion is its call for a regional free trade agreement.
Media in the Balkans, echoed by various politicians, greeted the idea with suspicion, characterising it as an attempt to restore Yugoslavia, minus Slovenia but with the addition of Albania.
Those concerns have now subsided, with EC representatives insisting that they had no such aim in mind and stressing the benefits of trade liberalisation.
On 6 April, prime ministers of eight countries -- Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Moldova, Romania and Serbia-Montenegro -- met in Bucharest and endorsed the creation of a single free trade zone through the expansion of the existing Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA).
CEFTA currently includes Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia and Romania.
However, Bulgaria and Romania will be leaving the organisation once they enter the EU.
The EC also has suggested the establishment of a local border traffic regime at the external borders of the EU member states.
Under this regime, residents of border regions -- including along EU borders with Western Balkan countries -- could be authorised to cross the border with a local border traffic permit, and without a visa.
UNDP chief pledges further assistance to Albania

UNDP chief Kemal Dervis praised Albania on Monday (10 April) for its co-operation with his organisation and development efforts, and pledged continued assistance to the country.
"Albania has been a role model for other countries in its pursuit of human development and in its strong commitment to the Millennium Development Goals," said Dervis, the third highest-ranking UN official, during a visit to Tirana. "Albania recognised that good governance is a crucial component of development by making it a priority in all of their work.
I applaud Albania for that."
Dervis arrived on a two-day visit to the country on Monday -- his second visit since 1991, and the first since he became UNDP head in May 2005.
Dervis met with Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha and Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli.
"The priority you have given economic development -- since the time you were president -- it is obviously having a result," a UNDP statement quoted Dervis as saying after his meeting with the prime minister.
During the talks, Berisha briefed him about Albania's efforts in the fight against organised crime, trafficking and corruption, and about concrete legal initiatives, including the law to counter conflict of interest and nepotism.
The two also discussed the UNDP programme in Albania, particularly in four new areas of co-operation: Combating extra-legality and undertaking tax reform; information and communication technologies for schools; the Brain Gain initiative; and environment and tourism.
The e-schools project focuses on the modernisation of school computer labs, the establishment of broadband Internet connectivity and the training of teachers.
Around 1,749 primary schools and 384 high schools will be the primary beneficiaries of this project, which will help Albanian students acquire skills and take advantage of modern information and communication technologies.
The UNDP has set aside $1.3m for the first year of implementation of the 36-month programme.
The projects on combating extralegality and supporting ecological initiatives and cultural tourism were also expected to be inaugurated during Dervis's visit.
The Brain Gain initiative would assist the government in its effort to utilise expatriate Albanian expertise for the country's socio-economic development.
On Monday, Dervis visited a police station commissariat in Tirana, which has been renovated under an ongoing project in support of security sector reform, financed by various international and bilateral donors, including the UNDP.
Addressing deputies in parliament later, Dervis urged politicians to stay united on issues of national importance, stressing that stability is key to sustainable economic development and growth.
Income per capita in Albania could double in 20 years if it promotes "private entrepreneurship and markets, as well as a good government that makes sure that markets are competitive, that they are well regulated, that the law applies equally to all," the AP quoted him as saying.
"So Albania needs both: effective government and competitive markets ...
What is crucial is to enforce the rule of law and not allow criminal elements to distort the economy to their advantage.
Political instability is the biggest enemy of rapid and sustained growth," Dervis said.
IMF predicts Macedonia's economy will grow in 2010
Macedonians can look forward to a recovery following this year's 1.3% contraction.

Macedonia is on track to return to economic growth next year, the IMF said on Monday (December 28th), praising authorities for taking prudent fiscal and monetary steps in the face of global turmoil.
The anticipated 1.3% contraction this year is expected to be followed by a GDP growth of 2% in 2010, the Washington-based international financial institution noted in an annual review of the Macedonian economy.
Macedonia was able to cushion the impact of worldwide economic woes and its downturn was modest compared to other countries in the Balkans, Fund executive directors said, citing the country's macroeconomic policies as one of the reasons.
Export demand fell and external financing decreased as the global crisis hit Macedonia in late 2008.
As a result, the country's economy experienced a sharp slowdown, tax revenues shrank and the central bank's foreign exchange reserves dropped significantly.
In response, the government cut planned spending increases and issued euro-denominated bonds worth 175m euros in July, which helped increase reserves and ensured sufficient budget financing.
The National Bank of Macedonia managed to slow credit growth and contain the loss of reserves by tightening the bank liquidity and reserve requirements and by raising its policy rate from 7% to 9%.
The prudent fiscal and monetary policies and the exchange rate peg to the euro served Macedonia well, as the situation in the country had stabilised and confidence had improved by the second half of this year, according to the IMF.
The Fund also noted that there is no significant exchange rate misalignment and urged Skopje to carry out structural reforms, particularly in the public administration sector and the judiciary, to increase the country's competitiveness and secure more foreign direct investment.
But the IMF also warned of some problems.
"The large -- albeit reduced -- current account deficit in the context of an exchange rate peg is a source of vulnerability and limits the room for policy manoeuvre," the Fund stressed. "In the near term, supporting growth while reducing external imbalances will remain a key challenge."
Welcoming the tightening of monetary policy in the first half of 2009, the IMF executive directors voiced support for the recent cut in the policy rate, given more conducive conditions.
But they also cautioned Macedonian authorities that plans to ease monetary policies should not be taken until there are "clear signs of lasting favourable trends in the balance of payments and international reserves".
The IMF directors also said that authorities' revenue projections for 2010 may prove somewhat optimistic, but welcomed their readiness to take the needed steps to meet the deficit target of 2.5% of GDP envisioned in the country's budget for next year.
"Directors were encouraged by the broadly healthy condition of the banking system and its low reliance on external funding," the Fund said in its statement Monday.
The IMF board also welcomed plans to take steps towards strengthening crisis response mechanisms and to adopt legislation that will allow them to intervene in troubled banks without being subject to court challenge.
The sky's the limit for disabled athletes in Serbia
An organisation in Serbia is bringing out the best in the country's disabled athletes.
By Nikola Barbutov for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 29/12/09
Members of the Disabled Athletic Association of Serbia at the peak of Bobotov Kuk [ssisrbije.org].
The Disabled Athletic Association of Serbia, which had about 15,000 members, is on a mission to keep handicapped athletes in the country active.
"Sporting results are not the primary goal, the goal is rather to include as many disabled people as possible in all events, instead of having them just sit at home...
Our aim is to increase the number of our members, who now account for around 2% of disabled people," Dusan Moracanin, head of the Disabled Athletic Association of Serbia told SETimes.
He added that in order to achieve that goal, the association needs more funding.
"We are financed by the Sports and Youth Ministry and the Labour and Social Policy Ministry, but those funds are sufficient only for some basic costs and activities.
We are unable to develop and offer something new.
Working with disabled people requires a whole team that includes a psychologist… we are unable to hire that kind of personnel," said Moracanin.
The disabled in Serbia compete at the state and international levels in chess, shooting, fishing, swimming, table tennis and wheelchair basketball, and also participate in recreational activities such as mountain climbing, sailing and weightlifting.
According to Moracanin, sporting activities are a great way for disabled people to boost their self-esteem -- especially mountain climbing.
"When you reach the top, it feels fantastic to look around and realise what you've gone through.
You've made it," he said.
The association started hosting mountain climbing events about three years ago in association with two mountaineering clubs -- Pobeda and Avala.
Milanka Arsic, who recently opened her own mountaineering club called Balkan, described a climb up Bobotov Kuk, a peak in northern Montenegro, where disabled climbers reached the summit.
"It was extremely difficult.
It was unreal, phenomenal, impossible -- but we did it," she told SETimes.
Pobeda guide Zoran Kovljenic was overjoyed that the disabled mountaineers accomplished what some "healthy" folks could not.
The mountaineering groups plan to branch out and climb peaks in neighbouring countries, such as Mount Olympus in Greece and Mount Rila in Bulgaria.

Crowds flock to Croatia's annual Knight's tournament
A centuries-old competition in Sinj draws more international attention.

Southern Croatia hosted the annual knight competition in Sinj on August 9th, called Alka, to celebrate the 1715 military victory over Ottoman forces nearly 300 years ago.
The competition, now in its 294th year, featured participants on horseback, decked out in full knight regalia, who tried to snag a three-ring set (alkas) with their lance.
Alka attracted nearly 10,000 visitors, and the eye of the foreign media.
''We are proud of keeping the tradition that long and there is no doubt people of Sinj will continue to take care of the Alka in the future. … We would like to bring tourists in throughout the year to visit Sinj, learn about the Alka, enjoy it, see the area, enjoy our cuisine,'' said Alka Duke Ivan Cikara.
Croatian President Stipe Mesic and Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor were on hand for the event, as was the visiting Swiss Guard -- recruited by organisers to make the event more international in scope.
''We want to connect with similar associations abroad.
The historical Swiss Guard unit 'Societe des Vieux-Grenadiers' were our guests in Sinj this year and we were very glad about it," said Stipe Jukic , president of the Alka Knights' Society.
This year's winner, Ante Zorica, hit the Alka's centre in all three races -- a rare achievement that left spectators in awe.
This is a dream come true. My family members used to win in the past at this game, but this is me doing it, and I have a special feeling,'' said Zorica, who continued the tradition of his Uncle Ivan's victory 20 years ago.
''Ante did it in a magnificent way.
It was amazing.
Three times hitting the middle in three races does not happen that often.
In the nearly three-centuries-long tradition of Alka, it happened just a few times,'' said Ivan Zorica.
A large number of foreign visitors are expected to turn out for Alka's 300th anniversary in 2015.
Authorities plan to organise a film festival in co-operation with Eugene Chaplin -- son of the legendary actor and director Charlie Chaplin -- who was introduced to Alka this year.
Serbia's Lepenski Vir offers ancient history with a modern twist
How did our ancestors live in 6,500 BC?
What habits and customs did they have?
Answers to these questions can be found at Lepenski Vir, an archaeological site in eastern Serbia.
By Bojana Milovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 20/08/09 Photos by Nikola Barbutov
Lepenski Vir sits close to the Iron Gates Gorge.
In 1965, during construction of the Djerdap Hydroelectric Plant, workers unearthed remnants of an ancient settlement, Lepenski Vir.
"The people of Lepenski Vir were hunters and gatherers.
The first farmers appeared a little after those oldest inhabitants of this region," says Vasoje Vasic, museum curator.
The site, which sits close to the Iron Gates Gorge, consists of one large settlement and ten satellite villages. In 1967, archaeologist Dragoslav Srejovic founded the Lepenski Vir Museum.
It is closed this summer due to renovations funded by the National Investment Plan, and is set to reopen by the end of the year.
The museum was founded by archaeologist Dragoslav Srejovic in 1967.
"The museum will welcome visitors with a whole new look, new contents and modern video and audio presentations.
Apart from the museum, which will present the authentic environment, hearths and shrines of prehistoric communities, a gallery will also open, where visitors will be able to see many more exhibits than before," Vasic told SETimes.
He also says the area will be transformed into an ethno park, which will allow tourists to view artefacts in an authentic setting.
There are plans to build a camp on the bank of the Danube, as well as a science station.
In addition to Lepenski Vir, eastern Serbia has plenty of natural resources that attract tourists.
Majdanpek, about 30km from Lepenski Vir, and 190km from Belgrade, is known for its ore, especially gold.
Rajkova Pecina Cave is more than 2,300m long.
The Majdanpek Tourism Organisation offers the experience of gold washing -- the oldest craft in the region -- on one of the nearby banks of the Rajkova Reka, Paskova Reka or Mali Pek rivers.
Just 3km from Majdanpek is the Rajkova cave.
It was named after Duke Rajko, who, according to legend, robbed Turks by day and hid stolen treasures in the cave by night.
The cave was first explored by Serbian geographer Jovan Cvijic in 1894.
Today it is fully accessible to tourists and speleologists.
Limestone ornaments and glittering crystals created by nature over millennia decorate the cave walls.
More than 2,300m of canals snake through the cave -- about 600m of which are available to tourists.
IMF: global economic recovery under way
The global economic crisis left "deep scars" that will take years to heal, the IMF's chief economist said in a paper published Wednesday.
(Independent, Wall Street Journal, Finfacts.ie, Nine O'clock - 20/08/09; CNN, RFE/RL, Novinite, IMF - 19/08/09; Reuters, Bloomberg, Market Watch - 18/08/09)
IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard said world leaders must now focus on ways of sustaining the tentative rebound. [IMF]
The global economy is beginning to recuperate from its deepest recession in 60 years, IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard said in a paper published Wednesday (August 19th).
But the process will be slow, he cautioned.
"The recovery has started.
Sustaining it will require delicate rebalancing acts, both within and across countries," Blanchard wrote.
Rebalancing from public to private spending is one measure that would help sustain the world recovery, he added.
An increase in US net exports to China and other Asian countries with current account surpluses is also needed.
The crisis that hit the world last autumn is far from normal, the economist said.
Therefore, models used to understand past recessions are inapplicable in the current situation.
"The turnaround will not be simple," Blanchard said. "The crisis has left deep scars, which will affect both supply and demand for many years to come."
Most countries are set to see positive economic growth for the next few quarters, he noted.
It will not be as vigorous as needed to reduce unemployment in the short term, however.
Stressing that economic stimulus programmes should not be kept in place longer than needed, he said they could be prolonged, only if accompanied by structural measures "to limit the future growth of entitlement programmes".
"IMF estimates suggest that the fiscal cost of future increases in entitlements is ten times the fiscal cost of the crisis," said Blanchard. "Thus, even a modest cut in the growth rate of entitlement programmes can buy substantial fiscal space for continuing stimulus.
Eventually, however, the fiscal stimulus will have to be phased out, and private demand must replace it."
"In nearly all countries, the costs of the crisis have added to the fiscal burden, and higher taxation is inevitable," Blanchard said. "All this means that we may not go back to the old growth path, that potential output may be lower than it was before the crisis."
On the basis of an analysis of 88 banking crises in a wide range of countries over the past 40 years, the IMF has concluded that, on average, they permanently reduce the level of output, but not its growth rate.
"So, if past is prologue, the world economy likely will return to its past growth rate," Blanchard said. "But, especially in advanced countries, the period of above-average growth, characteristic of normal recoveries, may be short-lived or nonexistent."
He also stressed that an understanding of the issues and the risks posed by the crisis, as well as some co-ordination across countries, would likely be of crucial importance during the next few years.
IMF Urges Romania to Reduce Budget Deficit, Boost Reforms
The IMF has praised Romania's macroeconomic policies and structural reform progress, while calling for further efforts to sustain the country's robust economic growth.

Prudent wage policies are critical for maintaining macroeconomic stability, the IMF said Tuesday (27 July). [AFP]
While praising Romania for its prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reform progress over the past three years, the IMF says more efforts are needed in those areas to sustain robust economic growth.
According to IMF projections, Romania's real GDP will reach 5 per cent this year, up from 4.9 per cent in 2003.
"Sustaining strong growth over the medium term will require further efforts to complete macroeconomic stabilisation and accelerate structural reform," the IMF said in a public information notice issued Tuesday (27 July), following consultations with Bucharest earlier this month.
Stressing the importance of maintaining a tight fiscal policy in the coming years, the Fund urged the government to reduce the budget gap to help curb inflation and contain the current account deficit within safe levels.
Romania managed to lower its budget deficit from 2.6 per cent in 2002 to 2.3 per cent in 2003, and the IMF is urging authorities to keep it below 2 per cent of GDP over the medium term.
Inflation, meanwhile, declined from 40.7 per cent in 2000 to 14.1 per cent in 2003, and is expected to drop further to an annual 9.0 per cent in 2004.
An increase in domestic demand last year has pushed the current account deficit to 5.9 per cent, reflecting a very rapid growth of credit to the private sector and a large minimum wage increase in January 2003.
Prudent wage policies are critical to maintaining macroeconomic stability, the IMF said, urging authorities to keep wage settlements in collective labour contracts in line with productivity growth.
The Fund also urged officials to avoid further real increases in the minimum wage, as this would aggravate demand pressures and harm Romania's competitiveness.
The IMF also called for continued efforts to eliminate losses and quasi-fiscal activities in state-owned enterprises (SOE).
It welcomed Romania's privatisation progress over the past three years and government plans to offer most of SOEs outside the energy sector for sale by the end of 2004.
Although energy sector privatisation has been slow, the IMF said, a number of key projects are now close to completion.
Particularly important is the privatisation of Romania's largest company, oil and gas producer Petrom.
The Fund also praised the government for recent progress in improving the business climate, including judiciary reform and the implementation of measures in the fight against corruption.
"To attract higher private investment, it will be crucial to sustain these institutional reforms, further strengthen the fight against corruption -- in particular through further efforts to increase the independence and effectiveness of the judiciary -- and improve transparency in privatisation and public procurement," the Fund said.
It also urged the authorities "to keep up the momentum on these policies in the run-up to the general elections in November and in their immediate aftermath".
Djindjic Murder Trial Resumes in Belgrade
The head of Zoran Djindjic's security detail gave testimony in the trial of his suspected assassins, telling the Belgrade Special Court that police knew that a plot was in the works well before the attack was carried out.

The trial of the suspected assassins of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic has resumed at the Special Court in Belgrade.
One of the major developments so far has been the testimony of the head of Djindjic's security detail, Milan Veruovic, who told the court Tuesday (20 April) that Serbian police knew of a plan to kill the prime minister well before the attack was carried out.
Veruovic, who was wounded in the shooting, indirectly accused former senior police officials of failing to properly boost measures to protect Djindjic, even after an earlier attempt on his life.
Prosecutors have charged Zvezdan Jovanovic, deputy commander of a special operations unit at the time, with the actual shooting.
As the second phase of the trial got under way, a statement from one of the accused, Dusan Krsmanovic, was read to the court.
Krsmanovic said he was near the Serbian government building on 12 March 2003 when he heard two gunshots, and that another suspect, Ninoslav Konstantinovic, later told him that Jovanovic had fired the shots.
The trial has been partly overshadowed by controversial remarks from the new interior minister, Dragan Jocic, who seemed to suggest during an interview on 10 April that a new police investigation into the murder should be launched.
Jocic later said that his comments to the Belgrade daily Blic had been sensationalised and that the case would not be re-opened.
According to former Deputy Police Minister Nenad Milic, a new investigation would likely not uncover anything new.
"There are many different interpretations among the public, but I think that they are completely unfounded.
The material evidence found at the scene of the crime, in front of the Serbian government and the location from where shots were fired, indicates that only one gunman is at issue," Milic said.
The lawyer for the Djindjic family, Rajko Danilovic, said a brand new investigation is unnecessary because of "all the facts that indicate who organised and carried out the assassination".
Danilovic said it is still not known who commissioned the murder and that that any further investigative efforts should be directed towards that question, rather than starting from scratch.
"It is known that the Zemun Clan, amplified by the criminally inclined wing of the Red Berets, could not carry out the murder of Djindjic, had they not enjoyed the support of certain powerful politicians.
If the investigation were to take that direction, that would be very useful and that is what the victims are demanding," Danilovic said.

Holbrooke: Dayton Can Be Changed
Richard Holbrooke, the American ambassador who was most responsible for the signing of the Dayton Agreement that ended the war in BiH in 1995, said that the Dayton constitution can be changed as long as people in BiH agree on the changes.
By Beth Kampschror for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 13/10/03
The man who was instrumental in getting all parties to sign the Dayton Peace Agreement ending the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) eight years ago says the agreement and its constitution were meant to be flexible.
"Dayton is a framework, not a straitjacket," former US Ambassador Richard Holbrooke told the press in Sarajevo on 2 October. "There's no constitution in the world that can't be improved . there have been many changes in the last eight years -- the Bonn Powers that increased the Office of the High Representative power, the state security service."
"Dayton was a framework, and anyone who wants to improve it should go ahead and try.
And anything that all three groups agree to is fine with us," he said.
Holbrooke addressed the BiH Parliament earlier, followed by former UNMIK head Bernard Kouchner.
Both were visiting to support the work of the Office of the High Representative and to encourage the public to do more for their country.
Holbrooke gave up the ambassadorship to Germany to handle BiH as assistant secretary of state for European affairs in 1994.
He led a team of Americans in shuttle diplomacy towards the end of the war, and was most responsible for convincing the warring parties to sign the peace agreement at Dayton, Ohio, in November 1995. The accord, with its 11 annexes, was also designed to create a government for the divided country.
Eight years later, Holbrooke told parliament that his team at Dayton knew the agreement was far from perfect.
For example, he said the central government should have been given more power and ethnic groups given less, that BiH should not have been allowed to keep three armies and that Dayton should have created a truth and reconciliation commission modelled on the one in South Africa.
But Holbrooke said he didn't want to give the impression that his trip here was disappointing.
"On the contrary -- your progress far outweighs your problems now, despite some very serious economic difficulties, and this is a credit to a new emerging generation of post-war leaders," he said.

Substandard Buildings Continue to Kill People in Turkey
The collapse of a building in Konya last month that killed at least 92 people brought renewed attention to the need for improved construction practices in Turkey.
Experts say it is both a matter of adopting new regulations and enforcing existing ones.
By Fatih Baran for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 17/03/04

The death toll in the collapse of the 11-storey Zumrut building in Konya early last month once again drew attention to the problem of substandard buildings in Turkey.
Ninety-two people lost their lives in the disaster, which officials blamed on shoddy construction.
According to Osman Nuri Dulgerler, an official investigating the collapse, lack of controls and poor materials were the main factors.
A Turkish court charged two contractors -- Vedat Kaya and Ismail Canlier -- with negligence for allegedly ignoring building codes.
Substandard construction was also blamed for many of the deaths in two 1999 quakes in western Turkey that killed more than 18,000 people, as well as in the quake in Bingol in May 2003 that killed 176 people -- including 84 children and a teacher who were trapped in a collapsed four-storey school dormitory.
Even though poor building standards have often resulted in building collapses and high death tolls in Turkey, none of the construction companies involved has received severe penalties.
One of the building contractors who faced charges of negligence, Huseyin Uygun, was later awarded a contract to restore 8,000 quake-damaged buildings.
Experts say little has been done to address the problem.
According to the Turkish Construction and Machine Engineers and Architects Union (TMMOB), more that 60 per cent of buildings in Turkey are illegal and substandard.
The existing laws are inadequate, the TMMOB says, while most building regulations have not been implemented.
New legislation that would increase punishment for deaths due to poor construction is pending.
Under the proposed laws, contractors and the authorities in charge of regulating construction would be held responsible and would face substantial prison sentences in cases of negligence.
Because the legislation has yet to be adopted, the maximum sentence that Kaya and Canlier will receive is five years in prison.
"This is entirely a technical failure.
As long as the sanctions for these types of things aren't heavy, citizens will pay the price with their lives.
Nobody has that right.
We won't allow it," said Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, calling for tougher laws on building codes.
The collapse of the Zumrut building reawakened the public to the fact that their homes, schools and workplaces are, in many cases, badly constructed.
But understanding the problem may not be enough.
Until laws compel contractors to abide by the rules, experts say, negligence and inadequate construction practices may continue.
War Crimes Indictee Gotovina Speaks
Gen Ante Gotovina disappeared in 2001 after being indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal. Now he has resurfaced.
By Natasa Radic for Southeast European Times in Zagreb - 12/06/03
After two years of silence, retired Gen Ante Gotovina has given an exclusive interview to the director of the weekly Nacional.
The Croatian general has been at large since June 2001, when UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte unsealed an indictment against him for war crimes allegedly committed during an operation in 1995.
Gotovina has been indicted for crimes against humanity, chain-of-command responsibility for failing to prevent the murder of civilians, and overuse of weapons against civilian targets. He is the only Croat wanted by the war crimes tribunal that has decided not to surrender.
The Croatian government has attempted to capture him without success. A few weeks ago, the ministry of home affairs offered the equivalent of 50,000 euros to anyone providing useful information on Gotovina's whereabouts.
For many, Gotovina is a symbol of Croatia's war for independence.
However, his ties to the political right led to his retirement from the Croatian Army in 2000, after he and other generals signed a letter opposing President Stipe Mesic.
As supreme commander of the armed forces, the president could not accept this political engagement on the part of active generals, and retired them all.
In Nacional's latest issue, magazine director Ivo Pukanic claims to have talked to Gotovina a few days ago.
Supporting the claim, several photographs of the general accompanied by Pukanic were published with the ten-page interview.
Gotovina's lawyers initially refused to comment, but as questions concerning the authenticity of the interview emerged, some of them have said they believe it is genuine.
Pukanic, who is now being questioned by police, has invoked the legal right of journalists to protect their sources and stories.
Local media speculate that Gotovina, who is on Interpol's most wanted list, is hiding in Bosnia and Herzegovina or in Canada.
In the interview, Gotovina claims that he was not aware of any requests coming from the prosecutor's office in The Hague in 1998, when investigators wanted to interview him.
Soon after, the indictment was unsealed.
After two years in hiding, Gotovina now says that he recognises the UN tribunal and is ready to talk.
Meanwhile, Mesic said Wednesday (11 June) that he has sent a letter to the tribunal proposing that the preliminary hearing on the case be held in Zagreb.
The first comments coming from del Ponte's office indicate that she expects Gotovina to surrender and be transferred to The Hague.

Judicial reform talks under way in BiH
The talks averted a potentially damaging showdown between the High Representative and RS.

It took a meeting last month between Republika Srpska President Milorad Dodik and EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton to avert a crisis and strike a deal on launching structural dialogue on judicial reform, a process both agreed would be long-term.
The restructuring bid was necessitated by Dodik's intention to organise a referendum on BiH's court and prosecutor's office.
Bosnian Serbs have long complained that the existing system lacks a process for addressing war crimes committed against Serbs during the BiH conflict.
At the first round in Banja Luka last week, EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said the whole process could be described as simply "more EU in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH)".
Ashton had pledged that a special committee would be formed as a step towards restructuring.
It would offer recommendations on how to address issues in the judicial sector within the context of the EU accession process.
The main goal of the structural dialogue is to consolidate legislation and create a legal system that will be independent and impartial.
"This is very serious work, and the Republic of Srpska had prepared some documents and analysis that our representatives presented at the beginning of the dialogue," said Igor Radojicic, president of the RS National Assembly.
He participated in the first day of dialogue with politicians on June 6th, which was followed by a meeting of experts.
There is no doubt BiH had to start this process eventually, as it is in accordance with the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, said High Representative and Special EU Representative Valentin Inzko.
"The process that has started in BiH is something every country must pass if it wants to become an EU member," he noted.
However, Dodik made clear that RS will not support the creation of a High Court in BiH, described as one of the EU proposals.
"We do not question some form of court and prosecutors office on the state level, but in any case, the application of retroactive law should be excluded.
We will not agree to combine the legal budget, as some suggest, because it would not be effective," said Dodik.
Justice Minister Barisa Colak weighed in, saying "I believe we must find a solution that fulfills minimum EU standards.
On the other hand, we must respect the legal and constitutional system until it is changed.
We will not be able to change some things radically, if they should be changed, without constitutional reforms."
But Professor Vitomir Popovic of the Faculty of Law in Banja Luka disagrees.
"There is no reason for this dialogue on judicial reform to last long and it is in everyone's interest to complete this reform before any other discussions about any other question of Bosnian institutions' work."
European representatives said they would come up with certain proposals after every round of talks, but it will be up to Bosnian officials to make final decisions.
First, they must respond to a questionnaire on the judicial system in BiH by August 31st.
Turkey's EU accession gets a boost
Prime Minister Erdogan's government has established a new ministry in order to jump-start the process.

At a time when the EU accession process has ground to a near complete halt, Turkey's government hopes establishing a new ministry will help get things back on track.
The European Union Ministry will take over co-ordination of Turkey's path towards EU integration, a task currently handled by state minister and chief negotiator Egemen Bagis.
The government has set an ambitious goal: full harmonization with the EU by the end of 2013.
According to retired ambassador Ozdem Sanberk, one of Turkey's most seasoned diplomats, establishment of the ministry sends an important message both at home and abroad, demonstrating the country's continued readiness to become a full member of the European Union.
"This proves that coherence and continuity are still the prevalent principles of Turkish foreign policy," Sanberk told SETimes.
Among outside observers, Turkey's multi-dimensional regional diplomacy and slow movement towards EU harmonization, along with resistance from EU members Germany and France to Turkey's accession, have spawned fears that Turkey is sliding away from the West.
At the same time, however, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the ruling AKP party – now going into their third five-year term in power – have a number of important domestic issues to tackle, for which the EU accession process can act as an important anchor.
These include writing a new constitution and efforts to resolve the Kurdish problem.
The new ministry will be at the cabinet same level as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As Bagis notes, the EU General Secretariat (EUGS) will now report directly to the prime minister, while the ministry will have full responsibility for the EU portfolio.
According to Sanberk, however, this could lead to some battles for turf among the various ministries and centre of authority, because the new ministry will need to co-ordinate the implementation of the reform process and ensure that other ministries are doing their part.
"This ministry needs to possess, with respect to hierarchy, a certain dominance and authority over other ministries [and this] entails difficulties from the standpoint of the domestic political equilibrium," he said.
Sebnem Karaucak, editor-in-chief of Kriter Magazine and the chairperson of Eurohorizons Consulting, believes the ministry will nevertheless help iron out many internal obstacles to the accession process.
"It is an important step that will help overcome the constant confusion of responsibilities between relevant institutions since the establishment of EUSG in 2000," she told SETimes.
Sanberk argues that the responsibility of Ministry of Foreign Affairs should continue at the level of external relations, explaining that the external and internal dimensions of EU accession should not be conceived as compartmentalized, but rather viewed as concomitant to each other.
All functions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should continue in the upcoming period with the same efficiency; and this new process should lead to a close and efficient co-operation and co-ordination between the relevant parties, she said.
Despite the anchor role of the EU in Turkey's domestic reform process, with so many issues on the domestic agenda and intractable issues like the Cyprus blocking the opening of new Chapters, some question how high EU membership will be on the government's list of priorities.
Veteran diplomat and diplomacy advisor to CNN-Turk Yalim Eralp told SETimes, "With the AKP's election win on June 12th, EU relations will fall from the agenda for a while; this will lower the efficacy of the new ministry."
Tourism: Albania hopes to build on record growth
Despite the country's ongoing political tensions, the tourism industry is banking on a repeat of last year's crowds.

It was a banner year for tourism: Albania had about 3.5 million visitors last year, a whopping 32% increase over previous years.
Authorities are happily anticipating more of the same.
"Our expectations are based on the improvements we have done in infrastructure and improvements of the tourist environment in general," Endri Jorgoni, chief of cabinet in the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, tells SETimes.
"However," he acknowledges, "the political situation might have a negative impact on that".
Lack of infrastructure, including inadequate road connections to the most popular attractions, is one of the main problems hampering the country from realizing its tourism potential, Jorgoni said.
The government, he added, is seeking to boost investment in the sector and has drafted new legislation to that effect.
Dritan Xhengo, 35, has been operating a tourist agency in Tirana for eight years now.
It offers everything from tickets and packages to travel insurance.
"So far, so good," he says about tourism this year, though he agrees that Albania's turbulent politics could impact the number of visitors.
Still, he adds, the industry has seen "extraordinarily positive change" compared to a few years ago.
Most of Western tourists prefer study tours, cultural tourism, and archaeology.
Many come from Britain, Italy, Finland and Denmark.
"Albania is cheap for them," says Xhengo.
Meanwhile, as more and more visitors come to Albania, Albanians themselves are going abroad for their holidays.
Albania still "exports" more tourists than it "imports", Xhengo said.
The reasons, he added, include the comparatively low level of services in Albania, and an eagerness to see other cultures in Europe.
"Comparing money you spent with the quality you get, it's cheaper abroad than at home," he said.
In the past, Albanians favoured travel to countries where they do not need a visa, such as Turkey.
But visa liberalization has changed that, according to industry sources, and there is increasing interest in Croatia, Greece and Spain.
Tirana resident Enkelejda Beqo says she has chosen to spend vacations in different countries because she likes meeting new people, seeing different cultures, and visiting places rich in history.
"It is also about spending vacations in places where you know nobody … and where service is in line with quality and cost," Beqo told SETimes.
Serbia tackles campaign finance
Serbia's parliament passed the law on funding political parties, which is one of the conditions for obtaining EU candidate status.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade – 15/06/11
Political parties must now disclose their financers. [Reuters]
Sparked by Serbs' feelings that political parties are one of the biggest generators of corruption in the country, the EU has demanded that the country set the manner for financing political activities.
As the result, on Tuesday (June 14th), the Serbian parliament adopted a law on financing political parties, which will make the activities and financing transparent and allow the public a look into their financial sources.
"The law also envisages clear penalties for those who fail to abide by the regulations," State Administration Minister Milan Markovic said, adding that all financial contributions to parties would nowbe publicized and carried out exclusively through bank accounts.
The public will be able to see who, aside from the state, finances parties and how much money they get from private sources.
This means that parties in Serbia will be punished for omissions in financial operations for the first time.
Anti-Corruption Agency Chairwoman Zorana Markovic said the new regulations on financing political activities were necessary, because the public believed there was a lot of corruption in that area.
"I think we can be satisfied, because at this moment we have good legal grounds for more transparent actions in the field.
I hope that we will very soon clear up the issue of financing political parties and tone it down to a realistic measure," Markovic said.
According to the new law, illegal acquisition of funding can carry the penalty of between three months and three years in prison.
The same sentence will apply those who jeopardize the financiers of political parties in any way.
Zlata Djordjevic, a member of the Anti-Corruption Agency committee, told SETimes that it is important that the new law allow the agency to control parties' financial reports and to hire auditors if it doubts the validity of party documents.
"Control of party operations can prove to be crucial in suppressing corruption on the political scene," she said.
The law will also prevent the appearance of phantom parties in elections, ie, those that exist only to take money from the budget for election campaigning, Djordjevic said.
"All parties that plan to take part in elections must pay a certain guarantee, which is poured back into the state budget if a party fails to win one percent of valid votes in an election," she said.
Transparency Serbia representative Nemanja Nenadic told SETimes that the law is not "a magic wand that can solve everything at once".
"Everything depends on independent state bodies and their control, but the fact is that they now have more instruments of control.
Up till now there has been no verified data on who is financing a certain party," he said.
Not everyone involved in Serbia's political life is happy with the new law, although all MPs said the financing of parties should be controlled.
Miroslav Petkovic, vice-president of the opposition Democratic Party of Serbia, told SETimes that according to the new law, more money would be earmarked for parties from the budget, which was unacceptable in the economic crisis.
"The law is not good because it does not sanction potential abuse of state resources in the financing of parties -- there is no control of possible concealed drawing of public companies' funds for certain parties," he said.
Lower costs lure Greek, Romanian companies to Bulgaria
Bulgaria has enjoyed a spike in the number of Greek and Romanian businesses registrations due to the country's low taxes, cheap labour and geographic proximity.
By Tzvetina Borisova for Southeast European Times in Sofia – 22/08/11
Official statistics pinpoint Greek and Romanian businesses' increased commerce, industry and service sector activity in Bulgaria. [Reuters].
Amid economic crisis and burdensome austerity measures in the Balkans, Bulgaria's 'flat tax' has created an opportunity for businesses to set up shop at a low cost.
A flat tax is a system under which taxpayers pay a single tax rate at the same percentage of their total income or profit.
Currently, there are over 2,000 Greek and nearly 300 Romanian companies that have registered in Bulgaria, according to official statistics.
Bulgaria's National Revenue Agency (NRA) reports that since 2006, the number of wholly Greek-owned businesses that filed taxes in Bulgaria has grown almost threefold.
The number of companies climbed from 733 in 2006 to 2,074 by the end of 2010, with the sharpest increase occurring in 2008 -- from 619 to 1,168 -- when Bulgaria introduced its 10% flat corporate and personal income tax.
Since then, business operations in Bulgaria have increased annually by an average of 600 companies.
The figures for Romanian businesses show a similar trend. From only 33 registered companies in 2006, the number of wholly Romanian-owned businesses in Bulgaria reached 272 in 2010.
The data suggest that a lower tax rate has also driven neighbouring companies to Bulgaria.
Comparatively, corporate taxes in Greece stand at 24% -- more than double that of its neighbour.
One factor contributing to business flight is the Greek government's implementation of austerity measures amid the most serious financial and economic crisis in the country's history.
Theofilos Aslanidis, general manager of the Thessaloniki-based Hellenic Fashion Industry Association, contends that the migration of Greek businesses to neighbouring Bulgaria is "nothing new", but rather a phenomenon dating back to the 1990s.
Cheap labour costs are very attractive to employers. [Reuters]
According to Aslanidis, "Whoever could have transferred their business to Bulgaria has already done so; they didn't wait for this crisis." Bulgaria's cheap labour costs are another attraction to businesses.
According to EU statistics, Greece has one of the highest wage levels, while Bulgaria stands firmly at the bottom.
Aslanidis praises Bulgaria's cheap labour costs, saying that "Greek companies have strengthened their operations in the retail sector as a result." He also applauds the low level of red tape in Bulgaria's customs sectors.
Lower transportation costs, inexpensive property rents, and a stable economic situation in Bulgaria are among the factors attracting foreign companies.
Romanian businesses are also tempted to increase their presence in Bulgaria, especially after the Romanian government introduced fiscal reform to increase taxes and tighten regulation.
This was in response to international financial institution requirements attached to the 20 billion-euro loan that helped the country stave off economic disaster in part by implementing strict austerity measures.
In Romania, the corporate income tax stands at 16%.
However, authorities re-established a 3% rate for microenterprises that meet certain criteria, such as having less than nine employees and a turnover of less than 100,000 euros.
The country "is so bureaucratically and fiscally excessive that Romanian companies seek friendlier environments in Bulgaria -- a close destination for businesses based in southeast Romania," Editor Aurel Dragan of CAPITAL, the Romanian economic weekly.
Austerity measures in neighbouring Romania have sparked work stoppages and driven businesses to Bulgaria. [Reuters]
Low tax rates have also had the broader effect of attracting private citizens to the country.
The NRA in Rousse recently announced that the city's richest person is a Romanian consultant who earned 3.12m leva (around 1.6m euros) last year.
This individual, whose name was not revealed, owed 187,000 leva in taxes (95,000 euros) as of last May, according to the office.
Apart from the companies who are registered in Bulgaria, there are also those who outsource some of their activities.
According to Jechko Dimitrov, president of the Bulgarian Institute for Foreign Trade, their number is much higher than those that register.
Many believe this is good for the country, as it creates a living for people in certain areas.
But Dimitrov disagrees, based on the general economic picture.
"They [the outsourcing businesses] return all their profits abroad ...
This is not good for Bulgaria.
We should try to attract investors and make them move their whole business to Bulgaria," he told SETimes.
"They come here because our labour is cheaper.
That's the only use they have."
According to him, the mechanism of lower taxes does not work. If it did, he argues, "we would have seen much more big investors moving their headquarters and financial balances to Bulgaria."
"It turns out it is not the nominal value of taxes that matters, but the overall price of doing business in Bulgaria," he said.
"If you don't have good transport infrastructure, if you have problems with bureaucracy and corruption, business turns out to be more expensive.
What use will you have from paying lower taxes then?"
"Attracting small traders in small villages in towns cannot be a policy to develop a region and the overall economy," Dimitrov concluded.
New Turkish Penal Code Still Controversial
The new Turkish Penal Code, amended after 78 years, aims to bring the country's laws into line with the EU.
But critics say the revised code still contains articles limiting press freedom.
By Allan Cove for Southeast European Times -- 23/05/05
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan recently approved a revised draft of the penal code in which 26 articles were amended. [AFP]
The new Turkish Penal Code (TCK), due to be implemented on 1 June, will bring vital changes to Turkey.
Aiming to eliminate shortcomings targeted by the EU, it removes any reference to the death penalty in Turkish law, bars virginity testing, places the National Security Council under civil control, and increases punishments for ordinary crimes.
Critics, however, argue that it still limits press freedom by using ambiguous or broadly-defined terminology, and by keeping in place penalties for "thought crimes" and insults against government figures or public officials.
According to the Turkey Association of Journalists, the new TCK imposes a number of limits on press freedom.
For example, prison terms can be increased by one third if a crime was committed via the media.The concept of "insult", says the association, is defined using vague, confusing terms that could be interpreted very broadly and lead to controversial decisions, thus limiting the media's room to manoeuvre.
Furthermore, if a journalist is charged with insulting a minister, the insult is recorded as having been made against the entire cabinet -- allowing each individual minister to file a complaint against the journalist.
Thought crimes, crimes perpetrated against public order, and other related offenses carry penalties of between six months and five years in jail under the new TCK.
That constitutes an indirect limit on media freedom, according to the association.
The code was supposed to take effect on 1 April.
Facing heavy criticism, however, the government postponed implementation until 1 June to make amendments in line with demands voiced by journalists' groups and NGOs. According to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the latest revision amends 26 articles and includes most of the changes sought by the press.
Not so, says Press Council President Oktay Eksi, adding that his organisation will appeal to the European Court of Human Rights if parliament does not take action.
"We argued that the rights of privacy in communication and personal privacy should be protected, but when journalists abuse those rights aiming to report in favour of the 'public interest', their acts should not be criminalised," Eksi said, adding that this demand had been refused by the government commission that drafted the TCK.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Urges Romania to Press Ahead With Reforms
Romania stands a good chance of achieving the progress required for EU membership in 2007 but must move quickly to meet the criteria, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said as he completed a two-day visit to Bucharest.

Winding up a two-day visit to Bucharest, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said Tuesday (1 March) that Romania stands a good chance of achieving the progress needed to join the Union in January 2007.
But he also warned authorities they have no time to waste in meeting the membership criteria.
"Romania should exert efforts for the fulfilment of the accession criteria and, from this viewpoint, each day, each week, each month should be turned to good account in the fight against corruption and the justice reform," Rehn told reporters.
Meeting requirements set out in the accession treaty is the "priority of all priorities", he added.
Romania concluded its entry talks in December and is scheduled to sign, together with Bulgaria, its accession treaty with the EU on 25 April.
Although membership is expected in 2007, safeguard clauses included in the treaty allow for a postponement if conditions are not met.
In addition to tackling corruption and pressing ahead with judicial and political reform, the country must also cut state subsidies to the steel sector.
During his first official visit to Romania since assuming his post in November, Rehn met with President Traian Basescu, Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu, Foreign Minister Razvan Mihai Ungureanu and other key officials.
Tariceanu assured Rehn that his country is determined to meet its commitments, particularly in the fight against corruption.
He noted that the administration has moved to free the Supreme Council of Magistrates from political influence, appointed a justice minister with no political allegiances and stripped former ministers of their immunity from prosecution.
"There is no doubt whatsoever as to the authorities' intentions of combating corruption," Tariceanu said.
An EC monitoring mission is scheduled to visit Bucharest this month and present an assessment in May.
Several months later, most likely in November, the EC will publish its comprehensive report on Romania's accession progress.
Rehn has promised a "fair evaluation".
Montenegro's Proposal to Form Union of Independent States Sparks Debate
Arguing that the present state union is dysfunctional and inefficient, Montenegrin leaders have put forth a proposal transforming Serbia-Montenegro into a union of independent states.
By Dusan Kosanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 02/03/05

Montenegrin officials unveiled a proposal on 23 February to transform the state union of Serbia-Montenegro into a union of independent states.
The proposal was sent to Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic, Serbian President Boris Tadic and Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic and President Filip Vujanovic, who signed the proposal, said they anticipate reaching an agreement with Belgrade on an alternative to the present state union, which they say is dysfunctional and inefficient.
According to the Montenegrin leaders, two independent, internationally recognised countries would achieve better results.
Maintaining Serbia-Montenegro is expensive, they say, and the union's shortcomings jeopardise diplomacy and the functioning of the military.
Continuing the status quo would only lead to further deficiencies and slow Montenegro's and Serbia's integration into the EU and international security structures, Djukanovic and Vujanovic have said.
The initial reaction from Belgrade has been less than positive.
Kostunica has described the plan as a blatant violation of the EU-brokered Belgrade Agreement and vowed to stick to the agreement signed in 2003.
"By constantly avoiding and breaching the provisions of the Constitutional Charter, [Montenegrin authorities] are trying to create an extraordinary situation that would lead to a spontaneous disassociation," Kostunica told the daily Politika in an interview published Monday (28 February).
Djukanovic's latest proposal, Kostunica said, shows that the Montenegrin prime minister is trying to avoid a referendum on independence because he fears an unfavourable outcome.
Kostunica's deputy, Miroljub Labus, also opposes the initiative, though he is known as a strong advocate of an independent Serbia, agreeing with Montenegrin leadership on all points concerning the state-union.
"We should hold two referenda and the matter should not be put off past the spring of 2006," Labus said.
Tadic is largely for preserving the state union, but insists, "Serbia's priority is to join the EU and achieve better living standards, not to maintain the joint country at all costs."
Vujanovic, meanwhile, argues that Belgrade's negative reaction is not definite, adding that he cannot see why Serbia should be against its own sovereignty and independent international status.
The international community has steered clear of involvement in Serbia-Montenegro's internal affairs.
However, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana's spokesperson, Cristina Gallach, has voiced concern over political initiatives that could push Serbia and Montenegro away from European integration and cause political tension.
The Beta news agency has quoted officials in Brussels as saying the proposal was "surprising, simply premature, and coming at an inappropriate moment".
This year should not be lost on fruitless moves, the officials said, as Serbia-Montenegro's bid for Euro-Atlantic integration has already lost two years following the assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.
US Ambassador to Belgrade Michael C. Polt said that Washington would support any democratic agreement on state status reached between Serbia and Montenegro.
Podgorica's proposal is a culmination of several months of constitutional crisis triggered by the failure to hold direct elections for the Serbia-Montenegro Parliament.
The republic has advocates for preserving the state union as well as for independence, and the debate will likely sharpen as 2006 approaches.
During that year, Montenegro will have the legal right -- under the Belgrade Agreement -- to organise a referendum on independence.
Alleged Accomplice in Djindjic Murder Could Lead to Organisers
Greece recently extradited Dejan "Bugsy" Milenkovic, the driver of a truck that attempted to hit Zoran Djindjic's car in an assassination attempt in February 2003.
Authorities in Belgrade hope he will clear up unresolved questions concerning The Serbian prime minister's murder the following month.

Dejan "Bugsy" Milenkovic, charged with being an accomplice in the March 2003 murder of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, was recently extradited to Serbia after six months in a Greek prison.
Nicknamed for the notorious criminal Bugsy Siegel, he is thought to have been a key member of the Zemun Clan criminal gang, whose members allegedly carried out the attack on Djindjic.
Authorities hope he will identify those who ordered the assassination as well as clear up other unresolved questions about the case.
They say he was behind the wheel of a truck that attempted to hit Djindjic's car on a Belgrade highway on 21 February 2003.
Other members of the Zemun gang were then allegedly supposed to fire a rocket into the car, but the plan failed because Milenkovic did not manage to stop Djindjic's vehicle.
Milenkovic was arrested, but freed after just three days.
The circumstances of his release remain murky.
Serbian police and the judiciary have leveled accusations at each other concerning the mishap, but an official investigation on the matter was never organised.
Following his release, Milenkovic disappeared. He was on the run for 16 months, until his arrest in Thessaloniki on 16 July 2004.
At his first appearance before the Belgrade Special Court for Organised Crime, Milenkovic requested additional time to prepare his defence.
The trial is set to resume on 9 March.
"I know that many are unhappy with my presence here, as some did not want to see me here alive," Milenkovic told the court.
Under Serbian law, he could be granted witness-associate status and the charges against him could be dropped.
In that case, however, he must co-operate with the prosecution and testify against the rest of the Zemun Clan.
If that does not happen, Milenkovic will be tried for the assassination of Djindjic.
He also faces charges of involvement in six murders and several kidnappings.

US Restores Normal Trade Relations with Serbia-Montenegro
After ten years of trade sanctions, Washington has restored Permanent Normal Trade Relations status to Serbia-Montenegro.
By Dusan Kosanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 10/11/03
After more than a decade, normal trade relations between the United States and Serbia-Montenegro will resume on 1 December, under a decree signed by US Secretary of State Colin Powell.
The move restores Permanent Normal Trade Relations status (PNTR), which the country lost in 1992 as a result of the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and the policies of the Milosevic regime.
The US administration created a precedent by entrusting Powell with signing the decree.
That step, sources say, was taken because of an obstacle that the bill containing the PNTR decree encountered in the US Senate.
The delay was not related to Serbia-Montenegro.
Since congress had no objection to it, President George W. Bush suggested that Powell sign the decree.
Five other countries -- Afghanistan, Cuba, Laos, North Korea, and Vietnam -- do not have PNTR status.
According to a statement issued by the administration, the measure aims to boost Serbia's trade and economy.
While ties have warmed since the ouster of Slobodan Milosevic, foreign trade has yet to reach 1990s levels.
Before Yugoslavia lost PNTR status, the United States was its fifth largest foreign trade partner.
By contrast, in the first eight months of 2003, total foreign trade stood at a modest $116.9m, with Serbian exports to the United States accounting for only $8.4m.
Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic welcomed the US move, describing it as a sign of great progress that will boost US investments in the Serbian market.
"It creates conditions for Serbia's products to enter the US market with imports tariffs reduced by 20 per cent, and I expect that it will affect further US investments in Serbia, but also Serbia's increased exports," he said.
According to the prime minister, the most immediate impact of the change in status will be reflected in Serbian recreational firearms producer Zastava's exports to the US market.
Serbian Trade Minister Slobodan Milosavljevic added that the United States has shown a significant level of interest in Serbian pharmaceutical and furniture products, and that he anticipates that Serbia will also export meat and meat products in the future.

BiH politicians urged to end impasse over police reform
Bosnia and Herzegovina's next step on the road to the EU could be delayed by a year if the country's political leaders fail to hash out a deal by Sunday.

"Bosnian politicians are gambling with the future of their own country," EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said. [Getty Images]
High Representative Miroslav Lajcak urged Bosnian Serb politicians on Wednesday (September 26th) to stop obstructing an agreement on police reform, a key condition for further movement towards EU integration.
"Too much time has been lost and if there is no agreement by Sunday, you will lose even more time," Lajcak told lawmakers at the Republika Srpska (RS) parliament. "The train is leaving and will not return for at least another year."
Similar comments came from EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana.
"Bosnian politicians are gambling with the future of their own country," he said in an interview with the newspaper Dnevni Anaz.
In December, BiH completed technical talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Union, a major first step towards eventual membership in the 27-nation bloc.
But Brussels has made it clear that the accord will not be sealed this year if BiH politicians fail to reach an agreement -- by the end of the month -- on bringing the country's police structures into line with EU standards.
Currently, the two entities in BiH -- the RS and the Federation of BiH -- each have their own police force.
Brussels wants them unified into a single force, with legislative and budgetary competencies for all police matters vested at the state level.
The EU also has called for establishing new policing zones on the basis of professional criteria, rather than on ethnicity, and for an end to political interference in the operational work of police.
Efforts to reach a deal have been deadlocked for more than two years.
Bosnian Serb politicians view the EU's demands as a step towards the abolition of RS, and have rejected successive proposals to unify and restructure the country's two forces.
On Wednesday, Lajcak reassured Bosnian Serb lawmakers that the creation of a single and more efficient police force poses no threat to the existence of their entity.
If politicians do not support police reform, they are rejecting BiH's European path, he said.
As a consequence, the country would face isolation, turn into a "black hole" in the region and lag behind neighbours in the process of EU integration.
"The choice is yours -- you will either continue to opt for isolationist solutions and limit your own prospective in that way, or you will be a driving economic force with positive effects for the economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina," the high representative said.
However, RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik again said he would not agree to eliminate the entity's force.
"Regardless of the consequences, I am not ready to accept anything that does not include a clearly positioned structure for a Bosnian Serb police on the territory of Republika Srpska," he said.
The same day, Bosnian Serb officials warned they might withdraw from state-level institutions if Lajcak uses his sweeping powers to impose tough sanctions against Dodik and others accused of obstructing police reform.
Meanwhile, representatives of the eight main political parties in BiH held their fourth round of technical talks on police reform in Banja Luka, but again failed to reach an agreement.
They reportedly will resume negotiations Friday.
ICJ gives UN members six months to submit views on Kosovo issue
UN member states have until April to submit their views on whether Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence complied with international law, the International Court of Justice said on Tuesday.

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has given UN member nations six months to submit their views on Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence, according to an order published on Tuesday (October 21st).
In an October 8th vote, the General Assembly approved a Serbian resolution requesting the UN top legal body's advisory opinion on whether the secession complied with international law.
A week after receiving the resolution, the ICJ, also known as the World Court, decided on Friday that the UN and its member states are "likely to be able to furnish information" on that question and asked them to submit their written statements by April 17th.
It also set July 17th "as the time-limit within which states and organisations having presented written statements may submit written comments on the other statements".
Kosovo authorities can "make written contributions to the court" defending their declaration of independence.
The ICJ announced on Tuesday that it would invite them to participate in its proceedings as well.
Kosovo has set up a legal team, headed by Michael Wood, a British expert in international law, to represent its interests before the ICJ.
"Wood is one of the most famous and competent lawyers of our time, and we are lucky that he is prepared to represent our case," President Fatmir Sejdiu's office said last week.
"We have great confidence in his stands and experience."
It is not clear yet how the court plans to proceed after July.
According to Tuesday's press release, "the subsequent procedure was reserved for further decision."
Established in 1945, the ICJ has two main functions: to settle legal disputes between states and render advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by UN bodies and specialised agencies. In the first case, the court delivers a verdict that is binding and cannot be appealed.
In the second case, the advisory opinions on issues such as Kosovo's independence declaration have no binding effect.
Therefore, the 51 countries that have recognised Europe's newest state thus far will not be obliged to reverse themselves, even if the ICJ should judge that Kosovo's unilateral move in February broke international law.
Aside from Serbia, which remains staunchly opposed to its former province's secession, Bosnia and Herzegovina is the only former Yugoslav republic that has not recognised Kosovo as an independent state.
Turkey and Iraq ready for counterterrorism accord
Turkey and Iraq have agreed to sign a deal aimed at eliminating the PKK threat in northern Iraq, officials said on Wednesday.

"We cannot accept any person or group that is against Turkey," Iraqi Interior Minister Jawad al-Bolani told reporters on arrival at Ankara's airport. "We are here to take up every issue." [Getty Images]
Iraqi Interior Minister Jawad al-Bolani was in Ankara on Wednesday (September 26th) to discuss terrorist attacks in Turkey by the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK).
Al-Bolani and his Turkish counterpart, Besir Atalay, agreed to sign an accord on eliminating the threat.
The deal-- which will be signed Thursday after being translated into Turkish, Arabic and English -- will allow Turkish "hot pursue" operations into northern Iraq against PKK militants, but with some conditions.
These small-scale military operations would require prior authorisation by the Iraqi central government.
Under the agreement, the two countries will also establish new security mechanisms, including "contact points" between Turkish and Iraqi security units.
Rising attacks by the PKK, whose militants are encamped in mountainous northern Iraq, have been a source of increased tensions between Turkey and Iraq.
Around 100 Turkish soldiers have died this year as a result of PKK attacks.
Turkish officials have been warning of a cross-border operation if the terrorist threat is not eliminated.
The United States, however, has urged Turkey to work with Baghdad and the Iraqi Kurdish regional government to solve the problem.
Washington is concerned that a military incursion by Turkey could destabilise a relatively peaceful region in Iraq.
On Monday, Turkish Land Forces Commander General Ilker Basbug said he expects concrete action."Since 1984, Turkey has been fighting alone against terrorism," Basbug said in a speech to cadets at the Military Academy in Istanbul.
"Turkey's concerns in Iraq are also affecting Turkey's relations with the United States.
The United States has to understand and to demonstrate that it is now time for action, not words."
US State Department deputy spokesman Tom Casey said Washington is aware of the importance of the problem.
"It's important to us as well.
The PKK is a designated foreign terrorist organisation.
And we are working with the government of Turkey, as well as the government of Iraq, to make sure that they cannot operate safely out of northern Iraq or any place else," Casey said.
Parliamentary dispute turns physical in Macedonia
Macedonia's parliament was in chaos Tuesday as a heated verbal dispute among ruling and opposition parties escalated into a brawl.
The largest ethnic Albanian party, the Democratic Union of Integration, is now refusing to participate in the institution.

Prolonged political tensions erupted into a brawl at the Macedonian Parliament on Tuesday (September 25th).
It happened at the end of a heated session concerning changes to the election code.
Speaker Ljubisa Georgievski announced a break after a fierce verbal exchange between the leader of the Party for Democratic Prosperity (PDP), Abduladi Vejseli, and members of the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI).
Immediately afterwards, Vejseli was punched by DUI member Sadula Duraku.
The PDP, an ethnic Albanian party, is a member of Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski's ruling coalition.
The DUI is the largest party representing ethnic Albanians in the country.
Menduh Taci, leader of a third ethnic Albanian party, the Democratic Party of Albanians, then appeared during the break.
Along with a few other members of his party, he allegedly attacked DUI member Teuta Arifi, who asked for medical assistance.
By then, the halls of parliament were in chaos.
A reporter from A1 Television was slapped in the face by DUI party security, and a crew from TV ALSAT was detained while filming police intervention outside the building.
The same evening, police detained nine people who were found in possession of two pistols outside parliament.
Pistols, machine guns and bullets were also found in cars.
The following day, a TV ALSAT cameraman was beaten by police on the way to Tetovo.
He had been filming the police as they stopped a vehicle containing two DUI members of parliament.
The car with the MPs was allowed to go, but the police attacked the journalist and broke his camera.
According to the City Hospital in Skopje, the man has two broken ribs and contusions on his back and chest.
The DUI has now convened an emergency meeting and decided to freeze its participation in the work of the parliament.
The party also requested formation of a parliamentary commission to investigate the incidents.
The opposition Social Democrats and Liberal Democrats have called for the resignations of the interior minister, deputy interior minister and parliament speaker.
Gruevski condemned the incidents and urged party leaders and MPs to resolve their disagreements peacefully and in a democratic manner.
After meeting with the leaders of several parties, he said the first priority is to calm political tensions, after which an investigation should be launched.
Social Democratic leader Radmila Sekerinska, however, said the meeting with Gruevski had produced no results.
She said her party had warned that the situation in parliament was escalating and that the parliamentary majority was provoking trouble.
Instead of reining in those responsible, Gruevski simply complied with them, she said.
The events have drawn international condemnation.
The EU warned that the situation reflects on the image of the country and shows the need for improved political dialogue.
NATO said verbal and physical intimidation in institutions is unacceptable, especially at a time when agreement on reforms is within reach.
The OSCE and the Journalists' Association of Macedonia condemned the attacks on journalists.
The ombudsman has begun an inquiry, and the interior ministry had pledged to conduct an internal investigation.

Economic recovery is under way in the EU, but it will be gradual, the European Commission (EC) said in its 2010 Spring Forecasts published on Wednesday (May 5th).
Greece's economy will register a negative economic growth of -3% in 2010, which will improve to -0.5% in 2011, EC analysts said.
The same research forecasts 1.3% growth in the GDP of Cyprus by 2011. Bulgaria's GDP will grow by 2.7% and Romania's by 3.5% in 2011.
Among the candidate countries, Turkey is the top performer with expected economic growth of 4.7% in 2010 and 4.5% in 2011.
Economic growth is expected to stand at 1.3% this year in Macedonia and accelerate to 2% next year.
Croatia, meanwhile, will register negative growth of -0.5% this year but improve to 2% in 2011.
Albania's exports reached 120m euros in March -- an increase of 83% compared to the same period last year.
The growth comes mainly as a result of electricity exports, according to the Statistics Institute report on Tuesday (May 4th).
German company MC Mobile Communication GmbH has opened a call centre in Kosovo's capital to service the clients of German companies via internet and phone.

ICJ: Kosovo hearing to open in December
The International Court of Justice said on Wednesday that countries wishing to participate in public hearings on the legality of Kosovo's independence should let it know by September 15th.
The hearings will open on December 1st.

The public hearings on the legality of Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence will open on December 1st, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) announced on Wednesday (July 29th).
Those wishing to participate in them must inform the court by September 15th.
The UN and its member states, as well as the "authors" of Kosovo's independence declaration, will then be able to present their statements and comments on the issue during the public hearings at the court's headquarters in The Hague.
On October 8th 2008, the General Assembly approved a Serbian resolution asking the ICJ to render an advisory opinion on whether Kosovo's unilateral move was in accordance with international law. The issue was filed with the UN top judicial organ, known also as the World Court, two days later.
Kosovo authorities, the UN and member states were given until April 17th to submit their written statements on the case.
According to the ICJ's statement Wednesday, the Czech Republic was the first to do that.
Thirty-five other UN member states followed suit.
Albania and Romania were the only Balkan countries, aside from Kosovo and Serbia, to submit statements.
Media reports in April said UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon submitted a 2,900-page dossier with documents and other materials on the matter, some dating back to March 1998.
The ICJ set July 17th as the deadline by which the UN, its member states and Kosovo should file any comments they had on each others' submissions.
Kosovo and 14 of the 36 countries have submitted comments.
Kosovo declared independence from Serbia on February 17th 2008 and has thus far been recognised by 60 countries, including 22 of the EU's 27 member states, Australia, Canada, Japan and the United States.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is the only former Yugoslav republic, aside from Serbia, that has not done so.
Belgrade maintains that Kosovo is an integral part of Serbia.
In a recent interview for the BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight show, Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said he wants to negotiate with Pristina authorities, vowing to be "very flexible".
His remarks also suggested a possible shift in Belgrade's position.
Asked whether he might recognise Kosovo should some of its land be returned to Serbia, Jeremic said "We don't want to exclude any options.
We need to come to the table and see what happens."
As all other advisory opinions rendered by the ICJ, its ruling on the Kosovo issue will have no binding effect.
Therefore, none of the countries that have recognised the young country so far will be obliged to reverse their decisions, even if the UN judges determine its independence declaration was not in accordance with international law.
Ceca out, Tesla in: Serbia's new idols
Folk singers are pushed aside as athletes and scientists become the new role models for Serbian youth.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 26/01/11

Serbian youth increasingly consider the leading athletes, scientists and historical leaders as the people they most admire and want to emulate, a new survey has found.
This preference represents a shift from previous years when young people listed mostly folk singers and people known for their involvement in the Balkan conflicts in the 1990s.
An opinion poll conducted by the Fund for an Open Society Serbia in late 2010 confirmed that tennis players Novak Djokovic, Ana Ivanovic and Jelena Jankovic; football player Nemanja Vidic; and scientists Nikola Tesla and Albert Einstein top the role model list.
Sociologist Ratko Bozovic says the change reflects the increased ability of young people to communicate with the world and acquire knowledge.
"Young people in Serbia are fed up with trivial content," Bozovic told SETimes. "That is why the results of this poll represent a normal response of the youth in search for identity," he said.
The poll's sample consisted of 1,500 people between 15 and 29 years of age.
Only the bottom 10% chose singers of "newly composed" music like Ceca Raznjatovic and Seka Aleksic as well as Bosnian wartime leaders and war time indictees Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic.
Serbian youth "refuse to search for a dirty river, rather they are looking for the pure sources", Bozovic said.
Ministry of Science and Technology official Nada Mijatovic told SETimes that the poll results are very encouraging.
"We have been working for a while on promoting the right values in Serbia and these results are very important," Mijatovic said.
Advocacy efforts by the ministry include placing a large billboard featuring scientist Nikola Tesla at the Belgrade airport as well as organising yearly competitions for projects aimed at promoting science and research.
Tesla's face is practically the first thing arriving passengers see in Belgrade.
Some view the new generation of informed people as a pillar of the country's future development.
"There is an entire army of smart and capable young people who certainly are not pessimists, they can't be, otherwise they would not be successful, and who believe in working and investing in oneself," Belgrade Institute for Excellence Sonja Liht said in an interview with local media.
Kuci asks Kosovo Serbs to vote in November
With local elections about four months away, Pristina is working to encourage Kosovo Serb participation.

Kosovo Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci says if Kosovo Serbs support decentralisation, they should hit the polls. [AFP]
Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Kuci is asking Kosovo Serbs to cast their ballots in the November elections.
According to Kuci, if Kosovo Serbs back decentralisation, they need to vote.
"Serbs should participate in the elections, because we are not interested in having municipalities under the control of parallel structures, and we are looking for the decentralisation of Kosovo," Kuci said on Monday (July 27th).
He is optimistic that the minority group will turn out.
Belgrade, however, is pushing to boycott the election, as former envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan, which Serbia rejects, will be used as a blueprint.
"Serbs are still not legally protected and do not have an adequate number of local self-governments that we have been striving for in the process of decentralisation," Serb Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic told Belgrade-based B92.
Bogdanovic noted that decentralisation is a key step, and said Belgrade would back an election organised by a status-neutral organisation "rather than under the patronage of [EU Special Representative in Kosovo] Pieter Feith's office or the government of Kosovo".
The Serb minister described the Council of Europe, the EU, the UN, and UNMIK as "status-neutral sponsors" and said Serbia is ready to jumpstart talks that will help decentralise Kosovo, but not jeopardise Serbia's position, according to B92.
"We are also ready to talk with EULEX, regardless of the fact it demonstrated bias on numerous occasions," said Bogdanovic.
"There are many issues that we must solve quickly.
We want to solve the legal vacuum in the north of Kosovo as soon as possible, but, of course, not at the expense of the Serb community, not to work according to the laws of the so-called state of Kosovo and not to promote the Ahtisaari plan."
Montenegrin soldiers to head to Afghanistan
Montenegro is preparing to deploy its first military unit to Afghanistan.

Despite some political opposition, the move to deploy troops to the NATO mission in Afghanistan is under way.
Parliament approved on Tuesday (July 28th) a plan to send 40 soldiers to join the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).
The administration says this is necessary to achieve the country's goal of NATO membership.
"A squad and medical personnel will be sent at the start of next year, while two officers who are due to join the German command are going to leave between September and October 2010," Defence Minister Boro Vucinic said.
Montenegro will also send troops to missions in Liberia and Somalia.
Meanwhile, Montenegro is to sign a military-technical agreement with one Alliance partner country to provide support for the troops and their transport to Afghanistan.
Until then, a three-member medical team will leave for Afghanistan in August: one doctor and two technicians.
"It is clear that Montenegro will not contribute to the Alliance in the same way as the US, Germany or France, but it is also certain that, in the range of its capacities, it will adequately contribute," Vucinic told Southeast European Times.
He added that a collective defence system guaranteed by NATO is the best choice for Montenegro.
"For us in the Balkans, there is no more pressing obligation than ensuring peace and stability, that will, at least according to the experiences of new NATO member states, have a positive effect on our economic development, with which we will create a safe investment environment," said Vucinic.
However, the opposition is not happy with the plan.
"The existing law defines participation in missions on a voluntarily basis, but keep in mind that social problems are significant and it is hard to find jobs.
Therefore, it is realistic to expect that a certain number of soldiers will decide [to join a military deployment]," opposition Socialist Peoples Party member Predrag Bulatovic told Southeast European Times.
He also added that the government moved too quickly with the decision.
"Afghanistan is a very risky area and there is a possibility that Montenegro and its citizens may be targeted by the international terrorist organisations."
Preliminary training of 85 soldiers began in Danilovgrad, near Podgorica, last August.
The US company Military Professional Resources, Inc. began an intensive three-month training of soldiers there.
Baby trafficking gang sold infants for 25,000 euros
Bulgarian and Greek police have smashed an organised crime group that took babies from impoverished women -- sometimes by force -- and sold them to childless couples at premium prices.
(CNN, Herald Sun, Standart - 26/01/11; Sofia News Agency, The Sofia Echo, Dnevnik.bg, Mediapool, eKathimerini, Bulgarian Interior Ministry - 25/01/11)

A cross-border criminal ring, which trafficked pregnant women to Greece and sold their newborn babies there, has been smashed as part of an ongoing joint operation by Bulgarian and Greek police, authorities in the two Balkan nations said on Tuesday (January 25th).
A statement by Bulgaria's interior ministry said a total of 11 people have been arrested thus far.
Six of them, including the two alleged leaders of the organised crime group, as well as a doctor and a lawyer, were detained in the town of Lamia in central Greece.
The other five were arrested in the eastern Bulgarian cities of Varna, Burgas and Yambol.
Acting as middlemen, they were responsible for finding pregnant Bulgarian women with little money who were willing to leave their babies for adoption following birth.
Citing Greek police sources, CNN and the Athens-based daily Kathimerini reported that a total of 12 suspects were detained, seven of them in Greece.
The joint operation, dubbed "Babies", followed a several-month investigation, prompted by a tip-off from one of the 14 mainly ethnic Roma victims of the gang.
The woman reportedly gave birth to a baby girl in Greece, but refused to leave it for adoption and the gang took the child from her by force.
She managed to escape and return to Bulgaria.
"The scheme for the transfer of pregnant women to our southern neighbour was very well organised," the Bulgarian interior ministry statement said.
At least three of those arrested in Greece on Tuesday were women, aged between 33 and 39, and all of them of Bulgarian origin.
They included one of the alleged leaders of the criminal network, her sister, who took care of the women until delivery, and the lawyer, who is married to a Greek and allegedly supplied the birth certificates and the faked adoption documents.
Before their departure for Greece, the victims were warned against visiting a doctor in Bulgaria to prevent their pregnancies from being registered.
Prior to the birth of their children, the expectant mothers were transported by car or were given money to buy a ticket to Greece.
There, they were accommodated in lodgings in Lamia and Athens, where they left shortly after delivery.
The Greek clients, mostly childless couples, reportedly paid up to 25,000 euros for the newborn boys and about 15,000 euros for girls, according to the Bulgarian interior ministry.
Depending on the terms of the deal, the mothers received between 100 euros and 1,500 euros, it explained, adding that some got nothing at all.
CNN quoted the police spokesman in Greece as saying that the colour of the baby's skin was one of the factors in determining the price.
If a woman appeared to be having second thoughts about giving up her newborn for adoption, she and her family would be subjected to threats and intimidation by the group.
Only one of the babies sold by the group has reportedly been recovered so far and will be repatriated to Bulgaria.
Police are still trying to establish the whereabouts of the others, according to The Sofia Echo.
Eurojust, the EU agency dealing with judicial co-operation, and Europol were involved in the international co-ordination of the operation in Greece and Bulgaria.
Orthodox seat in Mostar revived
After 18 years, Mostar has again become the seat of the Zahumlje and Herzegovina Eparchy.
By Jusuf Ramadanovic for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo – 26/01/11

After nearly two decades, Mostar is again the seat of the Eparchy of Zahumlje and Herzegovina of the Serbian Orthodox Church.
The seat was temporarily transferred to Trebinje in the beginning of the 1992-1995 conflict.
Bishop Grigorije of Zahumlje and Herzegovina announced the return earlier this month.
This revival of the Eparchy seat, according to Grigorije, is "a landmark moment for the Serb Orthodox Church".
He urged all resettled Serbs to return to the town and reconstruct their homes.
Until two decades ago, the Neretva River Valley area was home to both Serbs and Bosniaks. The 1991 census recorded about 24,000 Serbs living there.
Today, there are around 5,000.
"There are over 100 recorded applications for house reconstruction, and only about ten per year receive the necessary funding.
There is often a problem with allocation of funds and with prioritising.
There are many of those who are dissatisfied, but even those who have already returned are having a hard time getting steady jobs," said Zitomislic Monastery prior Danilo Pavlovic.
Still, Serbs see the increased presence of the Orthodox Church as an encouraging sign.
"When I arrived in Mostar, I was slightly shocked at the delightfulness of this diversity, where church bells resound and ezan (the Muslim prayer) can be heard from minarets," said Grigorije, who became head of the Eparchy of Zahumlje and Herzegovina in 1999.
Mostar Mayor Ljubo Beslic said the bishop's transfer back is important not only for the church, but for the peaceful co-existence of Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks in the multicultural city.
Before the seat could return, however, major preparations were required.
They "began with the reconstruction of the Zitomislic Monastery and with the return of the Orthodox priests to the Neretva Valley.
First and foremost, this return means the establishment of a broken continuity," Grigorije said.
In addition, the Orthodox Congregational Church of Holy Trinity began undergoing reconstruction in March 2010.
The church was destroyed in the conflict.
The effort is being financed by the eparchy itself and by the Serb Orthodox Church.
The original Congregational Church of Holy Trinity was built in 1862-1873.
The funds for its construction were donated by Serbs in Mostar and the neighbouring areas.
Since the 19th century, Mostar has hosted the seat of the Orthodox metropolitans of Herzegovina, and its episcopes have had seats in the major centers or cities.
Krasniqi: Kosovo ready to co-operate on organ trafficking probe
Kosovo's acting president vows to work with EULEX to get to the bottom of allegations linking top leaders to criminal activity.

Kosovo's interim head of state, Jakup Krasniqi, says his country is ready to work with EULEX in launching an investigation into claims that organs were taken from prisoners held in Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) detention camps.
The allegations, contained in a report by Council of Europe (CoE) rapporteur Dick Marty, were the subject of a resolution adopted on Tuesday (January 25th) by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE).
"We are interested in shedding light on this issue in order to know the truth, or in order that this unjust burden that has been loaded on Kosovo, and especially on the KLA, be once and forever taken off the agenda," Krasniqi said.
Marty's report, released in December, dropped a political bombshell in the region by alleging that current Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci -- a former KLA commander -- may have headed a mafia-like network that smuggled weapons, drugs and human organs during and after the Kosovo conflict.
On Tuesday, by a vote of 169-8 with 14 abstentions, PACE endorsed Marty's findings.
It said there were "numerous indications" that organs were removed from some prisoners at a clinic located on Albanian territory in order to be trafficked abroad, and that Serb and Albanian prisoners received inhuman and degrading treatment at secret detention camps before ultimately disappearing.
The resolution urged that EULEX be given a clear mandate, the resources and high-level political support it needed to carry out its "extraordinarily complex and important role" in investigating the charges.
"In the interests of persons implicated and countries concerned, the allegations should be thoroughly investigated and the truth must be revealed," Darja Lavtizar-Bebler of Slovenia said.
She also warned against politicising the issue and said it should not be allowed to derail dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina.
"Our focus should be the victims, in Kosovo and the Western Balkans.
We can't expect reconciliation without justice," Holger Heibach of Germany said.
Some PACE deputies opposed or expressed concerns about the draft resolution.
Turkey's Ozlem Turkone said it "has been written in the manner of a prosecutorial indictment".
"The introductory paragraphs of the resolution include personal accusations that are stated as though they were final judgments," he said.
France's Jean-Claude Frécon, meanwhile, warned that "if these conclusions were adopted and subsequently found to be without substance, it would seriously weaken the credibility of the Parliamentary Assembly."
Albanian representative Ilir Rusmaili also urged caution.
"Whatever the allegations are, they should not be used to draw hasty or ill-founded conclusions.
They should not give way to collective condemnation of specific groups or political forces, or even of nations," he said.
Thaci and other Kosovo leaders have rejected the allegations contained in the Marty report, describing them as "slander" and "racist".
On Tuesday, hundreds of Albanians staged a protest outside the PACE building in Strasbourg.

Croatians seek to offset Slovenian highway tolls
Drivers using Slovenian highways, many of them heading for the Croatian coast, now have to shell out a minimum of 35 euros for the privilege.
Therefore, the Croatian tourism minister is advising travellers to take secondary roads.

Since July 1st, soaring gasoline prices are not the main issue for motorists on Slovenian highways.
Ljubljana implemented a new toll system that does not depend on distance driven.
Instead, drivers of any nationality passing through Slovenia now have two options -- buying a 35-euro permit for six months of driving or a 55-euro one for one year. Those without a valid permit will have to pay fines between 300 and 800 euros.
While Slovenians who regularly drive their own highways find the permit system cheaper than the previous distance-based model, foreign motorists are furious.
For example, a couple planning a brief holiday on the Croatian coast will now pay at least 35 euros to use the Slovenian freeway.
Some might reconsider whether to drive to Croatia after all or will find themselves forced to economise once they reach their destination.
Another sore point for these motorists is that many Slovenian freeways are under construction -- road crews are currently repairing more than a fifth of the nation's 500km of freeways.
Recently, the Croatian ministry of tourism and Croatian Auto Club (HAK) held a joint press conference on the "Introduction of Six-Month Tolls in the Republic of Slovenia and the Presentation of Alternative Roads".
Both Minister of Tourism Damir Bajs and HAK President Ivo Bikic emphasised the alternative roads leave much to be desired in terms of comfort and safety but will save motorists considerable money.
They believe the current toll system to be an unfair burden on foreign motorists -- especially tourists -- passing through Slovenia.
Out of 75 million tourists who entered Croatia last year, 95% came by car.
Of these, 32 million drove through Slovenia.
But Croatia is not the only country to complain.
Auto clubs from Italy, Austria and Germany are asking Slovenia to introduce cheaper permits for one week and one month rather than retain the Swiss model.
The Slovenian ministry of roads says the shorter-term permits do not generate enough revenue.
Austria tried to implement the same model years ago but gave in after the European Commission demanded ten-day and two-month permits.
Those currently cost 7.70 and 22.20 euros, respectively.
Since the EU has not yet pressured Slovenia to make similar modifications, European tourists will continue to pay 35 euros for using as little as 22km of Slovenian highways.
The permits are only a temporary method of collecting highway revenue; Slovenia will implement transponders in the next two years.
Macedonian athletes head to Beijing
Macedonia sent a delegation of seven athletes to Beijing last week for the upcoming Games.
The country has high hopes for its representatives in swimming, handball and kayaking, among other disciplines.

Macedonia's delegation left for the Games in Beijing last week.
Wrestler Murat Ramazanov, archer Sasho Nestorovski and kayaker Atanas Nikolovski are among the seven athletes representing the country, which will participate in its fifth Olympics since gaining independence in 1991.
The athletes left on July 28th, accompanied by Macedonian Olympic Committee President Vasil Tupurkovski, Secretary-General Sashe Popovski and Director Nase Nasev.
The group will have time to become familiar with the "lay of the land" in Beijing before the games open on Friday (August 8th).
"The team that will represent Macedonia at these Olympic Games consists of young sportsmen.
I hope that all of them will achieve results which will satisfy mainly their expectations.
They are young, promising athletes, and I expect good results from them in the future," Tupurkovski said as the team left.
"This [is the] first Olympic Games for me; every good result will be a bonus for the next Olympic Games," swimmer Elena Popovska said.
Swimmer Monika Spasovska and handball player Darko Georgievski will participate in the camp for young sportsmen in Beijing from August 6th through the 17th.
They will work with disabled youths from China, aged 16 to 18, to give them "a firsthand experience of the Olympic ideals of peace, enterprise, teamwork, sportsmanship, fair play and participation".
Nikolovski, who qualified for the Games at the European Championship in Krakow, Poland, will carry the country's flag in the opening ceremony.
"I am honoured that I have been chosen to carry the Macedonian flag," he said.
The flag, however, has caused some confusion in Beijing.
Kayaker Saso Popovski hung some Macedonian flags from his balcony at the Olympic Village, but Chinese officials, who confused them with the banned Tibetan flag, asked him to remove them.
"Security asked me to take the flags down; however, I refused and told them they were Macedonian flags," Popovski told local media. "The International Olympic Committee got involved and explained to the Chinese that the flags are not Tibetan flags.
The security people were very embarrassed and apologised a dozen times."
"It is a great pleasure to associate with sportsmen who will represent Macedonia at the Summer Olympic Games in Beijing, and I wish them great success.
My country is prepared for the upcoming sports event that will unite the world," Chinese Ambassador to Macedonia Dong Fu Feng said.
Macedonian athletes won no medals in the 2004 Athens Games, but the country's Olympic committee is offering monetary incentives for the team in Beijing.
A gold medal will net the winner 50,000 euros; a silver, 30,000 euros. A bronze medalist will receive 20,000 euros.
Albanian tourism on the rise
A large number of tourists arrived on Albania's shores this year.
Unexplored beaches and good food are the main attractions.

In recent years, an increasing number of foreign tourists are visiting Albania.
The country has become a regional tourist destination after shaking off its prolonged communist-era isolation, during which it fell into obscurity.
Among the populated beaches of Durres and Vlora, Albania offers unexplored stretches on the north and south coasts of the Adriatic and Ionian seas, which are attracting more interest among foreign tourists.
Statistics from June record a 20% increase of tourist visits to Albania from the same period last year.
Expectations ran high for June and July, which marked the peak of the summer season.
"More tourists are arriving in Albania this year, and their number has been steadily increasing in the past few years," Minister for Tourism Ylli Pango said at a press conference.
Visitors from Kosovo comprise the bulk of the tourists.
Their number has increased by 43% this year, according to official sources.
There are also 42% more tourists from Macedonia than there were at the same time last year.
Up to 90% of Albanian tourists are Europeans, of whom 70% enter the country by road, presenting a major challenge.
The quality of roads and of services remains the core developmental problem.
"Increasing the accommodation capacity and raising the quality of service remain the main challenges for Albanian tourism," said Pango.
Albanian entrepreneurs are aware that their infrastructure remains one of their biggest problems.
"The secondary roads to the beaches remain very problematic, even though the cost to build or rehabilitate them is irrelevant," said Sadik Malaj, the head of the Albanian Union of Tour Operators.
Nonetheless, the government is promoting the industry and announced plans for upcoming resorts.
Entrepreneurs from Dubai and Qatar expressed interest in financing a substantial development on the Bay of Lalzi, said Pango.
In addition, the French chain Club Med plans to build about 350 luxury villas overlooking the Bay of Kakome, thus investing 75m euros.
One of the strongest points of the Albanian tourist industry is the local cuisine, a tempting blend of Greek and Turkish influences.
According to the Bank of Albania, the tourism industry attracted in 170m euros in revenue in 2007, making it a major engine of national economic growth.
Bulgaria, EU Finalise Accession Talks
Bulgaria has formally concluded its accession talks with the EU and is on track to join the 25-nation club on 1 January 2007.
But its entry could be delayed by one year if it fails to keep its reform pledges.
(Reuters, Dow Jones, BBC, AFX, Eupolitix, EurActiv, BNN, Novinite, Standartnews - 15/06/04)
"This is a very positive achievement.
It sends out a clear signal that momentum is being maintained in the accession process," Irish Foreign Minister Brian Cowen said of the negotiations closure. [AFP]
Bulgaria concluded its accession negotiations with the EU on Tuesday (15 June), a day after the technical closure of talks on two final negotiating chapters.
The deal brings the Balkan country a step closer to its 1 January 2007 entry target.
However, if Bulgaria fails to make good on its reform pledges, its formal admission into the 25-nation bloc could be delayed by one year.
Accession negotiations between Bulgaria and the Union started in February 2000.
They were completed six months ahead of schedule, during Ireland's rotating EU presidency, which ends on 30 June.
Following a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg, Irish Foreign Minister Brian Cowen hailed what he described as a "very positive achievement".
"It sends out a clear signal that momentum is being maintained in the accession process," he said. "This is a major success for Bulgaria."
Bulgarian officials welcomed the milestone.
"Our membership in the EU has turned from a distant dream into a close reality," said Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg.
However, both Saxe-Coburg and Foreign Minister Solomon Passy have stressed that the completion of negotiations is not the final phase in the accession process.
Discussions with Brussels would continue and the implementation of needed reforms would continue, they said.
The deal reached in Luxembourg includes a "safeguard clause" allowing the EU to postpone Bulgaria's accession by one year if it sees a "serious risk" of the country being unable to implement the required reforms and standards.
"The safeguard clause is in our interest," Passy said Tuesday, adding that it would serve as a guarantee that the reforms will be put into effect.
"We are working and we are moving with the right speed in the right direction and everybody is welcome to monitor our progress."
Bulgaria is expected to step up its fight against organised crime and corruption, implement judiciary and public administration reforms, and carry out all other commitments made during the talks, including the early closure of two Soviet-era reactors at the Kozloduy nuclear power plant in 2006.
Under its agreements with the EU, the country will receive 240m euros, in addition to the already announced funding of 4.4 billion euros under the Union's 2007-2009 budget.
Prior to the signing of the membership treaty, expected to take place in June 2005, the European Commission will issue its regular report on Bulgaria's accession progress, to be released in October this year.
Based on the findings and recommendations in the report, the EU leaders will decide whether to approve the country's admission during their summit in December.
US official calls for stronger, and more efficient BiH government
During a visit to Sarajevo on Tuesday, US Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns called for the unification of Bosnia and Herzegovina's presidency and other government institutions, saying it was time to modernise the Dayton Peace Accords.

US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns called Wednesday (12 October) for constitutional reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) to create a stronger and more efficient state.
The changes should include unifying the country's presidency and other government institutions, Burns said.
BiH's constitution is part of the General Framework Agreement for Peace, signed in Dayton, Ohio, on 21 November 1995.
The accord, which ended a brutal interethnic conflict that lasted for more than three years, established BiH as a federal state consisting of two entities -- a Muslim-Croat federation, or the Federation of BiH (FBiH), and a Bosnian Serb republic, the Republika Srpska (RS).
In addition to a state-level government and parliament, each of the entities also has its own government and parliament.
The country has a three-man presidency, each member represents one of the main ethnic groups living in BiH -- Bosnian Muslims, Croats and Serbs.
Welcoming the significant progress achieved in BiH over the last ten years, Burns said it was time for the country to move forward and modernise the Dayton Peace Agreement (DPA), in accordance with its spirit.
He also praised a recent move towards the establishment of a state-level police force in the country over the next five years, noting that the next logical step would be to amend the constitution.
"The Dayton accords were meant to end the war, but it should not be set in stone or concrete," Burns said Wednesday in Sarajevo, the first stop of his three-day tour of the Balkans. "We do believe that the logical objective would be a single presidency, a strong prime minister and parliament."
Burns held talks Wednesday with a number of the country's leadership, including BiH Presidency members Sulejman Tihic and Borislav Paravac, BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic and Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic, RS President Dragan Cavic, Milorad Dodik, the leader of the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats and High Representative Paddy Ashdown.
Burns invited the BiH presidency members to visit Washington on 21 November to participate in a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of the DPA, while stressing that the leadership is expected to show a clear vision for change by then.
The US diplomat also warned that BiH, Serbia-Montenegro and Croatia could not expect to build closer ties with NATO as long as the UN war crimes tribunal's most wanted indictees -- former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, his military chief Ratko Mladic and retired Croat General Ante Gotovina -- remain at large.
Burns said he was encouraged by the statements made Wednesday by BiH officials that Karadzic and Mladic must face justice at The Hague.
"I hope that in five weeks, in Washington, leaders of all BiH political parties, as well as of the three-member presidency, that they will … demand Karadzic and Mladic to surrender," local media quoted the US diplomat as saying. "That would be a step forward."
New SP leader Rama seeks to renew, democratise party
The popular mayor of Tirana, Edi Rama, is the new leader of Albania's Socialist Party.
He has promised a sweeping overhaul of the party, which was defeated in the July elections, after eight years in power.

The newly-elected leader of the opposition Socialist Party (SP), Edi Rama, has embarked on a programme to restructure the party in the wake of its loss in the July parliamentary elections. At a meeting Wednesday (12 October), Rama urged local party branches to play a larger role in a number of areas, including the selection of a new leadership.
The proposal came a day after the entire SP chairmanship resigned, enabling Rama to inaugurate a sweeping overhaul of the party, dogged by frequent infighting and charges that it has fallen out of touch with voters.
Rama, the mayor of Tirana, won the top party post on Sunday during an extraordinary congress called after the resignation of former Prime Minister and SP head Fatos Nano, who took responsibility for the SP's defeat at the polls after eight years in power.
In voting at the conference, Rama easily beat a rival candidate, former Albanian President Rexhep Meidani to clinch the leadership position.
Out of 449 votes, 297 were in favour of Rama and 151 for Meidani.
The new leader told delegates that he would do his best to keep the party united, respecting "opposite opinions".
"Taking this post, I will give the possibility to see closely that I respect all the collaborators; I am very careful towards the others who do not think as I do," Rama said.
Among other reforms, Rama has proposed introducing the "one-member, one-vote" concept as the basis for electing the leadership.
According to analysts, Rama faces multiple challenges.
He must rebuild the party as a potent opposition force, keeping it in the forefront of left-wing parties, while at the same time building alliances and co-operation with other political forces.
Born in 1964, Rama is an artist as well as a politician.
As mayor of Tirana, he gained international notoriety for his ambitious programme to beautify the capital's public spaces.
He was elected World Mayor 2004 in an Internet poll.

Serbia-Montenegro tops World Bank list of business reformers
A new report from the World Bank ranks Serbia-Montenegro first among countries that have made the most effort to improve their business climate.
While crediting the government with pursuing reforms, Bank experts caution that the pace must be maintained.

Serbia-Montenegro tops the list of countries that have done the most to enact reforms meant to improve the climate for business, a recent report from the World Bank concludes. The report, "Doing Business in 2004: Creating Jobs", provides the first global ranking of 155 nations in terms of key business regulations and reforms.
It finds that the former communist nations of Eastern Europe, including Southeast European countries, have aggressively sought entrepreneurs and investors by enacting major reforms designed to cut red tape and reduce taxes.
Meanwhile, Serbia-Montenegro ranked first among the top 12 reformers worldwide, ahead of Georgia, Vietnam, Slovakia, Germany, Egypt, Finland, Romania, Latvia, Pakistan, Rwanda and the Netherlands.
"There are other countries, Slovakia, Poland, Ukraine, which made greater progress than Serbia-Montenegro in particular areas, but overall, when all areas are considered together, Serbia-Montenegro has made the greatest progress in reforms," said Vesna Kostic, the World Bank's spokesperson in the country.
According to the 188-page study, Serbia-Montenegro improved in eight of the ten areas examined in the report.
It has simplified the procedures for starting a business, obtaining a license, hiring and firing, registering property, paying taxes, closing a business and entering bankruptcy.
In two areas -- investor protection and foreign trade -- progress was not registered.
The capital required for starting a business was reduced from 5,000 euros to 500 euros, while the time needed for registering a company has been reduced from 51 days to 15 days.
Carolina Jungr, director of World Bank's Belgrade office, has welcomed the progress, while striking a cautionary note.
It is important, she says, that the momentum be sustained.
"A lot of good things have happened and some credit is due to the government," the AP quoted her as saying. "There has been tremendous progress, just as long as you don't put up your feet and say you are done." Serbia-Montenegro embarked on its reforms relatively late compared to other countries in the region, Jungr notes, and must still work hard to catch up.
In particular, World Bank experts want to see court cases accelerated, land property rules simplified, and foreign trade made easier.
Serbian Minister of Economy Predrag Bubalo welcomed the report, but says it will be awhile yet before the reforms translate into better quality of life for Serbian citizens.
"What has changed is that there will be more jobs, we will have to work more and only after a long period of time citizens will feel, both financially and in other ways, these improvements," he said.
Foreign investors are pleased with the pace of reforms and insist that there should be now slowing down.
"There are things that are not functioning the way they should, but we did not expect everything to be perfect in two years, anyway.
We have a plan and I am satisfied because I see progress," said Nis Tobacco Factory Director Eugenio Sidoli.
Kostunica to be questioned about Djindjic assassination
BELGRADE, Serbia -- Former Prime Minister and Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) leader Vojislav Kostunica on Saturday (March 12th) criticised plans to question him about the political situation at the time one of his predecessors, Zoran Djindjic, was assassinated.
Local media reports suggest he will be questioned to determine whether Djindjic's 2003 assassination amounted to political persecution. "I have nothing to do with the political background to Zoran Djindjic's killing and neither does the DSS," said Kostunica, who was prime minister from 2003 to 2008.
He says the prosecution is being "misused" to launch a political campaign against the DSS. (Tanjug, Nezavisne Novine, Radio Free Europe, RTS - 12/03/11; B92 - 11/03/11)
UNMIK Chief Discusses Regional Issues With Mitrovica Leaders
Michael Steiner held talks with local government leaders and met with residents of Mitrovica during his visit Saturday to the ethnically divided town.
(UN, Tanjug - 01/02/03; UN, KFOR - 31/01/03; UN - 20/01/03)
UNMIK head Michael Steiner visited Mitrovica on Saturday (1 February) to discuss the situation in the region with local government leaders, including Municipal Assembly President Faruk Spahija and Deputy President Mursan Ibrahimi.
UNMIK assumed authority in the northern section of the ethnically divided town about two months ago and opened its office there, establishing full control over an area that has seen violent clashes in the past.
"We have brought the northern part of Mitrovica out of the grey zone.
And I will stick to my promise that there will be no partition," Steiner said in a recent televised address to the people of Kosovo.
The situation in Mitrovica is now calm, including in the so-called confidence zone around the main bridge over the Ibar, linking the two sections of the town.
Since mid-December, 20 newly graduated Serb officers have been conducting regular policing out of the Mitrovica North police station.
Steiner's visit was part of his ongoing efforts to promote stability and development in the region.
While in Mitrovica he took the local officials to the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA), which has recently opened an office in the north, accessible to people from all over the province.
The UN chief considers the KTA a key institution for Kosovo's economic future, as it is tasked with managing the privatisation of publicly-owned enterprises.
A number of quick impact projects that have received donor funding are expected to improve life in Mitrovica.
For example, a recent UNMIK publication noted that the issuance of license plates in the northern section will help overcome the appearance of lawlessness created by unregistered vehicles driving around this part of town.
The opening of a planned bus line linking the two sections is also expected to improve freedom of movement in this area.
To further facilitate freedom of movement for both civilians and the military, KFOR - which works in co-operation with UNMIK - started building a by-pass around the south of Mitrovica in November 2002.
A French engineering batallion is implementing the project, which includes construction of 300m of road, a 40m-long bridge and the amelioration of an existing 1.5km-long road.
Before returning to Pristina, Steiner talked for an hour with Mitrovica residents about issues affecting their daily life.
One of the main problems Kosovo faces is the high level of unemployment.
A recent Rinvest Economic Institute survey placed overall unemployment in Kosovo at 49 per cent.
The survey found that joblessness among the province's youth stood at an alarming 72 per cent, while Kosovo's Statistics Office and the Labour Ministry say the youth unemployment rate is about 57 per cent.
A recent announcement of job positions within the UNMIK Administration in Mitrovica received an enthusiastic response, attracting more than 500 applications.

"School of Life" teaches skills, independence to disabled in Serbia
Natasa Bojanic, 26, was born with Down's Syndrome.
Through her family's efforts and the work of a Serbian NGO, she has been able to find her niche.
By Bojana Milovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 02/03/09 Photos by Nikola Barbutov
Natasa Bojanic was born with Down's Syndrome, but because of her family's efforts, this has not meant social isolation.
Natasa Bojanic is 26 years old and has a full life -- family, friends, a job she loves.
She's a bit shy, but confident enough to deal with the challenges life has brought her.
Natasa was born with Down's Syndrome.
But thanks to her family's efforts, this has not meant social isolation.
Six years ago, Natasa's mother heard about the Child's Heart charitable organisation, and from then her daughter's life changed completely.
Natasa started meeting new friends, attending daily workshops, and going to movies, theatres and concerts.
She became involved with a programme launched by the organisation dubbed "The School of Life".
Its aim is to help young people with developmental disabilities learn the everyday skills -- such as preparing meals and completing house chores -- that will enable them to function more independently.
"We do everything as if we were living on our own, without mom to do something for us.
We arrange our obligations around the house among ourselves," Natasa explains.
As one of the programme's most successful participants, Natasa was given the chance to become an employee of Child's Heart.
She now comes to work alone every day, riding public transportation.
Ever since she got the job, she has taken on many assignments, from sending faxes to helping develop projects.
Even that, she says, eventually became "boring".
Now, as she proudly points out, she is "head of the beverage section", a job which entails making sure that all guests and employees are served their favourite drink, be it coffee, tea or juice.
She shows us her kitchen, with a reminder of her daily duties posted on the wall and recipes for the preparation of various kinds of coffee posted beside it "just in case".
"For the parents of a mentally challenged person, the biggest fear is: 'what will my child do when I die, who will take care of him?' That is why we try to teach these young people practical things through the School of Life," Child's Heart representative Tanja Staljonic (right, with Natasa) says.
"The kitchen always has to be clean, and I take care of that," Natasa says.
Outside work, she keeps busy.
When she is not socialising with her friends, she likes to watch TV and play video games.
"My mom doesn't let me watch too much TV or sit in front of the computer for long," she complains.
She has a knack for art and also writes poetry, although when we asked her to read some of her work, her shyness prevailed.
Tanja Staljonic, a representative of Child's Heart, provided more details about the programme.
She said its objective is to enable people with mental disabilities to acquire as many practical skills as possible, leading to more independence.
"For the parents of a mentally challenged person, the biggest fear is: 'what will my child do when I die, who will take care of him?' That is why we try to teach these young people practical things through the School of Life, where we carry out camps lasting for several days.
Everyone knows their obligations and daily tasks.
We act as though they are on their own and react, if necessary, only in crisis situations," Staljonic says.
She adds that around 5,000 children have taken part in Child's Heart projects over the past eight years.
"Good co-operation with parents is imperative," Staljonic adds.
"Many of them cannot get the right information on how to exercise some of their rights.
They are confused and do not know who to address.
That is why Child's Heart is also a sort of information centre with all the necessary instructions."
Natasa has taken on many assignments at work, from sending faxes to helping develop projects.
Over the last few years in Serbia, there has been frequent discussion of the employment prospects for disabled individuals.
As Staljonic notes, however, finding a job is easier for people with physical disabilities than for those with developmental impairments.
"Employers would not have enough patience and would not want to take responsibility for a mentally challenged person.
It is different with people whose mental functions are fully intact.
They just need barriers to be lifted and their work space made accessible, and that is where an employer's concern ends," Staljonic says.
She goes on to say that inclusion in the regular school system should also be carried out in line with the capabilities of disabled individuals.
"Wheelchair-bound children or, for example, those with impaired hearing are able to attend regular classes and they should be enabled to do so.
Mentally challenged people cannot handle such programs, biology and physics mean nothing to them and they need practical skills.
"Still, even though they are not in the same classes, those children should at least be in the same school buildings, so as to develop mutual tolerance and awareness of differences," she adds.
Estimates say that some 250,000 mentally disabled people live in Serbia, but those data are not exact.
In rural areas especially, families often hide family members who have such disabilities.
They may not even receive a proper medical diagnosis, and are not included in the education or social protection systems.
Erdogan's convoy attacked; police escort killed
ANKARA, Turkey -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's convoy was attacked in the northern city of Kastamonu late Wednesday (May 4th), leaving one police officer dead and another injured.
Erdogan himself was not in the convoy, but some of his closest aides were.
The attackers, who managed to escape after opening fire on police, threw explosives at the bus carrying party activists to a meeting ahead of the June 12th elections.
Erdogan had left Kastamonu in a helicopter shortly before the incident to head for another rally in Amasya.
In a speech to supporters of his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) there, he expressed sorrow over the attack, blaming it on separatist groups.
Separately Wednesday, six police officers were injured in an attack during the funeral of four members of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in Diyarbakir.
Those attending the funeral attacked the city prison, trying to access the prison compound. (NTV, Hurriyet, CNN Turk - 04/05/11)
Srebrenica Recovery Project Helping Returnees Start Businesses
About 2,000 people in the Srebrenica region in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina are benefiting from the UNDP's Srebrenica Regional Recovery Programme.

Wires for light fixtures are still dangling from the wood-panelled ceiling in Husein Huseinovic's new, but empty, chicken shed near Srebrenica.
But Huseinovic says he should be ready to raise birds here by the time warm weather arrives.
This is the type of small business that a UNDP project is helping to develop here.
The UNDP Srebrenica Regional Recovery Programme aids those who want to return to one of the country's most economically depressed regions.
Srebrenica, in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), is the site of the July 1995 massacre, Europe's worst since World War II.
Due to political obstruction by local authorities, it and much of eastern Republika Srpska remained under a funding embargo until 1999.
"Without UNDP I wouldn't have been able to do this project, that's for sure," said Huseinovic, who returned to his home a year ago. "UNDP was one-fifth of it, but without that one-fifth, you can't even begin to finish."
Huseinovic is one of 166 people who received business grants through the three-year, 10.4m-euro project, which was launched in 2002.
It has so far benefited about 2,000 people, according to programme manager Alex Prieto.
The focus in Srebrenica now is not on rebuilding the factories that operated before the war, but rather on creating small businesses that can thrive in the rural and mountainous region.
The project is also working to strengthen civil society and local government and to rebuild roads, electricity networks and water works.
Though refugee returns -- as of October 2003 about 3,200 Muslims had returned to the three municipalities -- represent but a trickle of the pre-war Muslim population, UNDP reckons that the figures will only increase.
The number of returns in the past 12 months is about the same as the total number of returns in the previous six years.
Few observers expect a flood of returnees to the area after the events of 1995.
Nor is anyone saying that the project, however successful it may be, will make up for what happened here.
UNDP officials said the project highlights their commitment to the region in the aftermath of the tragedy.
"That was the major, fundamental, cardinal reason why UNDP decided to go ahead with the project," said UNDP Deputy Resident Representative Moises Venancio. "We certainly felt that given the suffering here, that we had to be committed to it, to help those people who live here and those who want to come back."
Plans for 2004 include extending a micro-crediting line for female run businesses, promoting cattle raising and fruit growing through agricultural grants, completing 17 civil society projects and improving infrastructure.
Huseinovic said the programme is effective because it is not about giving financial injections that help only in the short term.
"People have gotten used to social aid, they work a little bit and always expect some kind of aid," he said.
"But that's not the way that I work. [The UNDP grant is a] bigger investment, so I can employ someone and so that my family can work."
Del Ponte Demands Handover of Top War Crimes Suspects by Year's End
The war crimes tribunal at The Hague will not close its doors before Bosnian Serb wartime leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic and Croatia's Ante Gotovina are tried, vows UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte.
(Reuters, AP, AFP, BBC, HINA - 12/09/03)
Embarking on her 2nd four-year term as chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), Carla del Ponte has said the surrender of all remaining fugitives is one of her top priorities.
The court would not close its doors before Bosnian Serb wartime leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic and Croatian General Ante Gotovina are tried, said del Ponte, setting the end of 2003 as a deadline for their handover.
The three are the most wanted among 17 war crimes indictees still at large.
"The government of Croatia should immediately transfer Ante Gotovina to The Hague and Serbia and Montenegro should do the same with Ratko Mladic.
The Bosnian Serbs should extend all co-operation to apprehend Karadzic," del Ponte said during a press conference on Friday (12 September).
Under a strategy recently endorsed by the UN Security Council, the ICTY is to complete all investigations by the end of 2004 and finalise all trials, excluding appeals, by the end of 2008.
That timeline would allow it to wrap up all activities in 2010.
But the completion strategy could be jeopardised should efforts to capture the most wanted suspects fail, del Ponte warned.
Mladic and Karadzic face genocide charges for their alleged involvement in major atrocities during the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), including the Srebrenica massacre.
Insisting that Mladic is in Serbia, del Ponte urged authorities there to arrest him immediately.
Karadzic is believed to be hiding in BiH's Serb-run entity, Republika Srpska.
Gotovina, who has been on the run since 2001, has been indicted for atrocities against Serb civilians during a Croat Army offensive in 1995.
Del Ponte said the Croat authorities were aware of his whereabouts.
"Both my office and the government of Croatia know the whereabouts of General Ante Gotovina," del Ponte said.
She also said that she would continue seeking the international community's assistance in bringing the tribunal's most wanted suspects to justice, adding that failure to apprehend and try them is not an option.
"I will not consider this option.
Karadzic, Mladic and Gotovina will be arrested and transferred by the end of the year.
The tribunal will not close its doors without Karadzic, Mladic and Gotovina on trial," del Ponte said.
Reacting to those remarks, Croatian Prime Minister Ivica Racan said Friday that his government "has had no contact with General Gotovina".
He said that the fugitive would be arrested "if Croatian services knew that he is in Croatia and where he is".
He urged the retired general to turn himself in, saying his surrender to the tribunal would be good both for him and his country.
In a separate statement, Croatian President Stipe Mesic also called on Gotovina to surrender to defend his and Croatia's honour in The Hague.
Defence Reform in BiH Enters New Phase
As a part of the defence reform process, taking place under the auspices of the international community, the Defence Reform Commission has presented its report as a draft state defence law.
It would make Bosnia and Herzegovina a credible candidate for NATO's Partnership for Peace programme.
By Antonio Prlenda for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 20/10/03
The process of reforming Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) defence structures entered a crucial phase at the end of September with the presentation of the Defence Reform Commission's (DRC) report as a draft state law that would be sent to parliament for approval.
Established by High Representative Paddy Ashdown and headed by US military expert James R Locher III, the DRC finished its 100-day mission with concrete legal and practical steps for reorganising the country's defence during 2004.
Reforming the system is a key prerequisite for full membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme.
According to the DRC recommendations, the two BiH entities -- the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) and the Republika Srpska (RS) -- would still maintain separate entity armies and defence ministries.
However, they would come under a joint staff, operational command and state-level defence ministry.
The supreme command of the BiH armed forces would be the BiH joint presidency, which would make decisions with a consensus.
Entity ministries of defence would retain only an administrative chain of command for recruiting and logistical purposes, while an operational chain of command would be established through the joint staff and the subordinated operational command.
The state-level defence minister would be fully responsible for co-ordinating the military budget.
The commander of the operational command, the chairman of the joint staff and the state defence minister would be appointed from the country's three constitutive ethnic groups -- Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats.
The system is designed to prevent misuse of the armed forces against any of the three ethnic groups.
"These decisions on defence reform are historic," said Ashdown. "The way to NATO through the PfP is open now.
But the decisions have yet to be approved by the state parliament of BiH."
Today, the RS Army has 6,600 soldiers in active service, while 9,200 Bosniaks and 4,000 Croats serve in the FBiH Army.
According to the DRC recommendations, the number of soldiers would be reduced to a total of 12,000, in order to make the armed forces financially viable and to save 1 per cent of state GDP.
Soldiers from both entities would serve in the same uniforms with the BiH state flag and insignia.
The DRC was made up of seven local representatives from the two entities' ministries of defence and the BiH Standing Committee on Military Matters, as well as one representative each from NATO, SFOR, the Office of the High Representative and the OSCE mission in BiH.
Representatives from the EU, the United States, Russia and Turkey were also present as observers.
The state parliament must make its final decision before the end of the year.
Kosovo-Serbia dialogue still stalled, as larger issues loom
It’s been well over two months since negotiators from Serbia and Kosovo sat across the bargaining table to discuss technical issues.
Larger issues, including highly charged matters such as missing persons, remain unaddressed.

Bajram Cerkini of Mitrovica lost his 19-year-old son in 1999 and 13 years later still has no information about what happened to him.
He is bitter that by participating in on-again, off-again EU mediated talks with Kosovo, Serbia may edge closer to EU accession without addressing issues such as war reparations and missing persons.
"Brussels is not serious about it.
If it was, this issue could have been put as a precondition for any further advancement of Serbia towards the EU.
All signs until now are that Brussels has not taken this issue seriously until now because it also means that some people have to face justice, go in front of court," Cerkini tells SETimes.
These larger issues are still not the substance of ongoing talks between Kosovo and Serbia.
The dialogue, which began in March 2011, inches forward instead focusing on technical issues, although there have been some important breakthroughs.
Compromise solutions, for instance, were found regarding the integrated border management.
But other technical issues such as energy, telecommunications and Kosovo's regional representation are still far from settled, and the date for resuming talks remains elusive.
The last session was on December 2nd.
"I cannot confirm the date of the next round ... at this point. We are keen to see the dialogue continue, and both sides remain engaged," Maja Kocijancic, EU spokesperson tells SETimes.
Complicating the entire situation are two new moves by Kosovo opposition parties. The main one, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) called on February 7th for a formal interruption of the dialogue.
Its leader, Isa Mustafa, who is also the mayor of Pristina, told Kosovo Public Broadcaster RTK that while the international community must be assured that Kosovo is not against talks with Serbia, "it is absurd … to enter into dialogue with somebody that has entered the territory (of Kosovo) with criminal forces, forces of organised crime, has blocked a part of the country, and through that part creates fiscal evasion and violates the territorial sovereignty of the country, [while] we continue the dialogue and behave as if we don’t see anything. "

The other opposition party, Vetevendosje, tried a different tactic the following day, asking the Constitutional Court to rule whether the agreements struck so far, considered international agreements, require ratification by the parliament.
The party also staged two protests last month aimed at forcing the government to impose reciprocity with Serbia at the borders.
Edita Tahiri, head of the the Kosovo negotiating team, said war reparations and border demarcation should be addressed this year. The agenda, she adds, is based on what is considered a priority by all three sides: Kosovo, Serbia and the EU.
As for war reparations, "Serbia should undertake the obligations that derive from its responsibility for the war in Kosovo", she told SETimes.
Belgrade has a completely different view.
Borko Stefanovic, head of Serbia's negotiating team, tells SETimes "Reparation cannot be the paid to someone who lives in the same state.
That is the first thing."
Marko Milanovic, professor of international law at Britain's University of Nottingham, agrees, telling SETimes that it is very difficult for Kosovo to claim war reparation from Serbia, primarily because during the conflict in Kosovo, it was not an independent state.
"In other words, Serbia was, then, violating the rights of its own citizens, not the law of another state," says Milanovic.
Kosovo lawyer Adil Fetahu tells SETimes that Serbia should compensate for the billions in material and non-material damage it caused Kosovo, and that Pristina should continue to demand it.
"This is …a lot of work, which can be dragged on for years and decades," Fetahu concedes, adding "There is no chance to reach a deal between Kosovo and Serbia on the issues of war reparations and compensation ... international arbitrage should decide on that."
Fetahu believes that the demarcation of the border with Serbia is also a complicated political issue and "without any chance" of being solved "in the near future".
He notes however, the requirement that "no state can become an EU member without solving border contests with the neighbours. Each state has to reply to the EU questionnaire correctly and precisely on which is its border with each of the neighbouring states."
As for control of border crossings, Dusan Janjic, research fellow at the Institute of Social Sciences in Belgrade, assesses the agreement reached over the summer this way: "In the implementation of this agreement, we will have an absurd situation where things will look better on paper and between negotiators than in the field," he tells SETimes.
KFOR personnel have been playing a lead role at the troubled Brnjak crossing. [Reuters]
He describes a "dual" situation underway with the technical dialogue, which for Belgrade "takes place without political approval and support in the field". The international community and Kosovo authorities, he says, are trying to get "as much as possible from Belgrade, to be able to implement it in a more adequate moment".
Members of the public wonder when the big issues will be tackled.
Pristina resident Besnike Salihu tells SETimes "Agreements reached so far have been reached with difficulties.
There are problems in their implementation as well.
I don't think [border demarcation] will be on the agenda at all for this period of time."
Sasa Denic, a Kosovo Serb from Gjilan, in eastern Kosovo, does not even consider the issue of the war reparations. "One part of Kosovo should pay another part of Kosovo, or those who stayed have to pay those who left Kosovo?" he tells SETimes.
All seem to agree however that the issue of missing persons must be addressed soon.
The International Commission on Missing Persons says the remains of 2,370 missing persons have been located and identified.
Commission chief Kathryne Bomberger says there are approximately 1,800 people still reported missing from the Kosovo conflict and "a steady decline over the years in finding missing persons".
Belgrade’s Stefanovic says the sides have been unable to find a mechanism that will enable the more efficient locating of the missing. "And this is what we insist on," he says.
Gordana Djukanovic, from the Serb Association of Families of Persons Kidnapped and Killed in Kosovo, tells SETimes that there are 512 Serbs and non-Albanians in the missing persons list from Kosovo.
"We had, before negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina started, a meeting with Mr. Stefanovic when he told us that on the agenda of issues, it will be negotiated," Djukanovic tells SETimes, adding that they were surprised when the issue was not mentioned at all.
"I do hope that Belgrade authorities and the authorities in Pristina will agree to, truly and sincerely, start finding and exhuming the graves for which we have provided maps and live witnesses, and to finally, also, start with identifications in order that families find out the fate of their missing," she says.
Macedonia, Kosovo fight crime together
Macedonia is asking neighbouring Kosovo to co-operate in fighting crime and Kosovo's interior ministry has already taken the first steps.
Minister Bajram Rexhepi talks about it with SETimes.
By Linda Karadaku for Southeast European Times in Pristina – 26/05/10

Authorities in Kosovo received a list of people wanted by Macedonia earlier this month, after a shootout at the border resulted in four deaths.
According to Macedonian police, the three Macedonians and one Kosovar were smuggling weapons.
This is not a first border incident, and officials believe that a number of criminals with Macedonian citizenship are hiding in Kosovo.
Kosovo Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi visited Macedonia after the shootout, stressing that his country is dedicated to the rule of law and regional security.
Rexhepi talked about that trip and future co-operation with Macedonian authorities in this exclusive interview with SETimes.
SETimes: What were the steps that were agreed on, and how will they be carried out?
Bajram Rexhepi: We are strengthening the relations between the two countries in all fields -- especially on security issues.
We have already signed a memorandum on police co-operation with Macedonia; we expect to make it operational through ... technical protocols.
We have agreed to communicate between the two interior ministries and the subordinate agencies to have a joint and efficient fight against organised crime, weapons smuggling, drugs, human trafficking and illegal immigration.
SETimes: During your visit, Macedonian authorities reportedly gave you a list with the names of 70 Albanians in Kosovo and Macedonia, who are wanted criminals.
Does the interior ministry have information about the people on this list?
Rexhepi: We have received, through official channels, a list of the persons who are wanted and who are suspected to be in Kosovo.
Based on the initial verifications, the majority of those people are citizens of Macedonia.
The list has been forwarded to the police and the justice bodies.
The responsible mechanisms in the country will carry out verifications on each case and they will act according to the laws of Kosovo.
SETimes: There have been accusations that Kosovo is involved in the tensions in Macedonia.
How would you comment on those allegations?
Rexhepi: In the past, especially before the recognition of independence, Kosovo has been accused as an exporter of violence, weapons smuggling and as a sponsor of tensions.
This perception is changing now and Kosovo is perceived not only as a consumer, but also as a contributor to regional security.
Kosovo is dedicated to security and regional stability, as well as to the rule of law.
We are testifying to this dedication through the efficient fight against all kinds of crimes, which in our countries, has a regional context.
We are a credible partner, and we invite the others to follow this approach.
Thousands gather to celebrate Tito
Thirty years after his death, Yugoslav dictator Josip Broz Tito's birthday is still celebrated in Belgrade.
Every year, on May 25th, thousands of people visit his tomb, still faithful to his ideas.

Thousands flocked to Josip Broz Tito's resting place in Belgrade on Tuesday (May 25th) to mark the former Communist dictator's birthday.
Dubbed the architect of the "second Yugoslavia", Tito managed to both unite and separate huge masses of people.
Thousands gathered outside the House of Flowers -- where Tito is buried -- to rekindle memories.
Coinciding with Serbia's Youth Day, for years Tito's birthday was celebrated in the former Yugoslavia by having relay runners carry a baton for weeks, which was then given to the leader on the 25th.
This year, relay batons were carried to Belgrade from Serbia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Macedonia.
On Tuesday, admirers gave a baton to Tito's grandson, Joska Broz.
Although Tito is viewed as a dictator, he is remembered for the freedoms he allowed his people -- such as open travel -- that other Communist nations did not allow.
The difficult post-war times called for influential and determined leaders.
People needed comfort, security and hope.
Tito gave the people an idea they could keep fighting for -- the vision of a great republic of united peoples and ethnicities.
The breakup of the country and today's widespread poverty, has led many to believe the Tito era was better than the present.
Zana Stanica, 85, from Vrsac, came to honour "the great father of the peoples and ethnicities".
Forty-five years after the end of World War II, when the bloody disintegration of the former republics started, the idea of a great Yugoslavia which she had believed in nearly all her life became merely a memory.
"One never forgets that," she says.
Miodrag Milosevic walked 43km from his village of Umcare to visit the House of Flowers.
"I take it slowly, I'm in no hurry.
I started walking at 3pm yesterday, then stopped here and stopped there, and finally I came here," Milosevic told SETimes.
"We remember better times, we keep memories of them and nurture that tradition," Edi Kriz of the Tito's Republic Association from Rijeka, Croatia, told SETimes.
Del Ponte Urges EU to Press Croatia, Serbia-Montenegro for Full Co-operation With ICTY
Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte urged the EU on Thursday to keep talks with Croatia and Serbia-Montenegro on hold as long as key fugitives wanted by The Hague court remain at large.
Neither country is co-operating fully with the UN tribunal, she said.

The EU should not move to build closer ties with Croatia and Serbia-Montenegro until they hand over those indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte said Thursday (1 September).
"Full co-operation with the ICTY is one of the conditions set by the EU for the countries of the former Yugoslavia to join," del Ponte said at a conference on the Balkans in the Swiss capital, Bern. "Without the strong European support, the process of justice in the Balkans would be a sad failure.
Croatia and Serbia-Montenegro, in particular, have been co-operating with the tribunal only thanks to the international pressure," the prosecutor added.
Describing the two countries' current co-operation with the ICTY as "not perfect, nor full", del Ponte urged Brussels to pressure them to meet their international obligations and hand over war crimes indictees sought by the tribunal.
"As long as a country remains a candidate, the EU has the power to force reforms," del Ponte said. "As soon as it will be in the club, this power will get lost."
Croatia was due to begin accession talks with the EU in March, provided the authorities had handed over retired General Ante Gotovina to the ICTY by that time.
But as Zagreb failed to meet this sole condition for proving its full co-operation with the UN tribunal, the negotiations were put on hold.
Serbia-Montenegro, meanwhile, is scheduled to begin talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU on 5 October.
Both the EU and the United States have in recent months stepped up their pressure on Serbia-Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) to extradite former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic -- who is believed to be hiding in Serb-controlled parts of BiH or in Montenegro -- and his wartime general Ratko Mladic, who del Ponte insists is in Serbia.
"Impunity for them means a huge blow to the international community and to international justice," del Ponte said in Bern.
She rejected claims, made by Croatian Foreign Minister Kolinda Grabar Kitarovic at the European Parliament on Tuesday, that Zagreb has done all it could to find Gotovina.
"There has been no substantial qualitative change in the operations conducted by Croatia.
The indications that I have still show that Gotovina is in the region," del Ponte said.
Insisting that Croatia is implementing its action plan for co-operation with The Hague, Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader on Thursday cited the arrest of Hrvoje Petrac, a suspected Gotovina supporter, in Greece earlier this week.
In her comments, del Ponte also noted Petrac's arrest, describing it as a positive development, a good example of international co-operation among intelligence and law enforcement agencies, and an opportunity to finally infiltrate the network that is protecting Gotovina.
"We will be monitoring very closely Croatia's actions in the coming weeks," said the prosecutor.
"We truly expect Croatia to act aggressively based on this new development in order to bring Gotovina to The Hague."
Del Ponte's remarks coincided with the start of an informal, two-day meeting of EU foreign ministers in the Welsh city of Newport.
Croatia's bid to join the Union is among the issues on the agenda.
British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw was quoted as saying Thursday that the EU would review Croatia's bid in mid-September to decide whether to give the green light for the start of its entry talks.
Del Ponte will be asked to report to the EU task force on Croatia's co-operation with the ICTY before a decision is made.
Regional human trafficking group sentenced
A group of 26 Macedonian, Albanian, Bulgarian and Kosovo nationals were sentenced to a total of 108 years in prison for their involvement in a trafficking ring.

A Skopje court Tuesday (November 14th) sentenced 26 people found guilty of automobile smuggling and human trafficking.
Their combined sentences totaled 108 years in prison.
The group included Macedonian, Bulgarian, Albanian and Kosovo citizens.
The organisers of the international trafficking channel, Dejan Stamkov and Jane Beldedovski, received the most severe sentences -- 13 and ten years, respectively.
Five Bulgarian nationals were tried and convicted in absentia to three years in prison each, and two Albanian nationals were convicted in absentia to seven years each.
The court also ordered the seizure of 10,000 euros, several vehicles, a residential building, and land.
The sentencing is the final chapter in the Macedonian police's "Operation South".
Police began arresting those involved in the group last November.
The resulting trial was the largest ever-organised in Macedonia, featuring the most participants.
The group was transporting illegal migrants to EU member states -- mainly to Greece.
Stamkov and Beldedovski supervised the operation.
For transport, they used trucks with special tanks where migrants could be hidden.
The migrants paid between 1,000 and 1,500 euros.
The most frequent users of the channel were Albanians.
The group managed to transfer about 44 migrants within two years.
Besides illegal transfer of migrants, some in the group also trafficked luxury cars.
The Bulgarian nationals supported that part of the activitiy.
The chief of a border police station and a police officer were involved.
The Macedonian police used special measures to apprehend the organised crime group -- surveillance, eavesdropping and hidden cameras.
Some of the defence lawyers say the sentences were too strict, and vowed to appeal.
Greek sea tourism professionals look to neighbouring states for cheaper bases
The traditional yachting business in Greece takes a turn for the benefit of other regional maritime countries.

Tzanis for Southeast European Times in Athens -- 09/03/12

A mix of uncompetitive pricing, over-regulation and red tape, now repeated at almost every instance to dissect the Greek economy, is directly blamed for a dramatic slump in sea tourism, a segment of the economy viewed as crucial for coming out of the crisis.
This trend is apparently benefitting Turkey the most, although Croatia and Montenegro have also recently attracted their fair share of yachts and motorboats.
In terms of Greece, a policy of the previous socialist government in 2009 raised taxes and stepped up inspections of pleasure craft backfired, as official Hellenic Coast Guard figures showed that no less than 3,823 private vessels were declared "permanently moored" in 2011.
"Tax criteria [for owning a vessel] were abolished in 2002, but with their re-institution in 2009, the number of vessels went from 11,500 to 2,600 throughout Greece," said Ilias Perimenis, the president of the national fiberglass manufacturers, traders and service providers in the boating sector.
"These types of criteria are a Greek invention.
Their 'reasoning' is only to collect revenue by the state; in practice, though, the state loses money as the manufacturing sector, for instance, which employs thousands of people, is being destroyed day by day," he said, adding that his group is waiting for the current interim Greek government to fulfil its promise to abolish the extra tax burden on owners and operators.
Turkey, however, appears to have lured a good many Greek-owned yachts, some of the sector's seasoned professionals and, of course, numerous foreign-owned vessels.
Entrepreneur Stavros Gavrias is equally pessimistic, confirming that many of Greece's sea tourism professionals are moving to neighbouring Turkey.
"There was one instance where tax inspectors boarded foreign-flagged vessels for checks, something that is very bothersome for the owners and crew.
They [owners and operators] don't care where they'll take their vessels.
They can work from anywhere, and many are travelling back and forth from Turkey," he said.
Gavrias, a contractor, also points to less-than-competitive rates as the biggest obstacle to jump-starting growth in the sector, and too much bureaucracy in constructing and operating high-end marinas.
"The most significant attraction is to have more, better and less expensive marinas in Greece.
This means liberalising the sector for would-be investors.
Turkey is more competitive in terms of prices, and correct services," he said, adding that the sector in Greece is desperately anticipating the draft law in making the building and operating of new marinas more attractive.
Beyond Turkey, he said operators of so-called "mega-yachts" are increasingly choosing Montenegro as their operations base.
The head of the influential Hellenic Professional Yacht Owners Association, Antonis Stelliatos, listed a number of professional vessels registered in Greece at no less than 3,150 and up to 3,500, all flying the Greek flag. Of these, he said, 800 are "cruisers" of varying shapes and sizes, accompanied by crews with five to eight people. The rest, he said, are sailing boats without crews.
He lamented the fact that only 19 full-service marinas exist in a "very safe country with more than 5,000 islands and isles, beautiful waters and millennia of history and culture practically under every rock".
According to the Association's figures, 28% of berthed vessels in Greece have fled for a regional country, primarily Turkey, but also Croatia and Montenegro.
"The criteria, which were voted in during a period of panic over the public debt, were excessively high, thus fuelling the downturn, reducing state revenues and increasing unemployment, while at the same time handing over the financial control of sea tourism in the Aegean to Turkey," General Secretary of the Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises, Giorgos Vernicos, said.
Away from the Aegean in the equally picturesque Adriatic, in terms of ever-important fuel costs, and contrary to recent media reports, Croatia is not becoming a new destination for yachts re-fuelling along the exquisite coast.
Andro Vlahusic, the mayor of the eponymous city of Dubrovnik, recently wrote to the leadership of INA, the biggest Croatian oil company, requesting that the company modernise its fuelling stations in the southern resorts to make them more attractive.
According to Juroslav Buljubasic, who sails a Seagull 2 old-timer yacht, the prices of fuel are the biggest problem for Croatia-based mariners.
"Yachts usually refuel either in Montenegro, Italy or further on, in Malta.
The prices in Croatia are too high so people tend to refuel somewhere else.
You have to pay a double price here than in Montenegro so I don't think that - if the prices are not dropped - we will become a place where the yachts will refuel in the summer," Buljubasic told SETimes.
Current official data, however, show that more than 400 mega yachts sail into Croatian harbours every year.

Romania, Hungary hold joint governmental meeting, sign accords
A host of mutual co-operation issues were on the agenda of a joint meeting of the Romanian and Hungarian governments.
It ended in Budapest on Thursday with the signing of a series of agreements.

Emphasising the importance of leaving behind historical disputes, Romania and Hungary vowed on Thursday (November 16th) to work together in the EU and to promote common and regional interests.
We will co-operate "for the consolidation of a united Europe, a Europe based on the fundamental values of democracy, human rights and the state of law," Romanian Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu said, quoting a declaration he and his Hungarian counterpart, Ferenc Gyurcsany, signed at the end of a daylong joint governmental session in Budapest.
Taking place less than seven weeks before Romania's entry into the EU on January 1st, the meeting -- the second in this format in 13 months -- focused on the co-ordination of the two countries' economic development plans and joint projects in various sectors, including transportation and infrastructure.
One of the issues discussed Thursday was a project for the construction of a gold mine at Rosia Montana in Romania, some 190km east of the country's border with Hungary.
The project involves the use of a cyanide-based technology for the extraction of gold.
Hungary is worried about the potential for an environmental catastrophe similar to the one caused by another Romanian mine in 2000.
"We are full of concerns because we have questions about a series of issues," the AP quoted Gyurcsany as saying at a joint press conference with Tariceanu after Thursday's meeting.
Tariceanu assured him that the project, which is opposed by Greenpeace and other environmental watchdogs, "will be carried out if all international and European environmental criteria" are met.
"At the moment it is too early to give an opinion since not all of the [environmental impact] studies have been completed," he added, promising, "total transparency".
Another item on the agenda concerned the issue of autonomy for ethnic Hungarians in Romania.
The countries still differ over this.
According to the Hungarian news agency MTI, a total of ten agreements were signed at the end of the meeting, including on EU-related activities, the Danube and Tisza rivers, simplifying the cross-border regime and on projects in the infrastructure and transport sectors, including the construction of a natural gas pipeline between the cities of Szeged in Hungary and Arad in Romania.
The two cabinets also agreed on the establishment of a joint commission to work on the drafting of a common history handbook by 2010.
Speaking at Thursday's joint press conference with Tariceanu, Gyurcsany said Hungary plans to partially open its labour market to Romanians after their country joins the EU.
"We want to open it up as much as we can without endangering Hungarian interests," Gyurcsany said.
He also announced plans to establish a 12m-euro - 19m-euro fund in support of small and medium Hungarian enterprises that want to enter the Romanian market.
Turkey Mulls Government Reforms
Turkey's recently proposed draft legislation related to local administrative reform has aroused the suspicions of municipal authorities, secularist institutions, labour unions and intellectuals.
By Fatih Baran for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 05/05/03
The Justice and Development Party (AKP) is promising to transfer a significant number of centralised bureaucratic functions to local authorities, paving the way for an American-style government.
With a comfortable majority in the Turkish Parliament, AKP should have no problem pushing through the reforms.
However, the proposed legislation is raising the hackles of stanch secularist institutions, intellectuals and labour unions.
The country adopted the parliamentary system in 1920.
Even before the republic was founded, Turks debated whether or not a presidential system mirroring that of the United States would be preferable.
At the time, lack of roads, education and communication made it virtually impossible to hold direct elections, since the electorate was unable to vote under such circumstances.
This situation, plus a one-party system, contributed to a centralisation of power in Ankara.
Three attempts at multi-party politics ended with the military taking control of the government.
After the 1980 coup, however, political life in Turkey achieved a level of stability.
As the population grew, so did the government in Ankara.
Reform has been on Turkey's agenda for a long time, but the options have been either to reduce the number of personnel or to devolve some of the power concentrated in Ankara.
Critics have complained for years that the central government has been unable to solve local problems, while centralisation contributes to inefficiency and constant delays.
During the 1989-1993 presidency of the late Turgut Ozal, there were discussions about adopting a presidential system. The initiative came from Ozal himself, who also proposed the creation of seven regions and the devolution of central power to them.
But conservatives and the military disapproved, citing the ongoing, low-intensity war with the autonomy-seeking Kurdistan Workers' Party, based in southeastern Turkey where most Kurds live.
Ozal's motives in introducing such a system came under fire.
Many felt that he sought the transfer of elections from parliament to the people as a means of keeping himself in the post.
Presidential tenure is currently limited to a single, seven-year term.
Ozal's successor, the widely popular Suleyman Demirel, raised the issue again, and again it was dropped amid similar suspicions.
Over the past ten years, successive governments have failed to reform the central administration in part because they were coalitions based on two or three parties of differing political persuasions.
In addition, government positions are traditionally handed out to influential party supporters or their relatives.
The clamour for reform has grown, however.
The IMF recently joined the chorus, insisting on bureaucratic reform and the elimination of nonessential jobs, as part of the criteria for issuing credits to Turkey.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said 21 April that he would welcome an American-style government with a president and the devolution of centralised powers.
Local administrative reform, as part of public administration reform, was one of the main platforms in AKP's election manifesto.
The draft legislation was submitted to parliament this past week.
Under the legislation, most ministries that have municipal offices would hand over their authority to local administration, with the exception of strategic ministries -- interior, foreign affairs, national education, health, finance and justice.
Supervision of the municipalities would fall to the audit department, while the authority to dismiss mayors would be transferred to the judiciary from the interior ministry.
The reform would also bring some changes to the structure of the central government, leading to the merger of state institutions tied to deputy prime ministers and certain ministries.
The AKP argues that such reforms will increase efficiency in the public sector.
As details emerged, however, the country's secular institutions, intellectuals and labour unions have launched an attack.
According to the unions, the closure of ministry offices would lead to unemployment and extra taxes.
At the same time, the municipal mayors have objected to expanding the authority of government-appointed governors.
The legislation also provides for a Local Administrations Committee, whose chairman would be appointed by the government.
According to the mayors, these changes would block the authority they would acquire through the reforms.
Intellectuals reject some aspects of reform, arguing that these will mean a greater burden placed on the shoulders of the long-suffering public.
Transferring the authority to impose taxes to local administrations would not strengthen them economically, and they would have to levy additional taxes.
The intellectuals also warn that the AKP, built on the ashes of the Islamist Virtue Party, may be out to change Turkey's secular structure.
Despite protests to the contrary from Erdogan and other AKP officials, Turkey's secularist institutions, as well as its intellectuals, remain suspicious.
President Ahmet Sezer has accused the ruling party of trying to penetrate state administration with Islamic ideology.
In turn, Erdogan has criticised Sezer for blocking government appointments to public office.
"Ottomania" on the rise in Turkey
While the renewed interest in Ottoman culture and history may be commercialisation to some, it can also provide a reference point for Turkish foreign policy and domestic politics.
By Menekse Tokyay for Southeast European Times in Istanbul -- 17/10/11
One example of "Ottomania" is the annual celebration of the conquest of Istanbul in 1453. [Reuters]
"Ottomania", the mass interest in everything Ottoman, has become a new trend in Turkey over the past couple of years.
The phenomenon is not only seen in the popularity of television series like "The Magnificent Century", depicting the life of Suleyman the Magnificent and his harem.
It is also reflected in the increased sales of Ottoman history books, Ottoman-styled jewelry, museum exhibitions, the restoration of Ottoman buildings and calligraphy.
While the craze has a certain commercial dimension to it, Turkey's Ottoman legacy may be able to provide a reference point for its proactive regional diplomacy, the expansion of markets and overcoming internal divisions within society.
According to Zeynep Ertug, who teaches Ottoman cultural history at Istanbul University, there are two main sources for this increased interest.
"The first is the search for an identity by a society which is highly embedded in European culture, while the second one is a belated bourgeoisie becoming increasingly richer and curious about the aristocratic way of life."
However, experts do not see this trend as a move away from the Kemalist ideology of a state that sought to disassociate itself from its Ottoman past in the early Republican era.
Rather, the new trend is a reflection of changes in how people see Ottoman culture.
As Professor Emre Alkin of Kemerburgaz University explains, until recently people had been taught that the Ottoman Empire was merely a state organisation.
"However, despite all forced omissions and reluctant remembering, it became evident that Ottoman is in fact a culture of living, covering a wide range of areas from clothes to lifestyle, from cookery to jewelry and decoration," he told SETimes.
The trend has led to an increase of people who have become much more proud of the Ottoman past.
For some, "Ottomania" is little more than the commercialisation of Turkey's Ottoman past. [Reuters]
"In fact, for a long time people were uncomfortable hearing that their past was discredited. But now, they are so glad to know that their past was not so bad; on the contrary, it was magnificent," said Ertug.
However, the Ottoman era cannot be taken as a monolithic issue, but rather is composed of different stages, some of them glorious, others marked by defeat.
As a result, people can only be proud of specific periods of their Ottoman past with some kind of nostalgia.
"In the long run, it can lead to frustration when someone asks you such a question: Then, why did such a glorious period end?" said historian Ahmet Kuyas of Galatasaray University.
While some experts like Kuyas consider this trend as the maturation of an interest over three or four decades, others see a superficial dimension to it.
"Although the interest in fields related to the Ottoman Empire has never been interrupted, current interest is rather superficial when one compares it to the novels in the past discussing Ottoman as a political heritage," Selim Kuru, associate professor of Turkish and Ottoman Studies at the University of Washington, said.
For Kuru, the interest manifested in TV series, the design of goods in shopping malls, and visual-based publications are a way of reviving Turkey's domestic and international market.
"This recent interest in all that is Ottoman can be rather explained by the fact that this subject matter has gained meta-value within the market economy," he explained.
According to Kuru, this profit-based interest comes at the expense of historical works over the past century by prominent academicians, researchers and artists.
Still, the Ottoman legacy may provide Turkey a reference point in conducting its foreign policy and overcoming problems of identity.
AKP Kayseri deputy Pelin Gundes Bakir said that the Ottoman Empire was a melting pot of different identities and religions in the Balkans and the Middle East.

On multiple occaisons, Davutoglu has rejected the characterisation of Turkey's foreign policy as neo-Ottomanism. [Reuters]
"The Ottoman Empire was a centre of tolerance, peace and political stability during its five centuries of existence in the Middle East and Balkans.
In this respect, it is logical that the Ottoman model provides a reference for Turkey's policies in the Middle East and Balkans," she said.
"History shows us clearly that Turkey has the potential to play a great role in the upcoming decade for ensuring peace, stability and economic prosperity, not only in Balkans but also in the Middle East," Bakir said.
However, the renewed interest in the Ottoman legacy is not an atavistic imperial drive, often dubbed neo-Ottomanism.
Rather, it comes as a logical consequence of geopolitical changes and economic needs in the post-Cold War era.
According to Kuyas, what is wrongly dubbed as neo-Ottomanism is in fact the research for new markets in the immediate vicinity of Turkey's geography. "So, it is not a matter of cultural extension, but rather a wish to extend its economic Lebensraum."
Mustafa Akyol, a Turkish political commentator, also doesn't see it as a neo-imperialist attempt. "On the contrary, if conceived in a reasonable way, it can provide a promising vision to the policymakers."
For Akyol, when remembering the historical links with the Balkans and Middle East, "there is always a risk of over-idealisation if not applied in a reasonable way."
While some have interpreted Turkey's proactive policy in the Middle East as a shift away from the West, Akyol doesn't see the increased interest in Turkey's Ottoman legacy as a rejection of Europe.
"The Ottoman Empire had been already a significant part of European politics with the alliances it established with European powers like France and the UK.
So, the Ottoman past cannot exclude Europe although the EU membership path of Turkey is not so promising nowadays," explained Akyol.
Maybe most importantly for domestic stability, the renewed interest in the Ottoman legacy can be a positive step towards rediscovering the pluralism within Turkish society. "In other terms, the Ottoman past can provide the society with a strong reference for identifying its different components, such as Kurdish people or non-Muslims," he said.
Plavsic Asks UN Tribunal for Justice
Addressing the UN war crimes tribunal, former Bosnian Serb leader Biljana Plavsic admitted responsibility for the persecution of non-Serbs during the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
(Reuters, The Independent, The Washington Post - 18/12/02; AP, BBC, CNN, Reuters, The New York Times, VOA, RFE/RL, Radio B92 - 17/12/02)
Addressing the UN war crimes tribunal on Tuesday (17 December), former Bosnian Serb leader Biljana Plavsic admitted responsibility for the persecution of non-Serbs during the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and appealed for justice.
"You must strive in your judgment to find whatever justice this world can offer, not only for me, but also for the innocent victims of this war," Plavsic told the three-judge panel presiding at her three-day sentencing hearing.
She said that over time she had come to realise that "many thousands of innocent people were the victims of organised, systematic efforts to remove Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats from territory claimed by Serbs." Because of a "blinding fear" that Serbs might become victims of their neighbours, as in World War II, the Bosnian Serb leadership became victimisers themselves, Plavsic said.
"The knowledge that I'm responsible for such human suffering and for soiling the character of my people will always be with me," said the highest-ranking Bosnian Serb official to appear before the court.
She is also the only woman to have been indicted by The Hague tribunal for war crimes during the conflicts in the Balkans.
Plavsic initially pleaded not guilty to all eight counts against her.
But in a surprise move in October, she decided to plead guilty to one charge of persecution, defined by the court as a crime against humanity. In exchange, the prosecution dropped the other seven charges, including two counts of genocide.
The 72-year-old former biology professor was once Radovan Karadzic's close ally and his wartime deputy, but later severed relations with him.
After the end of the war Plavsic succeeded Karadzic as president of the Bosnian Serb entity, Republika Srpska.
While in this post between 1996 and 1998, she played a key role in implementing the Dayton peace accord.
Addressing the court on Tuesday, former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright described the atrocities committed during the Bosnian conflict as "unimaginable horrors" reminiscent of the Holocaust, and said Plavsic, whom she characterised as a "very conflicted individual," bore some responsibility.
But she also credited Plavsic with taking a personal risk in breaking with other hard-line nationalists and supporting the Dayton peace agreement, and expressed respect for the Plavsic's admission of guilt and willingness to take responsibility.
The judges also heard testimony from the international community's former High Representative, Carl Bildt, who praised Plavsic for her contribution to implementing the Dayton accord.
That process, he said, "would have been very difficult and more dangerous and almost certainly more violent" without her.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel was among the other seven witnesses.
He urged the judges not to forget the victims of ethnic cleansing as they consider Plavsic's sentence, which is expected in a few months.
The maximum penalty for crimes against humanity is life in prison.
Science and Technology: Romanian experts uncover biggest Dacian find ever
Romanian scholars unearthed a Dacian necropolis in Ukraine. Also in the news: Thessaloniki will hold an Infosystem fair in October, and three Balkan students won Cisco's NetRiders award.

Romanian archaeologists discovered an ancient cemetery, which experts consider the largest necropolis ever found in the Dacian area.
They made their discovery in Malaia Kopalnia, Ukraine, 20km from the Romanian border.
It should reveal more about the Dacians' burial rites.
Women's graves contained fibulas, jewels, buckles, rings and chain loops, while the men's graves contained weapons, such as a one-bladed sword called "fica", spurs, spearheads and other objects.
The 22nd International Informatics, Telecommunications and Digital Technology fair, Infosystem, will take place in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki from October 2nd to October 5th, as part of the Thessaloniki International Fair.
According to organisers, Infosystem will present the whole range of modern digital technology under the headings Personal & Fun, Telecommunications, Business Selections and Public Sector Selections.
Serbian Education Minister Zarko Obradovic announced on July 28th that the government will launch a fund for young students.
Those enrolled in high schools and universities will be able to take advantage of the fund, Obradovic said.
Boris Dekovic from Croatia, Cristian Sandescu from Romania and Pavel Stefanov from Bulgaria were among the five winners of this year's prestigious international internet networking competition, NetRiders, organised by Cisco. On July 9th, for the first time, the competition occurred online, with 70 participants from 24 countries.
The winners received a fully sponsored tour to California's Silicon Valley in January 2009.
The Cypriot Ministry of Education and Culture has approved the establishment of a medical school in the University of Cyprus, the ministry announced on July 25th, adding the move will make Cyprus an international and regional centre of higher education and research.
The new faculty will offer Cypriot doctors and nurses lifelong postgraduate training.
The Greek company Marak Electronics will build a telematic network in the Evros River delta of northern Greece. The project, worth 250,000 euros, aims to promote tourism in the highly biodiverse area.
The planned telematic system will allow visitors to observe a number of animal species and the landscapes from a distance.

Erdogan, Karamanlis pledge a "new page" in Turkish-Greek relations
During the first official visit by a Greek prime minister to Ankara in 50 years, the leaders of both countries pledged on Wednesday to put their differences behind them and develop a close partnership.

Greece wants "to go beyond the difficulties of the past and to look towards the future with hope", Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis said after meeting with his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Erdogan described 2008 as a year of new opportunities to develop further ties between the two countries.
Although Turkey and Greece are traditional rivals, political relations have drastically improved in recent years, despite ongoing disagreement about airspace and territorial waters.
The two NATO allies stopped just short of going to war in 1987 and 1996 over oil and gas exploration and a sovereignty dispute involving two tiny, barren islets in the Aegean Sea.
The Turkish and Greek prime ministers agreed on Wednesday to further develop bilateral co-operation, but they differed on the politically sensitive issues of Cyprus, the reopening of a Greek Orthodox seminary in Istanbul, problems in the Aegean and issues concerning the Turkish minority in Greece and the Greek minority in Turkey.
They pledged to work together to resolve the long-standing dispute over the territories in the Aegean, although they remain far apart on the means to be used in this effort.
Karamanlis reiterated Athens' position that the matter should be decided by the International Court of Justice in The Hague, whereas Erdogan continued to insist on a bilateral solution.
Meanwhile, the stalemate over efforts to reunify the divided island of Cyprus has hampered Turkey's EU bid.
In December 2006, Brussels froze the opening of eight of 35 negotiating chapters because of a Cyprus-related impasse.
The Republic of Cyprus joined the EU in May 2004, claiming to represent the island as a whole.
However, the Turkish part of the island is in international isolation and is only recognised by Turkey.
"It is necessary for Turkey to also normalise its relations with Cyprus for its EU bid," Karamanlis said, adding that the EU should accept Turkey as a full member after Ankara fulfils all of its commitments to the organisation.
Erdogan responded by saying there is a need to redouble diplomatic efforts regarding Cyprus and expressed hope that the February presidential elections there will create a new window of opportunity.
Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos, who led his community in rejecting a UN reunification plan in a 2004 referendum, is seeking re-election.
Turkish Cypriots held a separate referendum at the time and voted in favour of the plan.
But it had to be endorsed by both sides in order for a reunified Cyprus to enter the EU.
Pensions in Macedonia increase by an average of 15%
Pensions in Macedonia have been increased for the first time in 15 years.
Financial discipline, better tax collection and a pension fund surplus made the raise possible.

Approximately 280,000 Macedonians will see an average 15% increase in their pensions this month.
The decision, reached earlier this month by the government, replaces the planned 10% across the board hike.
The new increases -- between 20% and 10% -- will equalise the payouts, Minister of Labour and Social Policy Ljupco Meskov said at a press conference.
The government will raise the lowest pensions by 20%; those amounting to 100 to 170 euros by 15%; pensions of up to 240 euros by 12%; and pensions of more than 240 euros by 10%, according to Meskov.
The first group includes about 120,000 pensioners, the second 110,000, the third 35,000 and the fourth group has around 12,000 pensioners, the minister said.
About 97% of pensioners began receiving the increase last week, and the rest will receive the increase beginning in July.
Meskov described it as a huge step for the government since the average pension had been based on average salaries.
"Through this harmonisation, pensions will approximate to the dynamics of the salary increase," Meskov said.
The increase was made possible by a 9.4% surplus in the Pension and Invalidity Insurance Fund.
That surplus is expected to increase further this year.
Other contributing factors were the introduction of the flat tax and the reduction of the gray economy in the country.
Tax collection has increased, as has the government's financial discipline.
The pension increase was carried out with the consent of the IMF.
Fund representatives say that as long as the budget deficit is kept within the projected 1.5% of GDP, the costs are believed to be within the IMF's low-inflation and low-interest policy.
The raise -- the first in 15 years -- was welcomed, especially in light of rising prices for basic necessities.
As a token of the pensioners' appreciation, the Dostoinstvo (Dignity) Pensioners' Association presented Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski with a certificate of gratitude.
Kostunica's support could come at too high a price for Serbia's Tadic
Local press reports say Serbian President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica have struck a deal regarding support in the presidential election run-off, but judging by the positions of their parties, an agreement remains uncertain.

Although the Belgrade press has reported that Serbian President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica have struck a deal ahead of the February 3rd presidential run-off, their parties deny it.
In exchange for his support, according to Belgrade daily Blic, Kostunica said Tadic must oppose the planned EU mission to Kosovo, unless the UN Security Council adopts a new resolution authorising it.
In return, Tadic wants the prime minister to back the signing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU.
According to the paper, Kostunica is to announce his support for Tadic after sealing an energy agreement with Russia, in Moscow, on Friday (January 25th).
Belgrade analysts say that Kostunica's support could be decisive in the run-off.
In the second round, Tadic will face ultranationalist Radical Party candidate Tomislav Nikolic, who won about 4% more votes than Tadic in the first round.
Kostunica's supporters will be crucial in choosing the winner in February.
However, Kostunica's party requested on Wednesday that Tadic's Democratic Party change the coalition agreement reached during the formation of the current government.
The Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) is calling for a tougher policy regarding the EU -- it does not want the SAA to be signed if the EU deploys that mission to Kosovo, without prior UN approval.
The DSS says an EU mission to Kosovo would violate Serbia's sovereignty.
Tadic's platform, however, is focused on European integration.
His campaign motto is "Let Us Conquer Europe Together".
"Everyone knows what I think about Kosovo, about Europe, about the future of this country, and what I have been doing all these years.
And I will not allow anyone to set conditions before me.
I will yield the last atom of strength, I am ready to sacrifice myself for this thing, but I will not let anyone set conditions for a better Serbia and a better life," Tadic said.
While the Hungarian and Croatian minorities have backed the incumbent, without Kostunica's supporters it will be practically impossible for Tadic to win.
Analysts believe that he will have a difficult time catching up with Nikolic, because the Radical Party candidate can also count on the support of around 6% of opposition Socialist Party of Serbia voters.
League of Vojvodina Social Democrats leader Nenad Canak, who is backing Tadic, has accused Kostunica of positioning himself to form a ruling coalition with the Radicals after the run-off.
For the time being, however, there is no indication this is in the works.
Former Yugoslav Countries Beginning to Address War Crimes in Local Courts
In September, Bosnia and Herzegovina's state court issued its first-ever war crimes indictment.
The country is joining other regions of the former Yugoslavia that are beginning to take on cases in local courts as the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) prepares to close its doors by 2010.
The tribunal plans to continue to try leaders such as former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in The Hague, while deferring lower-level cases.
Observers say that trying cases locally can have a substantial impact on public opinion and raise awareness about war crimes.
But some worry that the local courts are not yet prepared.

A recent war crimes indictment issued by prosecutors at Bosnia and Herzegovina’s (BiH) fledgling state court is just one part of a regional push to try war crimes committed during the Balkan conflicts in the 1990s closer to home. Iraqi-born BiH citizen Abdul Maktouf, 45, was charged on 13 September with allegedly abducting Serb and Croat civilians in 1993 and transporting them to a mujahadeen camp where they were severely beaten.
The case is significant because it is the first war crimes indictment to be issued by BiH’s state court, which was created by the country’s top international official, High Representative Paddy Ashdown, in January 2003.
The indictment was issued by prosecutors within the court’s special department for economic crime, organised crime and corruption, where international judges and prosecutors work alongside nationals.
BiH’s special war crimes chamber isn’t slated to begin work until January, but its setup will mirror that of the special department.
"It’s also, to our knowledge, the first mujahadeen case anywhere," said BiH state prosecutor and special department head John McNair, referring to the foreign-born Muslim fighters who came to BiH to fight on the side of the government during the conflict.
The mujahadeen issue is a highly sensitive one in BiH, given the heightened fears after the 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States that some of the men who remained in BiH after the war could be involved with terrorist groups.
When BiH’s war crimes chamber begins work at the beginning of 2005, it will join other regions of the former Yugoslavia that are beginning to take on cases in local courts as the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) prepares to close its doors by 2010.
The ICTY has tried more than 40 people since being established in 1993. The strategy between now and 2010 will be to continue to try leaders such as former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in The Hague, while deferring lower-level cases.
Some tribunal observers say that local trials may present steep learning curves for local judiciaries that haven’t proven themselves to be particularly fair or unbiased.
"In a way [local trials] already should have started a long time ago, but as far as the messages I get about the region, basically they are far from ready," said the project manager of the London-based Institute for War and Peace Reporting’s tribunal update, Ana Uzelac, noting that the lack of debate in parliaments when passing war crimes legislation was "disturbing".

"On the other hand, one can be an optimist and say that once the trials start and once there is a jurisprudence, and once the judges and prosecutors get experience, things may turn out rapidly for the better," she said.
Croatia, for example, has designated four courts -- in Zagreb, Osijek, Rijeka and Split -- to deal with war crimes, rather than the myriad of smaller courts that have handled the issue up to now, with uneven results.
The problem with the smaller courts, said one analyst, is that their verdicts can be overturned by a higher court, as has been the case in an ongoing trial against a man who stands accused of allegedly killing 13 civilians in Karlovac in September 1991.
"This is the third time the process has started in a local court in Karlovac," said Vesna Terselic, a consultant who formerly worked for the Institute of Peace Studies in Zagreb. "There have been two liberating sentences, and the high courts have said, 'no, he did kill those people,' and they keep returning it to the court."
"[The lower courts] are really under pressure from the local community. The pressure would not be so high in Zagreb," she added.
Judges have been appointed and are being trained with help from the ICTY, but it’s not clear when these four courts will actually begin taking cases.
Terselic said that while The Hague tribunal is an essential institution and local trials would never have come about without it, it’s important to try crimes locally as well.
"Trials in our country really have an impact on public opinion, and have more importance to people in realising what kinds of crimes have been committed," she said.
"Each ex-Yugoslav country deals with this in different ways, and which is the best we’ll have to see."
In Serbia, six Serbs accused of killing 200 Croat civilians in Vukovar in 1991 went on trial in Belgrade in March.
The trial is still under way and is widely seen as a test of Serbia’s judiciary.
Kosovo’s panels of international and national judges have been trying war crimes and other cases for the past two or three years, and one justice official there said that bringing in internationals to handle certain types of cases -- including war crimes cases -- have been received well by the local courts and prosecutors.
"It takes the pressure off the local judiciary, who’d be worried about their safety or risk of intimidation," said Thomas Monaghan, the director of UNMIK’s justice department.
As to lessons that BiH’s state court could learn from the experience in Kosovo, Monaghan said that justice should be swift. "The most important thing with the war crimes cases is to investigate them early and to try them as quickly as you can," he said.
"My sense of the difficulty is that the witnesses, the more they’re interviewed and the more they have to testify, the more they’re reluctant to be witnesses.
It’s a painful process to have to testify to the details."
Whatever the process ends up looking like in BiH, McNair said that war crimes cases would be prosecuted no matter their level of sensitivity.
"We didn’t select this case because it involved any particular perpetrator or perpetrators, and I suppose that is the point," McNair said. "As in the other cases we have brought, we will prosecute serious crimes, irrespective of their ethnic background or political influence or their economic status."
Sale of Telekom Serbia Prompts Investigation
The sale of Telekom Serbia in 1997 has sparked accusations of kickbacks and support for former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's regime.
An investigation has been launched in Italy to uncover the extent of the alleged corruption.
By Davor Konjikusic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 11/11/03
The former president of the Bank of Belgrade, Borka Vucic, has denied that the money received from the sale of shares of Telekom Serbia to foreign partners in 1997 was spent illegally.
She said the money received was in no way used to aid former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's regime.
In an interview with the Italian agency Ansa, Vucic said Yugoslavia made 1.5 billion German Marks (739m euros) from the contract.
According to her, 1.2 billion DM were deposited into the Yugoslav Fund for Development through the Bank of Belgrade, and the government used the money to pay pensions and subsidise health care and other social services.
The remaining 300m DM were directly forwarded to the treasury of the National Bank of Yugoslavia, Vucic said.
An investigation was initiated in Rome into the purchase of Telekom Serbia after the Italian media reported early in 2001 that the Italian side, during negotiations, had insisted on several million DM in kickbacks.
According to the Republica, kickbacks went to senior Italian officials, while Milosevic received cash that his regime needed during the period of sanctions imposed because of Kosovo.
As a result of the sale, Italy Telecom (STET) acquired 29 per cent of the shares of Telekom Serbia, while the Greek telecommunication company OTE acquired 20 per cent.
STET paid out 702m DM 48 hours after the signing of the deal, on 10 June 1997.
It paid out 117m DM in the next six months and 74m DM in March of 1998.
Serbian Justice Minister Vladan Batic announced recently that, at the request of Italian authorities, a court in Belgrade would hold hearings for 12 Serbian nationals to assist in the investigation.
The hearings are closed to public and there is no information about those on trial.
On the basis of findings by an Italian Parliamentary Committee that uncovered facts regarding the purchase, prosecutors of the tribunal in Turin, Italy, decided to extend the investigation until next summer, says committee president Enco Trantino.
He added that the committee is ready to send a delegation to Sheveningen detention unit at The Hague to hear "Milosevic's version of the entire event".
Greece Wary of Terrorists as Olympic Games Approach
With the Olympics scheduled to take place in Greece next summer, authorities are watching for any signs of potential terrorist activities in the country.
By Dimitris Agrafiotis for Southeast European Times in Athens - 24/06/03
Last month's al Qaeda attacks in Riyadh and Casablanca are the latest incidents of terrorist activity in the Mediterranean region.
Ongoing activity by terrorist and extremist groups, and warnings from foreign intelligence services, have fueled concern in Greece about a possible incident within its borders.
While wary of the "cry wolf" syndrome, authorities are taking the threat very seriously.
Greece has many reasons to be on alert.
The country's geographical position makes it a magnet for terrorist groups, since it is easier to reach Greece than other European states.
Its geography increases the danger of illegal infiltration. The Greek coastline is extremely long, making it difficult to protect.
In the government's view, one of the main threats to national security comes from Islamic fundamentalists entering Greece as illegal immigrants.
Three years ago, many such immigrants received green cards, sometimes without any significant investigation into their criminal records.
Thus, it is possible that cadres belonging to a network of Islamic extremists have obtained documentation allowing them to stay in Greece.
Authorities have four cells of Muslim immigrants under close surveillance.
Despite these dangers, law enforcement organisations and the National Intelligence Service (EYP) are in a strong position.
The EYP is working in close co-operation with foreign services in the coalition against terrorism as they investigate possible links.
Greek authorities are concerned about the possibility of an attack during the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens.
Al Qaeda's global activity and its aim of creating mass casualties have put the Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and the government on high alert.
It is up to the government to deal with the most difficult task of the Games: ensuring the security of the athletes and visitors.
Greece's participation in the coalition against terrorism is a strike against radical fundamentalism.
Its choice to join the United States in the fight against al Qaeda could make it a target for extremists within the country.
Greece has little experience with fundamentalist terrorism.
Containing this new threat is a challenge that the law enforcement community and the EYP must meet.
Ashdown Criticises Bosnian Serb Authorities Over Mladic
Paddy Ashdown sharply criticised the Bosnian Serb authorities Tuesday following new revelations suggesting top war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic had been on the Republika Srpska Army rolls until 2002.

New revelations suggesting that one of the top war crimes fugitives from the 1992-1995 conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) might have remained on the Bosnian Serb Army rolls until 2002 prompted sharp criticism from High Representative Paddy Ashdown.
The Sarajevo-based daily Dnevni Avaz published a report Tuesday (30 November) displaying what it said was wartime Bosnian Serb military chief Ratko Mladic's military personnel file.
It showed that he was discharged from the army of BiH's Serb-run entity, Republika Srpska (RS), only two years ago.
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) indicted Mladic in late 1995, charging him with war crimes, including genocide.
Mladic is one of The Hague-based tribunal's most wanted indictees, along with former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and retired Croat General Ante Gotovina.
According to the report, Mladic was discharged from the RS army (VRS) in March 2002 under a decree issued by Mirko Sarovic who was serving as RS president at the time.
Ashdown said it was "scandalous" that the VRS had an employer/employee relationship with the fugitive until as recently as two years ago, while claiming it was unaware of his whereabouts.
This "is an indication of the flagrant disregard that the RS authorities and especially the VRS have held towards their Dayton commitments and their obligations to the International Tribunal in The Hague," the top international envoy in BiH added.
A statement by Ashdown's office said Tuesday that the document published in Dnevni Avaz supported chief ICTY prosecutor Carla del Ponte's remarks before the UN Security Council last week.
"I believe that there are fundamental systemic weaknesses built into the law enforcement and security structures in BiH, and in particular the RS," the prosecutor said on 23 November, criticising the RS authorities for failing to apprehend any of the indictees sought by the ICTY.
"What does this tell us about the collusion of the VRS in Mladic's continued evasion of justice and their willingness to co-operate with the ICTY?" Ashdown asked. "The RS must break with the past if it wants a modern European future."
According to the document published by the Sarajevo daily, Mladic was also on active service in the Yugoslav Army (VJ) until 2001, contradicting a claim by RS authorities that the relations between the VJ and the VRS had ended in 2000 and 2001.
Said Ashdown,"If Mladic was registered with both the VJ and the VRS, why did his personnel file never appear back in 2000 and 2001 when the authorities were claiming to have severed the link?"
The new revelations come days before NATO's summit on 9 December.
At the end of June, the Alliance postponed an invitation for BiH to join its Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme, because of the country's failure to meet its obligations to the ICTY.
BiH news agency FENA quoted Germany's ambassador to the country, Freiherr von Kittlitz und Ottendorf, as saying Tuesday that he did not expect BiH's bid to join the PfP to be a central issue at the December summit, but that it would be discussed.
NATO would study del Ponte's report to the Security Council carefully, the diplomat said.
Turkey to Reform Water Policy
As an EU candidate, Turkey must harmonise its laws with those of the Union.
The country is preparing to reform its tight policy on transboundary rivers and water resources in order to comply with EU criteria and international law.

Turkey is preparing to reform its tight policy on transboundary rivers and water resources in order to comply with EU criteria and international law.
The country's foreign ministry has established two working groups -- one to prepare the new water legislation, taking into account Turkey's needs as well as the EU Water Framework Directive, and the other to carry out the necessary restructuring of institutions.
As an EU candidate, Turkey is required to harmonise its laws, including those governing environmental resources, with those of the Union.
Ankara is hoping to start membership negotiations with the EU in 2005, provided the Union gives the go-ahead during its summit this month.
The EU-Turkey Accession Partnership Agreement of 2003 urged Turkey to approve the Union's water standards.
At the same time, the country must balance its need to safeguard its resources with current interpretations of international law, which require countries to consider the impact of water policies on neighbouring countries.
Transboundary rivers constitute 40 per cent of Turkey's water potential.
It has been reported that the Middle East, and the Gulf States in particular, will face serious water shortages during the next 25 years, and Turkey is likely to be one of the main sources for the transfer of fresh water.
The two important rivers originating in Turkey -- the Tigris and the Euphrates -- have long been the subject of disagreements with water-stressed Syria and Iraq, which are traversed by both rivers. During the 1990s, while Syria and Iraq were calling on Turkey to release more water for agricultural use, the country instead decided to construct dams to foster economic growth in its poorest regions. Under a protocol signed in 1987, Turkey releases 500 cubic metres per second of water to Syria, which would like to see this amount increased to 700 cubic metres.
Once Ankara signs the recent international conventions on transboundary rivers, it will have to obtain Syria's approval if it wants to build a dam on the Euphrates.
Turkey also has its own long-term needs to consider.
Many experts warn the country could face shortages by 2030, due to a growing population, combined with rapid urbanisation and industrialisation.
Even as the foreign ministry sets about developing a more flexible policy, it is also seeking precautions.
Ankara will likely push Syria and Iraq to acknowledge the Tigris and the Euphrates as having one river basin, thus decreasing the requirements under international law.
In addition, Turkey will try to prevent interventions by third parties, demanding instead that only riparian states should be involved in discussions concerning water rights.

Plastic surgeons and laryngologists at the Clinical Hospital Centre in Zagreb restored a patient's voice by extracting fat through liposuction and injecting it into her vocal cords.
The complex operation, the first of its kind in Croatia, lasted about an hour.
The surgeons performed it on Thursday (April 16th) to mark World Voice Day.
Engineers from Kragujevac and Nis designed the first Serbian implant that can replace part of the human sternum.
In early April, surgeons performed the first successful operation on a 54-year-old patient with a chest tumor.
The method is applicable in orthopaedics, maxillofacial surgery, dentistry and surgery for bone cancer.
Young Croatian astronomers Aleksandar and Stefan Cikota, twins who study physics at Zurich University, discovered an asteroid that they named "Zagreb", the newspaper Jutarnji list reported on April 14th.
The brothers so far have discovered more than 2,300 asteroids together with colleagues at the La Sagra Observatory in southern Spain.
Surgeons at the KAT hospital in northern Athens reattached all four limbs of a 30-year-old woman from Albania on April 13th.
Her husband had assaulted her with a chain saw three days earlier in their home in the city of Kalamata.
The patient is in stable condition, doctors said.
Turkish scientists from Bilkent University developed through nanotechnology a new type of DVD, known as "magical", the newspaper Turkiye reported on April 13th.
The technique pioneered by the scientists enables new DVDs to store at least 1,000 times as much as information as regular DVDs, The "magical" DVDs will be able to store thousands of films.

In Romania, a cautious celebration
The road to EU membership for Romania began in 1999.
On Tuesday, the European Commission assured it and neighbouring Bulgaria that they will join as scheduled on 1 January 2007 -- but with the strictest conditions ever imposed on new members.

"Size matters," European Liberal lawmaker Graham Watson told the European Parliament (EP) as it debated the bloc's future. "The EU needs as many countries as possible which share our values to help us tackle the serious challenges of our age."
Along with most of the Group leaders in the European Parliament, Watson welcomed the European Commission's (EC) decision to recommend 1 January 2007 as the accession date for Romania and Bulgaria.
According to EC President Jose Manuel Barroso, the entry of the two Balkan countries is "a historic achievement that makes our Union safer and stronger".
Although he called for a pause in the enlargement process while the bloc resolves the issue of a European Constitution, he also gave assurances to other aspiring members that they are not being shut out.
"We will respect our commitments towards countries to whom we have opened an accession perspective," Barroso said.
Romanians, meanwhile, were cautiously celebrating.
President Traian Basescu warned the country not to indulge in wishful thinking.
"Any illusion that once we enter the EU, wealth will be for granted cannot be anything but a grave error.
We have to get used to living in an environment which continuously calls on us for performance," he said.
After a long and painful process of reforms, Romania has reached its objective.
Nevertheless, Basescu said, there are "areas with mediocre performance".
The shortcomings were laid out in the new monitoring report that the EC has submitted to the European Parliament.
A particular area of concern is agriculture.
There is "still a real risk that the paying agencies will not be functioning properly by the time of the accession", the report warns.
As a result, Romania risks losing up to 25% of EU agricultural funding.
The EC was faced with a difficult task.
In giving the green light, it also had to appease some reluctant EU member states -- notably France and Germany, which have not yet ratified the accession treaty with Bulgaria and Romania.
While praising the "sustainable progress both countries have achieved," Barroso also assured European lawmakers that the EC would set up a mechanism for co-operation and verification of progress after accession.
Both will have to report every six months to the EC.
They will still have to meet benchmarks in judicial reform, anti-corruption measures and the fight against organised crime.
Should either country fail to meet these benchmarks, the EC could apply a specific safeguard clause that would suspend judicial co-operation and the obligation of the current EU member states to recognise the court rulings issued in that particular country.
Some EU officials, such as Jonathan Scheele, head of the EC Delegation in Bucharest, acknowledge that this safeguard cause could be "a blunt edged weapon", mainly affecting ordinary citizens.
In Brussels, however, it is viewed as a means of pressure on Bucharest and Sofia to continue needed reforms.
Bulgaria hails decision on EU entry
Hailing the European Commission's go-ahead for his country and neighbouring Romania's admission into the EU on 1 January 2007, Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev described it Tuesday as "the final fall of the Berlin Wall".

Although it did not come without strings attached, Bulgarian officials hailed on Tuesday (26 September) European Commission (EC) decision, which clears the way for their country and neighbouring Romania to enter the EU on 1 January 2007.
"This is the genuine and final fall of the Berlin Wall," Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev said.
Joining the EU is the most meaningful historical project for Bulgaria's future, Bulgarian Darik Radio quoted President Georgi Parvanov as saying.
Bulgaria, he added, has signed a number of treaties in its history, but it is this step that finally puts it on an equal footing with the rest of the European nations.
In its final monitoring report on the two Balkan nations' progress towards EU accession, released Tuesday, the EC said both "have carried out an extraordinary reform process and they have gone through a remarkable transformation" since the fall of communism in late 1989.
EU membership will give a powerful momentum for Bulgaria's economic and social development and will make the Union stronger, EC President Jose Manuel Barroso said at a news conference in Sofia on Wednesday, following talks with Stanishev.
There is reason to celebrate, but there is no room for complacency, he stressed, urging the authorities to focus on implementation of still needed reforms.
Stringent conditions have been imposed on Bulgaria and Romania as they prepare to become the 26th and 27th members of the Union.
Failure to meet the requirements could lead to the activation, during the first three years of membership, of tough safeguard clauses included.in the two countries' accession treaty.
The EC said it will establish strong monitoring mechanisms to ensure that both countries carry out the prescribed actions.
In addition, Sofia and Bucharest will have to submit reports on their progress in implementing the required measures every six months, with the first one due on 31 March.
Bulgaria must also take immediate corrective action to rectify all deficiencies in the area of air safety.
Otherwise, the EC may move to restrict Bulgarian aviation companies' access to the bloc's aviation market.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, who was with Barroso in Sofia on Wednesday, said it was up to Bulgaria to make sure that the safeguard clauses envisioned in the treaty will not be triggered.
Ahtisaari: Stability key to the progress of status talks
Those who advocate violence will be given no role in determining Kosovo's final status, UN envoy Martti Ahtissari said during his recent trip to Pristina.

Stability is crucial to the process of resolving Kosovo's status and those advocating violence will be given no role in determining the province's future, UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari and his deputy, Albert Rohan, said during their recent three-day stop in Pristina.
"The Special Envoy can take appropriate action with his UN mandate to suspend or exclude any individual or group if he judges that their actions are not conducive to progress," Ahtisaari said during a press conference Wednesday (23 November).
Members of the Security Council have signaled they back taking measures to preserve stability if such steps become necessary, he added.
Rohan echoed his remarks, noting that the Contact Group for Kosovo has urged all parties to refrain from unilateral steps and to reject any form of violence. "The whole international community really rejects violence.
As the president [Ibrahim Rugova] said: whoever would take this kind of measures, it will be totally counterproductive."
The comments came in the wake of threats by a shadowy militant group calling itself the Kosovo Independence Army (KIA).
In a communique circulated in local media, the group has threatened to launch attacks on Pristina, which it said was under the control of a "modern occupier".
It also urged Kosovo Police Service (KPS) and Kosovo Protection Corps members to join it in a campaign of violence.
The KIA first surfaced two months ago in Dukagjini, in the southern part of Kosovo that borders with Albania.
Masked, armed men reportedly have stopped and interrogated people there, and the UN and other international organisations have advised staff not to travel in the area after dark.
On 16 November, a KPS car was damaged by an explosion.
One day later, a bomb situated under a truck injured four Serb teenagers at a busy outdoor market in Sterpce, a mainly Serb town in the east of Kosovo.
UNMIK has described the incident as a terrorist act, but it is not clear whether there is any link to the KIA.
Using violence to try to force a solution is "crazy", UNMIK head Soren Jessen-Petersen said. "We are prepared to respond to any kind of provocation of violence," he added.
Turkish court decides to put ruling AKP on trial
The eleven-member Constitutional Court judges voted unanimously Monday in favour of hearing a case brought by Turkey's chief prosecutor.

Turkey's Constitutional Court decided on Monday (March 31st) to put the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) on trial on charges of undermining the country's secular system.
In a unanimous vote, the 11 judges agreed to hear a case brought by Turkey's chief prosecutor, Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya.
"The Constitutional Court has found the indictment of chief prosecutor to be admissible.
But this doesn't meant that the top court agrees to the claims cited in that indictment," journalist Taha Akyol told CNN Turk. "Now it will hear the petition."
Yalcinkaya filed his lawsuit on March 14th, seeking to have the party banned.
He accused the AKP of becoming a "focal point" for anti-secular activities, and claimed it has a "hidden agenda" aimed at transforming Turkey into an Islamic state.
He also called for 71 officials, including Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and President Abdullah Gul, to be barred from politics for five years.
The court was split over whether to put Gul on trial, with four judges opposed and the others in favour.
Under the constitution, a president can only be tried on charges of treason.
The secretary general of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), Cihan Pacaci, was the first to comment on the decision.
"From now on, a legal process will start.
Everybody should respect the decision of the Constitutional Court."
The AKP describes itself as a conservative democratic party.
It won a solid victory in last year's elections, receiving 47% of the vote.
Last month, to the dismay of secularists, it succeeded in lifting a ban on wearing Islamic headscarves at universities.
That move, according to Yalcinkaya, is proof that the party is trying to reshape Turkey along religious lines.
In his 162-page indictment, the prosecutor also cited various statements by Erdogan that referred to Islam and Islamic law.
The trial is expected to take six months.
As a first step, the Constitutional Court will forward the indictment to the AKP, which has one month to come up with a defence statement.
After that, Yalcinkaya will issue a technical opinion on the case.
Later, AKP officials will testify in their own defence.
Once that process is complete, the rapporteurs of the Constitutional Court will prepare a technical report.
After the report is ready, the 11 members of the Constitutional Court will review it.
They will then convene to rule on the case.
The vote of at least seven judges is needed to shut down the AKP.
Eight of the 11 judges on the bench were appointed by former President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, a staunch secularist who clashed frequently with the AKP.
In the meantime, the ruling party plans to introduce a series of constitutional amendments aimed at making party closures more difficult.
With opposition parties reluctant to support the proposed changes, however, they may end up being put before the public in referendum.
Noisy jets disturb Montenegro's coastal region
Due to the high noise level around the Montenegrin airport in the coastal city of Tivat, the government is considering banning two types of Russian aircraft.

High-frequency noise caused by older Russian airplanes disturbs tourists in the Montenegrin coastal city Tivat, often shaking houses in the area and the nearby bay of Boka Kotorska.
Media reports say the noise even triggers car alarms.
The Montenegrin government has suggested that the Russian airliners land at Podgorica Airport.
It has the capacity to handle more aircrafts and the noise would not adversely affect the tourist industry as much.
However, the government does not want to give up the two Russian airplanes too quickly as the Ilyushin 86 and Tupolev 154 together carry an estimated 100,000 Russian tourists to Montenegro annually.
Tourist agencies that bring Russians to the so-called Montenegro Riviera openly oppose the ban.
They like to use the two Russian aircraft because of their low cost maintenance and passenger capacity.
According to the Montenegrin media, the government will first attempt to move the Russian aircraft from Tivat to the Podgorica Airport this summer, but it will also consider a full ban of the Ilyushin 86 and Tupolev 154 for 2009.
Meanwhile, the government will give tour operators time to consider alternatives to the Russian airliners.
A ban would force Russian tourists to travel a half hour from the Podgorica Airport to the coast.
Despite the possible effect this increased travel time might have on tourism, local authorities in Tivat and the general public support preparations for the ban, given the noise.
All signs indicate that the additional travel time will not affect tourism.
Association of Tourist Agencies in Budva head Snezana Vejnovic, for instance, announced that Russian tourists have again expressed interest in travelling to Montenegro this year.
''Many have booked their holidays early, at the beginning of the year, despite the fact that prices increased from 10% to 20% in comparison with last year,'' said Vejnovic.
In fact, many Russian tourists are looking for possible property investment opportunities.
Montenegro reported 2.3 million registered foreign tourists last year.
Additionally, the World Tourism and Travel Council has announced that in the next ten years, the tourist industry is estimated to expand 10% annually.
Mine-clearing campaign moves forward in BiH despite deaths
Reinforcing the importance of the country's new mine-clearing campaign, six sappers were recently killed in one week.
The country must move forward with the campaign, however, for public safety and the future of tourism.

More than 12 years after the end of its inter-ethnic conflict, almost 4% of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) remains peppered with landmines, endangering the lives of 900,000 people living nearby, said Prime Minister Nikola Spiric, launching a new mine-clearing campaign earlier this month.
He said 480 people were killed and almost 1,140 injured by landmines since the fighting ended.
A fifth of the dead were under the age of 18, and 39 were trained experts, or sappers.
Additionally, 50 sappers have been injured.
During one week in March, six sappers lost their lives.
The first died on March 17th near Doboj.
The following day, two were killed and one suffered injuries in a field near Sprecani.
A few days later, three others -- two policemen and a civilian guard member – were killed near Gorazde.
Although the general threat posed by landmines has been significantly reduced, it will be a long time before BiH can claim to be mine-free.
The more optimistic experts say it will take at least ten years to clear the mines and about 40.9m euros per year to fund the effort.
Others warn it could take decades.
Unmarked minefields are a major problem.
In addition, natural phenomena such as landslides and soil erosion can cause the location of mines to shift, creating "walking mines", as people term them.
BiH boasts impressive natural scenery and the potential to become a magnet for tourists.
But the landmine problem is an obstacle.
Outdoor activities such as camping and hiking are limited by the danger.
The former Yugoslav National Army (JNA) was the fourth strongest military force in Europe.
It produced several types of anti-personnel and anti-tank mines.
During the conflicts on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, all parties acquired these dangerous weapons by plundering JNA military depots.
As the conflict progressed, the parties also smuggled in various types of mines from various manufacturers.
Much mine-clearing work has taken place already.
Several firms have taken part, backed by large donations of both money and equipment from several countries.
Nevertheless, BiH remains a high-risk country.
Many of the victims have been children.
Others include loggers, farmers and hunters.
Animals have also tripped mines alongside roads and hunting associations routinely report game being injured by landmines.
Prior to the deaths in March, sappers assigned to the area near Doboj had found and removed 122 landmines.
Efforts have since been suspended.
The European Commission estimates that 67,000 mines and about 650,000 unexploded devices still affect 10,000 localities. A new Mine Action Plan has been adopted for 2009, but its implementation will require continued involvement by the international community.
Court Prohibits Implementation of Law on Aid to ICTY Indictees
The Serbian Constitutional Court has placed a temporary ban on implementation of a controversial law providing aid to those indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 26/04/04

A controversial law offering aid to those indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia was temporarily blocked by the Serbian Constitutional Court earlier this month.
Debate over the legislation almost caused a split in Serbia's ruling coalition.
Constitutional Court President Slobodan Vucetic said the decision did not amount to a final verdict on the measure's constitutionality.
Rather, he said, it was a temporary move that "practically prohibits its implementation".
The Democratic Party of Serbia, the Socialist Party and the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party cast the votes that resulted in the law's passage on 30 March.
The Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights then challenged its constitutionality.
Biljana Kovacevic-Vuco, a spokeswoman for the organisation, welcomed the move by the constitutional court.
"This is a good decision and it serves to buy time until relations within the ruling coalition are harmonised," Kovacevic-Vuco said, noting that Serbian Finance Minister and G17 Plus Vice President Mladjan Dinkic is about to propose a regulation that would amend a part of the law.
The law, she said, presented a "great risk" for the ruling coalition, because G17 Plus cannot accept all of the demands being made by the Socialists.
According to G17 Plus member Ksenija Milivojevic, the party has tried to iron out certain irregularities in the legislation.
"We welcome the decision of the Constitutional Court of Serbia and it is a good thing for the committee to declare its stance concerning the law," she said.
Socialist Party senior official Ivica Dacic criticised the Serbian Constitutional Court but said his party would observe its decision.
Socialist support for the Serbian government was not at risk, he said.
Governments View Indictee Surrenders as Form of ICTY Co-operation
The governments of Serbia-Montenegro and Republika Srpska have begun taking incremental steps towards meeting their obligations to the UN war crimes tribunal.
While reluctant to make arrests, authorities are hoping voluntary surrenders will provide a means of compliance.

The two governments most often vilified for their lack of co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal -- Serbia-Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) Republika Srpska (RS) -- have, in recent weeks, taken baby steps towards meeting their obligations to turn over indictees.
Meeting those obligations, however, has not meant police kicking in doors during late-night raids.
Rather, it has taken the form of voluntary surrenders, such as last week's announcement by former Serbian Army General Momcilo Perisic that he would turn himself in. Perisic, wanted in connection with atrocities committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Kosovo between 1993 and 1998, arrived in The Hague on Monday (7 March).
Authorities view such surrenders as a way to respond to international pressure without destroying their own political futures, said one analyst.
"It is providing them with the least number of enemies, since they do not want to create too many political enemies and endanger their positions and future electoral prospects," said BBC Southeast Europe analyst Gabriel Partos.
At issue is the leverage that the international community -- in the form of the EU, the US government and NATO -- have on BiH and on Serbia-Montenegro.
Serbia faces dual messages from the EU and the United States: Arrest your war crimes indictees or forget about moving closer to the EU or receiving US aid.
Retired General Vladimir Lazarevic, who faces charges of crimes against humanity and of violating the rules and customs of war during the 1998-1999 Kosovo conflict, is now in The Hague after surrendering -- just weeks after Washington suspended $10m in aid to Serbia, saying Belgrade had failed to co-operate with the tribunal.
Washington also withdrew a number of its experts providing technical support to the Serbian government.
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, meanwhile, cancelled a trip to Belgrade, indicating there was nothing new to discuss while indictees were still free in Serbia.
BiH has twice been denied invitations to NATO's Partnership for Peace programme (PfP) over the issue, prompting top international administrator in BiH Paddy Ashdown to sack dozens of RS officials.
That was in response to the entity's failure to arrest a single war crimes suspect since the 1992-1995 conflict ended.
Though the most recent round of sackings in December 2004 prompted the RS prime minister to resign, Ashdown maintains that the entity will be held responsible if BiH is again denied PfP membership in April.
The surrenders of Savo Todorovic and Boban Simic in January to RS police and EU peacekeepers respectively, indicate a way that RS politicians can bow to the pressure without being branded as traitors by their constituents.
"Ideally [RS leaders] would like to have their cake and eat it too -- they want to keep the powers of the entity as much as they can, and they want to avoid being seen as being directly implicated in forcing indictees to go to The Hague by arresting them," Partos said. "They are now offering [indictees] incentives to surrender and encouraging them in every possible way.
It's a sign of remarkable progress in some sense, but it needs to be sealed by actual action."
Serbia-Montenegro Economy Faces Challenges
Economic imbalances are widening and could potentially jeopardise Serbia-Montenegro's economic achievements so far, an IMF delegation has warned, calling on authorities to speed up the privatisation process.
By Davor Konjikusic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 08/03/05
According to the IMF review, restructuring public enterprises and boosting privatisation are crucial challenges the government must meet. [File]
Last month, the IMF mission completed a regular review of its three-year financial arrangement with Serbia-Montenegro.
Agreement was not reached, however, on several key issues, and talks are continuing.
The mission must issue a positive assessment of Serbia's economic policy before the IMF Board of Directors can approve a new credit line worth $190m.
In an official statement, Fund analysts pointed to widening macroeconomic imbalances, which they said are jeopardising the country's earlier achievements.
In particular, the mission said, domestic demand is outpacing GDP, spilling over into Serbia-Montenegro's large external accounts deficit, and fuelling inflation.
Steps taken so far by the government are unlikely to be sufficient, the analysts warned, noting that the imbalances are largely due to slow privatisation and structural problems in state and socially-owned enterprises.
"With the large structural current account deficit leaving little scope for increasing the low share of investments in GDP, sustained economic growth will require redeploying labour and existing capital to more productive usages," according to the mission's statement. "State- and socially-owned enterprises are unlikely to offer the competitive products required for export-led growth, which is the only realistic way of achieving sustained increases in real incomes and employment."
"The government has drafted a plan for accelerating privatisation, and the Fund supports this," explains IMF Belgrade office chief Harold Hichhofer. "But wise and cautious control of demand and wage policy is required.
The majority of salaries in the public sector must not increase more than 7 per cent, except when accompanied by a reduction in the number of employees."
According to Miroslav Miskovic, the president of Delta Holding, the privatisation process so far is unfolding amid considerable chaos.
Unless greater transparency is established, he says, "Capital of unknown origin will be incoming, while our competition in the region is buying companies in Serbia, making investments.
This is positive, but when we attempt to do the same in those countries, we come up against significant barriers."
Economist Miroslav Prokopijevic, meanwhile, says that economic policymakers in Serbia should concentrate this year on two things -- increasing transferred inflation and the exchange rate of the dinar.
Economic growth cannot be based on foreign donations, meagre proceeds from privatisation and cheap credit, Prokopijevic says, warning that inadequate economic policies will become more costly in the future.
This year, he notes, state debt repayments could help push inflation up well beyond the projected 9.1 per cent, possibly reaching as much as 21 per cent.
Outgoing Turkish Cypriot Prime Minister to Run for Presidency
The Republican Turkish Party has officially nominated its leader, Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Talat, as its candidate in next month's Turkish Cypriot presidential election.
Meanwhile, he is expected to head a new government coalition with the Democratic Party.

Turkish Cypriot Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Talat pledged on Monday (7 March) to defend the interests of his community in the international arena, if he wins the 17 April presidential election in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC).
"I take responsibility to present the will of the Turkish Cypriot people to the international community," the leader of the Republican Turkish Party (CTP) told reporters Monday after his party named him as its presidential candidate.
If he wins next month's vote, Talat would replace 81-year-old Rauf Denktash and would then become the TRNC's chief negotiator in any future peace talks with the Greek Cypriots.
Last year, the CTP leader was a vocal supporter of a UN reunification plan for Cyprus, which Denktash strongly opposed.
The effort to end the Mediterranean island's more than 30-year division ended in failure, however, as Greek Cypriots overwhelmingly rejected the plan in an April referendum.
Although the majority of Turkish Cypriots supported the proposed peace deal, only the Greek Cypriots eventually joined the EU on 1 May 2004, as the TRNC is not internationally recognised.
Talat's earlier governing coalition with the Democratic Party (DP) of Serdar Denktash, the son of the incumbent Turkish Cypriot president, collapsed in October.
However, he emerged in a stronger position after leading his party to victory in the TRNC's early parliamentary elections on 20 February.
The CTP won 24 seats in the 50-member parliament, a net gain of seven seats.
With Talat pledging to work for the renewal of peace talks during the campaign, his victory was viewed as an indication of the Turkish Cypriot community's strong support for Cyprus's reunification and EU membership.
Talat, who was given the mandate to form the next Turkish Cypriot government on Friday, is now expected to head a new CTP-DP coalition cabinet.
Under the provisional power-sharing deal reached late Sunday, the CTP would take seven ministerial seats.
Three seats would go to the DP.
The final agreement was to be submitted for ratification to party leaders Monday evening, with finalisation expected on Tuesday.
The list of ministerial nominees would then be submitted to Denktash on Tuesday or Wednesday, according to reports.
Albania, electricity and the way forward
Lack of a reliable power supply not only brings misery to many Albanians, but also deters investors.
With a new director at the helm of the state power corporation, however, prospects may be getting brighter.

Albania's transition to a democratic state has imposed huge sacrifices on the population.
The biggest trouble area, for ordinary people, has been the persistent lack of a stable supply of electricity.
Under the old regime, it was easy to meet demand as people had so few things that required power, the country was even an exporter of energy.
The new Albania is totally different -- since 1990, Albanians have witnessed a steadily worsening electricity situation.
By now, many have come to accept the erratic power supply as a fact of daily life.
Albania is not alone in the region when it comes to energy shortages.
The situation in neighboring Kosovo is no better.
Across the Balkans, countries have been impacted by the closure of Bulgaria's Soviet-era nuclear plants.
Every year, Albanians say the latest winter was the worst ever.
This past winter was extremely difficult, with daily cuts and the constant noise of gas generators running.
However, there may finally be light at the end of the tunnel, although patience is still required.
Albanian Power Corporation's (KESH) new chief, Gjergj Bojaxhi, represents a new generation of leaders, educated and trained in the United States, who have returned to Albania.
He brings a wealth of experience with the World Bank and other private sector financial institutions.
In addition, he previously served as deputy minister in the Ministry of Trade, Economy and Energy.
Plans to open a hydro-power plant are under way. [Gent Shkullaku]
Bojaxhi, 33, joined KESH in March.
He now has one of the most challenging jobs in the country. Failure to deliver has major implications -- elections can be won and lost on the power issue.
He must chart a way forward that will not only bring relief to Albanians, but also reassure foreign investors who worry about Albania's precarious power supply.
So far, the actions taken bode well for both the short and long term, and suggest that Bojaxhi has the creativity and drive to apply multiple solutions on a step-by-step basis.
Albania faces specific disadvantages when it comes to energy production.
It is dependent on hydro power, and therefore on climate conditions.
Albania has experienced less rain than ever, and reservoirs are dry.
As a result, the country can only meet 50% of its electricity needs.
Importing power is always an option, but an expensive one.
As the country is forced to buy electricity abroad, the state budget suffers.
So what is the solution?
According to Bojaxhi, a number of avenues should be pursued.
First, he is focusing on improving efficiency and employee engagement in their work.
He is creating better awareness of Albania's situation through the news media and, most importantly, he has been a highly visible campaigner in the effort to persuade people to pay for the energy they use.
With no plans to privatize production, the focus is on upgrading existing facilities and building new power plants. [Gent Shkullaku]
Some districts of Albania have become notorious for ignoring power bills and sabotaging lines to gain free power.
While Albania's commercial clients have a near perfect record in paying up, individual consumers, especially in parts of northern Albania, have been less enthusiastic.
Around 25% of home consumers are not paying their bills and Bojaxhi intends to cut them off.
He is probably the first KESH director to actually take to the field with staff to deal with the problem.
This is only an initial step.
Long-term solutions, which will enable KESH to have a secure a stable supply of electricity, are also on the table.
For example, the company intends to privatize distribution lines over the next two years.
Bojaxhi believes that private sector control over distribution, with a focus on the bottom line, can only improve things.
A new transmission line -- between Elbasan and Podgorica -- will make imported power more accessible as long as it can be paid for.
Plans for an oil-fired plant in the southern city of Vlora are also in the works.
Feasibility studies for a new hydro-power plant in Bushati in northern Albania are under way.
Smaller projects are also possible on Albania's many rivers.
International donors have already made huge contributions towards improving things.
Meanwhile, some suggest raising prices might encourage people to conserve more.
Bojaxhi says this is not an option right now.
A significant price hike was imposed just over a year ago, and any further increases have a huge social cost for many Albanians.
Price rises, he says, can come later once supply is guaranteed.
With no plans to privatize production, the focus is on upgrading existing facilities and building new power plants.
Bojaxhi accepts that over the next two years, there will still be problems.
Foreign investors, who need steady power, are hoping a permanent solution to the problem -- possibly the most pressing one facing Albania -- is finally within sight.

Tests confirm H5N1 bird flu strain in Croatia
Croatia has become the fifth European country where the presence of the deadly H5N1 bird flu strain has been confirmed.
(CNN, International Herald Tribune - 27/10/05; AP, AFP, FT, VOA, HINA, Xinhua - 26/10/05)

Laboratory tests have confirmed that six dead swans found in a park in eastern Croatia were infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus, officials said Wednesday (26 October).
Croatia thus becomes the fifth European country, along with Britain, Romania, Russia and Turkey, where the lethal strain has been discovered.
The Croatian case was confirmed by the EU reference laboratory for bird flu in Weybridge, Britain, which tested samples from the swans found last week in the nature park of Zdenci.
Experts believe that all the swans flew to Croatia from Hungary as part of the same flock.
Recently, about 1,500 swans have flown to Croatia, along what is described as a major route for migratory birds.
Since the virus was detected, Croatian authorities have culled more than 17,000 birds within 3km of the nature park in a bid to contain the spread of the deadly virus.
Other measures include disinfecting the area and putting the region under quarantine.
The H5N1 bird flu strain has led to over 60 deaths in Asia since 2003.
Most of the victims were poultry farmers directly infected by sick birds.
While it is difficult for humans to contract the virus, experts fear that it might combine with the genes of the common flu and mutate into a form that can easily transmitted from person to person, sparking a flu pandemic.
In continental Europe, the dangerous strain was detected earlier this month in Turkey, Romania and Russia.
On Wednesday, Britain announced its second case in less than a week: this one involving an H5N1-infected parrot imported from South America.
Both birds died while kept in quarantine.
Meanwhile, other European countries, including France, Hungary and Slovenia are awaiting the results of tests to determine whether dead birds found on their territories were infected with this form of bird flu.
Preliminary tests on wild geese found dead in Germany have shown that they carried bird flu; further tests are being conducted to see if it was the H5N1 strain.
Meanwhile, Greece has announced that it will host a conference of health ministers on 19 November to discuss a common action plan against the bird flu threat.
Health Minister Nikitas Kaklamanis said on Wednesday that he has sent invitations to his counterparts from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Moldova, Romania, Serbia-Montenegro and Turkey.
Health ministers from Armenia, Azerbaidjan, Cyprus, Georgia, Russia and Ukraine have been invited as observers.
Women could face military service obligation under new Serbia-Montenegro defence law
Under draft defence legislation put forward in Serbia-Montenegro, women could be called up to receive training and serve in the military reserves.
By Davor Konjikusic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 27/10/05
The draft defence law stipulates that women from ages 19 to 50 could be called up to get "necessary knowledge and training for service during war". [AFP]
In the future, women in Serbia-Montenegro will have an obligation to serve in the military, under a draft defence law proposed by the federal government.
In practice, this does not mean they will be conscripted into the regular army.
But it does mean that women from ages 19 to 50 would be called up to receive "necessary knowledge and training for service during wartime" and might have to serve in the army reserves.
According to the legislation, women who opt for professional military service "will have the right to maternity leave, reduced working hours and other rights associated with child care".
Pregnant woman will not be called up for training, nor will women with children under age ten or whose spouses are already in the service.
The introduction of military obligations for women is only one of several key innovations envisioned in the draft law.
Another is the possiblity of "buying" military service -- that is, paying money instead of actually serving.
Such an option would benefit Serbs living abroad, who find it difficult to interrupt their careers to complete an obligation at home.
The price will be established by the Council of Ministers of Serbia and Montenegro.
"Representatives of our diaspora proposed that military service can be bought for 1,000 euros, whereas in Turkey, payment for military service is 5,000 euros.
The diaspora ministry considers that a realistic price is somewhere in between, hence between 2,000 and 2,500 euros," Serbian Assistant Minister for the Diaspora Aleksandar Cotric told reporters.
However, several NGOs have said they do not view purchasing service as the best way to solve the problem of recruits living abroad.
They argue that such a system unfairly discriminates against those who lack the financial means to buy off their military obligation.
"Many countries have freed their recruits from military service or have simply established some other relationship and have not introduced military service," says Petar Milicevic of the European Bureau for Conscientious Objectors office in Belgrade. "I don't think that it is appropriate to divide recruits into the poor and the rich, even if they live abroad, for it is the same for someone doing volunteer work in some country as earning large amounts of money, and hence being able to buy military service."
The draft law does show a liberalising trend in Serbia-Montenegro with regard to military obligations, Milicevic acknowledges.
"This is indicated by the fact that military service has been reduced to six months.
Service without arms would last 13 months, and according to the current draft law it would also last six months.
We hope that this law will introduce increased liberalisation into military service to the point of discontinuing of military service, where the world trend is professional service," he says.
Bulgaria, Romania get wake-up call from EC
Leaders in Bulgaria and Romania have responded positively to this week's EC progress report, which held open the possibility that both countries could join the bloc on schedule but included pointed warnings about the need to speed up reform.

Earlier this week, the European Commission (EC) released its much-awaited progress reports on Bulgaria and Romania's bids to join the bloc.
The EC concluded that the two countries could still join on 1 January 2007, as planned, but only if they speed up the reform process.
Failure to do so could lead to activation of a safeguard clause allowing for a one-year postponement.
In the document, the EC singled out organised crime and corruption as areas of particular concern and called on Bulgaria to move forward with needed judicial and administrative reforms.
It suggested that Romania -- previously seen as behind in the accesssion process -- may have caught up with its neighbour, which was hampered by a nearly two-month delay in forming a cabinet after the June parliamentary elections.
The cautionary tone of the report was in keeping with predictions.
Many observers -- including the European Parliament's rapporteur for Bulgaria, Geoffrey van Orden -- had anticipated that the EC would note an apparent slowdown in the process, particularly in Bulgaria.
The EC is under a great deal of pressure to be as critical as possible, due to the recent EU Constitution fiasco and budget difficulties, van Orden told Bulgaria's bTV channel earlier this month.
Heeding this week's "wake-up call", officials in both Bucharest and Sofia vowed on Wednesday (26 October) that they would act to implement the EC's recommendations and avoid a postponement of the entry date.
Describing the criticism as objective, Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev said it should be taken as a stimulus for greater efforts.
He voiced hope that the new government would compensate for this summer's delays.
In Romania, EU Integration Minister Anca Boagiu said that the EC report was the "best" one on the country thus far.
Citing the EC's concern about the lack of sentencing in corruption cases, Justice Minister Monica Macovei pledged on Wednesday that all high-level corruption cases would reach court by April.
Release of the report came nearly a month after 18 Bulgarian and 35 Romanian parliamentarians joined the European Parliament (EP) as observers, in what was widely seen as a show of confidence in their accession bids.
The admission had been expected in April, but was delayed over concerns about the two countries' readiness to accede on schedule.
"In this way the Bulgarian and Romanian parliaments will be able to get acquainted with the work, the procedures and the working methods of the EP," the assembly said in a statement. "When both countries then actually join the EU and their peoples elect their fully-fledged members of the European Parliament, they will be able to hit the ground running."
Water shortages in Croatia hurting tourism
Lack of adequate infrastructure is leaving some of Croatia's prime tourist locations without enough water, forcing rationing and driving away visitors.

At the peak of the tourist season, coastal regions of Croatia have been plagued with water shortages.
Rainfall in Dalmatia has been scarce, and the existing water supply systems are not adequate for large settlements, nor capable of handling the growing influx of people.
As a result, water rationing has been implemented in some areas.
The worst situation was on Pag, an island in central Dalmatia.
There, local administrations were at odds with each other over supplying water to island districts.
In one district, water use was curtailed from 11 am to 5 pm, while in another, people continued to water gardens and hose down the streets.
Pag usually attracts tens of thousands of tourists.
But this summer, some have left.
Visitors do not want to pay for an apartment or hotel where they cannot take a shower.
To remedy the situation, the military has started importing water from other Croatian cities.
Officials are now inviting tourists to come back.
As a result, the crisis has been averted -- for now.
Over the long term, the problem will have to be addressed by overhauling the water system.
Otherwise, Croatia can expect shortages and emergency measures each year, not a welcome prospect for a country seeking to develop its tourism industry.
Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader has expressed solidarity with islanders and their guests.
He vowed that Pag would receive government support soon and that a new water supply system will be built.
While it has been common for this part of Croatia to suffer summer water shortages, this has been the most acute yet.
Experts say more planning ahead of the tourist season is needed, rather than simply waiting for the next set of angry tourists and frustrated hotel owners.
Entity Agencies Putting BiH on Tourist Map
Entity tourism agencies are hoping that by joining together to promote BiH, they'll change the country's dubious image abroad, boost the economy and make people here see their own country in a new light.

Suggest Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) to the average person intending to travel in Eastern Europe and they will likely shudder at the mental pictures the country's name conjures up - marketplace bombings, burning villages and busloads of refugees.
But those outdated images are what tourism officials from both entities are working together to change, taking their presentation of BiH on the road to a dozen international tourism fairs during the past year.
"BiH is known as a country that had a difficult war, is destroyed and is unsafe, but the real situation isn't like that," said Federation Tourism Association public relations head Hamzo Ajanovic.
"We've presented a better face, with the intention of changing BiH's image in the world."
The face that the association and the Republika Srpska (RS) Trade and Tourism Ministry are putting forward to the world is that of a unified country shaped by jagged mountains, clean rivers and a stew of different cultures.
It hasn't always been like this, though.
Even two years ago, the entities' tourism agencies were operating separately.
Their first official contacts with each other weren't until 2001, when Willem van Eekelen of the Office of the High Representative (OHR) was struck by the beauty of the countryside between Sarajevo and Jahorina mountain, and decided to speak to the entity tourism agencies about joining and promoting BiH as a whole.
Thus the project "Putting BiH on the Tourist Map" began, with help from the OHR and the Sarajevo Economic Region Development Agency.
Both partners have since withdrawn their formal help, and the two entity offices have taken over, travelling to international tourism fairs and producing promotional materials.
According to Van Eekelen, who works in the OHR's economic department, it's wise to promote BiH's beauty, safety and peace from an economic standpoint as well.
"The simple fact of life is that no one will think of investing in a country unless they have positive associations.
The effect of this goes beyond tourism," he said, flipping through the newest brochure that came out at the beginning of February. "This brochure is like the suit of BiH - it's the first handshake."
Judging from the glossy brochure - with its photos of Kozara and Sutjeska national parks, hikers perched on rocky ridges and the Old World charms of eight BiH towns - it appears that the authorities are leaning more towards eco-tourism than tours for masses of people.
Ajanovic said that BiH has a lot to offer in that regard, including mountain biking, paragliding and rafting the Una, Neretva and Drina rivers.
The country is "an ecologically clean area with natural rarities - that type of tourism really has a serious chance.
We're trying to change the thinking about tourism to one that's ecologically-based, and this is a very important moment for tourism development in BiH," Ajanovic said.
One tour operator who has more than ten years of experience in BiH said that, in his opinion, developing eco-tourism was the best way to go about it.
BiH is a "paradise" for eco-tourism, according to Tim Clancy.
Clancy is a guide and partner in the Sarajevo-based eco-tourism company Green Visions, which organises hikes, rafting and other excursions.
He also wrote the text for the promo brochure and is closely involved with the two entity agencies.
"If I were running the show I'd follow the Ireland model - their tourism isn't big hotels, it's bed and breakfasts."
Ajanovic said the office is also emphasising cultural heritage, such as the world-famous Catholic pilgrimage site at Medjugorje, as well as Islamic and Orthodox monasteries.
Working to promote all of BiH's riches, he said, shows that people here have no problem leaving politics behind and working together.
"One of the results we really value is the integration process in BiH through tourism.
Tourism workers are less burdened by politics. We have a great relationship [with the RS ministry] at our joint presentations at tourism fairs, and we invite the media and in that way we're reducing or ending all the negative things," he said, adding that all the tourist agencies in BiH, whether based in Herzegovina, Sarajevo or RS, only want to show the best of what BiH has to offer.
And perhaps most importantly of all, changing the misguided perceptions that outsiders - whether they are seeking a good campsite or a new market for their products - harbour towards BiH can positively affect how people here see and value their own country.
"The people in BiH also need to change their way of thinking," Ajanovic said.
"It should be clear that the Neretva is beautiful, that it needs to be taken care of.
We're definitely changing this relationship towards nature, so that all people in BiH love their country, like Americans love America, like the French love France.
If we can accomplish that, I'm sure that there'll be more appreciation for this country."
Science and Technology: Archaeologists unearth tomb

Bulgarian archaeologists Nikolay Ovcharov and Hitko Vachev discovered the tomb of a Bulgarian princess, which is believed to date back to the 14th century, buried in the courtyard of the medieval church of St Peter and Pavel in the town of Veliko Tarnovo.
The Greek Education Ministry issued the first group of licenses, which will establish 33 private colleges throughout the country, on Wednesday (July 29th).
The introduction of private colleges in Greece has been controversial, as many members of the academic community and professional organisations think there will be too many colleges in the country.
Restoration experts announced on July 24th that they found a well-preserved mosaic, depicting the face of angel, in the former Byzantine cathedral St. Sophia in Istanbul, as well as other Christian mosaics.
The artefacts were hidden shortly after 1453, when the cathedral was converted to a mosque.
The depiction of human figures is forbidden in Islam; therefore, the mosaics were hidden with plaster.
The World Bank will fund its first smart grid project in Turkey, the institution's Sustainable Development Department announced on July 28th.
Turkey will be among the first countries to benefit from the new $5.2 billion Clean Technology Fund, which provides loans for clean power and energy efficiency.
Greek archaeologists and computer scientists from Princeton University in the United States are working together to restore the frescoes at Akrotiri on the Cyclades island of Santorini as part of a programme called "Grifos" (Riddle).
The two-year-old project has produced a three-dimensional puzzle showing fragments of the frescoes.
Computer scientists developed special software to decode the secrets of the frescoes through finding connections among the fragments.
A team of researchers from the University of Novi Sad in Serbia and the British Antarctic Survey found that the tiny arthropods arctic springtails can survive freezing temperatures by dehydrating themselves.
Their research is the first in-depth molecular study of the species' underlying cold survival mechanism.

Croatia cuts education budget
New budget cuts are forcing parents to dig deeper into their wallets.
By Natasa Radic for Southeast European Times in Zagreb – 13/10/09
Textbooks must be purchased by parents as of this year. [klinifo.hr]
The global financial crisis hit Croatia's schools hard, resulting in a newly imposed tightening of the state budget.
For the first time, parents of primary and secondary school children have to purchase textbooks.
The books were previously state supplied and free of charge.
Depending on the age of a child, parents also spend in the ballpark of 100 to 250 euros per child in additional school expenses.
Only children whose families fall below the poverty level and children of war veterans are excluded from the textbook rule.
"The tax payers again have to pay more than projected because of somebody's bad decisions.
It is not fair that we have to spend extra money for something that was earlier guaranteed by the state," says Sanja Omazic, a shopkeeper from Zadar, and mother of a first grader.
The current recession forced about 550,000 Croatian students to buy textbooks this year.
In an attempt to help each other out, local families organised a second-hand textbook market, where older textbooks from previous school years were available to those in need.
Such unprecedented solidarity yielded tremendous results.
Only parents who could not find the required books started queuing up in front of nearby bookshops.
Textbooks were state subsidised in the past, costing the country about 76m euros annually.
As each new school year allows for a different curriculum, teachers who create the lesson plans decide on the textbooks for that year as well.
Such an approach complicates the process for parents.
Violeta Nikolic, the head of a Rijeka-based elementary school, thinks it is good to have diversity in the school curriculum, and for teachers to have more options in selecting the best textbooks for their classes.
Pero Lucin, a well-known expert on education, disagrees and says if there is a choice for teachers, it should be restricted to only a few per subject.
Meanwhile, free-of-charge sites like www.trebamknjigu.com, which started last July, serve as pools for second hand textbooks, helping to alleviate the current textbook crisis in Croatia.
Romanian-born author wins Nobel Prize for Literature
The author's work about her life under the Ceausescu communist regime was chosen for the prestigious award.

Romanians were exhilarated when the Nobel committee announced on Friday (October 8th) that a Romanian-born German author -- Herta Muller -- was selected as the winner of this year's Nobel Prize for Literature.
Muller was distinguished for her work describing life in Romania during the communist regime of Nicolae Ceausescu.
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences described her as a writer "who, with the concentration of poetry and the frankness of prose, depicts the landscape of the dispossessed".
"I am so surprised that I still cannot believe it," said Muller.
One day after the Nobel committee's announcement, Muller downplayed any link between the prize and the 20-year period since the fall of the Berlin Wall.
"I don't think the prize has something to do with this, but what I wrote has something to do with the communist regime. … In my mind, communism isn't over yet," said Muller.
In her interview with the Nobel committee, Muller explained she is still writing about Romania because "literature is born there where there's the highest degree of emotional charge.
I lived more than 30 years of my life under dictatorship, those were the obstacles I ran into, it wasn't me who looked for those themes, they looked for me."
Muller is better known in Germany than in her native Romania.
Shortly after the Nobel committee's announcement however, the Romanian media rushed to Muller's village of Nitchidorf near Timisoara to learn more about her.
Born in 1953, Muller recalled that her village was entirely inhabited by Germans; she learned Romanian only when she was a teenager.
Her mother was deported by the communist authorities to a labour camp in Ukraine.
Muller passionately described the exile of Romania's Germans to Soviet labour camps in her book "Atemschaukel", released earlier this year.
At university, she joined a German-language authors' circle seeking freedom of speech -- an ideal that ran counter to Romania's communist regime doctrine.
Following Muller's graduation, she worked as translator in an industrial enterprise, but was fired in 1979 after refusing to become an informant for the secret police, Securitate.
Afterwards, Muller was constantly harassed by the regime.
Her debut work, "Niederungen" (Nadirs, 1982), was subjected to communist censorship.
"Criticism over and over again, such destructive criticism that one wonders what is the use of these texts," reads the Securitate agent's report.
Muller left Romania in 1987 when the Causescu regime blocked the publishing of her books.
Since settling in the West, she has won important national and international literary awards, including the Ricarda Huch (1987), the Kleist (1994) and Joseph Breitbach (2003), the Aristeion Prize (1995) and the international IMPAC Dublin Literary Award (1998).
Muller was nominated for the Nobel Prize three times on behalf of Germany since 1999.
"The Oppressive Tango", "The Passport" and "The Appointment" are among her best known books.
This is the third Nobel prize won by a Romanian-born person.
George Emil Palade won a Nobel prize for medicine in 1974 and Elie Wiesel for peace in 1986.
Kostunica says Kosovo more important than EU membership
Serbia will continue to oppose independence for Kosovo even if its EU bid is harmed as a result, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica told a Belgrade daily.

Serbia will not accept independence as a solution to the Kosovo status issue, even if its EU membership bid should suffer as a result, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said in an interview published on Monday (31 July).
"Serbia will reject a solution that takes Kosovo away from Serbia and, very importantly, will continue to consider Kosovo part of its territory," he told the Belgrade daily Danas.
According to Kostunica, some within the international community have suggested that Serbia give up Kosovo for the sake of EU membership.
While entry into the Union requires meeting certain conditions, these do not include "territorial concessions," the prime minister said.
Legally still part of Serbia, Kosovo has been under UN administration since June 1999, when a 78-day NATO intervention ended months of fighting between Kosovo Albanian guerrillas and Serb forces accused of ethnic cleansing in the province.
The 1998-1999 conflict left some 10,000 Kosovo Albanians dead and forced about 800,000 to flee their homes.
Today, there are about 100,000 ethnic Serbs still living in the province, where the ethnic Albanian majority accounts for 90 per cent of its population of 2 million.
UN-led talks to determine Kosovo's final status -- including a high-level meeting on 24 July -- have yet to see a significant breakthrough.
The two sides remain far apart in their positions, with the Kosovo Albanians saying they will accept nothing short of independence and Serbia insisting it will agree only to "substantial autonomy".
Citing Western diplomats, Reuters reported that the major powers involved in the status process see little alternative to independence, with EU and NATO supervision for years to come.
UN Special Envoy Marrti Ahtisaari is said to be planning to brief the UN Security Council on the status negotiations in September.
If an agreement has not been reached, the Security Council could impose a solution.
"Serbia's position will be to reiterate that Kosovo is a part of Serbia," said Kostunica. "This is not empty rhetoric, but a legal and constitutional formulation."
But he distanced himself from a recent statement by Tomislav Nicolic, deputy leader of the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party, who said Serbia should "fight for Kosovo" in the event the province gains independence.
"Serbia so far has reached only for legal arguments, not force," Kostunica said. "That is how it would act in the future."
Serbian Defence Minister Zoran Stankovic said on Monday the army was not preparing for war in response to Kosovo's possible secession.
"We are not thinking about armed conflicts, nor do we intend to prepare the armed forces for active participation in armed conflicts," the minister said during a visit to Novi Sad.
Meanwhile, the next, two-day round of talks on Kosovo is scheduled to begin on 7 August and is expected to focus on local reform and minority rights.
Bucharest Optimistic About Meeting EU Entry Target
Romanian officials are optimistic that the country will be able to wrap up all EU accession preparations in time to meet its 2007 entry target.
(FT - 23/01/04; RFE/RL, Rompres, Evenimentul Zilei, Seeurope, Novinite - 22/01/04; EU - 21/01/04; AFP - 18/01/04)
Senior Romanian officials have voiced confidence that the country will be ready to join the EU in 2007.
Notwithstanding a tight 2004 electoral schedule, government officials insist accession preparations, including wrapping up formal entry talks with Brussels, will be given the highest priority.
"It is total nonsense to suggest that Romania might miss the timetable," Foreign Minister Mircea Geoana told the Financial Times on Thursday (22 January), citing the "tremendous progress" his country has achieved over the last three years.
Romania began official accession talks in February 2000 and is expected to join the Union with its southern neighbour, Bulgaria.
Both countries hope to complete their accession talks with the European Commission (EC) -- the EU's executive body -- by the end of this year.
Romania has so far closed 22 of the 30 negotiating chapters. Bulgaria has closed 26.
Bucharest and Romania will "wrap things up with the current European Commission", whose term ends in October, the Agence France Presse recently quoted Geoana as saying.
His Italian counterpart, Franco Frattini, also appeared optimistic about prospects for the two countries.
He told the Italian Senate on Thursday that both have every chance of completing their negotiations in 2004, signing the accession treaties in 2005 and meeting their EU entry target dates.
Stressing that the two Balkan nations were part of "the same inclusive and irreversible process" of expansion, EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen conveyed a similar message a day earlier.
"Accession negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania have been making considerable progress," he said. Describing the timetable for accession as "realistic", Verheugen called on the countries to "keep up their efforts and the momentum of reforms".
In its latest report on Romania, issued in November, the EC said the country was making economic progress, but did not grant it "functioning market economy" status, a key precondition for EU membership.
The report also listed corruption and the weak implementation of EU-related legislation as areas of particular concern.
Romanian President Ion Iliescu said the country's focus this year is meeting its European and Euro-Atlantic integration objectives.
"I believe that we have amassed enough experience so that the electoral process, campaign and confrontations should not disrupt the normal process," he said.
Winter Storms Cause Deaths, Disruptions in Southeast Europe
Heavy winter storms have claimed dozens of lives and wreaked havoc in some Southeast European countries.
(AFP, Scotsman, Reuters, bTV, Dnevnik - 25/01/04; AP, Novinite - 24/01/04; AFP, BBC, Reuters, Rompres - 23/01/04; Radio B92 - 22/01/04)
Heavy snowfalls, high winds and sub-zero temperatures have caused chaos in parts of Southeast Europe, where dozens of people have reportedly died as a result of the harsh weather.
In Turkey, the death toll from the blizzard-like conditions reached at least eight on Sunday (25 January), when rescuers recovered the bodies of three new victims, including a 13-year-old boy.
Two schoolboys were among five people previously reported to have frozen to death after the storm hit Thursday.
In Istanbul, Turkey's financial centre, 50cm of snow brought business to a halt.
Officials declared a state of alert, closing schools, universities and the stock exchange.
About 9,000 police and municipality personnel were mobilised and rescue teams rushed to help people stranded in their cars.
The closure of the Istanbul stock exchange has caused an estimated 637,000 euros in losses.
"The conditions are equivalent to a disaster," the BBC quoted Istanbul Governor Muammer Guler as saying. "Istanbul is going through a hardship unseen in 50 years."
Extreme currents and low visibility due to the high winds and heavy snow forced the Turkish authorities to close the Bosporus and the Dardanelles, blocking the passage of dozens of oil tankers through the key shipping lanes.
In Bulgaria, authorities temporarily closed the Black Sea port of Varna.
Storms hit the country's northeast and southeast regions the hardest, with dozens of secondary roads closed and traffic disrupted by snowdrifts.
More than 100 villages and towns were reported without power Friday.
Conditions have gradually improved, however, and authorities said Sunday that only six villages still have power problems, while another 12 are awaiting restoration of their power supply.
Romanian officials, meanwhile, said the worst snows in 20 years left tens of thousands without electricity.
On Sunday, the public ministry reported that power had been restored to 300 settlements.
Sea and river transport is returning to normal as Black Sea and Danube River ports resume operations.
Greece was also hit by the bad weather, and a state of emergency was declared on the northern island of Limnos.
In addition, a Greek-owned freighter with 17 crewmembers on board sank in rough waters in the Aegean Sea about 120 nautical miles west of Crete early Friday.
Only two of the crew have reportedly been rescued.
IMF raises red flag on Cyprus' economy
The Fund warns Cyprus to act fast and fend off fears it may need a bailout.

The stagnant Cypriot economy -- weakened by falling revenues, credit ratings and banks exposed to Greek debt woes -- is in need of immediate measures, the IMF warned following an 11-day visit this month.
IMF's Europe Department Assistant Director Erik Jan de Vrijer said the Fund considers the situation concerning.
"The fact that the government can not access capital markets is very serious and the risks to the banking sector compound that," he said.
Amid fears that Cyprus may eventually need a bailout, de Vrijer said the first priority must be containing problems, chief among them, excessive public spending.
The IMF has warned Cyprus not to give in to demands for increased workers' wages but also to freeze benefits, given the flat economic growth forecast for this year and a 1% decline in 2012.
"There is time, and there is opportunity for the government to take decisive action to avert the possibility of these problems getting worse," de Vrijer said.
The Cyprus government, eyeing Greece's downward spiral, has gone beyond cutting salaries and is now reducing the budget for such services as child benefits and student grants.
Facing rising borrowing costs, the government also turned to Russia -- a country with an investment presence in Cyprus -- for a four-year 2.5 billion-euro loan.
The IMF considers that to be of little help because the Cypriot "public finance dilemma" is exacerbated by the munitions explosion last July which knocked out the island's main power station and brought the economy to a temporary standstill.
"The government has set ambitious targets that would deliver a large reduction in the deficit in 2012 and a balanced budget within three years," IMF's mission head Wes McGrew said.
"Reducing the deficit by 7% of GDP in 2011 is needed to halt the rapid increase in public debt," he said.
However, the government will not be able to meet the balanced budget goal while in practice Cypriots will be forced into a more modest lifestyle with fewer social services.
Some domestic analysts like the University of Nicosia's Andreas Theophanous say the situation is not that grave, and caution against a Greek-style austerity that has pushed that country deeper into recession.
"We have the usual problem of public sector spending.
We need new engines of growth.
If you keep representing economic activity with austerity measures ... you make things worse," Theophanous told SETimes.
University of Leicester Financial Economics Professor Panicos Demetriades told SETimes the government's deficit reduction plan is credible, but should be careful not to go overboard.
"The IMF recognises lately that too much austerity delivered too quickly has deleterious effects on growth, which can undermine the success of any deficit reduction plan," Demetriades said.
"Greece's plan failed to fully take into account the negative effects of austerity on growth, government revenues and unemployment," he said.
Both analysts agreed Russia is a bulwark because many Russian companies are based in Cyprus due to a low corporate tax rate and a treaty on double taxation.
"Had we taken the loan on the open market, it would have cost much more," Theophanous said.
"If Cyprus were forced to borrow from the European Financial Stability Fund, there would be pressure from Germany and France to raise the tax rate that will hurt Russian interests and the Cyprus economy," Demetriades said.
Theophanous acknowledged Russia is also promoting its own interests in Cyprus.
"Nobody gives 2.5 billion euros without getting something in return."

Bulgaria, Romania and Greece initiate EU strategy for Balkans
The adoption of European standards, economic projects and genuine regional co-operation are the focus of the proposed strategy.
By Tzvetina Borisova for Southeast European Times -- 26/10/11
It is important that countries from the region maintain their enlargement perspective. [Reuters]
The top diplomats of Bulgaria, Romania and Greece have joined hands to enhance the EU prospects of their neighbours from the Western Balkans, at a time when the bloc is facing the most serious crisis in its history.
"As member states of the EU and neighbouring countries, we are firmly attached to the fulfilment of our common objectives of increased prosperity, stability and security in the area and the whole of Europe," Bulgaria's Nikolai Mladenov, Romania's Teodor Baconschi and Greece's Stavros Lambrinidis stated in a joint letter to EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule and EU Regional Policy Commissioner Johannes Hahn on October 10th.
"It is of crucial importance that the EU is not distracted by other pressing issues," the ministers warned, referring to the financial woes that member states have been experiencing amid the ongoing eurozone crisis.
"A steady progress in the European and Euro-Atlantic integration of the Western Balkan countries is key for avoiding potential prolonged instabilities and uncertainties," they added.
The three countries suggested a strategy focused on three major objectives: adoption of European standards, facilitating the development of European economic projects in the region and genuine regional co-operation.
"What seems particularly important at the time being is how the region could better benefit from the structural and cohesion funds within the EU's new budget," Vesela Cherneva, spokesperson of the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry, told SETimes.
"It is important that countries from the region maintain their enlargement perspective.
In a situation of crisis, this can only be achieved if they observe EU rules and criteria, including the financial ones," she said. "What we can do and have been trying to do for the past year-and-a-half is work for the resolving of the small and specific hurdles to the Western Balkans' EU accession."
In its 2011 strategy paper adopted earlier this month, the European Commission outlined a number of challenges facing the European future of the region.
Among them are the rule of law, including the fight against corruption and organised crime, as well as freedom of expression, reconciliation, regional co-operation and economic growth.
"It is also important that outstanding bilateral issues between Western Balkan countries and neighbouring member states be addressed constructively and solved by the parties concerned," Ana Paduraru, Fule spokesperson, told SETimes.
"Bulgaria, Greece and Romania, as well as other member states neighbouring the Western Balkans are well placed to assist their Balkan peers that aspire to join the EU.
They know well the countries and the region and their own experience in joining the EU is particularly relevant," Paduraru said.
According to Romanian European Parliament Member Victor Bostinaru, vice-chairman of the delegation for relations with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo, "the perspective of joining the EU, as in the case of previous enlargements, plays a key role in speeding up the reform process in all countries concerned."
"The only possibility to win stability, co-operation, and to avoid new crises in the Western Balkans, is to integrate those countries.
Otherwise, instability or disputes of any kind could arise, calling the EU to play a difficult role and to pay a high price," he told SETimes.
Parallel institutions a sticking point in Serbia's EU bid
President Boris Tadic said that Serbia will not abolish its institutions in Kosovo, even though that may cost Belgrade its EU candidate status.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 29/08/11
Belgrade should remove the parallel Serbian institutions from Kosovo, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said during her visit to Belgrade. [Reuters]
Serbia's arrest and extradition of the remaining two ICTY indictees, Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic, raised confidence that the country would obtain EU candidate status by the end of the year.
Officials hoped to also obtain an exact date for the launch of EU membership talks.
Last week's visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, however, has dimmed those expectations.
During her August 22nd trip, Merkel asked the Serbian government to shut down its institutions in Kosovo, which continue to operate in parallel to those of the administration in Pristina.
Belgrade sees its institutions as legitimate and funds them from the state budget.
The structures in question include local self-government, schools and health care institutions.
In comments to the Tanjug news agency on August 25th, President Boris Tadic said his country is committed to joining the bloc, but not at the expense of its interests in Kosovo.
"Serbia will not abandon its people in Kosovo and Metohija.
Serbia will also not give up on EU integration," Tadic said. "If the Serbian or European political public demands that Serbia should choose one, my answer will be that Serbia will not give up on any of its legitimate interests."
He added that the Serbian institutions in Kosovo are legitimate, that many Serbs earned a living through them and that it was not "natural" to shut down schools and health care institutions.
Recent events may lead to a deterioration of relations between Brussels and Belgrade, and Serbia's path to the EU may be frozen, according to analysts.
Faculty of Political Sciences professor Predrag Simic said the latest events could conspicuously downgrade Serbia's relations with the EU, after several years of association.
"Serbia now has to carefully analyse its moves.
The question of how to continue down the road to the EU while also preserving interests in Kosovo is the million dollar question," Simic told SETimes.
Belgrade analyst Dejan Vuk Stankovic also believes the Serbian government will have difficulty making major concessions on Kosovo, because it is facing elections next spring at the latest.
"In its current form, the Serbian government lacks the capacity for a drastic change of policy, because it was elected with the message 'Both the EU and Kosovo'," Stankovic told SETimes.
Serbia faces the risk of being left without both Kosovo and the EU, because Brussels is setting conditions that are not easy to meet, he added.
Tadic's statement also caused a stir among Serbian political parties.
Deputy Prime Minister for European Integration Bozidar Djelic announced he would resign if Belgrade did not become an EU candidate by the end of the year, adding that the authorities had implemented all necessary reforms.
The Liberal Democratic Party, which fervently advocates European integration, warned the government it "has no right" to miss the chance of obtaining EU candidate status.
On the other hand, the opposition Serbian Progressive Party said that parliament must urgently debate the dilemma facing Belgrade.
By announcing the possibility of Serbia not becoming an EU candidate, Tadic had "signed a capitulation of the policy he has been leading over the last few years", the party said.
Albania's Berisha says intelligence law compatible with NATO standards
TIRANA, Albania -- Prime Minister Sali Berisha has confirmed the government's determination to adopt an intelligence law that respects NATO standards.
Berisha met on Thursday (September 30th) with NATO Supreme Allied Commander for Europe James Stavridis, in Tirana.

New Turkish government pledges to speed up EU reforms
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose Justice and Development Party won snap elections on July 22nd, says his government will work to improve political, economic, social and legal standards.

The newly re-elected Justice and Development Party (AKP) has pledged to push ahead with further political and economic reforms meant to speed up Turkey's bid to join the EU.
"Our government views Turkey's EU accession process not only as integration into Europe, but also as a transformation process that will further develop our political, economic, social and legal standards, " Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday (August 31st) during a speech to parliament, unveiling his government's five year programme.
Turkey's alliance with the United States, its NATO membership and its eventual accession to the EU were all complementary elements of the same overall target, the prime minster said.
He also discussed his government's policy of seeking closer relations with Russia and other key states.
"The relations developed with the important actors of Eurasia, such as Russia, China, India and Japan, are not an alternative to the established relationships that Turkey has with the United States and the EU," he said.
Erdogan's presentation followed four months of political tension between the AKP-led government and the military over the choice of Turkey's next president.
A close ally of Erdogan, former Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, took up the post last week.
The largest secular opposition party boycotted the parliamentary vote on Gul's candidacy, and the military reiterated its uneasiness while signaling that it would respect the outcome.
The AKP has its roots in political Islam, and counts key members of now-banned Islamist parties among its ranks.
However, it claims now to be a centre-right party, along the lines of Christian Democratic parties in Europe.
In his five-year programme, Erdogan refrained from including any controversial religious issues.
Instead, he promised further economic development and improved human rights standards.
"The Republic of Turkey is a democratic, secular and social state with rule of law.
These constitutional clauses are non-amendable and they constitute the basic values of our Republic," Erdogan said.
He also promised to draft a new constitution that will "protect individual rights in the most efficient manner and bring basic rights and freedoms in line with universal standards." The government will seek the broadest consensus possible for the new civilian constitution, he added.
Press reports suggest the new draft constitution will uphold the ban on wearing headscarves at universities, while allowing military officials fired because of Islamist connections to appeal.
Possible new wording on civil-military relations would further limit the political influence of the military.
The government's five-year programme will be debated by parliament this week, with a vote of confidence held on Wednesday.
No breakthrough in Kosovo talks
Pristina's delegation reiterated its demand for independence, and the Serb side elaborated on its proposal for broad autonomy.
Both sides agreed that partition is not an option.

The latest round of talks on Kosovo, held Thursday (August 30th) in Vienna, have ended without any major progress towards finding a solution.
However, the two sides did agree that partitioning the province is not an option.
The Kosovo Albanian delegation remained firm in its demand for full independence from Serbia, while the Serbian representatives again offered broad autonomy as an alternative.
"We believe that they understand our position," Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku said as he returned to Pristina. "We shouldn't negotiate about independence, because this is non-negotiable."
The daily Vecernje Novosti, however, said international mediators had listened "with great attention" to Belgrade's autonomy proposal.
According to the daily, the EU-Russia-US "troika" received a more detailed explanation of the proposal, outlining such issues as border control and the arrangement of military forces in the province.
Belgrade and Pristina are also at odds over when the talks should end, and whether these should be the last set of talks.
The Kosovo Albanian side is adamant that December 10th should be the end of the process, with no further delays after that.
By contrast, Serbian chief negotiator Slobodan Samardzic says it is unrealistic to expect a status settlement by then.
Western countries will soon realise the deadline cannot be met, he said, and the discussions will continue.
Similar remarks came from Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic.
Speaking to the daily Vecernje Novosti, he stressed that Serbia and Russia both favour an open-ended process.
Even as Serbia presses it case, however, officials there have acknowledged that the Kosovo Albanians may unilaterally declare independence if the current negotiations do not yield agreement.
At an open government session, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said Serbia, with Russia's help, had managed to "remove the danger" of the UN Security Council adopting a resolution based on former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan for supervised independence.
However, he added, there was still the danger that "the Albanian separatists" would make their own declaration by the end of the year.
Should that happen, Kostunica said, Serbia would take measures against any country that recognised Pristina's move.
"If someone damages you, you must react by causing certain damage as well.
That way you preserve your own integrity and the dignity of the state and every citizen," the prime minister said, declining to reveal what specific action Serbia might take.
On Sunday, however, his Democratic Party of Serbia (DPS) issued a statement suggesting that Serbia could abandon its effort to join NATO.
"Certainly, one of the possible responses that needs to be discussed is a decision by the Serbian parliament that Serbia cannot become a member of NATO," the DPS said.
Serbia is currently a member of the Alliance's Partnership for Peace programme.
While entry into NATO is not a prerequisite for joining the EU, the process of integration has historically followed that sequence.

BiH politicians criticised over lack of police reform
Unless a deal on police reform is reached quickly, Bosnia and Herzegovina's chances of signing a key pre-accession agreement with the Union will be jeopardised, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn warned.
(AP, Reuters, AFP, DPA, RFE/RL - 31/08/07; Office of the High Representative - 30/08/07)
"Without an agreement on police reform in accordance with the EU's principles, the EU is unable to conclude a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said. [Getty Images]
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn voiced regret Friday (August 31st) that a new draft proposal on police reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), a key condition for the country's EU accession progress, has been rejected.
"This has set back Bosnia and Herzegovina's chances of concluding a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA)," the commissioner said in a statement. "Bosnia and Herzegovina now risks falling farther behind its neighbours and ending up last on the road to Europe."
His statement came a day after leaders of the two most influential Bosniak parties -- Haris Silajdzic of the Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina (SBiH) and Sulejman Tihic of the Party for Democratic Action (SDA) -- rejected a new police reform proposal.
They said that the plan, put forward by High Representative Miroslav Lajcak, is not in line with the principles set out by the EU and that it favours Republika Srpska (RS) police structures.
"This is not a police reform, this is legalisation of the ethnically divided police forces," Tihic said. "We cannot accept that."
RS Prime Minister Miroslav Dodik, however, also rejected the proposal as "completely unacceptable" and "unconstitutional".
"His initiative does not back our stance on the police reform and does not represent a compromise solution," Reuters quoted him as saying at a news conference.
In 2005, the EU made clear that it would move to build closer ties with BiH only after the country restructures its police forces in line with European standards.
The European Commission (EC) has laid down three principles aimed at ensuring police efficiency in a country whose two entities -- RS and the Federation of BiH -- have their own police forces.
The EU wants all legislative and budgetary competencies for all police matters to be vested at the state level, that there be no political interference in the operational work of police and that police zones be established on the basis of professional criteria, rather than on ethnicity.
Attempts to reach a deal in the past were blocked mainly by Bosnian Serb parties.
Viewing police reform as a step towards the abolition of RS, they have blocked every proposal for the unification and reorganisation of the country's two forces.
Dismissing claims that his plan violates principles laid down by the EU, Lajcak voiced disappointment Thursday with Silajdzic and Tihic's reaction to his "fair and balanced" proposal.
"There are no losers in this proposal," the high representative said in a statement. "The only winners would be the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, who would benefit from the initialling of BiH's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Union."
Lajcak, who also serves as the EU special representative in BiH, assumed his post in July, pledging to help the country move forward on its EU integration path.
Last month, he warned that although SAA talks were completed in December, the accord will not be signed this year if there is no agreement on police reform by the end of September.
Voicing support for the proposal drawn up by Lajcak in a bid to facilitate a deal, Rehn also insisted that it was in line with the EU principles.
"I strongly encourage all political parties to continue to work constructively with Mr. Lajcak on the basis of his proposal and reach a comprehensive agreement without delay," he said in his statement Friday.

Bulgaria, Turkey Discussing Power Supply Resumption
Turkey suspended Bulgarian electricity imports in April, charging the country had failed to meet its commitments under a power-for-infrastructure agreement.
On Monday, officials from the two countries held marathon talks in Ankara, hoping to break the stalemate.
(BNN, Novinite, Anatolian Agency - 10/06/03; Dow Jones, Mediapool, Dnevnik, Novinite, BTA - 09/06/03)
Bulgarian and Turkish officials have agreed that implementation of a 1998 power-for-infrastructure agreement should continue.
After 12 hours of talks on Monday (9 June), they said negotiations on the concrete parameters of the deal are to resume in ten days.
The Turkish Electricity Trade and Contracting Inc (TETAS) suspended Bulgarian electricity imports on 21 April, alleging that the country had failed to meet its commitments.
Under the agreement, Turkey was to import 33.7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity from Bulgaria, worth about $1.5 billion, over a ten-year period lasting through the end of 2008.
In exchange, Turkish companies were to take part in the construction of the Upper Arda hydropower dam and the Maritsa highway, for $300m and $220m respectively.
Aiming to resolve the stalemate, Bulgarian Energy Minister Milko Kovachev and Regional Development Minister Valentin Tserovski travelled to Ankara on Monday for talks with Turkey's Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, Hilmi Guler, and other officials.
They also met with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and assured him that the problems could be overcome.
Erdogan is said to have urged both delegations to seek solutions as soon as possible, so that implementation of the intergovernmental agreement can continue.
Bulgaria is reportedly willing to discuss changes in the schedule, but not in the overall quantity of agreed power supplies.
According to Kovachev, any change in the price at which Bulgaria sells its electricity to Turkey -- currently 3.5 eurocents per kilowatt hour -- would be reflected in the volume of Bulgarian investment in the two infrastructure projects.
Electricity exports are a key source of revenue for Bulgaria, which received about 250m euros last year from the export of 6.2 billion kilowatt hours to countries in the region.
More than half of the annual exports are to Turkey.
Tserovski said the first step now would be for the electricity companies of the two countries to agree on the specific parameters of future power supplies.
Then negotiations on the infrastructure projects can begin.
Soon after the accord was signed, Ceylan -- the Turkish company that was contracted for the projects -- went bankrupt.
Seeking a replacement to take on the Upper Arda project, Bulgaria has held talks with Italian energy giant Enel.
Ankara, however, insists the project go to a Turkish company.

Watchdog: most nations face serious corruption problem
Greece is perceived as the most corrupt nation within the EU, according to Transparency International's annual index.
Together with Bulgaria and Romania, it is also ranked lower than the three EU candidate countries in the Balkans.
(CNN, Deutsche Welle - 27/10/10; Transparency International, AFP, Reuters, DPA, BBC, Euronews, Euobserver, VOA, RFE/RL, Sofia News Agency, Dnevnik.bg, MIA, Beta, B92 - 26/10/10)
Transparency International released its annual Corruption Perceptions Index in Berlin on Tuesday (October 26th). [AFP]
Trust in the integrity of public institutions in some of the countries worst affected by the global economic downturn has dropped, Transparency International (TI) said on Tuesday (October 26th), as it released its annual Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI).
"With governments committing huge sums to tackle the world's most pressing problems, from the instability of financial markets to climate change and poverty, corruption remains an obstacle to achieving much needed progress," the Berlin-based watchdog noted.
The group measured the degree to which graft is perceived to exist among officials and politicians in 178 countries, on the basis of 13 different expert and business surveys conducted between January 2009 and September 2010.
It viewed the fact that nearly three-quarters of the nations covered in this year's CPI received scores lower than 5.0, on a scale of 0 (perceived to be highly corrupt) to 10 (perceived to have low levels of corruption), as an indication of a serious corruption problem.
"These results signal that significantly greater efforts must go into strengthening governance across the globe," TI Chairman Huguette Labelle said.
Aside from Cyprus, all other Southeast European (SEE) countries, including EU members Romania, Bulgaria and Greece, were listed in that group, irrespective of whether they fared better or worse than last year.
But even Cyprus, which shares 28th place with the United Arab Emirates in the global rankings this year, appears to have lost some ground in the fight against corruption, as its score has dropped to 6.3, down from 6.6 last year.
Public confidence in the integrity of the Greek government continued to decline, hitting a three-year low of 3.5, down from 4.7 in 2008 and 3.8 last year.
Greece's new mark -- the worst for any EU nation -- placed it 78th in the world, along with China, Colombia, Lesotho, Peru, Serbia and Thailand.
Three other EU member states scoring less than 5.0 points this year -- Hungary (4.7), the Czech Republic (4.6) and Italy (3.9) -- were also mentioned among the countries where corruption perceptions had deteriorated notably.
Bulgaria and Romania, which were named the Union's most corrupt nations along with Greece in 2009, based on their CPI marks of 3.8 each, also continued to lose ground.
Romania's new grade of 3.7 placed it 69th in the world, along with Brazil, Cuba and Montenegro, which was rated at 3.9 last year.
After losing a further 0.2 point to score 3.6 this year, Bulgaria now shares the 73rd position in the global table with El Salvador, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago, and Vanuatu.
"Bulgaria's index is going down and this indicates certain disappointment on behalf of the international business, as well as the Bulgarian community with regard to the potential of the current government to push through consistent institutional reforms," Ognyan Minchev, head of the TI chapter in the Balkan nation, told reporters in Sofia on Tuesday.
While the government's stated political will to fight corruption is welcome, there is more that needs to be done for the country to deal with the problems it faces, the Bulgarian political analyst stressed.
The three SEE countries recognised as official EU candidates -- Turkey, Croatia and Macedonia -- each fared better than the other nations in the region, except for Cyprus.
Turkey's unchanged mark of 4.4 placed it 56th in the world, along with Malaysia and Namibia.
Croatia, which also maintained its 2009 score of 4.1, shares 62nd place with Ghana and Samoa.
Macedonia, which was ranked together with Bulgaria, Greece and Romania last year, has improved its grade by 0.3 point since.
The scores given to Albania (3.3) and Bosnia and Herzegovina (3.2) were also slightly higher than those received last year, while Moldova's new mark of 2.9 is 0.4 point lower than the one in 2009.
Kosovo, which was not included in the previous CPI, has been rated at 2.8, making it the region's most corrupt country.
Worldwide, Denmark, New Zealand and Singapore tied for the top spot with scores of 9.3.
At the other end of the global spectrum were Iraq, Afghanistan, Burma and Somalia with marks of 1.5 or less.
Last Yugoslav defence minister gains Russian citizenship
Former Yugoslav Defence Minister Veljko Kadijevic has gained Russian citizenship and is unlikely to face extradition to Croatia, where three separate indictments for his alleged involvement in war crimes during the early phase of the 1991-1995 conflict await him.

Veljko Kadijevic, the last defence minister of the former Yugoslavia, whom Croatian authorities have pursued for alleged involvement in war crimes, has acquired Russian citizenship, a Moscow-based news agency reported on Monday (September 29th).
"I can confirm that General Kadijevic obtained Russian nationality," an anonymous source told RIA Novosti.
A document posted on the Kremlin's website lists the retired general, born in 1925 in Croatia, among 14 people who obtained Russian citizenship by presidential decree on August 13th.
Under Russia's laws, Kadijevic, who obtained refugee status in 2005, had to live in the country for three years to be eligible.
Croatian authorities hold the former minister, who headed the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) at the outset of the 1991-1995 war in Croatia, responsible for alleged involvement in atrocities committed by forces under his command in the early phase of the conflict.
Kadijevic faces three separate indictments in Croatia.
The first one, issued by judicial authorities in the central town of Bjelovar in 1992, charged him with war crimes in the region.
Prosecutors in the eastern towns of Vukovar and Osijek indicted him in 2003 and 2006, respectively.
Vukovar is linked to one of the bloodiest episodes in Croatia's struggle for independence from Yugoslavia.
More than 1,000 civilians died and thousands more fled their homes during the three-month siege and bombardment of the town by Serb forces.
Others indicted by Croatian prosecutors for Vukovar war crimes included former JNA officers Veselin Sljivancanin and Miroslav Radic, rebel Serb leader Mile Mrksic and Vojislav Seselj, the leader of the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party.
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has already charged those four with war crimes.
Goran Hadzic, one of the UN tribunal's two remaining war crimes fugitives, was also among the ten included in the Croatian authorities' 2003 indictment.
Kadijevic's latest indictment came about in May 2006, when the court in Osijek charged him and the ethnic Croatian commander of the Yugoslav Air Force, Zvonimir Jurjevic in the deaths of at least 30 people killed by indiscriminate shelling in eastern Croatia.
It issued an arrest warrant for the two officers, both living outside Croatia.
The Croatian government issued an international arrest warrant for Kadijevic in March 2007.
A few days later, Interpol also included him on its list of wanted criminals.
After it became clear that Kadijevic was living in Russia, the Croatian government requested his extradition.
Russian authorities said they were studying the request.
The prospects of Kadijevic ever facing prosecution in Croatia appear slim now that he is a Russian citizen.
Russia's constitution prohibits the extradition of its nationals.
Italy's Fiat to invest in Serbian auto plant
Italian carmaker Fiat signed a deal Monday to invest in the Zastava auto plant, which observers expect to be a turning point for the country's economy.

The Serbian government and the Italian carmaker Fiat signed a contract on co-operation Monday (September 29th), under which the Italian partner will invest 700m euros in the Zastava auto plant.
Zastava, based in the central Serbian town of Kragujevac, collapsed in the 1990s. Soon after its breakdown, and that of the local economy, Kragujevac became known as Serbia's "valley of hunger".
The joint venture is expected to generate not only a regional but also a nationwide boom.
The contract terms, not yet fully disclosed, foresee state-controlled Zastava and Fiat forming a joint venture, in which the Italians will hold a 67% stake and the government 33%.
The new Fiat Group venture will employ 2,400 workers.
Observers expect the factory to create 5,000 jobs nationwide.
Experts project annual output to be 200,000 to 300,000 cars, with production of two Fiat models kicking off late next year.
Zastava currently manufactures just 12,000 cars per year.
Kragujevac will get a new transport infrastructure, and a large number of Fiat's partners are expected to launch businesses in the town.
On Monday, two Fiat Group members, Iveco and Magneti Marelli, also signed a memorandum with the Serbian government on the production of buses, special vehicles and car components.
Those contracts envision investments worth 240m euros and the opening of two new factories.
After the signing, Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic said he expects the new company to earn annual revenues of around 1 billion euros from car exports and to attract new foreign investors.
Export revenues would be extremely important for Serbia, which this year is seeing a trade deficit of about 6 billion euros.
"The Serbian government will continue to create the best possible environment for other investors as well, in order to boost economic development," Cvetkovic said.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said he hoped the deal with Fiat would raise Serbia's stature in the region and bring it much closer to the EU.
He also met with top state officials in Belgrade, to whom he conveyed support for rapid association with the EU.
"Italy strongly supports the pro-European policy of President [Boris] Tadic.
We agree … that Serbia should join the EU as soon as possible," Frattini said.
Tadic said the deal with Fiat will spur Serbia in every possible way.
"Those who did not believe Fiat would come to Serbia even ten to 15 days ago, who do not believe we will obtain EU membership candidacy and be placed on the so-called white Schengen list, should know that we will do all those things," Tadic said.
Students to get more choice as part of curricular reform in Montenegro
As part of the republic's sweeping overhaul of its education system, all 22 gymnasiums will start implementing new curricula from September 2006 onward.
As opposed to the mostly fixed subject offerings under the old system, the reformed curricula will have two components: a general educational core and electives.
Students will now have the opportunity to exercise some choice in what they study, determining in part the shape of their education.
Proponents say that students will gain a significantly enriched school experience. Learning, they say, is more effective when students are studying material they are truly interested in.

In the past few years, Montenegro has striven for changes: societal, economic, political and also educational.
As part of the republic's sweeping overhaul of its education system, all 22 gymnasiums -- out of a total 48 high schools -- will start implementing new curricula from September 2006 onward.
As opposed to the mostly fixed subject offerings under the old system, the reformed curricula will have two components: a general educational core and electives.
Students will now have the opportunity to exercise some choice in what they study, determining in part the shape of their education.
The term "gymnasium", used in Montenegro, is equivalent to the British sixth form college, the college and lycée in France, and the liceo and gimnasio in Italy.
In the United States, the term "high school" is used instead of "gymnasium", and "secondary school" in place of what Montenegrins refer to as "high schools".
In brief, a gymnasium is a general educational school whose aim is to prepare young people for university and higher education.
Institutions of this type date back to 1326 in Montenegro.
Under the planned overhaul, students gain progressively more control over their studies as they move towards graduation.
In the first grade of the gymnasium, the general educational core will account for 90 per cent of a student's course load, with the rest taken up by electives.
By Grade IV, however, a third of the classes taken by students should be electives.
In the final year, special attention is paid to getting ready to the Matura (final) exams.
The Matura itself is being upgraded to meet international standards and given enhanced significance; in the future, it will enable students to enroll at universities without taking an additional entrance exam, and also facilitate study abroad.
An Examination Centre dealing with the Matura, functioning as an independent institution within the Montenegrin educational system, is in the works.
The choice of electives depends on students’ interests and affinities, their future educational plans, the resources of their local school and the interests of their community, and on the obligation to take the Matura, explains Radovan Ognjanovic, director of the Department for Programmes and Standards at the Bureau for Education Services.
The list of elective subjects is never final; in fact, it will be revised annually.

Overhauling the gymnasium is just one part of an ambitious, across-the-board strategy for educational reform being pursued by the government.
It is based in large part on a guiding document, the Book of Changes of the Education System of the Republic of Montenegro, which was published in 2001 by the ministry of education and science in collaboration with the Open Society Institute.
Under the strategy, reform is to consist of two basic phases: formulation of the new education system, and implementation.
The model of change put forward in the Book of Changes incorporates the general principles of other European education systems -- that is, the principles of democracy, autonomy, equal opportunities, decentralisation, deregulation, and depoliticisation and transparency.
As laid out in the Book, the underlying principles of the education reform in Montenegro are decentralisation of the system, equal opportunities, application of a quality system, development of human resources, lifelong education, flexibility, possibilities of transfer (vertical and horizontal interconnectedness of the system), compatibility of curricula with the level of education, interculturalisation and the gradual introduction of changes.
The Book of Changes also suggests setting up bilingual general gymnasiums in regions with a majority Albanian population.
Also, if approved, it would be possible to organise teaching in a foreign language, with the prior consent of the Ministry of Education and Science.
The reforms will affect students, teachers, principals and administrators alike, and as with all major changes, there are challenges as well as benefits.
Proponents say that students will gain a significantly enriched education. Learning, they say, is more effective when students are studying material they are truly interested in.
Many teachers and principals agree, though some are intimidated by the need to radically overhaul curricula and methods that have been in place throughout their careers.
At the same time, they can look forward to students who are more engaged by learning.
Officials recognise that to make the reforms successful, activities will need to be put in place to help smooth the adjustment process.

Mapping geohazards in the Balkans
Southeast Europe is one of the most earthquake-prone parts of the continent, but so far a cross-regional approach to assessing its geohazards has been lacking.
A new mapping project seeks to change that.
By Betim Muco for Southeast European Times – 05/05/08
The Geohazard Map of the Balkans (Albania, Bulgaria, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Romania) at a scale of 1:1,000,000.
The Balkan Peninsula has the most complicated tectonics in Europe.
Seismic activity has produced a succession of devastating earthquakes in the region, flattening entire villages and costing many lives.
a grant from the US Civilian Research and Development Foundation (CRDF), a small team of specialists from Albania, Bulgaria, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Romania has created a new map illustrating geohazards in their countries.
The project represents the first ever attempt to produce a homogenous, composite geohazard map for the Balkans.
Until now, such work has been carried out separately by various organisations and agencies, often using different methodologies.
But earthquakes and other risks do not respect national boundaries.
Problems such as overcrowding, hasty and poor construction and inadequate preparation are found in many countries.
Experts agree that a cross-regional approach is long overdue.
The new project promises to pave the way for future co-operative efforts.
The first historical documentation regarding earthquakes in the Balkans dates to the 6th century BC.
Many cities and towns have been badly damaged, or in some cases completely destroyed, by quakes over the years.
On average, a 6.3 quake occurs every year in the region.
During the last century alone, more than 80 disastrous quakes were recorded.
What causes such geological restlessness?
The Balkans are affected both by the large lithospheric plates of Eurasia and Africa, as well as smaller units such as the Arabian plate and the Adriatic microplate.
In addition, numerous active tectonic located inland contribute to stress accumulation, which from time to time produces major seismic activity.
As powerful as they may often be, earthquakes are not the only threat.
Landslides are also common.
Other phenomena include liquefaction processes, rockfalls, erosion, land subsidence and expanding soils.
These can also pose risks to the environment, human life and the economy.

While geohazards have long impacted life in the Balkans, recent socioeconomic and political changes make an adequate response even more urgent.
Following the overthrow of communism, most countries in the region embarked on a hasty transition from totalitarianism to democracy.
The abrupt development of a free market economy has given rise to uncontrolled movements of people, hasty construction of housing and facilities, and disproportionate concentrations of people in and around big cities.
Combined with the region's tectonics, these trends point to future catastrophes in the making.
It has become increasingly important to understand, study and map geohazard elements in order to be aware of the damage they could cause.
The new mapping project is innovative in a number of ways.
To begin with, it was made possible through the internet, which enabled teams from different countries to communicate via the web.
The teams also conducted a workshop in Ohrid, Macedonia at the end of March 2007, and held a meeting in Tirana at the end of August the same year.
The mapping also took advantage of GIS technology to achieve both greater breadth and precision.
The result is a state-of-the-art tool which integrates many different data sets in order to give a broad overview of how a geological hazard may impact a community, area, or country.
Cartography and map compilation were carried out by the Albanian Geological Survey, based in Tirana.
The project's most novel contribution, however, may be its attempt to look at the problem regionally.
In the past, organisations in the participating countries have pursued different methods and techniques for collecting, depicting, analyzing and assessing information on geohazards.
Even within the same country, one can encounter surprisingly non-unified techniques and methodologies applied to the same phenomena.
The achievements of the project will not end there.
The authors plan to disseminate their work through different conference activities and make the results available to decision makers and policy planners in the Balkans, by making the map known to the respective geological and environmental authorities.
The information could help the authorities make more effective use of scarce funds.
While preventive efforts have been hampered by the administrative problems and resource shortages characteristic of transition nations, Southeast Europe countries hope the situation will improve -- particularly in the context of EU enlargement.
Three countries -- Bulgaria, Greece and Romania -- are already members of the Union.
The others are at various stages of accession, ranging from formal candidacy to negotiating a Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
A variety of pre-admission and member country programmes exist, offering joint and cross-border projects for improving road infrastructure and facilities.
Serbia Adopts Legislation on War Crimes Trials
Serbian authorities hope a newly-adopted law will facilitate the transfer of war crimes cases from the UN tribunal to Serbian courts.
However, prospects remain clouded by Belgrade's lack of full co-operation with The Hague.

The Serbian legislature on Tuesday (14 December) adopted a law concerning the authority of state bodies in proceedings against war crimes indictees.
The government, which proposed the legislation, hopes it will encourage the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) to hand over a number of cases to Serbian courts.
The new law introduces two major changes to the domestic judicial system.
It allows evidence presented before the ICTY to be used in Serbian courts, and provides for granting witnesses full protection if they come to Serbia to testify.
Witnesses will also be granted a sort of immunity from prosecution in Serbia.
The law guarantees the right of ICTY representatives to attend all phases of proceedings, and to be kept up to date on their progress.
Serbian Justice Minister Zoran Stojkovic said he believed the new law would lift major obstacles to the takeover of cases from the ICTY.
Under the UN court's exit strategy, he noted, the tribunal could transfer to Serbia all processes currently in the investigative and evidence-gathering phases.
Stojkovic also said he expected "a number of cases in which indictments have already been raised to be returned," voicing confidence that the Serbian judiciary can hold trials in accordance with all international standards.
Serbian officials have declined to say which particular cases they expect from the ICTY.
Deputy Justice Minister Branislav Bjelica said that the first might be handed over in early 2005.
"I cannot guess which cases will be given to our courts," he said, while adding that the logical first choice would be the indictment against three former Yugoslav People's Army officers for war crimes in Vukovar in 1991.
Overshadowing the process, however, is the unresolved issue of Belgrade's insufficient co-operation with the tribunal.
In her regular report to the UN Security Council in late November, war crimes chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte sharply criticised Serbian authorities for failing to arrest and extradite indictees -- at least 12 of whom, she said, are hiding in the republic.
The government of Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica was demonstrating "a defiant attitude towards the tribunal -- which also challenges the Security Council," del Ponte charged.
As a result of Belgrade's lax co-operation, Washington no longer backs the processing of war crimes cases in Serbian courts, US Ambassador for War Crimes Issues Pierre-Richard Prosper said following del Ponte's report.
Currently, Serbia's war crimes department is trying lesser-known individuals charged with the murder of Croatian captives near Vukovar in November 1991.
Three high-level indictees in the case -- Veselin Sljivancanin, Miroslav Radic, and Mile Mrksic -- are on trial in The Hague.
In another case, the Belgrade District Court sentenced Sasa Cvjetan to 40 years in prison earlier this year for the murder of Albanian civilians during the 1999 Kosovo conflict.
Ashdown Sacks Officials, Speeds Military Up Reforms After NATO's Rejection of BiH
NATO's second rejection of Bosnia and Herzegovina's attempt to join the Partnership for Peace programme, as well as reports detailing Ratko Mladic's ties to the Bosnian Serb military, have prompted a tough response from High Representative Paddy Ashdown.
By Beth Kampschror for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 17/12/04

Reacting in part to news that one of the region's most wanted war crimes fugitives had been raising toasts to his comrades in a Bosnian Serb military shelter as recently as June, Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) top international official on Thursday (16 December) sacked nine Bosnian Serb officials and ordered the abolition of BiH's two entity defence ministries by next year.
High Representative Paddy Ashdown's measures were prompted by NATO's "no" last week to BiH membership in the Alliance's Partnership for Peace programme.
It was the second time this year that NATO rejected the country over the failure of BiH's Bosnian Serb entity, Republika Srpska (RS), to arrest a single war crimes suspect since the end of the 1992-1995 conflict.
Ashdown noted that if NATO rejects BiH a third time over the same issue in April, he will not only recommend that NATO adopt a "three strikes and you're out" stance towards the country, but he also hinted that he would severely constrain RS.
"I will not hesitate to take measures that deal, directly and powerfully, with the assets and the institutions of the Republika Srpska so far as I am able to do so, and no options are ruled out," he told a news conference in Sarajevo.
Until Thursday, BiH military reforms -- which involve putting its former warring entity militaries under a single, state-level command -- foresaw the slow dissolution of the entity defence ministries over the next three years.
Ashdown announced Thursday that the ministries would instead be abolished by summer or fall 2005.
Thursday's moves came six months after Ashdown sacked 59 Bosnian Serb officials over failing to arrest suspects indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal, and two weeks after press reports based on former Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladic's leaked personnel file showed that Mladic was discharged from the RS Army (VRS) in 2002 -- seven years after the tribunal indicted him for genocide.
It was also recently revealed that Mladic left neighbouring Serbia in June, slipped over the border into BiH and celebrated a holiday at an underground VRS installation near Han Pijesak, in eastern BiH.
"While the [RS] authorities … were telling anyone who would listen of their efforts to apprehend war criminals, members of their own army sat in their own military base, celebrating VRS Day with Ratko Mladic," Ashdown said.
In addition, Ashdown:
Dovetailing with Ashdown's actions was Thursday's announcement by EUFOR peacekeepers that they were inspecting military sites -- including the one near Han Pijesak -- and would close facilities with no legitimate functions.
The US government also announced Thursday that it was imposing travel bans on the leadership of two RS political parties, one of which is led by BiH Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic.
In Tirana, hunger strikes and protests
Albania's Socialist Party leader Edi Rama has delivered on his pledge to bring demonstrators into the streets if the government doesn't open contested ballot boxes.
By Manjola Hala for Southeast European Times in Tirana -- 10/05/10

Since April 30th, crowds of Socialist Party supporters have been gathering every day at 6 pm to support their "heroes".
At least a dozen lawmakers and hundreds of activists have been staging a hunger strike outside the offices of Prime Minister Sali Berisha.
Claiming a lack of transparency, they are demanding that the ballot boxes from the June 2009 general elections be opened.
That will not only resolve questions about the results, but help ensure that future elections are fair and transparent, the protestors say.
During the day, their tents are visited by journalists and handfuls of supporters.
But as afternoon approaches evening, the crowds pick up and the noise level rises.
Doctors are on the scene, visiting the tents and keeping an eye on the hunger strikers' conditions.
The health of some is becoming precarious.
The leader of the Socialists, Edi Rama, has promised that he, too, will join the strike -- though he did not say when.
The protest will help democratise Albania, his party insists.
Berisha's Democrats, meanwhile, say the Socialists are simply putting up one obstacle after another, at the expense of Albania's EU integration prospects -- and the promise of visa liberalisation.
Socialist lawmakers have been boycotting parliament since the June 2009 vote, demanding a recount.
The deadlock has effectively brought government to a standstill, and EU leaders have been urging a solution.
"The EU perspective for Albania is at stake," Spanish Ambassador Manuel Montobbio de Balanz said earlier this year.
Last Thursday, EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele warned that the standoff threatens the country's chances of being granted EU candidate status.
Berisha says he ready to talk with Rama.
He has suggested either bringing the issue before the Supreme Court, or establishing a parliamentary commission to investigate the June vote.
According to the prime minister, the Socialists' demand to have the ballots opened is unlawful.
"In every free country, and in the interest of citizens, even of those who protest, the decisions of the courts may be changed only by other court decisions, not by other instruments," he said.
Nonsense, argue the Socialists, saying the right of citizens to transparency is guaranteed by the constitution.
Moreover, they add, the idea of establishing a parliamentary commission was already raised in March -- only to be rejected by Berisha's Democrats.
"Open the ballot or leave" is their call to Berisha.
The majority in parliament is composed of the Democratic Party and the Socialist Movement for Integration, led by Ilir Meta.
Meta, who serves as deputy prime minister, called last week for his former Socialist Party colleagues to end the strike and choose the path of dialogue.
"All possibilities are there to find a solution ... through respecting laws and the constitution," he said.
NGOs accuse Basescu of pre-election fraud
Four Romanian NGOs say the president is unfairly using a referendum to boost his chances of re-election.

A group of four NGOs -- Transparency International Romania, Asociatia Pro Democratia, The Centre for Juridical Resources and the Media Monitoring Agency -- asked Romania's ombudsman on October 29th to file a complaint in the highest court in the country, asking to dissociate the presidential elections from a referendum on single-chamber parliament, both scheduled for November 22nd.
The four organisations maintain that President Traian Basescu, who has the constitutional right to call a referendum, will appear on electoral posters both for the referendum and the presidential elections -- effectively unlevelling the playing field for the other candidates.
"We are calling on the ombudsman, who has this possibility, to inform the constitutional court concerning the fact that the president, a candidate at the same time, can propose a referendum and also run for a second term on the same day," said Cristian Parvulescu, head of Pro Democratia.
"This seems to ensure the president's supplementary chances.
It is an advantage and we wonder whether the equity in these elections, among the competitors, is respected," he added.
"It is a fraud; I would call it a moral one.
We believe this is a manipulation and a distortion of the electoral speech," said Georgiana Iorgulescu, head of the Centre for Juridical Resources.
"The campaign for the referendum has already started.
Judging by the violence through which he [Basescu] promotes the problem concerning the number of the MPs and the unicameral parliament, we can tell we are witnessing an electoral pre-fraud," said Mircea Toma, head of the Media Monitoring Agency.
Apart from the electoral posters used by Basescu's campaign for the presidential poll, thousands of others, featuring the president's image, have appeared across the country to promote the unicameral legislature.
Some complain the messages on these posters are tough, with slogans like "They won't get away from what they fear the most."
Basescu is pleading for a single chamber parliament, with 300 MPs, down from the current 471 in two houses.
His campaign spokesman, Democrat-Liberal deputy Sever Voinescu, dismissed the NGOs' actions as a "directly political and electoral one" and said the four organisations have thus lost their political neutrality.
He went further and accused the four of overtly serving one of Basescu's competitors in the presidential race.
The organisations also questioned the rationale behind the growing number of polling stations amid a constant decline in the population's interest in the elections.
According to the NGOs, there were 12,000 polling stations in 1990, then 15,000 in 2004, and 21,000 this year.
The European Parliament elections in June, the latest poll organised in Romania, saw a mere 27% turnout.
Balkan countries celebrate winter with customs and traditions
In a region known for its customs and folklore, the winter season is especially rich.

The Balkans, with their diverse and tumultuous historical backgrounds, are arguably one of the last havens in Europe for ethnologists.
In this region, an enormous variety of unique customs can be witnessed firsthand, many of them dating back to times immemorial.
Of all seasons, winter is particularly rich in this regard.
Many winter customs in Romania, for example, can be traced to Roman times.
For example, Christmas carols sometimes invoke Traian, the Roman emperor who conquered Dacia in 106-108 AD.
Others feature the chorus "Leru-I Doamne, ler," which comes from the old Latin words Holeluiah Domine.
Also linked to the Roman era is the "goat tradition".
Surrounded by children and revelers, a carved wooden goat mask is carried on a long pole.
The bearer manipulates the pole to open and close the mouth as he dances, to the accompaniment of flute music.
This tradition, which has variants – featuring different animals -- across the country, is reminiscent of pagan celebrations.
On New Year's Day, children invoke the god of vegetation by blessing family members and neighbours with a bouquet known as the "Sorcova", a symbol of fertility and prosperity.
In return, the children receive cakes, money and other treats.

The same day, young people dress up as ploughmen and join a procession featuring a decorated plough.
Again, this goes back to Roman times, having its origin in a ritual aimed at ensuring protection of crops.
These and other rituals demonstrate the way Romanians have integrated many ancient customs into an Orthodox Christian culture.
In Bulgaria, Ignazhden or St. Ignatius's Day is celebrated on December 20th and marks the beginning of the Christmas and New Year festivities.
According to popular belief, this day is also considered as the start of a new year.
In this context, it is critical that the first person to enter the house on this day is good.
That will ensure that the following 12 months are beneficial for the family.
Nothing is lent out on this day, in order that the family riches will remain in place during the new year.
A key element of the Christmas festivities is the koleduvane ritual.
Dressed up and singing carols, the "koledari" -- the boys and young men that perform the ritual -- go from house to house to wish health, good luck, prosperity and fertility to the heads of households, their families, livestock, land, etc.
Then come the sourvakari, who are key participants in the New Year celebrations.
Going from house to house, they tap people on their backs with cornel twigs, typically decorated with ribbons, yarn, popcorn and fruit, while wishing them health, longevity and success.
However, it is the kukeri (mummers) who are by far the most spectacular performers of a unique Bulgarian traditional ritual.
Wearing costumes and big, scary wooden masks), they perform their magical dance as they tour the village.
The numerous copper and bronze bells of various sizes that are tied to the kukeris' belts produce a loud clang intended to drive away evil and sickness.
The ritual, attributed to Thracian origins, is performed exclusively by men around New Year and before Lent.
It is aimed at scaring away evil spirits, so that the village may enjoy rich crops, health and happiness during the year.
Preparations for Christmas in Macedonia start on January 5th as people gather around the so-called Kolede bonfires drink warm rakija or wine and sing songs.
Bannock bread with a coin kneaded in it is split into pieces and the person that gets the coin in his/her piece of bread is named best man of Kolede Eve.
He then prepares the table with food.
Early in the morning on the next day, children go from door to door, sing carols and announce Jesus's birth.
They receive walnuts, apples, cookies and coins by their hosts.
This day is called Badnik.
Homes are decorated with white oak branches and the family gathers over food.
Again, a bannock bread with a coin is split.
It is believed that the one who gets the coin will have luck throughout the year.
The major Badnik celebration is held outside St. Kliment Ohridski Cathedral Church in Skopje where the Badnik best man hands out warm rakija and oak tree branches.
Christmas is celebrated on the next day, January 7th.
The young visit their elder kin and friends to wish them all the best for the holiday and enjoy a feast.
As a predominantly Catholic country, Croatian national traditions are closely tied to Christian folklore and celebrations.
The festivities start in the first week of December when two patron saints are being celebrated -- Saint Nicolas and Saint Lucy.

Saint Nicolas, whose celebration is on December 6th, brings presents to children and leaves them in red stockings.
Good kids receive candies; while those who misbehaved get warning sticks delivered to them by his assistant, Krampus. On Saint Lucy's celebration day, December 13th, a woman dressed as the saint goes around the neighborhood offering figs, almonds, walnuts and apples.
At homes, families begin celebrating Christmas by planting the miniature hay which symbolizes vitality and fertility.
By Christmas Day, the hay grows and will be presented as the central decoration of the Christmas table.
The bottom of the hay is tied with a red ribbon and in the middle an apple or a candle is placed.
After Christmas, the hay is given to the birds to eat, since it is not supposed to be thrown away.
According to the old beliefs, nothing from a Christmas table should end up in a trash bin but must be given to other living beings.

US, Russia announce new nuclear arms pact
If ratified, the updated Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty could lead to a significant reduction of the two countries' deployed nuclear arsenals.
(FT, RIA Novosti - 28/03/10; AP, Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, VOA, The Sofia Echo, Xinhua - 27/03/10; Reuters, DPA, VOA, SKY News, BBC - 26/03/10)
"We have a vision, a long-term vision, of moving towards a world without nuclear weapons," said US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. [Getty Images]
Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev agreed to an historic arms-control treaty on Friday (March 26th), calling for a substantial reduction of the two countries' deployed nuclear arsenals.
"I'm pleased to announce that after a year of intense negotiations, the United States and Russia have agreed to the most comprehensive arms-control agreement in nearly two decades," Obama said after a telephone conversation with his Russian counterpart.
The two leaders are scheduled to sign the pact on April 8th in Prague.
It will replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), which expired at the end of 2009.
The new accord will take effect after ratification by the US Senate and the Russian Duma.
Once the agreement is ratified, the two countries have seven years to fulfill their commitments.
"With this agreement, the United States and Russia -- the two largest nuclear powers in the world -- also send a clear signal that we intend to lead," Obama told reporters at the White House. "By upholding our own commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), we strengthen our global efforts to stop the spread of these weapons, and to ensure that other nations meet their own responsibilities."
Under the deal, each side would have to reduce the number of operationally deployed long-range nuclear warheads to 1,550, which is 30% lower than the 2,200 currently allowed.
This amounts to a little more than a quarter of the 6,000 warhead limit set in the original START agreement.
Both countries would also be required to bring the number of deployed and non-deployed launchers, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments to 800.
This is down from the 1,600 in the 1991 treaty.
The two countries also agreed to limit the number of deployed intercontinental and submarine-launched ballistic missiles to 700 each.
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said "The steps we are taking add up to something that makes a very clear statement of intent."
Obama said the new START treaty would establish a strong and effective mechanism for verification and monitoring, while maintaining the flexibility his country needs to protect national security and abide by commitments to its allies.
The US president noted that the agreement would help the two countries put behind them the "darkest days of the Cold War".
"When the United States and Russia can co-operate effectively, it advances the mutual interests of our two nations, and the security and prosperity of the wider world," Obama said.
Russia, however, is still cautioning that it could pull out of the deal if the United States goes too far with plans to build a missile defence system in Eastern Europe, to which Moscow is strongly opposed.
"The treaty is being concluded when both sides have corresponding levels of strategic offensive and defensive systems," the Wall Street Journal quoted Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as saying. "Any change of those levels gives each side the right to consider the question of its further participation in reductions of strategic arms."
Friday's agreement, meanwhile, brought praise from top international officials, including UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen and EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton.
In a statement, Ban voiced hope that the agreement "can be ratified without delay so as to allow its expeditious implementation".
Macedonian Eurovision singer has "the power"
Macedonia chose its eleventh Eurovision representative in a razor-thin race, with the public equally divided.

Gjoko Taneski, a 33-year-old singer from Ohrid, will represent Macedonia at the 2010 Eurovision contest in Oslo with "I Have the Power".
Taneski won in a dramatic finish in Skopje's Universal Hall over Vlatko Ilievski's "Happiness".
The popular pop singer Maja Vukicevic came in third with the song "Fame".
Suspense built as the jury announced the winner, prompting strong applause from one half of the audience and frowns sprinkled with some booing from the other.
It was a neck-and-neck race between Taneski and Ilievski in votes from the viewing public.
But a six-person jury ultimately decides and Taneski emerged the victor.
Few would have predicted the outcome.
"Taneski represents a complete surprise this year as his name was not even circulated before the national qualifying contest," long-time music connoisseur and Eurovision enthusiast Aleksandar Hristov told SETimes
The winner could not hide his excitement when the jury made its selection.
"The right song was chosen, and I expect the approval of that choice to be [crowned with] success in Oslo," he said.
Taneski and Ilievski are close friends and -- after greeting the runner-up -- the winner said "God willing, may he win next year." Taneski also expressed thanks to "all those that voted for me, my fans, the jury, and my team, which stood behind me".
To those dissatisfied with the jury's decision, the ebullient Taneski encouraged them to "hear the song again and then understand it is the right one for Eurovision".
"I want to sing in English in Oslo, but the more I hear the song, that much more I like it in Macedonian, so I don't know," he explained.
"What remains is that I maximally prepare for an ever-more convincing appearance in Oslo," he said, and joked that he will work on his fitness.
As part of the show in the Universal Hall before and after the contest, former Eurovision contestant and veteran Macedonian singer Karolina Gocheva held a mini concert.
BiH's Eurovision representative Vukasin Braic and Albania's Juliana Pasha performed as special guests, as did the Macedonian bands Sintezis and Next Time.

Prospects for the region are improving, but Balkan countries still have their work cut out for them to improve fundamental quality of life issues, according to SETimes readers polled in an annual survey.
The poll -- conducted from December 1st of last year through January 15th -- registered a mix of hopeful sentiment and realism about concrete problems.
Most respondents expressed faith in the future of their countries and disagreed that the road ahead is bleak.
The trend was negative when it came to the reliability of the judiciary, while opinions were split regarding the police, government and electoral integrity.
Those polled also seemed divided about their countries' international images.
Over half (51.6%) said they had little or no confidence in the judiciary and courts, while only 24.4% had a favourable view.
The police fared better, with more than a third (38.2%) indicating a high level of trust.
Nearly the same margin (37.2%) expressed low confidence and the rest chose neither positive nor negative.
On the question of national governments, more respondents were doubtful than confident (44.9% to 33.2%), while 21.9% claimed neutrality.
Many (40.8%) gave elections high marks for honesty, but 35.8% saw them as dishonest, and 23.4% were neutral.
Neutral, indeed, was a popular choice for many of the questions, suggesting that readers see the situation in the region as a mixed bag.
A total of 1,115 respondents took part in the survey.
They were a youthful group, with the largest bloc between the ages of 20 and 30. More respondents were 23 years old than any other age group.
More men (63%) participated than women (37%), while the overwhelming majority said they were highly educated, reporting either a college degree or above.
Only about a half indicated they had a full-time job; the rest were either unemployed or working part-time.
In terms of geographic location, the single largest bloc of respondents (34.4%) was from Turkey, followed by Macedonia (12.4%) and Kosovo (10.9%).
Based on the survey answers, SETimes readers tend to be pro-Western in outlook, with a democratic orientation and a strong belief in integration.
Respondents' attitudes towards the EU were overwhelmingly favourable, with 73.4% saying they had a "positive" or "mostly positive" view.
They also saw participation in NATO as crucial.
Asked if the region is becoming more aligned with the West, or with a resurgent Russia, readers (63.6%) generally picked the West.
However, a sizeable bloc (31.8%) said both are important.
By large margins, respondents claimed to be either tolerant or extremely tolerant of other political views, religious creeds and ethnicities, as well as of the opposite gender.
When asked if they have great faith in the future of their country, over half (53%) either agreed or strongly agreed, compared to 24.7% who did not.
At the same time, only 35% felt their country has a positive image abroad, while 39.5% suggested that the world looks upon their country unfavourably. A reported 25.5% had a neutral response.
Greece's growing jobless ranks face benefit cuts, longer lines
The mood among the unemployed is grim – and resigned.
By Andy Dabilis for Southeast European Times in Athens -- 22/03/12

There are 1,033,507 people unemployed in Greece.
If you were unlucky enough to be one of them that was standing in football-field length lines on a chilly March morning -- waiting for a monthly benefit -- it seemed like they were all there.
The jobless rate has hit 21% and is expected to reach 25% by the end of the year.
The lines are going to get longer.
Maria Paissiou, 44, a German language teacher who'd been working for a private school, said she'd been waiting three hours for her number to be called.
Unlike many who said they were angry with the government for the economic crisis gripping Greece, she told SETimes, "It's our mentality … we're all to blame."
Her words echo those of Deputy Prime Minister Theodoros Pangalos, who said all of Greek society is at fault – from politicians who hired hundreds of thousands of needless workers, to those who took the jobs and did little to earn their pay.
Workers from private companies have swollen the ranks so far, victims of a deep recession in which more than 111,000 businesses have closed, including 30-40% of those in the centre of Athens.
About 150,000 public workers will be fired over the next three years.
Many companies have also begun to implement unilateral cuts in wages, with some workers reporting their pay being cut by 33-50% -- more than public workers' salaries have been slashed.
"They've brought us to such despair to accept this little amount of money," said Paissiou, standing just outside the door of a forlorn-looking room where scores of people sat blank-faced waiting for their turn to be called.
On March 16th, the monthly benefit was cut from 461.50 euros to 360 euros to keep pace with 22-32% cuts in the minimum wage, the deepest for those under 25, for whom unemployment is now at 51.5%.
The number of jobless grew by 300,000 in 2011 and is already at 23.5 percent, according to Greece's statistics agency ELSTAT.
It was a doubly difficult day for Babis and Athina Paschos, 34 and 32, as the married couple had both lost their jobs.
He said he'd seen it coming as the store where he worked as a manager, as sales fell so precipitously the past year.
"When a shop has no business and you see it every day, you know …," he said, his voice trailing off.
His wife worked at a children's clothing company for eight years, but lost her job when the workforce was cut from 150 to 40.
The couple is thinking about giving up on their homeland.
"I have a cousin in Canada, in Toronto, in the restaurant business and we're thinking of going there," he said.
They have two children, 5 and 3 years old, and said they are worried they won't find work before the benefits run out in a year.
Alex Afouxenidis, a researcher at the National Centre for Research in Athens, said the situation is more dire than it seems, as some 500,000 people have no income at all amid growing numbers of those whose unemployment benefits have run out.
"Greece doesn't have a viable set of policies … [to] promote growth," he told SETimes.
The General Confederation of Greek Labor warned that "the number of those without a job combined with the reduction in unemployment benefits create an explosive mixture with unpredictable social consequences."
Possible RS referendum on NATO sparks debate
With more than 50% of Republika Srbska citizens opposing NATO membership, the entity opens the possibility of holding a referendum.
By Drazen Remikovic for Southeast European Times in Banja Luka -- 22/03/12
"When the time of the final decision to join NATO comes, we should give people a chance to say in a referendum what they think about it," RS President Milorad Dodik said. [Reuters]
Republika Srpska (RS) President Milorad Dodik reopened the possibility of a referendum in the entity last week -- this time on NATO membership.
Although some say that this is a marketing ploy for the upcoming October elections in BiH, the fact remains that the majority of RS citizens remain negatively inclined towards membership in the Alliance.
"The Serbs had a very negative experience with NATO. Nonetheless, we are determined to work hard at establishing good relations with the Alliance, but we have also determined that when the time of the final decision to join NATO comes, we should give people a chance to say in a referendum what they think about it," Dodik told Sarajevo's TV1 Television on March 14th.
Opposition parties in RS back the entity referendum, while parties from Federation of BiH emphasize that the issue is a state-level matter.
Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) deputy Aleksandra Pandurevic said that the referendum should be set as required by law -- a controversial law that RS adopted in 2010.
"We believe that citizens must decide whether [the entity] will join a military alliance such as NATO, like its done in all democratic and developed countries.
Our attitude is that BiH should be militarily neutral," Pandurevic told SETimes.
Much of the citizens' opposition stems from the NATO action in September 1995, when the alliance bombed the defense systems of the RS Army.
The action was in retaliation for the RS forces bombing of Markale marketplace in Sarajevo, where 68 people were killed.
In addition, from March to June 1999, NATO took military action against the former Yugoslavia after then President Slobodan Milosevic refused to sign the Rambouillet Agreement -- which eventually ended the war in Kosovo.
Slobodan Popovic, vice-president of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) believes that the issue of NATO membership is the state issue.
"[It is in] our strategic interest to do everything in order to be accepted in the Alliance.
I think the story of a referendum is used for the purposes of daily politics since the referendum in the RS has already been announced several times, but has never taken place," Popovic told SETimes.
BiH accepted the Action Plan for NATO membership (MAP) in April 2009, but conditionally, because the status of the country's military property is still unresolved.
Milos Solaja, director of the Center for International Relations in Banja Luka -- an NGO which deals with political analysis -- said that the main political forces in RS has formulated its attitude about NATO with the official position of Serbia, which is distrustful of an alliance.
"If the referendum is held now, NATO would definietly not have support in RS.
However, I think it will take years until BiH finds itself in front of the NATOs doors.
Until then, a lot can change," Solaja told SETimes.
A poll by Banja Luka marketing agency Prime Comunications in November 2011 confirms the distrust of NATO that prevails among the citizens of RS.
Joining NATO is suppored by only 26% of the population, while 55% oppose Alliance membership.
About 19% are undecided.
On the other hand, citizens of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina support idea that BiH should join NATO by 81%, while only 12% are against joining the Alliance.
When it comes to the total score, 59.7% of BiH's population support joining NATO, while 28.8% of citizens oppose the idea.
Every tenth respondent -- or 11.1% -- remain undecided on the issue.
Bojan Vlaski, 27, a lawyer from Banja Luka, said that NATO has taken action against Serbs twice, and therefore BiH should not become a member.
"I fully support the initiative for a referendum and I am sure that the RS citizens will vote against NATO.
It would be totally immoral that RS support the one military alliance [that has] bombed and killed innocent people and civilians," Vlaski told SETimes.
Pristina weighs force to keep Serbia's election from Kosovo
The May 6th election in Serbia – and plans to hold the vote in northern Kosovo – is at issue.
By Muhamet Brajshori for Southeast European Times in Pristina -- 22/03/12
Belgrade said it will operate voting precincts in northern Kosovo on May 6th for Serbia's presidential, municipal and parliamentary elections.

Serbia's plans to include territory in Kosovo in its May 6th election may be met with a show of force and an escalation of the hostilities between the two countries.
But some analysts suggest that Pristina should let the vote occur.
Representatives of four northern Kosovo municipalities announced on Wednesday (March 21st) that they have asked Serbia to hold local elections in Kosovo on May 6th.
They noted that Kosovo Serbs have shown loyalty to Serbia by overwhelmingly denouncing Pristina institutions in a recent non-binding referendum, according to local media reports.
Kosovo Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi said that police are preparing an operational plan to prevent Serbia from organising the vote, and said they will co-ordinate with EULEX and KFOR.
"While Serbia claims [it will] hold elections, we should be ready to react, not just on Election Day. [Kosovo] should use all democratic means … [to] stop the entry of unauthorised persons and materials relating to elections," Rexhepi told Radio Television of Kosovo.
He said that if the Serbian groups try to organize electoral meetings, the peacekeeping forces could not stand idly by.
Serbia says it has a constitutional obligation to hold elections in Kosovo, which declared independence four years ago.
More than 80 nations recognise Kosovo.
Gerard Gallucci, former UN regional administrator for Mitrovica and member of the advisory board of Transconflict, told SETimes that Pristina should hold the elections in Kosovo.
"It would be wiser for Kosovo, and perhaps better for everyone, if Pristina did not obsess over these elections.
It has the option of simply dismissing their legality and importance while standing back and taking the high road," Gallucci said.
He said the elections could be prevented in southern Kosovo, but not in northern Kosovo.
The failed effort to stop the vote would deepen the division and underscore that Pristina has no real influence in the north.
"Certainly the use of force to stop elections in southern Kosovo would most likely succeed.
But it could lead to ugly incidents that would hardly make Kosovo look European.
North of the Ibar River, the use of force would likely again be counterproductive.
It would engender another crisis that would lead to resistance by the local Kosovo Serbs," he said.
Gallucci said the International community likely would not assist Pristina to prevent elections in the north, with the fear of causing a new crisis there.
Kosovo Centre for Governance and Public Policy head Arjeta Demiri told SETimes that the international community has an obligation to assist Pristina.
"It was the international community that has assured Pristina that Serbian elections will not be organised, and if the decision is taken to use police, then Kosovo police must be supported," Demiri said.
She said Pristina has limited ability to prevent elections in northern Kosovo.
"Because of the roadblock and the current situation in the north, it will be difficult to prevent the elections.
Only KFOR has the ability to do that," Demiri said.
International Civilian Office spokesperson Christian Palme told SETimes that although legislation supports Serbia holding parliamentary elections in Kosovo, only Pristina can hold local elections there.
"As the resolution passed by the Assembly of Kosovo on the issue of Serbian elections states, Serbian citizens living in Kosovo -- in accordance with European practice - have the right to vote for parliamentary elections in Serbia.
"As for local elections … the only legitimate local elections in Kosovo are those organized by the government of Kosovo.
The International Steering Group unequivocally called on Serbia [in January] to ensure that its local elections are not extended into Kosovo," Palme said.
Contact Group expects Kosovo status solution in 2006; Annan concerned by delays
The Contact Group said on Tuesday that it expects a solution to the Kosovo status issue to be reached by the end of 2006, stressing that any settlement must promote a multiethnic society in the province and should be acceptable to its people.

UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said he was "seriously concerned that there have been delays or setbacks in most areas" of Kosovo's progress. [AFP]
The Contact Group on the future of Kosovo urged Belgrade and Pristina on Tuesday (31 January) to work constructively towards a settlement to the province's status issue, before the end of this year.
"All possible efforts should be made to achieve a negotiated settlement in the course of 2006," the foreign ministers of the six-nation group -- which includes Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States -- said in a joint statement after talks in London.
Also attending were EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's special envoy for the status talks, Martti Ahtisaari, and UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen.
The ministers urged Belgrade and Pristina to work closely with Ahtisaari in resolving the many difficult issues that must be addressed.
Among them are freedom of movement, links between local communities in Serbia and Kosovo and protection of religious communities and sites.
Decentralisation is expected to be another critical issue.
Direct, UN-mediated negotiations between Serbian and Kosovo Albanian officials were due to begin on 25 January, but were postponed following the death of Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova four days earlier.
The talks are now expected to open in late February.
In November, the Contact Group spelled out a set of guiding principles for a settlement to the status issue, providing inter alia that there should be no return to the pre-1999 situation, no partition of Kosovo, and no union of Kosovo with any part of another country.
Stressing that any solution should be acceptable to the people of Kosovo, the Contact Group reminded Belgrade that "the disastrous policies of the past lie at the heart of the current problems".
The international community stands ready "to support Serbian democratic forces in taking this opportunity to move Serbia forward," the statement said.
But it also called on the Belgrade authorities to fulfil their "repeated pledges" for full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
The Kosovo Albanian leaders should recognise that a multiethnic solution is the only feasible option, said the ministers, warning that those thinking of using violence as a means for achieving their goals would only "undermine their own cause".
Meanwhile, in his latest six-month report to the UN Security Council, Annan voiced concern about Kosovo's slow progress in implementing internationally endorsed standards.
He urged the province's leaders to renew their efforts towards achieving the goals.
Another issue of concern for the UN chief was an "increase in serious security incidents, including of incidents that may have targeted Kosovo Serbs for ethnic reasons" between May and December last year.
The province's leaders and institutions should "work closely with UNMIK to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice," Annan stressed.
Election result complicates Kurdish reform
Prime Minister Erdogan's policy of moderate reform suffered a setback as voters in the southeast shunned his party in local elections, turning to the more radical Democratic Society Party.

Turkey's local elections, held on March 29th, have shaken up the prospects for addressing Kurdish issues.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP), widely seen as linked to the terrorist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), won almost all the major municipalities in the primarily Kurd-populated southeast.
The result was a major blow to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP), which has sought to build support among Kurds for its policies of moderate reform.
The DTP won mayoral positions in the symbolically important city of Diyarbakir, as well as in seven other cities and 50 towns in southeast Turkey -- an increase of four cities and 18 towns from the 2004 local elections.
Erdogan's party had hoped to win 100 municipalities in eastern and southeastern Turkey, giving the prime minister a stronger mandate for his reform programme while isolating and weakening the PKK.
AKP mobilised all its forces in pursuit of a victory. The party recently inaugurated the first Kurdish TV channel, via the public broadcaster TRT.
State officials delivered prizes such as refrigerators and washing machines.
Erdogan himself visited key cities in the region and promised increased investments, jobs and better social services.
The effort, which provoked considerable criticism from the opposition in Turkey, did not yield fruit. The party ended up losing 15% of the vote compared to its 2007 numbers, winning only four mayoral positions.
AKP leaders blamed the PKK.
"It was not possible to carry out a successful campaign in regions where the terrorist PKK has threatened voters and party officials," Turkey's EU chief negotiator, Egemen Bagis, told reporters.
According to Milliyet columnist Taha Akyol, the result amounts to a "strong alarm signal".
The identity politics of the DTP, its radical approach and the feeling of Kurds that they are under pressure were important factors that led to the election results, Akoyol wrote, adding that the outcome will make it more difficult to reach a solution to the Kurdish problem in the near future.
"This is a warning for AKP's nationalist, authoritarian, one-party rule understanding," DTP leader Ahmet Turk said. [Getty Images]
DTP head Ahmet Turk, however, hailed the victory as a triumph of democracy and called on the AKP to change its approach.
"This is a warning for AKP's nationalist, authoritarian, one-party rule understanding.
This is a warning for AKP, for its stalling on EU reforms, for its laying aside the debate on a new constitution and for its limited understanding of democracy, remembering democracy just for itself," Turk said.
The DTP wants radical changes to the Turkish state system -- including a new constitution that would recognise Kurdish autonomy -- and advocates general amnesty for the PKK militants.
Although the party is now on a more confident footing, most analysts do not expect it will win any major concessions from the AKP in the short term.
To date, Erdogan has refused to consider appointing, or even holding a meeting with, any DTP member.
Instead, he has blasted the party for refusing to acknowledge the PKK is a terrorist group and for not condemning its attacks.
Sedat Bozkurt, a senior journalist and Ankara bureau chief for Fox TV, says Erdogan's party fell into a political trap set by the DTP.
"To undermine Kurdish support for the AKP, leaders of the DTP adopted fiercer, radical rhetoric," Bozkurt told Southeast European Times.
"They have made radical demands … leading to harsh rebuttals by Prime Minister Erdogan and AKP leaders.
This tactic served well, again uniting Kurdish voters under the DTP."
According to Bozkurt, the AKP has to address the identity demands of Kurds if it hopes to regain their trust and votes.

Erdogan has long promised a new opening towards the southeast. During a key visit to Diyarbakir in 2005, he promised to recognise "the Kurdish reality", and even suggested a new definition of citizenship.
However, renewed PKK violence in the following months stirred up outrage in Turkey and led to increased political pressure from nationalists.
For years, PKK terrorists have used the mountainous part of northern Iraq as their base for attacks against Turkey.
The bloody insurgency has claimed almost 40,000 lives since 1984.
The DTP leadership is still far from condemning the terrorist group, and still places the burden of finding a peaceful solution on the Turkish government, rather than on the PKK.
Now, all eyes are turned towards a proposed International Kurdish Conference, scheduled for early May in the northern Iraqi city of Arbil.
DTP is planning a meeting of all Kurdish groups from Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran, as well as representatives of the PKK.
Local media have speculated about a possible announcement by the PKK of its conditions to lay down arms.
However, Akyol sees no quick end to PKK terrorism or any solution in the short term.
"What can decrease the ethnic tension in the long term is democratic reform policies that would reflect our respect for the Kurdish identity, as well as social integration policies that would strengthen our unity," he said.
"But in order to achieve this goal, all of us, including the opposition CHP and MHP [need to] make an opening, for the sake of Turkey's future."
Complicating the situation further is the often tense relationship between Turkey's ruling party and the country's military, which sees itself as the guardian of the secular state.
Secularists have clashed with Erodgan and his party over an alleged "Islamist" agenda, while the military has urged a tough line on Kurdish issues.
Turkey's top military commander this week expressed support for the expansion of cultural rights as long as this is done on the basis of Turkish citizenship.
Addressing the War Academy on Tuesday, General Ilker Basbug said problems such as unemployment and lack of opportunity made young Kurds susceptible to the PKK's lure, and that fighting terrorism required a "comprehensive strategy" and possible legal changes.
He ruled out, however, the idea of recognising Kurdish identity in a new constitution, stressing that Turkey is not an ethnicity-based state.
"Turkishness is a generic identity (supra-identity) referring to the all equal citizens of Turkey, regardless of their ethnic background," Basburg said.
Families Help Draft BiH Missing Persons Law
Families of the thousands of missing persons in BiH are helping draft a law that outlines their rights.
By Beth Kampschror for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 23/01/04
Photographs covering the walls of the Sarajevo office of Mothers of Srebrenica and Zepa, an organisation of women who survived the fall of both eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) towns in 1995, show members dedicating memorials, lobbying international officials and attending exhumations.
But there aren't any photographs of what may be their most important project yet -- helping draft a missing persons law with 16 other family associations and the government.
Among other things, the draft law acknowledges their right to know what happened to their loved ones and will grant them compensation.
The idea came from the families themselves, not from the foreign organisations involved.
"The problem is with the governments, not with us.
Every mother, whether she's Serb, Bosniak or Croat, is a part of her son who has been killed or has disappeared," said Munira Subasic, head of the Mothers of Srebrenica and Zepa organisation.
She added that the draft should differentiate between missing civilians and missing soldiers.
The law is important not only because the families lobbied for it, but because it outlines merging the entity groups that conduct exhumations -- the Federation Commission for Missing Persons and the Republika Srpska (RS) Office of Missing Persons -- into a single, state-level organisation.
Such a merger would mean that searching for the missing would no longer depend on ethnicity.
It would also give BiH a tool to solve its enormous missing persons problem on its own. Its estimated about 30,000 people went missing during the 1992 to 1995 war.
Even discussing the merger is only possible because of great changes in the past few years, said Klaudia Kuljuh, a government relations officer at the International Commission for Missing Persons (ICMP), which runs the largest DNA identification project in the world, matching bone samples from mass graves to blood samples given by living relatives.
"I have been dealing with this since 1997, and the difference between 1997 and 2003 is like day and night," she said.
The early days, she said, were marked by a quid pro quo mentality.
If the Federation group wanted to do an exhumation in RS, the RS office would agree only if they were allowed to do one in the Federation.
Kuljuh also mentioned that the entities are now funding the commissions to the tune of hundreds of thousands of convertible marks annually, whereas eight years ago the budget was zero.
And gone are the days when people doing exhumations demanded military escorts when working in the other entity.
"Before, they wouldn't leave the inter-entity boundary line without [NATO peacekeepers] SFOR, but now they're doing fine," she said.
By all accounts, BiH is the first post-war country to create a missing persons law.
ICMP Chief of Staff Gordon Bacon said the law could turn out to be a blueprint for countries like Iraq, where about 300,000 people went missing during Saddam Hussein's 24-year rule.
Bacon seemed optimistic that the law would soon be ready to enter parliament, largely because the BiH Ministry of Human Rights and Refugees has been working hard on it.
"The signs from the government are that they are taking it very seriously," he said. "It's encouraging to get the government to actually do what they say they'll do."
Albania to renovate port of Durres
With the help of international financial institutions, Albania is building a new terminal at its largest port.
By Erlis Selimaj for Southeast European Times in Tirana – 27/11/06
Durres handles roughly 90% of the country's international maritime trade tonnage, and 65% of the country's total export and import trade. [NATO]
The Albanian government on Monday (November 20th) launched a 40m-euro international tender for the construction of a new terminal and other projects at Durres, the country's largest port.
Funding is being provided by the EBRD, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Albanian government.
Work is expected to start at the beginning of next year, and to be completed by 2008.
The new terminal would have an annual capacity of one million passengers.
Meanwhile, two other terminals and the connecting infrastructure are being renovated, along with other improvements to port services -- including the implementation of tight security measures.
"The terminal will create all the conditions for hundreds and thousands of Albanians and tourists to travel to Italy and other countries of Europe through the sea, and for those who enter Albania from the port.
The terminal [provides] the needed perspective for the future," Prime Minister Sali Berisha said.
According to official data, the port was used by 704,000 passengers during 2005, an increase of more than 21,000 passengers year-on-year.
There are five ports in Albania open to international traffic: Durres, Vlora, Saranda, Shengjin and Himara -- with a total average of about 5 million tonnes of cargo annually.
Of these, Durres handles roughly 90% of the country's international maritime trade tonnage, and 65% of the country's total export and import trade.
The government is implementing a master plan for the development of the port -- aiming to improve capacity and efficiency.
A Durres Industrial Park, planned for a location just outside of the city, is being promoted by the EBRD.
The government also has invested state funds to modernise the ports of Vlora, Saranda and Shengjin.
Situated at the western end of Pan-European Transport Corridor VIII, Durres has an essential role to play in the economic development of the country and the Western Balkan region, says EIB.
It is also important for tourism.
Durres is considered Albania's gateway -- not only for the arrival and departure of ships carrying goods, but also for passengers, as it is connected daily with ferries to the Italian ports of Bari and Brindisi.
Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski Killed in Plane Crash
The international community is expressing its shock and grief at the death of Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski, whose plane crashed in southern Bosnia and Herzegovina Thursday morning.

Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski was killed Thursday (26 February) morning when his plane crashed into a mountain in southern Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) in bad weather.
Nine people were reportedly aboard the aircraft, including the Macedonian head of state, several advisers and two pilots.
Officials confirmed there were no survivors.
The crash occurred about 40km from Mostar, where Trajkovski and his delegation were to attend a top-level investment conference.
Bosnian police said they located the wreckage of his twin-engine turboprop near the village of Bitonja.
The region is known for its treacherous winter skies, amid mountains east and north of Croatia's Adriatic port of Dubrovnik. In April 1996, US Commerce Secretary Ron Brown was among 35 people killed when a US Air Force passenger jet crashed in the same area.
An AFP report said those traveling with Trajkovski have been identified as chief press officer Dimka Ilkova Boskovic, advisers Risto Blazevski and Anita Lozanovska, foreign affairs ministry official Mile Krstevski and security officers Ace Bozinovski and Boris Velinovski.
The co-pilot was identified as Branko Ivanovski, but the name of the pilot is not yet known.
The international community reacted with shock and condolences.
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, whose country holds the EU's rotating presidency, described Trajkovski as having "contributed hugely to reconciliation in Macedonia".
Ahern had been scheduled to hold talks Thursday with Macedonian Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski, but the Macedonian delegation -- which was expected to submit its formal EU membership application -- was called back from Dublin following news of the crash.
EU security chief Javier Solana called it "a very tragic day for Macedonia, for all the people of that country but also for many people in Europe."
"President Trajkovski was a great man, a man of passion, a man who moved his country forward, not only the reforms but also to get it as close as possible to Europe," Solana said in a statement.
A lawyer by training, Trajkovski, 47, was elected president in November 1999.
A moderate politician, he was widely respected for his neutral stance in the former Yugoslav republic and his role in averting a possible civil war in 2001.
The president, whose powers were largely ceremonial, presided over NATO-brokered peace talks that led to the Ohrid Agreement, which ended seven months of clashes between government forces and ethnic Albanian rebels.
Mark Laity, a NATO official who served as an adviser to Trajkovski in May 2001, told Reuters he was devastated by the news.
"In 2001 no Macedonian was more important to stopping that country having a civil war," Laity said, describing Trajkovski as a person "who could always be relied on to do the right thing".
Trajkovski, who studied theology in the United States and was an ordained Methodist pastor, was viewed in the West as a young leader with an international outlook and an ability to build contacts abroad.
He is survived by his wife and two children.

Cypriot president says no re-election bid if talks fail
NICOSIA, Cyprus -- President Demetris Christofias told a press conference Thursday (March 18th) that he will not seek re-election if talks to reunify the divided island fail.
Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat have resumed UN-brokered talks aimed at ending decades of division in Cyprus but have made only limited progress so far.
Christofias was elected to a five-year term in 2008, promising to resolve the Cypriot issue. (AP, Worldbulletin, Hurriyet - 18/03/10)
Business Roundup
A review of business and economic news from the Balkans since 3 January.
(Various sources -- 03/01/03 - 10/01/03)
A review of business and economic news from the Balkans since 3 January:
UNDP said its support in 2003 for governmental and economic reforms in Yugoslavia -- soon to be reconstituted as the new joint state of Serbia and Montenegro -- would focus on public administration reform in central government agencies and strengthening the provincial administration of Vojvodina.
Activities will be supported through the Capacity Building Fund.
Turkey's government decided to withdraw its five-year redemption plan for savings in bankrupt banks, saying the burden on the state budget was too heavy.
In 2002 alone, the Turkish state had to pay 8.9 quadrillion liras to its citizens.
Greek Finance and Economy Minister Nikos Christodoulakis announced on 8 January that the state would release non-taxable treasury bills for a total of 2.5 billion euros to finance social activities.
The primary market for government securities, currently limited to commercial banks, will be opened to individual investors.
Bulgarian Finance Minister Milen Velchev and the EU delegation in Bulgaria are expected to sign an agreement on 21 January, providing 240m euros in financing.
Funds will be distributed among seven different projects, including water distribution and road construction.
Bulgaria's Supreme Administrative Court refused on 8 January to consider an appeal by Viva Ventures, the selected buyer for Bulgarian Telecommunications Company.
The company was demanding resumption of the suspended sales procedure for the state telecom.
The Macedonian Bank for Support of Development announced it would secure 63m euros for the government's programme for boosting entrepreneurship and competitiveness.
The World Bank will also contribute, by organising the training of 500 Macedonian managers in foreign companies.
The Macedonian government decided to ask the European Commission for help in settling the dispute over the Skopje-based oil refinery Okta, owned by Hellenic Petroleum.
The controversy stems from a recent court decision to abolish Okta's monopoly status over oil imports in Macedonia.
Telecom Italia International has agreed to resell its 29 per cent interest in the Telekom Srbija mobile phone operator to the government for 195m euros.
Currently, the state owns 51 per cent in the telecom, while the Greek telecom OTE controls the remaining 20 per cent.
Serbia's Privatisation Minister, Aleksandar Vlahovic, announced that privatisation revenue this year is expected to reach 350m euros and at least three times that amount in 2004.
The privatisation programme will be spearheaded by the sales of companies in the oil, tobacco and mobile phone sectors.
The board of creditors of the bankrupt Croatian retail chain Diona announced on 5 January that it would offer the company for sale.
The tender will take place in the beginning of February, at a starting price of around 67m euros.
Romania's government has launched a privatisation procedure for the retail power distribution companies Electrica Banat and Electrica Dobrogea.
The French bank BNP is acting as a consultant in the tenders.
Kosovo tackles asylum
A national aspiration for fast European integration is making Kosovo double its asylum-issuing efforts.

The EU is assisting Kosovo's government in repatriating nationals that unsuccessfully attempted to seek asylum in other countries, and is also improving conditions for new potential asylum seekers to Kosovo.
Although the European Commission is supervising Kosovo's progress on the issue, Khaldoun Sinno, head of the EC Office in Pristina sector for politics, economy and integrations, said that Kosovo has to take over this duty.
"One of the issues that the government has to look at is launching awareness campaigns about traveling to Europe; about what the options are, what the options are not," Sinno said.
The head of the asylum department at the interior ministry, Islam Caka, said that the problem occurred when Serbia, Macedonia and Albania joined the visa liberalisation system with the EU.
This month a new centre for asylum seekers opened near Pristina. An EC donation of 1.5m euros funded the centre, which can accommodate up to 150 people.
The old facility could only shelter 20.
Delayed Tobacco Monopoly Sale May Mar Bulgaria's Investment Image
The on-and-off sale procedure for Bulgarian tobacco monopoly Bulgartabak, which has been marred by legal wrangling, may prevent Sofia's government from meeting this year's privatisation targets and send a warning signal to foreign investors.
By Alina Michailova for Balkan Times in Sofia - 02/12/02
The troubled sale of Bulgaria's tobacco monopoly Bulgartabak, which since September has turned into a high-profile court battle, threatens to hamper the reformist government's privatisation plans and send negative signals to foreign investors.
Failure to complete the sale, which the cabinet of Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg pledged to complete this year, may undermine its efforts to tackle economic reforms agreed under loan deals with major donors -- the IMF and the World Bank.
The sale, which began in March, has an important social impact as well.
A large part of the impoverished ethnic Turkish minority, that makes up around 10 per cent of Bulgaria's population of nearly eight million, make their living in tobacco growing and rely on Bulgartabak to purchase their product.
This is why the ethnic Turk Movement of Rights and Freedoms (MRF), a junior partner in the government, is anxious to see the deal finalised.
The two main opposition parties - the centre-right Union of Democratic Forces and the Socialists - have already demanded the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Nikolay Vassilev, a former London-based financier who leads the government's economic team. In his capacity of economy minister, he is supervising the sale.
Bulgartabak's sale attracted four offers.
In August, the Privatisation Agency selected a consortium of Sofia-registered Tobacco Capital Partners and Dutch firm Clar Innis as an exclusive buyer.
The consortium, backed by Germany's Deutsche Bank, offered 110 million euros for a stake of 80 per cent.
The other three candidates - Russia's Metatabak consortium, Vienna-registered consortium Tobacco Holding GmbH and Russia's Rosbulgartabak - appealed the sale procedure in the Supreme Court, arguing the Privatisation Agency acted illegally when it failed to allow them to sweeten their final offers after ranking the bids.
The Supreme Court ruled in their favour, saying the agency should have sought improved offers due to better-than-expected financial results reported by the company during the sale process.
The court also annulled the agency's decision to name the Deutsche Bank-backed candidate as exclusive buyer.
The Privatisation Agency insists its sale procedure was fair and denies wrongdoing.
In the latest twist of the legal battle, the agency is appealing the ruling before an extended Supreme Court panel, whose decision is final.
It would either uphold the lower court ruling or grant the appeal and allow talks finalising the sale with the selected buyer.
It might also order a new sale procedure.
The court said Friday (29 November) that it would issue its decision at the end of December.
If the sale is further delayed, the government is unlikely to realise the $300m privatisation revenue planned for 2002.
Government officials say the state budget would not be affected, as the country has ample fiscal reserves.
But Saxe-Coburg has warned that the troubles surrounding this sale may affect Bulgaria's investment image.
Bologna Process hits stumbling blocks in Montenegro
Understaffing remains a huge problem, as Montenegro implements the pan-European Bologna Process.

Montenegro's attempts to reform its educational system by integrating the pan-European Bologna Process are plagued with problems, according to one of the country's most outspoken citizens.
"The main principles of the Bologna Process are great, but if applied under the current conditions they will only result in Frankenstein," University of Montenegro political science professor Milan Popovic told Southeast European Times.
According to the European Commission website, "the three priorities of the Bologna Process are: Introduction of the three-cycle system (bachelor/master/doctorate), quality assurance and recognition of qualifications and periods of study."
"Bologna must be implemented in realistic conditions.
We are understaffed and don't have enough space," Popovic said.
"It is normal for one professor to have 30 students [per class].
This number can even go up to 50, and I can even handle 100 students.
However, one professor with 300 students is extremely difficult.
It's a crime against education," said Popovic.
Dragan Koprivica, a professor at the Faculty of Philosophy in Niksic, agrees that it is very difficult for a professor to "make contact with 300 or 500 students and give them all a lot of attention".
"It has become easier for students," said Koprivica. "There are one semester subjects, instead of two or even four-semester.
Students also have tests during the semester, although that can be almost impossible for a professor."
Montenegro has been a member of Bologna Process since 2003.
Before Bologna was introduced in Montenegro, students took only one exam per course, per year, usually an oral final.
There were no other tests during the school year.
Bologna changed that; now some students don't even need to take the final exam.
"I think that is a good thing; if a student works hard and collects enough points during the semester, he can pass the subject without taking the final exam," said Koprivica.
Popovic agrees that a student should be able to collect points during the semester, but he believes that in some colleges, an oral final is a must.
"Students in the political science college will need to speak in their future jobs.
It is wrong not to teach them how to speak and not to grade them through oral exams," he said.
A recent graduate from the University of Montenegro's International Relations Programme, Milena Miskovic, agrees.
"I like the idea of Bologna.
It gave us a chance to work for our grade throughout the year.
Bologna has resulted in an improved graduation rate."
Nemanja Djuraskovic, a current student of the University of Montenegro's Economy programme is not completely on board. "[Bologna] requires a lot of work; I have to study every day, so it is taking a lot of my time.
However, that can also be a good thing, because I am never behind in my studies."
Military Reform Under Way in Croatia
The Croatian government has announced decisive measures meant to jumpstart the process of reforming the country's military.
By Miranda Novak for Southeast European Times in Zagreb - 14/04/04
Following a NATO team's recent inspection of the Croatian armed forces, the government of Prime Minister Ivo Sanader has called for decisive measures, including the accelerated phasing out of four army corps and a reduction of guard brigades from four to two.
With these and other measures, the government hopes to speed up the process of reforming its military to meet NATO standards.
Also planned is a steep decline in the number of armed forces members and defence ministry employees, from the current 40,000 to 19,500 by 2006.
Instead of the current division of the three military branches -- air force, ground troops and navy -- under different commands, a single command unit is envisioned.
In addition, authorities have responded to a NATO request by deciding to establish a special command operations unit whose principal task would be to prepare Croatian soldiers for peacekeeping missions.
Croatian authorities have indicated that transformation of the air force is in the works, and consideration is being given to discontinuing the navy.
The defence ministry has vetoed the idea of purchasing new fighter aircraft and undertaking the expensive task of modernising existing aircraft.
Fighter and transport helicopters have become a priority for the air force because of their flexibility.
They can be used effectively both for military and peacekeeping purposes.
Up until now, military analysts say, bureaucratic obstacles have slowed the military reform process.
Key figures in charge of transforming the Croatian Army, which was created from remnants of the old Yugoslav People's Army, have been faulted for not moving the process along fast enough.
NATO's inspection team concluded that the country's military is outdated in terms of approach, with an excessive number of corps and command units.
Croatia's challenge, the inspectors said, is to make the transition from a territorial defence approach to a collective defence approach.
Without such change, Croatia will encounter a roadblock on its path towards full NATO membership.
Visegrad Group backs Western Balkan countries' EU integration
"The Visegrad Group stands ready to promote the integration of the countries of the Western Balkans," the foreign ministers said in a statement.
(MTI - 07/10/09; AFP, Budapest Times, MTI, TASR, The Slovak Spectator, MRT, Hungarian Foreign Ministry - 06/10/09)
[V4]
The Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, known as the Visegrad Group, voiced their support for the Euro-Atlantic integration of the Western Balkan countries, during a meeting of their foreign ministers in Budapest on Tuesday (October 6th).
"Euro-Atlantic integration played a crucial role in the transformation of Central Europe," the ministers said in a joint statement after the talks, adding that they "wish to see the enlargement policy fostering stability and prosperity in the same manner in the Western Balkans".
The Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, known also as the Visegrad Four (V4), joined the EU in 2004, along with six other East and Central European nations, and all are members of NATO.
Hungary, which currently chairs the V4, is due to take over the six-month rotating EU presidency from Belgium on January 1st 2011 and pass it on to Poland on July 1st the same year.
Sweden, whose six-month turn at the helm of the bloc ends on January 1st 2010, will be replaced by Spain.
"The Visegrad Group stands ready to promote the integration of the countries of the Western Balkans throughout the next presidencies of the EU, including the handling of their membership applications," the foreign ministers said in the statement.
But they also stressed that the applicant countries' accession progress is in their own hands and depends on their efforts in implementing EU-required reforms.
"Only a positive avis, including a satisfactory track record in implementing Stabilisation and Association Agreements, would speed up the integration process," the ministers said.
The Western Balkan countries, they added, should keep this in mind in considering when to submit their official EU membership applications.
The top diplomats of the four former communist states also promised to assist the EU hopefuls in preparing for eventual entry into the bloc.
"The Visegrad countries offer their help and recent expertise in drawing-up and implementing integration strategies, including the effective utilisation of pre-accession funds provided by the EU," the statement read.
The Western Balkan countries -- Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia -- are all in different stages of the accession process.
Croatia, the most advanced among them, is expected to join the EU in 2011.
This, the V4 foreign ministers believe, "will give further impetus to the process of integration and encouragement to the applicant countries to carry out reforms".
Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia will come a step closer to the EU in just a few months, as their citizens will be able to travel visa-free to the bloc's member nations as of January 1st.
That is "a testament to the fact that efforts made for meeting the conditions bring tangible results", the foreign ministers said.
Citing Serbia's improved co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the V4 also voiced support for the speedy enforcement of the EU's provisional trade agreement with Belgrade.
They also urged all political parties in BiH to work together to meet the requirements for the transition from the Office of the High Representative (OHR) to the EU Special Representative (EUSR).
"V4 countries support the continuous presence of EUFOR in BiH and recommend maintaining its current mandate until the OHR-EUSR transition is completed," the statement said. "They highlight the importance of reforming the constitution and reaffirm that only Bosnia and Herzegovina as a whole has the perspective of EU membership."
The V4 foreign ministers concluded their meeting Tuesday with an informal working lunch with their counterparts from Albania, BiH, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia.
Cyprus Impasse Complicates EU Enlargement, Turkey's Accession
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash (right) shakes hands with Greek Cypriot President-elect Tassos Papadopoulos as outgoing Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides looks on, following their meeting in the UN buffer zone separating the Greek and Turkish-held sides in Nicosia 28 February. [AFP] The future of divided Cyprus, and the country's EU accession, is up in the air now that the latest round of talks has failed.
By Robert Herschbach for Southeast European Times - 24/03/03
The failure of the Cyprus peace process earlier this month brought an abrupt halt to what had been widely heralded as an unprecedented opportunity to reach a breakthrough on the future of the divided island.
With the Greek part of Cyprus set to sign the EU accession treaty in April, and with Turkey's own EU hopes on the line, circumstances for an agreement, many believed, could not have been better.
Turkish Cypriots gather during a demonstration for peace on the Turkish side of Nicosia 27 February. [AFP] Turkish Cypriots -- cut off from the international community, and mired in economic stagnation -- are anxious to join the EU along with their neighbors to the south. In a series of demonstrations recalling Berlin in 1989, a third of the enclave's population took to the streets, conveying their desire to join Europe, and venting frustration with their longtime leader, Rauf Denktash.
Turkey, which maintains 40,000 troops in the north, also had incentives to push for a solution.
Its military presence on the island could create a legal quagmire once the Greek part of Cyprus enters the Union.
In January, ruling Justice and Development Party leader and current Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for a radical change in his country's policy on Cyprus and for the resumption of talks.
Glafcos Clerides, the longtime representative of the Greek Cypriot community, hoped to cap his career with a reunification deal.
A breakthrough would also have stood as a key achievement of Kofi Annan's often troubled tenure as UN Secretary General. The Turkish government has backed the plan Annan proposed.
Yet the barriers that have prevented a settlement for decades have proved hard to budge.
A UN deadline -- originally set for 28 February, and later extended to 10 March -- has passed.Clerides is out of office, replaced by Tassos Papadopoulos.
A disappointed Annan has told his special envoy, Alvaro De Soto, to close up shop and depart.
The victor, at least in the short term, seems to have been Denktash, who greeted the latest impasse with relief.
Turkish Cypriots were the victims of a "game" designed to deceive them, Denktash said.
The plan sponsored by Annan was modeled loosely on the Swiss federation.
It would have established two self-governing states, a common federal state, and a bicameral parliament.In the Chamber of Deputies, both states would have been represented in proportion to their population, while in the Senate each state would have equal representation.The plan envisaged a revolving presidency.
Territorial concessions, along with the resettlement of Greek Cypriots displaced by the 1974 military invasion, were among the major stumbling blocks.
In a dramatic last-ditch effort, the UN Secretary General invited Greek and Turkish leaders to The Hague, hoping to persuade them to hold simultaneous referenda on 30 March, so that a united Cyprus could sign the EU accession treaty on 16 April.
Newly-elected Greek Cypriot leader Papadopoulos said yes, with some reservations. Denktash refused.
Announcing that the process had reached the end of the road, Annan said that he felt a "deep sense of sadness".
"I am not sure another opportunity like this one will present itself again any time soon," he said, adding that he regretted Cypriots "have been denied the chance to decide their own future".
US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher echoed Annan's remarks.
"We find it very regrettable that Denktash has denied Turkish Cypriots the opportunity to determine their own future and to [vote] on such a fundamental issue," Boucher said.
The immediate impact of the failure is that, barring unexpected last-minute developments, Greek Cypriots alone will sign the treaty.European Commission spokesman Jean-Christophe Filori confirmed on 11 March that the enlargement timetable will go ahead as planned and that the EU treaty will be "signed by Cyprus as we know it today".
Speaking on behalf of EU enlargement commissioner Gunter Verheugen, Filiori also warned Turkey that it would be "well advised" to consider the implications for its EU prospects, adding that it would be "difficult to imagine starting negotiations" to admit Turkey while the island remains divided.
"If by the end of 2004, there is still no settlement on Cyprus, we will be facing this rather weird situation where a candidate country knocking at the door does not recognise one of our own member states," he said.
But if Greek Cypriots join the EU without their compatriots to the north, a solution could become even more elusive.
Disillusioned Turkish Cypriots are likely to "vote with their feet," continuing a pattern of emigration that is radically altering the demographics of northern Cyprus.
As the locals leave, they are being replaced by settlers brought in from even more impoverished parts of Anatolia -- part of an ongoing programme of "Turkification".
Turkey has openly hinted at the possibility of annexing the north -- a move that would almost certainly spell the end of its EU chances.
But if Turkish leaders conclude that those chances are bleak anyway, they could decide to cut their losses.
Some have voiced doubts about Annan's plan. [AFP] While many Turkish Cypriots have been vocally in favor of an agreement, Denktash has the backing of Turkey's influential military, and is popular on the mainland.
Furthermore, affluent mainland Turks who have bought or rented resort properties on Cyprus could stand to lose them in a reunification deal.
Greek Cypriots, too, have harbored doubts about the Annan plan - doubts which they voiced during the elections that ousted Clerides.The proposal would have placed limits on the number of returning refugees and their right to reclaim property.
An amended draft would have also restricted them from voting as members of the Turkish Cypriot constituent state.
Adjacent to Turkey, the Mediterranean, North Africa and the Middle East, Cyprus has been a major trading center --as well as a site of geopolitical intrigue - since ancient times.
The Ottoman Turks wrested control of the island from the Venetians in 1573, and maintained their rule until the late 19th century, when Britain took over administration of the island, later annexing it.
It became an independent republic in 1959.
Riots and interethnic fighting forced the de facto separation of its Turkish and Greek communities and the formation of a provisional Turkish administration.
Bicommunal talks were held between Clerides and Dentkash, who had emerged as the main representatives of their respective sides.
Turkish Cypriots demanded a bi-zonal federation, a solution rejected by the Greek Cypriots, and negotiations struggled along without result.
Events came to a head, however, in 1974 when officers from mainland Greece -- then ruled by a military junta -- led the Cypriot National Guard in a coup intended to establish enosis, or union. Turkish forces then invaded the island, eventually occupying 37 per cent of its territory.
UN-sponsored talks started in 1976 and have continued on and off since then.
But the EU's decision, at the Copenhagen summit in 2002, to accept the Greek part of Cyprus was seen as a catalyst likely to spur progress.

UNMIK Offers Reward for Information on Murdered UN Police Officer
Top international officials condemned the killing and called for all sides to co-operate in investigations.
The Sunday night ambush was the first fatal attack against the UN police force since it arrived in Kosovo in June 1999.
(Independent - 06/08/03; AFP, Reuters, CNN, UN, KFOR - 05/08/03)
UNMIK offered a 50,000 euro reward Tuesday (5 August) for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the killers of a UN police officer.
Major Satish Menon, an Indian national, was murdered in an ambush on Sunday night, becoming the first UN police officer to die in the line of duty in Kosovo.
Condemning the attack, top international officials have called on all sides to co-operate in investigations into the slaying.
"Let me be perfectly clear -- this was a cold-blooded and deliberate killing of an officer who had no chance to defend himself," UN Police Commissioner Stefan Feller said Tuesday, as he announced the reward.
"Major Menon did not die due to his interrupting a crime. He died because he was a police officer -- a symbol of hope.
He was a target to people opposed to freedom. He died serving the people of Kosovo."
Shortly before midnight on Sunday, Menon, 43, and a British officer slowed their patrol car due to rocks on the road between Leposavic and Mitrovica and came under gunfire from concealed gunmen.
"Multiple shots were fired into the passenger seat.
Satish Menon was struck and killed instantly," Feller said.
The British officer, who was driving the car, was not hurt.
In a statement on Tuesday, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan condemned the "appalling act", saying that those who committed this "brutal murder" must face justice.
"The Secretary General is shocked and outraged at the killing of a UN police officer in an attack on a police vehicle in the northern part of Kosovo," the statement issued by a UN spokesman said.
"He strongly condemns this appalling act and appeals to all concerned to co-operate with UNMIK in carrying out the investigation into the circumstances of this brutal murder. The guilty must be brought to justice," the statement added.
The shooting was the first fatal attack against the UN police force since its arrival in Kosovo in June 1999 to maintain order in the province.
Annan sent his condolences to Menon's family and the government of India.
Echoing Annan's words, KFOR said it considers any attack on UNMIK, the police or judicial system as an attack on KFOR and the international community.
"Such acts undermine all the progress and good work to date; they are attacks on Kosovo as well," KFOR said in a statement, pledging its full support for the efforts of the civil authorities to bring the perpetrators of this crime to justice.
International officials in Kosovo say there has been a significant escalation of acts of violence against the police and the judicial system in the province in recent weeks following the first war crimes conviction of former Kosovo Albanian rebels in early July.
"It is clear that criminal elements are determined to derail the progress that Kosovo has been making," Marcie Ries, head of the US diplomatic mission in Kosovo, said.
Blaming criminal elements for Menon's murder, Feller said the police "will not be deterred from doing their job" and will spare no effort to find the perpetrators and bring them to justice.
Menon was one of the more than 4,000 UN police officers from 50 countries patrolling Kosovo.

Albania's new investment strategies
As political turmoil wanes in the Balkans, countries are focusing their attention on the next major challenge: attracting more foreign direct investment.
In Albania, the government of Prime Minister Sali Berisha is taking some innovative approaches.
By Robert C. Austin for Southeast European Times – 02/09/06

If there is one trend in the region, it's the intensifying battle for much-needed foreign direct investment.
Countries across Southeast Europe are looking for innovative ways to attract it.
Meanwhile, political stability -- a precursor to investment -- is likely to increase following resolution of the Kosovo status issue, expected in the coming months.
The recent independence referendum in Montenegro was a welcome harbinger for the future.
Despite worries and uncertainties ahead of the vote, it came off without a hitch.
The dreaded grey zone -- a pro-independence vote exceeding 50% but falling short of the 55% threshold -- was averted.
The EU and other observers gave a sigh of relief and went home happy.
The recent election campaign there was, in the best possible sense, dull.
Politicians were forced to think beyond the independence issue and deal with real, nuts-and-bolts issues.
After so many fraught years, this is a welcome trend.
While Serbia's fate is still tied to the capture of Ratko Mladic, the rest of the region is poised to push ahead aggressively.
Albania's Democratic Party government, led by Sali Berisha, knows full well that a battle for foreign investment looms and that Albania has some catching up to do.
What strikes visitors the most when visiting the country is the near total absence of international brand names.
The local capital has done a lot, especially with so much coming in from remittances, but Albania’s key industries will need more than that.
Tirana and Durres, along with the highway that links them, are growing fast.
However, investment is uneven and Albania is not only Tirana.
Outlying regions, where poverty is highest, need investment.
The low level of foreign interest is largely due to the fact that Albania's international image is poor -- wrongly so.
Certainly visitors to Albania leave with a far better impression than they arrived with.
But much still needs to be done to make outsiders aware that the country has achieved significant progress.
A start would be to showcase the already successful international investors operating there.
Growth, ranging between 5% and 6%, is respectable.
The signing of the Stability and Association Agreement with the EU makes it clear that, after fits and starts, Albania is on the right track.
Political life still too often resembles a circus but the stakes are no longer so high.
The party state mentality dies slowly -- both Democrats and Socialists along with smaller parties still publish their own dailies.
Nobody reads them, but that does not seem to matter.
The battle between Socialist leader Edi Rama and Berisha is still on and with former Socialist leader Fatos Nano offering up his own party within a party, the word on the street is that politics like this is yesterday's news.
On the positive side, the two big parties did reach an agreement on electoral procedures for the upcoming local vote that averted the all too ubiquitous boycott of parliament by those out of power.
Albania's tourism potential remains untapped. [Getty Images]
Berisha is taking some very bold steps and he has some excellent people around him.
A few minutes with Lulzim Basha, the very youthful and energetic Minister for Public Works, Transport and Telecommunications, are telling.
A map in his office outlines the vision for massive improvement in Albania's transportation network -- improvements that will shrink travel times, make the country more accessible and maximize Albania's strategic ports.
Montenegro, with already fairly diverse international investment, seems so far to be the big winner in tourism investment but Albania should be next in line.
The completion of the highway along the coast from Dubrovnik through to Saranda in Albania's south will transform the country.
This is critical if Albania is to make the most of its incredible potential for tourism on its lengthy coast.
Albania's service sector, especially its restaurants and hotels, already offers exceptional things.
The hospitality is great and Albanians are an outward-looking people.
They are ready for an influx of tourists and people will leave impressed.
Albania is also rich in natural resources, such as oil, gas, copper, chrome and hydroelectric potential.
By far the biggest step is Berisha's new program of "Albania for one euro".
Although still in its infancy, the plan ultimately aims to offer extremely good terms to investors interested in strategic sectors like mining, agriculture, import reduction and energy -- areas that are crying out for big money.
Government ministries are determining what assets they have and then will offer long-term leases for one euro per year.
In essence, you can get a chromium mine for one euro provided the government is satisfied with your long-term development strategy.
There are still huge details to be worked out, like how to choose amongst competing bids and penalties for non-fulfillment of investment pledges.
Implementation will likely fall to the country's economy minister, Genc Ruli, and he is certainly up to the job.
The idea is an innovative one, albeit not without substantial risks: the political fallout would be heavy is things were practically given away and investors failed to live up to expectations.
The government is also moving towards a flat tax and other incentives to bring in foreigners.
Business registration times have been shrunk to eight days from over forty.
Berisha pledges to decrease it even further.
The government was especially pleased with the reduction in the size of government, tax reductions and other measures that reduced overall expenditures.
For ordinary Albanians, there is now a chance to be a whistle-blower and this has meant less and less bribery.
This is also good news for foreigners.
Albania’s key ministers are now highly visible outside the country in conferences as they spread the word.
They are leaving a good impression.
Berisha also hired former US Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge to advise him on security issues, including organised crime and corruption, along with NATO integration and investment.
The policies are in place – now it's time to see who grabs the bait.

Bulgaria's new health minister pledges reforms
Crucial changes are needed to provide every Bulgarian with the best possible treatment, Health Minister Anna-Maria Borissova says.
(The Sofia Echo, Sofia News Agency, Dnevnik.bg, Mediapool -- 22/04/10 - 23/04/10; BTA - 21/04/10; Eurobarometer)
The Bulgarian health care sector underwent a major overhaul in the late 1990s. [Getty Images]
More than two-thirds of Bulgarians think there is a risk of being harmed by hospital or non-hospital care, according to a Eurobarometer survey on patient safety released in April.
Poor management and lack of professionalism are undermining the health system and immediate reforms are needed, according to the country's newly-appointed health minister, Anna-Maria Borissova.
"I want to provide high-quality health care everywhere in the country," she said on April 22nd, a day after taking up the post. "Every patient in Bulgaria should get the best possible treatment."
The healthcare sector underwent a major overhaul in the late 1990s.
The communist-era system of funding and ownership was replaced with a new model and health care establishments were granted economic, legal and financial independence.
Doctors and hospitals became independent contractors of the newly created National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), which assumed the functions of the payment agency.
But other changes that could help improve efficiency and quality have stalled due to lack of political will.
"We will hurry [with reform] because we are ridiculously late," Borissova told reporters in Sofia.
At the same time, she insisted that decisions would be made without rushing, and only after careful consideration and preparation.
As short term priorities, she cited defining the professional standards for employees in the sector and drawing up a "national health map" with complete information on the country's healthcare system.
Borissova, an endocrinologist and a professor at the Medical University in Sofia, replaced Bozhidar Nanev, who resigned at the end of March after being charged with corruption over a contract for the purchase of the antiviral medicine Tamiflu late last year.
A recent report on the ministry's 2009 activities said the launch and implementation of healthcare system reforms had been a top priority.
Nanev had warned that in addition to the spending cuts required in the sector due to the economic crisis, dozens of hospitals operating in the red would have to be closed down.
The number of hospitals in Bulgaria has grown from 293 to 414 in the last nine years, Borissova said.
This means that Bulgaria has about 4.6 hospitals per 100,000 people, compared to the EU average of three hospitals per 100,000 people.
"This is a huge increase, all these hospitals are draining public resources, and our resources have not grown, their level has remained unchanged," she said, but promised that none of the existing hospitals will be shut down.
Lack of professionals is another huge issue in the sector.
"Every single day there is one doctor who leaves Bulgaria," the Sofia News Agency quoted Borissova as saying. "The number of nurses is only half of what Bulgaria actually needs.
This is a catastrophe."
Poor pay, the low social status of medical professionals and the poor management of the system are just a few of the problems in the health care sector, a Sofia-based doctor with a 22-year practice in otolaryngology told SETimes.
"The head of the health care system has been liquidated," said the doctor, speaking on condition of anonymity.
He blames the dire state of the system on the "non-working" models adopted at the start of the reform process more than ten years ago. "The inefficient hospitals must be closed," he added.
But others in the medical profession disagree and feel encouraged by the new minister's promises that this will not happen.
OSCE says talks on Georgia monitors suspended
The OSCE has suspended month-long talks on deploying additional monitors to Georgia over Russia's refusal to let the officers into South Ossetia.

The OSCE decided on Thursday (September 18th) to suspend further talks on sending additional observers to Georgia, citing Russia's opposition to the deployment of monitors to South Ossetia as the main obstacle to an agreement.
"We have reached no consensus on the observers despite one month of negotiations," Antti Turunen of Finland, whose country currently chairs the 56-nation security organisation, told reporters. "There is no point in continuing negotiations in Vienna at this stage."
Turunen, who chairs the OSCE's decision-making permanent council this year, also said that as all diplomatic means for reaching a compromise had been exhausted, the parties would now seek further instructions from their national governments.
The matter "is elevated to the political level and needs to be dealt with in capitals", OSCE spokesman Martin Nesirky said.
On August 19th, members of Europe's largest security organisation decided to increase the number of OSCE military monitoring officers in Georgia by up to 100.
Twenty unarmed officers immediately headed to areas adjacent to South Ossetia to oversee the August 12th cease-fire between Moscow and Tbilisi.
Under last month's decision, deployment of the rest of the additional OSCE monitors would be subject to a new resolution on the mandate of the officers, which would also apply to the 20-member group already in Georgia.
Russia says that only the eight OSCE military monitors who were operating in Georgia prior to the outbreak of its five-day conflict with Russia on August 7th could re-enter South Ossetia.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reportedly claimed that the OSCE plan to send additional monitors to the region was an attempt to undo South Ossetia's independence, which only Russia and Nicaragua recognise.
Voicing regret over the suspension of the talks, Russia's envoy to the OSCE, Anvar Azimov, said on Thursday his country was "ready to continue the dialogue".
He also insisted that "independent South Ossetia" should join the discussion of the mandate of the international monitors.
Paata Gaprindashvili, Georgia's OSCE representative, also called for further negotiations.
According to him, Russia was refusing to let the monitors into South Ossetia because it wants Georgia's breakaway region to be treated as an independent state.
An anonymous Western diplomat told Reuters there could be another possible reason for Moscow's opposition, an effort to hide "quite serious ethnic cleansing against Georgians" in South Ossetia.
Also Thursday, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice warned Russia that it was on a "one-way path to isolation and irrelevance" and urged the West to stand up to "bullying" by Moscow.
Dacic says Serbia does not face suspension of visa free regime
BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Serbian Interior Minister Ivica Dacic attends a briefing Tuesday (May 31st) in Brussels for visa experts from missions of EU member states.
On Monday, he met with EU Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom to discuss visa issues.
After the talks, he reiterated that the EU's visa free regime for Serbia is not at risk at the moment, and he voiced determination to continue implementing measures aimed at preventing visa abuses.
Last week, the European Commission (EC) proposed the introduction of a safeguard clause that would allow for the temporary reintroduction of visas for citizens of a third country.
The mechanism would be applied under certain exceptional conditions and as a last resort.
The EC is talking to authorities in Serbia and Macedonia to find ways to reduce the number of asylum seekers. (Tanjug, Blic - 30/05/11)

EBRD Pledges Further Support to Post-Communist Countries
Southeast Europe has made considerable progress, but challenges remain, according to the EBRD.
The Bank held its 12th Annual Meeting in Tashkent, Uzbekistan earlier this week.
(Various sources -- 30/04/03 - 05/05/03)
According to the EBRD, trade and investment links among all Southeast European countries have grown, and the region has made remarkable progress.
But the assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic is a reminder that the transition process is still fragile in this part of Europe, the Bank warned.
We have been impressed by the progress made in Serbia-Montenegro since that tragic event," Clare Short, the chairwoman of the EBRD Board of Governors, said in her closing statement at the institution's 12th Annual Meeting in Uzbekistan's capital, Tashkent, on 4 May and 5 May.
The EBRD was established in 1991, following the collapse of communism, with a mandate to "help build market economies and democracies" in 27 countries stretching from central Europe to central Asia.
Today, it is the largest single investor in the region and mobilises significant foreign direct investment beyond its own financing.
Over the past 12 years, total loan commitments to the 27 countries have grown to 21.6 billion euros, of which 3.9 billion were loaned in 2002 alone.
In addition, last year the Bank was instrumental in mobilising investments totalling 8.8 billion euros, which represent more than a quarter of the foreign direct investment in the region.
EBRD investment in the Southeast European countries increased by more than 25 per cent over 2001, reaching 865m euros.
What makes the EBRD unique among international financial institutions is that it demands democratic reforms, as well as economic reforms, from borrower states.
Addressing the board of governors, EBRD President Jean Lemierre said two lessons could be drawn after 12 years of experience in transition, namely that "prosperity comes from commitment to open markets" and that "close relations with neighbours drive progress at home".
According to the EBRD, one of the most tangible results of the commitment to reform is the fact that eight countries in its region of operations are set to become EU members next year.
Two others -- Bulgaria and Romania -- are expected to follow soon.
The meeting in Tashkent was the first to take place in a Central Asian country.
Previous annual meetings were hosted by Eastern and Central European countries, including Bulgaria and Romania.
The choice for this year's venue generated controversy, given Uzbekistan's poor human rights record.
According to human rights organisations, there are an estimated 6,500 political prisoners in the former Soviet republic, and many have been tortured.
The Bank, however, said its main goal this year was to place the focus on Central Asia.
The forum brought together about 3,000 participants, including businessmen, NGOs, journalists and officials.
NATO Welcomes Serbia-Montenegro Military Reform, Offers Help
Defence Minister Boris Tadic, meeting in Brussels with NATO ambassadors, presented Serbia-Montenegro's programme for military restructuring.
Tadic said he now expects his country will join the Partnership for Peace programme this year.
(AP, Reuters, RFE/RL, Radio B92, Tanjug, Washington File - 07/05/03)
Serbia-Montenegro's hopes of joining NATO received a boost Wednesday (7 May) as ambassadors of the alliance hailed the country's military reform efforts and offered assistance in implementing further democratic changes.
The expression of support came a day after Belgrade moved to place the general staff of the federal army under civilian control.
Defence Minister Boris Tadic said he now expects Serbia-Montenegro will join the Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme this year, adding that earlier PfP membership is a key goal of the administration.
Meeting with NATO ambassadors in Brussels, Tadic and Army Chief-of-Staff Branko Krga presented a programme for military restructuring and civilian control, which they said is already in progress.
On Tuesday, Serbia-Montenegro's Supreme Defence Council announced that the army general staff would become an organisational unit within the defence ministry, and that military officials would be appointed by the Council of Ministers of the joint state, as recommended by the defence minister.
"At the heart of our national strategy for military reform lies our commitment to the creation of a modern non-aggressive army that is under strict civilian control," Tadic was quoted as telling the ambassadors.
He also sought NATO's support for his country's efforts to fight organised crime and corruption, which he said has plagued the Balkans for years.
According to Belgrade-based radio B92, Tadic and Krga also presented Serbia-Montenegro's concept for regional security, which calls for a common Balkan security policy and seeks to ensure there are no alliances between some Balkan states against others.
An official quoted by AP described Tadic's presentation as "very convincing", and said NATO has offered to send an expert team of reform advisers to the country.
"The murder of [Zoran] Djindjic galvanised the emphasis on reform.
There is a sense of urgency that did not exist before and we want to develop closer relations," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
At the same time, the ambassadors cautioned that Serbia-Montenegro still has much to do in order to meet the conditions for PfP membership, including full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal and the International Court of Justice.
"We will continue to co-operate with The Hague tribunal and I am sure that we will meet all the pre-conditions.
I want to believe that we will become a member of the PfP this year," Tadic said.
Acknowledging the reform efforts, US President George W Bush on Tuesday authorised sales of military equipment to Serbia-Montenegro.
A White House statement said Bush "determined that defence co-operation with Serbia and Montenegro will encourage continued defence reform and strengthen Serbia and Montenegro's democratic institutions".
Human Trafficking Scandal Still Plagues Montenegro
Though stopped by the courts, a human trafficking case involving alleged links to top officials refuses to go away.
In early December, former Montenegrin Interior Minister Andrija Jovicevic accused Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic of trying to cover up his role.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 22/12/03
Although it has been a year since the arrest of human trafficking suspects in Montenegro, the scandal persists.
In early December, former Interior Minister Andrija Jovicevic accused Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic of seeking to cover up his involvement.
The case involves a Moldovan woman who was allegedly forced into prostitution by an organised crime group with links to top officials.
According to Jovicevic, high-ranking figures in the Montenegrin government used their influence to halt the case.
However, Jovicevic has so far failed to present evidence of Djukanovic's role in the scandal, while Djukanovic has charged that Jovicevic was paid to politically discredit him.
He added that he had not dismissed Jovicevic because of the human trafficking case but because of his poor work.
Djukanovic also said that the affair had been staged in order to discredit Montenegro, though he did not offer any evidence to support his claim.
Four people were arrested in connection with the scandal, including Deputy Public Prosecutor Zoran Piperovic.
But the Montenegrin courts stopped the case, claiming insufficient evidence, and the suspects were released from jail.
The Moldovan woman has since left Montenegro.
In late November, OSCE experts who had been checking the work of the Montenegrin police and courts in the case presented their report.
The experts said they had found numerous errors and mishaps in the work of Montenegrin state institutions, adding that the secret police were involved in the entire case.
They recommended that the Podgorica authorities redo the whole process.
The Montenegrin government said that the process could be restarted if new evidence was found.
However, police still have not obtained an order to start gathering evidence.
The head of the OSCE mission in Serbia-Montenegro, Maurizio Massari, has called on the Montenegrin government to implement the recommendations in the OSCE experts' report.

Organised by the TUYAP Fair and Exhibition Organization in partnership with the Turkish Publishers Association, the 30th International Istanbul Book Fair was held in November at the TUYAP Fair and Convention Center in Istanbul.
It hosted up to 600 publishing houses, NGOs and 197 activities and several hundred autograph sessions.
The culture ministers from Turkey and Egypt have conducted the opening ceremony, where publishers, editing agencies and guest writers from 35 different countries took part.
With the title "international" for the first time, this year's theme was Hope: Dream or Reality.
This year, the honoured guest country was Egypt.
Almost 25 publishers from Egypt attended the book fair.
Events took place around a variety of subjects -- from cinema to literature, and cultural history, along with interviews with guest writers, and book signing sessions.
Famous Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz' 100th birthday was commemorated at a panel discussion.
The honoured writer at the book fair was the well-known Turkish author Ferit Edgu.
Held in a huge exhibition centre, thousands of people visited the fair despite its relatively distant location from the city centre.
Report: human rights not fully protected in Balkan countries
The US State Department's annual report on human rights practices finds police abuse, intimidation of journalists and corruption are still problems in many Balkan countries.
(Financiarul, Makfax, B92, Sofia Echo, SNA - 26/02/09; US Department of State - 25/02/09)

Last year was marked by a growing demand for greater personal and political freedom across the globe, the US Department of State said on February 25th in its annual Human Rights Report.
It pointed to a number of ongoing human rights problems, including corruption, restrictions on press freedom, and burdensome legislation aimed at curtailing NGOs.
The 2008 report includes six regional overviews, with the one on Europe and Eurasia finding that "strengthening new democracies" and "addressing hate crimes and hate speech while protecting fundamental freedoms" remained key challenges in this part of the world.
The document also urges governments to refrain from enforcing curbs on human rights NGOs and to allow them to operate without repression.
The country reports on eight Balkan nations concluded that the authorities in six of them -- Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia -- "generally respected" the citizens' human rights, but that problems remained in some areas.
The Romanian government "addressed some human rights problems" in 2008, the State Department said. It added, however, that abuses continued to occur in the country.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, meanwhile, the authorities' human rights record "remained poor" last year, despite improvements observed in certain areas.
Even though laws across the Balkans prohibit police abuse, it remains a problem for all countries except Croatia and Kosovo, the report said.
In Albania, for example, suspects -- particularly homosexuals, or members of the Roma and Balkan Egyptian communities there -- were mistreated during their arrest or initial detention.
Roma also suffered at the hands of police in Romania, as did some other detainees.
In addition, the report cited "mistreatment of abandoned children with physical disabilities in state institutions and of prolonged incarceration for misbehavior within state orphanages".

There was no evidence of suspects or detainees being abused by local police, UNMIK, EULEX, or KFOR officials in Kosovo, the State Department said, while noting allegations of prison inmates experiencing harassment or maltreatment.
In general, Kosovo was the only country among the eight where prisons "reportedly met international standards", according to the State Department.
Prisons in most of the other countries, suffered from overcrowding, with those in Croatia also said to be experiencing shortage of capacity.
Freedom of speech and of the press is embedded in the national legislation of each of the eight countries and the governments of Albania, Bulgaria, Kosovo, Macedonia and Romania "generally respected these rights in practice" in 2008, the report said.
However, increased harassment and intimidation of journalists were observed in some of these and the other countries in the region.
Romania saw isolated cases of attempts on the part of the authorities to threaten or censor the press, or to attack journalists.
Government influence on the media continued to be observed in Croatia, while press in Montenegro continued to be subject to certain restrictions.
In Macedonia, media coverage viewed as "antipatriotic" was subjected to harsh criticism by the authorities, negatively impacting press freedom in the country.
"Government respect for freedom of speech and the press declined during the year" in BiH, the State Department found.
In Serbia, it said, there were indications that the government interfered with these freedoms.
Corruption remained a major problem for all countries in the region, despite national laws barring corrupt practices and providing for significant penalties.
In BiH, Bulgaria, Kosovo, Macedonia and Serbia officials often engaged in corrupt practices with impunity, the State Department said.
"Despite several arrests of high-level local and central government officials, corruption remained a major obstacle to meaningful reform and a serious problem," it said.
In Croatia, the government undertook further improvements to the official agency tasked with fighting corruption.
Nevertheless, according to the report, the problem remained serious.
Government institutions, the judiciary and the business sector often found themselves at the centre of corruption cases.
Increased harassment and intimidation of the media was observed in some of the countries in the region. [Getty Images]
Bulgaria and Romania, which joined the EU in 2007, are still subject to a special European Commission mechanism for monitoring their progress in judicial reform and fighting corruption.
The State Department described Romania's efforts in combating corruption as "generally ineffective" and criticised the Bulgarian government over its failure to "aggressively prosecute high-profile organised crime or corruption".
Macedonia was criticised over the June 2008 parliamentary elections, which were marred by incidents of violence, intimidation, and electoral irregularities and "failed to meet key" OSCE standards.
Trafficking in persons, discrimination against persons with disabilities and minority groups and violence against women were other common problems for the region.
The State Department also found that some national governments failed to fully meet their commitments to children's rights and welfare.
By law, schoolchildren of all ethnic communities living in Kosovo must have equal conditions regardless of their mother tongue.
Students from minorities groups also have the right to native-language public education through secondary school.
While schools teaching in Serbian, Bosnian, and Turkish operated during the year, minority education in some parts of the country suffered for lack of facilities.
Roma, Ashkali, and Egyptian children attended mixed schools with Kosovo Albanian children but were reportedly threatened and mistreated in some majority Albanian areas.
Many children from poor Roma families had to start work at an early age to contribute to family income and thus did not attend school.
"Kosovo Serb and Kosovo Albanian children [both] attended schools with inadequate facilities that lacked basic equipment.
A few schools housed both Kosovo Serb and Kosovo Albanian pupils, who studied different curricula and rotated class schedules," the report said.

Austria's Mobilkom won the tender to enter Serbia as the country's third mobile operator.
It was the sole bidder, offering a price of 321m euros.
Serbia has an estimated four and a half million mobile phone users, and the number is expected to increase.
Advocates say introducing a new competitor into the market has the potential to benefit consumers by offering them more choices and lower prices.
Switzerland approved a 6.3m-euro loan in support of Bosnia and Herzegovina's water supply and sewerage sector.
Part of the funds will go towards an 8.78m-euro project intended to improve water supply in the Prijedor Municipality over the next three years.
Bulgaria's industrial growth fell from 10.6% year-on-year in August to 6.4% year-on-year in September, according to the latest data from the National Statistical Institute.
The decline was attributed mainly to decreased production in the mining sector.
The Croatian oil and gas company INA's revenues rose 18.5% year-on-year to 1.47 billion euros in the first quarter of this year, according to non-audited data.
INA's sales revenue generated in foreign markets was 533m euros, up by 32.7% year-on-year, while domestic market sales stood at 943m euros, up 11.7%.
Bucharest City Hall said it has assigned several contracts for street modernisation work, worth a total of 195m euros, to three associate company groups -- Swietelsky (Austria), Euroconstruct Trading 98 and Tehnologica Radion (Romania).
The biggest deal, worth 79.1m euros, was concluded with the Swietelsky-led consortium, which includes German company Max Bogl and Eurovia Construct Bucharest.
Montenegro's telecommunication agency announced a tender for the third mobile operator license and two operating licenses for the 3G network.
The licenses will be issued for a 15-year term.
The deadline for submitting bids is January 15th. The minimum one-off fee for the 3G licenses is 2m euros, while the license for a third mobile operator (including 3G) is 6m euros.
Serbia's Privatisation Agency sealed a 2.25m-euro accord for the sale of the Nis textile works Nitekst to a local consortium, consisting of the companies Irva investicije, Jabuka and businessman Slavko Djordjevic.
Under the deal, the buyer is committed to investing an additional 4m euros in the Nis factory.

Law angers Hungary, could impact Serbia's EU bid
Ethnic Hungarians in Serbia say they are being unfairly barred from restitution for seized property.
Now Budapest has weighed in as well.

Voicing protest over legislation they call discriminatory, Hungarian leaders have said their country will reconsider its support for Serbia's entry into the EU.
"We are most devoted to Serbia's European integration, but accession is not realistic with laws that collectively deny people their civic rights," Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister Zsolt Semjen said ON Sunday (October 2nd) during a visit to Subotica, a northern Serbian town that is home to a large ethnic Hungarian population.
At issue is a law adopted by the Serbian parliament last week on the restitution of seized property and damages.
Passing such legislation is a condition for EU integration.
However, one provision in the law stipulates that property confiscated from members of World War II occupation forces and their heirs will not be returned to them.
Hungarian parties in Serbia say the measure is unfair because it affects even those Hungarians who were mobilised against their will, or who did not commit any crimes.
"We are convinced that the law, by ignoring the principle of individual responsibility, violates several provisions of the constitution and is not in line with European principles," said Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians President Istvan Pastor, a member of the ruling coalition in Serbia.
He said he would call for an assessment of its constitutionality.
Semjen, meanwhile, urged Serbia to amend "the unacceptable parts of the Restitution Law, to enable compensation to the Hungarian community as well".
An estimated 350,000 Hungarians live in Serbia.
In response, Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic told SETimes that Serbia is against collective guilt, but did not want anyone to forget who had been against fascism during World War II.
Djelic also said the Serbian authorities would aim to convince the Hungarian community that the law does not impose collective guilt, but pointed out the current makeup of parliament lacks the will to amend the law.
Nenad Canak, leader of the League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina, took a blunter tone.
"If we are choosing between the EU and rehabilitating those who murdered our fellow citizens and threw them into the frozen river, then we will think carefully.
We will think about what kind of an EU that is and whether we want to join it at all," Canak said.
EurActiv website editor Smiljana Vukojicic told SETimes that on October 12th, Serbia will probably obtain candidate status from the European Commission.
"However, all members need to agree to that in December.
That is where Hungary can block Serbia and there have already been cases of candidate countries blocked in progress towards the EU due to bilateral disputes with EU member states," she said.
Tensions are also running high because of several physical clashes between the Serbs and Hungarians in the mixed village of Temerin.
Dinko Gruhonjic of the coalition of NGOs Civic Vojvodina believes those incidents are unlikely to escalate.
"Incidents increase before an election and when tensions are high in the region.
The incidents in Temerin should not be overestimated, but the absence of a broader move to prevent their causes will result in ethnic communities living next to each other rather than with each other," Gruhonjic told SETimes.
Bank credits hard to come by for Bulgarian businesses
Last year, Bulgarian small-and medium-size enterprises had the least access to bank credits among 20 EU nations, Eurostat says in a new survey.

Obtaining credit was an easy job for non-financial small-and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) in Bulgaria and 19 other EU nations four years ago, according to a new Eurostat survey released on Monday (October 3rd).
But that became more difficult for them after the economic crisis started spreading across the globe, it concluded, based on the results of loan applications submitted between 2007 and 2010 by such companies in the 20 countries for which data were available.
The percentage of SME credit requests that were rejected altogether rose more or less significantly in all of the surveyed countries, except Sweden.
The largest increase in unsuccessful loan applications was recorded in Bulgaria -- from 3% in 2007 to 36% in 2010, Eurostat said.
The Balkan nation was also the country with the highest percentage of rejected credit requests among the 20 covered in the survey.
Furthermore, the share of successful loan applications, i.e. SMEs that were granted the money they requested and under the conditions they sought, fell the most also in Bulgaria -- from 87% of all in 2007 to 43% in 2010.
Ivaylo Georgiev, owner of the Sofia-based Metal M company, was among those who sought bank financing during that period to secure the additional operating capital he needed.
His primary bank however turned down his credit request, viewing it as risky.
He was eventually granted the financing from another bank, but it was not easy.
"We had five sessions with the credit inspectors.
Our request was initially rejected, but it was then reviewed and our application was eventually approved," Georgiev told SETimes. "It took us about seven months to secure the financing."
Ivan Midyurov, an entrepreneur from the Black Sea resort town of Primorsko, was not as lucky, though, but he does not regret it.
Just before the crisis began, he wanted to build a hotel and then sell it, but his application for an investment credit was turned down.
The bank inspectors considered is risky, he explained.
"It's better that they did not approve my application, because it would, most probably, have been impossible for me to repay the credit, given what happened in recent years," Midyurov told SETimes.
Before the crisis, Bulgaria experienced a long period of steady economic growth, which also led to a continuous increase in market sales, said economist Georgi Angelov of the Open Society Institute (OSI) in Sofia.
"Therefore, the access to credits was very easy, as the financial situation and companies' growth potential both looked good," he said.
But when the crisis hit, the economic situation began to deteriorate, making it more difficult for SMEs to find new financing.
They proved unprepared for dealing with such a risk, Angelov told SETimes.
"Believing that they would always have access to limitless bank financing, many of them launched long-term projects, financed with short-term credits, which was irrational," he said.
"Furthermore, many Bulgarian companies stand on the verge of the gray sector of the economy, declaring only part of their revenues," Angelov added.
While that was not a big issue in the situation of wide-spread optimism before the crisis, it turned into a problem when the turmoil started, as bank inspectors began to scrutinise the companies' balance sheets and account books more carefully.
"The business practices that worked during the times of easy access to credits will begin to change and companies will have to start relying to a greater extent on internal financing, reinvestment of profits and attracting new shareholders," Angelov concluded.
Kosovo police officers arrested for alleged procurement fraud
A longstanding investigation into alleged fraud and corruption within Kosovo police ranks gains new momentum.
By Linda Karadaku for Southeast European Times in Pristina -- 06/10/11

EULEX arrested six people and conducted 14 searches in an organised crime investigation operation Wednesday (October 5th).
The mission stated the operation is related to "a major investigation into alleged corruption and procurement fraud".
"The alleged fraud relates to procurement within Kosovo police and its business suppliers of weapons and ammunition.
Due to the alleged fraud, Kosovo police budget suffered losses that may amount to millions of euros, which make Kosovo police the primary victim in the affair," EULEX said.
Nicholas Hawton, EULEX deputy spokesperson, told SETimes that prosecutors will decide on future steps.
"Today's operation is closed," Hawton said, without divulging much about searches conducted in Germany as a facet of the operation.
"German police also searched one business premise and one private house in Germany as a part of the investigation," the mission said.
"In addition, 12 locations were searched all over Kosovo, including private houses, business premises and public offices," it said.
Kosovo media reported that documents, computers and other evidence were confiscated.
Taken into custody were the head of the Kosovo Police Administration Ragip Bunjaku, the head of Procurement in the Kosovo Police Xhevahire Vatovci and Kadrush Koliqi, head of the department for weapons and munitions in the Interior Ministry.
Three businessmen were also detained.
A EULEX prosecutor heads the investigation, supervised by the Kosovo Special Prosecution Office, but EULEX has been investigating the case since 2009.
Mentor Vrajolli, senior researcher in the Kosovo Centre for Security Studies, says such allegations are serious, greatly damaging the image of the Kosovo police.
"Such allegations and doubts do not come unexpected.
Although Kosovo police were praised for being transparent, the transparency of this institution has been superficial," Vrajolli told SETimes.
He compared the level of transparency to that of the Kosovo Security Force and the Kosovo Intelligence Agency.
His centre claims that the lack of institutional transparency created the potential for abuse of power by different officials and damaged the Kosovo police budget.
"Lack of internal transparency of these institutions can result in major corruption," Vrajolli said, pointing out that by law, the security institutions should report on the disciplinary violations and spending of funds.
"The security institutions are financed by the tax-payers who have a right to be regularly informed, according to the legislation, on how the funds are used in these institutions," Vrajolli told SETimes.
The Kosovo daily Express reported on Thursday (October 6th) that Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi was informed by EULEX one day ahead of the operation.
"They told me that they will search the Ministry and the Police.
I asked them to have this issue [investigated] to the end and I support this EULEX action," he said.
Rexhepi also noted that the period under investigation does not include the time he was leading the ministry.
"This is suspected to have happened before I was appointed Interior Minister," Rexhepi said.
Risky Business: investing in Greece, but there are takers
Betting on Greece takes courage, as the debt-crushed country struggles to lure believers.
By Andy Dabilis for Southeast European Times in Athens -- 23/01/12
Investors are wading into some sectors, despite the general wave of red ink. [Reuters]
In Greece, a country recently rated by Credit Suisse as the riskiest in the world for investors, there's treasure to be found, even if you're not a mining company like Canada's Eldorado, whose Greek subsidiary, Thracean Gold Mining, has been awarded a license for exploration.
The country's economic crisis, as it strives to stave off bankruptcy and is readying haircuts of as much as 65% for lenders, may be scaring away some investors, but there are sectors where it's luring them too: agricultural technology, solar energy, tourism, transportation, logistics, luxury resorts, gas and oil drilling, waste management, and telecommunications.
"There are many opportunities here in Greece," Elias Spirtounias, executive director of the American-Hellenic Chamber of Commerce told SETimes. He said the notoriously business-unfriendly government is trying yet again to change that image and implement serious reforms. "Investors are looking for stability and an environment that offers them lower taxation and is easy to operate in.
Greece doesn't offer that as the same level of other countries yet," he said.
The Credit Suisse report, which Spirtounias acknowledged was "kind of damaging". came on the heels of the country's fourth year of a deep recession and riots against austerity measures, and the Athens Stock Exchange having the worst performance in the world.
Greece was at the bottom of 50 countries in the report, which gauged current account balances, state budgets, debt (Greece is buried under a 380 billion euros deficit) and other factors, and was more than just another big hit. Following were Portugal, whose economy is also struggling, and Iceland.
It was the kind of bad publicity that sent Development Minister Michalis Chrysochoidis scrambling to Copenhagen to try to attract Danish investment and create some good spin just before the Scandinavian country assumed the rotating six-month EU Presidency on January 1st.
Kathimerini quoted him as saying "The economy adjustment programme aims at returning clear results in the sectors of competitiveness and growth in Greece," though he did not say how.

He could get some advice from George Markopoulos, general manager of Thracean Gold Mining, who said Eldorado believed in Greece despite the crisis.
"The mining wealth of Greece shows gold deposits are very encouraging," he told SETimes.
"The management of Eldorado knows how Greece is and how the crisis will work for investment," as world gold prices soar.
Eldorado has also recently acquired the Canadian European Goldfield, which offers a chance for further exploration in Greece through Thracean and expanding operations into Turkey and Romania, although some market analysts worried what would happen if Greece defaults and exits the eurozone.
Markopoulos said he's not worried. "In every investment you have second thoughts," he said.
"There weren't any investments in this area and now we think there is a chance for us." Markopoulos is also a mining engineer.
Spirtounias said there are signs that the government has finally realised it can't chase away potential investors with labyrinthine bureaucracy, high taxes or ignoring their needs.
He points to a revocation of cabotage laws that kept lucrative cruise ship business out of Athens' port of Piraeus, which has major Chinese investments, led by Cosco, which operates a major facility there.
And, said Spirtounias, whose organisation hosts major forums on the business climate, more companies are beginning to realise the situation in Greece is not so dire they shouldn't take a chance.
But, he said, the new coalition government headed by former European Central Bank Vice-President Lucas Papademos, charged with keeping international aid coming for the debt-crippled country, has to keep rapidly pushing new measures to attract businesses before elections are held in April. "The sooner major reforms related to FDI's (Foreign Direct Investments) will be implemented, the faster those opportunities will be realised," he said.
Prime Minister Lucas Papademos may need the Midas touch to attract investors to more sectors. [Reuters]
The government is also negotiating with investors the long-delayed debt write-down, a Private Sector Involvement (PSI) that Spirtounias said companies want to see for before taking a leap.
The Bank of Greece said the total gross inflows of FDI capital, which reflect the performance of a country in attracting investment, increased in 2010 by 4.96%, although figures for the riot-scarred and turbulent year of 2011 are not available yet.
They could be boosted though by the acquisition in May of the Greek pharmaceutical company Specifar for 400m euros by Watson Pharmaceuticals of California, which has its headquarters in New Jersey.
Watson was particularly interested in a generic version of the ulcer drug Nexium that the Greek company makes.
The drug market in Greece generates 6 billion euros a year.
The beleaguered Athens Stock Exchange, which fell 52% in 2011, the second-worst year in the last 50 for the bourse, began 2012 with a record-low turnover and losses for most stocks, but officials are hoping for more investment, even if it seems against all odds now.
The organisation's COO, Dimitris Karaiskakis, said while the Credit Suisse report doesn't help, he doesn't think it portents an economic catastrophe .
"We've seen a lot of reports that disaster was going to hit," he told SETimes.
"There are some positive numbers because we see the anticipation of foreign investors has not decreased [by] the same levels," as the exchange's performance and there is hope they may be perched to buy low.
"After the PSI we are all expecting to see a change," he added.
Finance Ministry Raises Taxes to Boost Greek Economy
In an effort to bring the economy up to European standards, the Greek Finance Ministry has raised the direct tax on goods sold.
Entrepreneurs are crying foul, but the government insists it had no choice.

As part of the government's efforts to bring the Greek economy up to European standards, Finance Minister George Alogoskoufis recently raised the Value Added Tax (VAT) rate from 18 per cent to 19 per cent.
The change took effect on 1 April.
Although the minister says the rate hike was necessary to reach the goal of reducing the national debt, it has upset entrepreneurs, who say they were only given a week to adjust their prices.
Businesses have voiced strong objections, though the government has also lowered business taxes from 35 per cent to 25 per cent, and from 25 per cent to 20 per cent for small and medium-size enterprises.
Both the opposition and Alogoskoufis' own New Democracy party have criticised the suddenness of the move.
While acknowledging it could have negative short-term effects on the economy, Alogoskoufis argues that he had no choice.
Greece is under strong pressure from the EU to reduce its deficit -- currently the highest in the Union -- to 3 per cent of the GNP by the end of 2006.
To do that, the finance ministry will have to collect 2 billion euros more than initially projected.
Brussels would never have approved a programme to shape up the economy through cuts in public spending alone, Alogoskoufis said.
The finance ministry has announced a number of measures aimed at economic improvement.
In addition to cutting expenses of public utility companies, it plans a massive effort to halt tax evasion.
Due to casual misreporting as well as black and grey market activities, Greece has one of Europe's highest rates of tax evasion.
The country's location, at the crossroads of three continents, makes it a prime location for goods smuggling.
The ministry is now working with police to crack down on illegal imports and direct them through the proper channels, so that taxes can be collected.
In the daily lives of Greeks, more taxes are coming.
The tax on alcohol and cigarettes will rise -- cigarettes today cost 80 cents, but will rise to 1.40 euros.
The state also plans to institute a tax on real estate, with new properties subject to the VAT as of 1 January 2006.
The fuel tax is set to increase by two or three cents per litre, a change which will also affect heating bills.
Finally, reduced VAT will no longer apply to the Aegean islands.
The tax break had been used as an incentive for people to live there.
Alogoskoufis has said he hopes that inflation will not increase by more than 1 per cent, and projections show it will be around 4 per cent during April.
A review by the Bank of Greece, meanwhile, found that economic development in crucial industries has been slowing, with construction, textiles, tourism, commerce, insurance and passenger shipping feeling the brunt of it.
Ashdown Says Police Reform Crucial to BiH's Progress on EU Path
Paddy Ashdown warned politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina on Tuesday that the country must restructure its police forces to move forward on the road to EU accession.
Failure to do so could mean lagging behind other countries in the region, he said.
(Office of the High Representative Web Site -- 19/04/05 - 20/04/05; Fena, Onasa - 19/04/05)
"Police reform remains the last great obstacle to be overcome before BiH can start negotiating its own Stabilisation and Association Agreement," said High Representative Paddy Ashdown. [OHR]
High Representative Paddy Ashdown urged politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) on Tuesday (19 April) to reach a compromise on police reform, a critical precondition for the country's EU integration progress.
"Police reform remains the last great obstacle to be overcome before BiH can start negotiating its own Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA)," Ashdown said during a meeting with the leaderships of both houses of the Federation of BiH Parliament.
The meeting came just days before the 24 April start of political negotiations on restructuring the country's police forces.
A consultative task force of the European Commission (EC) is due to arrive in BiH in mid-May to assess BiH's progress in meeting 16 requirements outlined in its feasibility study.
A positive assessment would open the way for the start of SAA negotiations, a key first step towards eventual EU membership.
According to Ashdown, most of the issues and problems on the agenda had been resolved, "including the fact that we can reach a constructive co-operation" with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
But he stressed that the go-ahead for SAA talks could come only after all preconditions are met.
BiH's leaders must "reach a formal agreement on police reform, or be responsible for the delay in fulfilling BiH's EU accession ambitions," Ashdown said.
The requirements Brussels has laid out for police reform include placing exclusive competence for police legislation and budget at the state level, removing political interference from operational policing, and ensuring that policing is carried out on the basis of functional criteria.
"If we succeed, these negotiations will provide BiH with a decent system of policing, one which can win the battle against crime, rather than losing it," said Ashdown. "If we fail then we condemn BiH to remain in Europe's backwaters.
This is not a decision I can impose -- it is one you must agree on."
Referring to the EC's positive feasibility study for Serbia-Montenegro last week, the British diplomat also noted that this was a clear signal that EU membership, rather than the destructive politics of the past, had become the priority for BiH's neighbours.
"BiH's leading political cadres -- in both government and opposition -- now have an opportunity to prove to the citizens of this country that they too are intent on reaching this goal and that they are capable of leading BiH into Europe," Ashdown was quoted as saying.
Police reform was also one of the issues the EUPM Commissioner in BiH, Kevin Carty, discussed Tuesday with the head of the Brcko District Police, Milenko Milicevic, and members of the EUPM team operating there.
"The reasons for police reform in BiH are clear," Carty said. "Current police forces in BiH are not functional and are under strong influence of various political parties."
If the country wants to begin talks on its accession to the EU, it should restructure its police forces, the EUPM chief said. "Politicians in BiH have two possibilities -- either to accept the police restructuring or to close the door to Europe," he added.
Mesic Names Ivo Sanader Prime Minister Designate of Croatia
Croatian President Stipe Mesic has named Ivo Sanader prime minister designate.
The leader of the centre-right Croatian Democratic Union is expected to form a minority government with a small centrist ally before year's end.
(FT - 10/12/03; AFP, Reuters, BBC, Croatian Information Centre - 09/12/03)
Croatian President Stipe Mesic named Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) leader Ivo Sanader prime minister designate on Tuesday (9 December). The leader of the centre-right party, which won one-third of the vote in the 23 November parliamentary elections, has 30 days to form the new government.
Sanader said he would present his cabinet for parliament's approval on 22 December, naming EU and NATO integration as some of his key priorities.
"My priorities are raising the living standards at home, gaining membership in NATO and the EU and resolving open issues with our neighbours," Sanader said following his meeting with Mesic.
The HDZ, which will take 66 of the seats in the country's new 152-seat parliament, is expected to form a coalition government with a small centrist party, the Democratic Centre (DC) and, possibly, with the Social Liberal Party (HSLS).
While voicing his party's support for the future government, HSLS leader Drazen Budisa said his party would decide on Saturday whether to join a HDZ-led coalition.
DC leader Mate Granic said Tuesday his party had unanimously supported entering a coalition government with Sanader's party.
Members of parliament representing ethnic minorities and pensioners have indicated readiness to support the government on key issues of national interest, such as the budget and reforms to advance the country's EU bid.
An Austrian-educated politician, Sanader, 50, has been described as a pragmatic technocrat, who is fluent in five languages and is an outspoken supporter of US President George W. Bush's policies.
One of the challenges Sanader faces is to reverse HDZ's international image, blemished by its past nationalist policies, as well as its poor human rights record and economic mismanagement during its 1990-2000 rule.
Founded by late President Franjo Tudjman, the HDZ led the country to independence and then into international isolation.
Sanader, however, claims his party has broken with its nationalist past and is now keen to work for Croatia's EU and NATO membership.
Still wary, the international community called on the future government to observe international standards, particularly in the field of human rights.
"The respect and promotion of international and European human rights standards is a goal the new Croatian government will be expected to embrace," Peter Semneby, the head of the OSCE Mission to Croatia, said in a statement.
While voicing full support for Croatia's European perspective, a statement by EU foreign ministers also urged the future government to ensure that its policies are in line with the Union's membership criteria.
"Key in this respect are, in particular, full co-operation with the ICTY and the return of refugees and minority rights," the statement said.
Outgoing Foreign Minister Tonino Picula said Sanader's government would have the chance now to prove its pro-European stance.
"But it will be very tough. It's one thing to declare your European orientation.
Enlarging NATO to Welcome Seven New Members
Seven Central and East European countries, including Bulgaria and Romania, join NATO Monday (29 March).
The Alliance's biggest expansion in its 55-year history will be marked at ceremonies in Washington and in Brussels this week.

Seven former communist states will join NATO this week as the Alliance moves to finalise its expansion into a 26-member bloc.
NATO's biggest enlargement in its 55-year history brings in countries from the Baltic to the Adriatic and Black seas.
The prime ministers of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia are meeting in Washington Monday (29 March) to hand in their countries' accession protocols to US Secretary of State Colin Powell.
US President George W. Bush will then hold separate meetings with the seven prime ministers ahead of a ceremony marking their countries' accession to the Alliance.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer will also attend the ceremony.
"These Central and East European democracies have already acted as Allies through their strong solidarity and actions in the war on terrorism, and in helping to strengthen peace and democracy in Afghanistan and Iraq," the White House said in a statement.
"As NATO acts to face the new challenges of the 21st century, the membership of these seven nations in NATO will advance the cause of freedom, and strengthen the Atlantic Alliance, the central pillar of transatlantic relations."
A ceremony at the NATO headquarters in Brussels on Friday will mark the accession of the seven new members.
Their flags will be raised alongside those of the other 19 members.
"This is a historic accomplishment for our countries, for NATO, for Europe, and for the whole Euro-Atlantic community," the prime ministers of the acceding countries said in an article published by the International Herald Tribune Monday.
This new round of NATO enlargement, they said, "represents another important step towards the fulfilment of our joint vision of an undivided, democratic and peaceful Europe", and will make nearly 50 million more Europeans "feel more secure in the knowledge that history will not repeat itself".
Bulgaria, Romania and the other five countries were officially invited to join the Alliance in November 2002 at the summit in Prague -- the 16th since NATO's establishment in 1949, and the first during the 21st century.
The seven nations have already acted as de facto NATO allies on many occasions.
Their entry will strengthen NATO's existing combined force of 2.8 million with an additional 200,000 military personnel.
The seven prime ministers said that NATO membership would not bring only benefits, but new obligations as well.
"We are ready to assume those responsibilities, and to contribute politically, as well as militarily, to our common endeavour of making our neighborhood and that of others a safe place to live," they said.
Joining them at Monday's ceremony will be the prime ministers of Albania, Croatia and Macedonia, which are also seeking NATO membership and are participating in its Membership Action Plan.
In 2002, NATO assured other hopefuls that its doors would remain open for new entrants.

The US company Barr Pharmaceuticals is set to acquire a 72.67% stake in the leading Croatian pharmaceutical producer, Pliva, having deposited more than 13.5m Pliva shares with the central depository agency in Zagreb on October 10th.
By securing more than 50% of the Croatian firm's shares, Barr has met the requirement for competing its 2 billion-euro public offer for Pliva.
The depositary agency is in charge of keeping shares in any transaction until a deal is completed.
Official confirmation of the takeover is expected next week.
The EBRD granted a 16m-euro loan to Albania for support and modernisation of the country's energy sector.
The loan, guaranteed by the Albanian state, is to be used by the national power utility KESH for the upgrading of six transmission substations.
The project also aims to support Albania's participation in the regional energy.
The Albanian government sealed a 418m-euro agreement with a joint venture of Bechtel International and the Turkish firm Enka on the construction of a section from the Durres-Morina motorway to Kosovo.
Under the deal, the contractor will build a 57km, four-lane road segment, including a 6km tunnel.
Construction must begin by the end of this month and should completed by June 2009.
Serbia's privatisation agency announced that it has chosen the Bulgarian company Brikel as the best ranked bidder in the tender for a 76.9% stake in the local rubber product manufacturer Trayal Corporation.
Brikel is offering 12.1m euros and pledging an additional 25.1m euros in investments.
The second-ranked bidder in the tender was the Dutch firm, Elcor Holding.
A Malaysian business delegation visited Republika Srpska and held talks at the entity's chamber of commerce.
The delegation expressed interest in investment opportunities in the food, wood processing and metallurgy sectors.
An IMF mission arrived in Bucharest for talks with government and central bank officials.
Mission head Emmanuel van der Mensbrugghe said the Fund expects Romania's economic growth to be 7.1% this year, with annual inflation of around 5.7%.
He voiced concerns over the expanding current account deficit.

Some just don't "get" them, while others see the potential. Also this week: internet addiction, Albania and the EU integration process, and anti-corruption efforts in Bulgaria.

Do blogs breathe new life into journalism, or are they just another form of internet junk?
BiHnet recently hosted a debate on this question, and responses were mixed.
"There are a lot of young talents in the blogosphere," said one commenter, while expressing disappointment with the blogging efforts of well-known journalists and writers.
Another said he has yet to find a local blog that holds his attention for more than a few lines.
"Some persons have been given an opportunity to bore people in one more way... pure waste of traffic!" he writes.
Lelly at Buduca novinarka thinks blogs are useful, but favours those with a personal touch.
"There are several blogs I read on regular basis, where people are simply writing about themselves.
I have my own blog, but I mostly write about things bothering me ... it's simply a little place I visit often."
Writing from Serbia, meanwhile, Ivana diagnoses what sounds like a grave case of web dependency.
"I was horrified to realise that I'm an addict," she writes. "I'm not an alcoholic, smoker or drug addict -- I'm an internet addict.
I sit here and instead of drinking coffee in peace and writing something I wanted to write, I'm opening and closing my Firefox every 15 minutes … I feel my head pulsing as a result of unnecessary nervousness.
"Even when I go to bed I have to open my cell phone and press a little blue letter i and go through e-mails, news, my blog, my bank account -- precisely my negative balance.... as if something important had happened in the last hour or two, or since the last time I connected.
"I'm thinking less and less about my vacation in November, and increasingly more about buying a new laptop ...
People, is there a way to treat this?" Ivana asks.
Elsewhere:
Albanians should spend more time discussing the EU integration process, Mento Beqa writes at shekulli.
Instead, whenever the subject comes up, "the debate is closed, as though it were a transcendental term -- incontestable, and a good sent by God to Albania." Commenting on his post, Ilir Avdiaj agrees that political leaders and the public at large need to change their attitude about the topic.
"Integration by itself can't be the scope.
The scope is the development of the country and in this direction our politicians should push more. "
But Bledar Zani feels confident this will happen as the Stablisation and Association Process continues.
"People's awareness will become more important in the second phase," he writes.
In Bulgaria, Boycho Kamenov takes issue with Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev's assertion that it's up to the Bulgarian people to eliminate corruption.
"This is true but not quite.
The prime minister is right that it is up to us to stop corruption, but we will find it difficult to accomplish this because of the structure of government.
The soil for corruption remains fertile first of all because the governance is not properly organised, to say the least.
There is no need even to mention the government's special acquisitions orders and concessions by which the state actually legalises corruption."
"If as the prime minister says, we are to be successful in the fight against corruption, we must first look at our cumbersome system of government and put an end to the adoption of various enactments that practically legalise corruption," Kamenov writes.
And that wraps up this week's tour of the Balkan blogosphere.

Dutch Group Recommends Turkey Start EU Accession Talks Within Two Years
An influential Dutch advisory group has said Turkey's EU accession talks should start within two years, but also urges Ankara to address continuing human rights problems.

An influential Dutch advisory group has recommended that Turkey's EU accession talks start within two years, stressing that there is room for Islam within the 25-nation bloc.
"Admitting a Muslim country may be new to the EU, but does not principally differ from earlier expansions," the Dutch Advisory Council on International Affairs (AIV) said in a report released Wednesday (25 August).
The 30-page report, available in the Dutch language only, came out about four months before the leaders of the EU member states are to decide whether to start accession talks with Turkey.
The Dutch government, which took up the rotating six-month EU presidency in July, has included the issue on its agenda of priorities.
Speaking before the European Parliament last month, Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende said that if the European Council determines at its December summit that Turkey fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria for membership, "Negotiations will be opened with Turkey."
Praising Turkey's reform efforts over the past few years, the AIV also stressed the need for full implementation of new democratic laws.
The report noted that human rights violations were still being observed, particularly at lower bureaucratic levels.
"Turkey can become a member of the EU and talks should be started, but we weigh heavily on human rights," Ben Knapen, vice-chairman of the AIV's European Integration Committee, said on Wednesday. "It is now up to the Turkish government to follow through with the reform process."
The AIV voiced concern over continuing examples of torture and mistreatment of prisoners, abuse of women's rights and restrictions on free expression, saying these could impede the process of EU integration.
"There are major shortfalls in the area of women's rights," the International Herald Tribune quoted Peter Baehr, a human rights expert and member of the advisory council, as saying. "Progress has undoubtedly been made, but concerns remain over the follow through of that progress."
Recommending that Turkey's accession talks open within 24 months, the group noted that the process could start even earlier if Ankara continues to successfully implement democratic reforms.
However, the report warned against setting a specific target date for EU entry.
"An accession date should not be set because it could create false expectations and risk compromising careful preparation to an artificial, politically loaded timetable," the report said.
The AIV advises the Dutch government and parliament on foreign policy issues, including human rights, peace and security, development co-operation and European integration.
Diplomatic Diary: Slovenian Embassy in Macedonia assumes NATO role
The Slovenian Embassy in Skopje has become a new contact point for NATO as it helps Macedonia prepare for future membership.
Also in diplomacy: Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader meets with Pope Benedict XVI and Romania and Ukraine initiate a new border crossing.

The Slovenian Embassy in Skopje announced that it has assumed the role of NATO contact embassy in Macedonia, as of January 1st.
Slovenia vowed full assistance to Macedonia's "accelerated preparations" for entry in the Alliance, and will work to improve communication with the Macedonian public and institutions, raising public awareness of the benefits and obligations of NATO membership.
Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel visited Skopje on Friday (January 19th).
Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis hailed Croatia's progress last week during a visit to Zagreb.
He said the country could serve as an example to the rest of the region in terms of Euro-Atlantic integration.
His comment followed talks with Croatian counterpart Ivo Sanader.
Pope Benedict XVI held a private audience Wednesday (January 17th) with Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader.
Afterwads, Sanader said the pontiff showed great interest in the progress of Zagreb's EU accession talks, and accepted an invitation to visit Croatia in the future.
High Representative to Bosnia and Herzegovina Christian Schwarz-Schilling and EU security chief Javier Solana condemned any attempt to link the future of the Bosnian Serb entity, Republika Srpska, (RS) with the Kosovo status issue.
Following talks with Solana and EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn in Brussels on Wednesday (January 17th), Schwarz-Schilling said the EU is unhappy with comments from Belgrade suggesting the outcome of the Kosovo status issue would impact RS.
Resolving Kosovo's final status will not jeopardise security in the region, Romanian Defence Minister Sorin Frunzaverde and visiting Macedonian counterpart Lazar Elenovski agreed last week.
They said regional co-operation is key to Euro-Atlantic integration and the stability of Southeast Europe.
Romanian President Traian Basescu and his Ukrainian counterpart, Viktor Yushchenko, inaugurated a new joint border crossing over the Tisza River last week at Sighetu Marmatiei-Solotvino.
They also discussed bilateral ties, expressing interest in boosting co-operation in the energy sector.

Business Roundup
A review of business and economic news from the Balkans since 11 April.
(Various sources -- 11/04/03 - 18/04/03)
A review of business and economic news from the Balkans since 11 April:
The European Commission has launched the Regional Economic Development project in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
Under the project, 7m euros will be allocated for economic reconstruction and creating new jobs across BiH.
According to the Bulgarian Industrial Association, 180 Bulgarian companies have applied to participate in the post-war reconstruction of Iraq. Areas where companies might provide help include seaport and airport administration, capital construction, public health, education and local governance.
The Hungarian bank OTP offered 311m euros for 100 per cent of Bulgaria's DSK Bank.
The other contender, Austria's Erste Bank, offered 293m euros.
The preferred buyer will be named by the end of the month, while the signing of the privatisation contract is expected in May.
The Albanian power company KESH announced it has settled its debts, worth $43m, and will now be able to launch new investments.
These will focus mainly on reconstruction of transmission lines and rehabilitation of two thermal power plants.
The international rating agency Moody's said in a report on 16 April that Greece's 'A1' long-term debt rating will likely remain unchanged in the near term.
The rating, however, is constrained by the relatively high level of government debt and by uncertainties regarding long-term economic growth prospects.
Under an agreement reached on 15 April, the World Bank will cut interest rates on loans to Turkey.
Economy Minister Ali Babacan said the agreement will result in $75m in savings.
The receivers of Macedonian apparel maker Astibo selected a buyer for the troubled company.
Stip-based Albatros offered to pay a price of 2.1m euros; signing of the sales contract is expected within a week.
During a visit by Macedonian Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski, Ankara pledged to place orders with Macedonia's two state-owned military equipment manufacturers, Eurokompozit and Suvenir.
Turkey also plans to donate $1m in military equipment to Macedonia.
Croatia's GDP saw a real growth of 5.2 per cent last year, with an 11 per cent investment hike and solid consumer demand. The national statistical office noted the economic growth rate last year was the highest since the start of the transition period.
An EBRD visiting delegation pledged to finance 85 projects in Romania, worth a total of 2.3 billion euros.
The Bank will secure credits to large infrastructure projects, especially in the energy sector, and will look for direct participation in SMEs through purchase of minority shares.
The EBRD and the European Investment Bank will lend 127m euros for reconstruction of Serbia's railroads, including a complete overhaul of some 100km routes.
The European Agency for Reconstruction will be responsible for completing the project.

AKP and CHP Work Together to Uncover Corruption
Politicians in Turkey have come under increased scrutiny with the release of the Graft Commission's report on corruption.
By Fatih Baran for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 11/07/03
The Graft Commission, established by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and the opposition Republican People's Party, has presented a report to parliament, outlining allegations of corruption during the tenure of past administrations.
It is now expected to propose suggestions for setting up new investigative committees to focus on the problem of graft, which is estimated to have cost Turkey $150 billion over the years.
The commission worked for the past four and half months researching the report.
It spoke with 51 people, including former Motherland Party (ANAP) leader and Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz; former ministers Cumhur Ersumer, Gunes Taner, Koray Aydin and Husamettin Ozkan; former Central Bank Governor Gazi Ercel; former head of the Banking Supervision and Regulation Agency Zekeriya Temizel; former Sumerbank owner Hayyam Garipoglu; and businessman Korkmaz Yigit.
The report suggests limiting legislative immunity and facilitating the retrial of former ministers and prime ministers, and recommends that specialised courts be set up to fight corruption.
Under current practice, if a minister or prime minister is still in office, or facing charges for the period when he was in office, a parliamentary investigative committee must find him guilty before the case can be referred to the Supreme Court.
The committee must recommend sending the case to the Court by an absolute majority of at least 226 votes, out of the total 550 seats in parliament.
The graft commission has no executive power, and is limited to reporting its findings to parliament.
If it reports any irregularities, parliament can launch an investigation.
The main allegations disclosed in the report involve the DSP-MHP-ANAP coalition that was in power before the November 2002 elections.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, speaking at his party's convention, said the probe into alleged corruption during the past several governments is continuing.
When it is complete -- and the full extent of the graft disclosed -- the nation will be shocked, Erdogan said.
He charged that during past administrations the state was "robbed" both from the inside and outside.
For the past decade, Turkey has been navigating a series of graft dossiers, but political bargaining led to the closure of all corruption investigations in the 1990s, before any results were achieved.
During the campaign leading up to the general election last November, Erdogan's AKP promised to uncover the corruption and make it known to the public.
Now the sincerity of those promises will be put to the test, as Turks await the outcome of the process.

European aircraft manufacturer Airbus and Turkish Airspace Industries (TAI) signed a 393m-euro agreement on Thursday (December 4th) under which TAI will produce parts for the A350 airliner.
This is the first big production programme for TAI in civil aviation, TAI Chief Executive Atalay Efeer said.
The Airbus A350 is a new mid-sized, long-range jet for which Airbus has booked 4,060 orders as of November.
The Pristina International Airport (PIA) received an operational licence from the Civil Aviation Authority of Kosovo on Monday (December 1st).
Prior to the issuance of this licence, Iceland's Administration of Civil Aviation monitored PIA operations.
The Serbian dinar hit an all-time low against the euro Tuesday (December 2nd) at 90.52 dinars to the euro, despite a 10m-euro intervention by the Central Bank.
The dinar faced strong depreciation pressures in the past two months after the global crisis led to capital outflows and panic withdrawals from local banks.
The Republika Srpska (RS) finance ministry agreed to cut the personal income tax from 10% to 8% in 2009, Finance Minister Aleksandar Dzombic said on Wednesday (December 3rd).
The changes require parliamentary approval by the RS ruling party, SNSD, which has a clear majority.
Dzombic explained the move aims to spare the business sector from pressure for pay increases and is the first concrete measure by the RS government to mitigate the effects of the global crisis.
Norway's Technor Energy Asa will invest about 200m euros in a hydropower project in Republika Srpska (RS), RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik announced on November 28th.
The company plans to build six hydro plants on the Bosna River, with a total capacity of 75 MW.
Construction will start in 2009.
For the second month, Romania ranked first in October in retail sales growth among the EU members, registering a 9.4% annual rise, the European statistical bureau Eurostat announced on Wednesday (December 3rd).
On a monthly basis, Romania recorded both the steepest decline (2.1%) and highest growth (2.6%), Eurostat reported.
The Albanian National Statistics Institute (INSTAT) said on Wednesday (December 3rd) that businesses in Albania operate on only 25% of the country's territory.
Companies in Albania tend to cluster in the cities of Lezha, Tirana and Vlora.
According to INSTAT, 50% of them operate in the district of Tirana and Durres.

Macedonia urged to ramp up reforms for 2008 NATO invitation
Macedonia will need to push ahead with the required changes in order to receive an invitation for membership at next year's NATO summit.

The Macedonian foreign and defence ministers -- Antonio Milososki and Lazar Elenovski respectively-- met with NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer and the ambassadors of NATO member states in Brussels last week.
Talks focused on the anticipated NATO membership invitation for the Adriatic Charter countries -- Albania, Croatia and Macedonia -- which many expect in 2008. The group discussed what Macedonia must do for this to happen.
"The NATO secretary-general and the ambassadors welcomed the progress made so far and encouraged the ministers to continue to work in certain areas," said James Appathurai, a spokesman for de Hoop Scheffer.
According to sources, the NATO chief said invitations are planned for next year for the Group, but there are no guarantees, as all three countries need to implement reforms.
In the case of Macedonia, there is a rift between the government and the opposition.
The Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), the second largest opposition party in Macedonia, left Parliament in January.
Political dialogue between the government and the party was launched in April, in hopes that difficulties are overcome and DUI returns to the institutions.
Relations between the government and the opposition must continue to improve, Appathurai said.
The Alliance requires that changes are irreversible, and the progress that is achieved is durable, the spokesman added.
NATO has also urged Macedonia to show progress in tackling corruption, rule of law, human trafficking and decentralisation.
Reforms in police and the judiciary are seen as particularly important.
Macedonian government officials say the country has intensified its fight against corruption and human trafficking over the past six months.
Numerous civil officials suspected of bribery have been arrested and tried, and prosecutions of human trafficking cases have increased, they say.
According to Milososki, Macedonia has a good chance at receiving an invitation for membership and will not miss it.
"We have a positive evaluation.
That does not guarantee [membership], but [increases our] obligation to continue with the progress in three areas -- tackling corruption and organised crime, decentralisation and the political dialogue."
Serbia celebrates Eurovision victory
Belgrade will host the 2008 Eurovision after Serbian singer Marija Serifovic won this year's song contest late Saturday, lifting spirits in her home country.

Some 30,000 Serbs gathered in the centre of Belgrade on Sunday evening (May 13th) to welcome home Marija Serifovic, the winner of the 2007 Eurovision song contest.
The finale was held at Finland's Helsinki Arena the previous night.
"I won for Serbia, I won for all of you!" the 22-year-old singer said upon her return.
Serifovic secured her country's first award in the competition with the emotional ballad "Molitva" ("Prayer"), scoring 268 points in a 42-nation telephone vote count.
Her win marked Serbia's Eurovision debut as an independent nation and entitled it to host the next Eurovision contest in May 2008.
"I'm so glad it wasn't some war song," Aleksandar Tijanic, the head of Serbia's RTS state television, said on Sunday. "Hosting this event in Belgrade next year will mean we have finally crossed into normality."
Serifovic won the award after eight nations, including all former Yugoslav republics, gave her the highest possible score of 12 points.
Under the competition's rules, viewers can vote for performers from other countries, but not for those from their own.
The Serbian singer's victory over competitors from 23 other nations brought crowds into the streets of Belgrade late Saturday.
Lawmakers, who were still debating the formation of a pro-reform government, interrupted their session to applaud the winner.
"Well done Marija!
The whole of Serbia is proud tonight and celebrates, thanks to you," Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said in a letter to the singer.
President Boris Tadic and the heir to the Serbian throne, Prince Alexander, also greeted the winner.
"It has been a European vote for European Serbia," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said, congratulating the country on its victory.
Serifovic also described her win as marking a new start for her country.
"I honestly think that a new chapter has opened in Serbia and not only in music," she said. "This victory is for the new Serbia."
The Eurovision contest, which has been held annually since 1956, has been dominated in the past by Western singers.
This year, however, Eastern European performers took 14 of the top 16 spots in the final, watched by more than 100 million viewers.
Ukrainian drag queen Verka Serduchka, whose country won the 2004 Eurovision contest, finished second on Saturday.
He won 235 points for his song, "Dancing Lasha Tumbai".
The Russian trio Serebro came next with 207 points for their "Song No. 1".
Turkey's Kenan Dogulu was fourth, winning 163 points with "Shake It Up, Shekerim".
Bulgarian drumming duo Elitsa Todorova and Stoyan Yankoulov came in fifth with 157 points for their folk-based piece, "Water".
Of the other Southeast European countries that went to the final, Greece finished seventh with a score of 139 points, four spots ahead of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which won 106 points.
Romania and Macedonia took the 13th and 14th positions with 84 and 73 points, respectively.
Serbia gets pro-democracy government; ultranationalist resigns as speaker
After Serbia's largest democratic parties reached an agreement on forming a new government, ultranationalist Tomislav Nikolic resigned from the post of parliament speaker.

Tomislav Nikolic of the Serbian Radical Party has ended his short tenure as parliament speaker.
He resigned on Sunday (May 13th) after a debate that lasted some 12 hours.
Nikolic had been voted into the post on May 7th with parliamentary support from Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), when it seemed the reformist parties in Serbia would be unable to agree on a new coalition government.
After stepping down, Nikolic accused Kostunica of betraying their agreement and siding with President Boris Tadic, whom he said would "betray Serbia".
While he was parliament speaker, Nikolic argued that Serbia should not join the EU and NATO, but rather become part of a new bloc led by Russia.
Nikolic's election as speaker triggered turmoil in Serbia's capital market, with the dinar dropping 2.5% against the euro and shares of top Serbian companies plummetting as much as 13%.
International repercussions followed.
European Commission representatives did not sign a previously announced visa benefit agreement, and the country's assumption of the Council of Europe presidency on Friday was met with questions about its suitability for the post.
Finally, after a secret meeting between their leaders, the main parties in the so-called democratic bloc -- Tadic's Democratic Party (DP), the DSS and and G17 Plus -- announced they had reached a coalition deal.
The new government is to have a total of 25 members: a prime minister, one deputy prime minister, 22 ministers and one without portfolio.
Kostunica will continue as prime minister, and seven cabinet posts will go to his DSS.
The DP will hold the post of deputy prime minister, 11 ministries and the post of minister without portfolio.
The G17 Plus party will have four ministries.
Together, these parties hold 130 of the 250 seats in Parliament.
The DP will control the military services and the DSS will control the police.
A person who is not a member of any party will head the secret police.
Tadic is to head the National Security Council, which will co-ordinate the work of all security and intelligence services.
Control of the police and security services had been a key sticking point in the protracted negotiations.
The DP has insisted it should take over these services to launch major reforms and clear up the obstacles that have been blocking full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
Kostunica, however, was reluctant to cede control.
"The parties have put state interests above those of their own," the prime minister said as the deal was announced.
Parliament will now have to work day and night to appoint the government before the legal deadline of midnight Tuesday.
Commenting on the weekend's developments, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said Serbia's journey to EU membership could "resume immediately", if the government proved to be "pro-reform and pro-European".
Talks with the EU were suspended a year ago after Belgrade authorities failed to extradite indicted General Ratko Mladic to the Hague-based tribunal.
Diplomatic Diary: Slovenian president visiting BiH
Slovenia's Tuerk is on a two-day visit to BiH.
Also in diplomatic news this week: Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis was in Malta, and Germany will support Albania's EU bid.

Slovenian President Danilo Tuerk launched a two-day official visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina on Monday (October 13th), making stops in Sarajevo, Banja Luka, Mostar and the Potocari memorial centre.
Tuerk pledged his country's support to BiH's EU accession process and said the country could receive candidate status fairly soon.
"We are talking about abolition of visas in a year or so and candidate status for BiH in 2010," Turk told reporters after a meeting with BiH's tripartite presidency members.
Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis wrapped up a two-day official visit to Malta on Saturday (October 11th).
At a meeting Friday with his Maltese counterpart, Lawrence Gonzi, Karamanlis praised the excellent relations between the two countries and added that co-operation should be maintained and further developed.
The two leaders also discussed the global financial turmoil and issued a joint statement saying radical responses are necessary on all levels to tackle the crisis.
Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek on Wednesday (October 8th) rejected any formula that involves a privileged partnership for Turkey instead of full-fledged EU membership. "A privileged partnership or such formulas cannot be accepted.
Any candidate country that complies with the criteria should have the right to become an EU member," Topolanek told a joint press conference in Ankara after meeting with Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Czech Republic is scheduled to assume the EU's rotating presidency in January.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday (October 8th) that Germany supports Albania's integration into the EU and will sign the protocol for the country's NATO membership.
Merkel met with Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha during his visit to Berlin.
The German chancellor praised Albania's progress in fighting organised crime and corruption but urged the government to do even more.
Berisha reiterated his country's commitment to fighting corruption and vowed to speed up the necessary EU-related reforms.
Visa liberalisation for Albanian citizens wanting to visit the Czech Republic and a nonstop flight between the two countries would boost bilateral co-operation, Albanian President Bamir Topi said on October 7th.
During a meeting in Tirana, Topi and Czech Senate Chairman Premysl Sobotka agreed that current bilateral co-operation is "at a satisfactory level".
However, Albania wants to strengthen economic ties with the Czech Republic as well as boost tourism, Topi said.

Albania, Bulgaria and Macedonia sealed an agreement on the construction of the regional Bourgas-Vlore oil pipeline on Wednesday (January 31st) in Skopje.
The project will be run by the US-based company AMBO, and a tender to select a contractor for the facility's construction will soon be announced.
The 912km pipeline, connecting the Bulgarian port of Bourgas with Albania's Vlora port, via Macedonia, will carry Caspian oil from the Black Sea to the Adriatic, with an expected annual capacity of 35m tonnes.
Bulgaria's government sealed a contract with the Spanish company FCC on Tuesday (January 30th) for the construction -- with Romania -- of a second bridge over the Danube River.
The Spanish firm won an international tender for the project.
The 100m-euro, EU-backed project should take 38 months, with construction to start in May.
Croatia and the World Bank have successfully completed talks on the second Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL2) worth 150m euros, according to the Bank's office in Zagreb.
The loan is aimed at supporting the Croatian authorities' implementation of key institutional and structural reforms and accelerating the country's EU accession process.
The Bank's board is expected to endorse the credit in May.
Austria's Mobilkom was the only bidder in an international tender for a third wireless licence in Macedonia.
The agency's tender commission is expected to announce the winner by February 12th.
Greece and Italy inked an agreement on Wednesday (January 31st) that envisions the acceleration of work on a natural gas pipeline connecting the two countries, which should carry Azerbaijani gas via Turkey to Western markets. The initial protocol for the 212km undersea pipeline was sealed in 2005.
It would run from Stavrolimenas, Greece, to Otranto, Italy, and is expected to cut the EU's dependence on Russian gas supplies.
Montenegro and Singapore-based Aman Resorts signed a leasing agreement on Wednesday (January 31st), under which the company will run three leading Montenegrin hotels -- Sveti Stefan, Milocer and Kraljicina Plaza.
Aman Resorts will pay Montenegro 2.1m euros annually, as well as 10% of earned profits.
It also committed itself to investing at least 40m euros for modernisation of the hotels in the next two years.

Montenegrin, Croatian fishermen warned about new species of fish
Marine biology institutions in Croatia and Montenegro are attempting to educate local fishermen about new -- and sometimes dangerous -- species of fish turning up in the Adriatic.

Marine biologists in Montenegro and Croatia are warning local fishermen about new species of fish, some poisonous, that have appeared in the Adriatic's increasingly warm waters.
The Institute of Oceanography and Fishing in Split, Croatia, and the Institute of Marine Biology in Kotor, Montenegro, collaborated on a brochure about 28 species that have been discovered recently in the Adriatic.
Institute of Marine Biology Director Aleksandar Joksimovic said the two organisations decided to develop the brochure after a fisherman named Ilija Rafailovic caught a blunthead puffer.
''We thought it would be useful to warn fishermen about new species.
The Croatian institute had more information because more of the new species were caught and researched there, so we asked it for help," said Joksimovic.
He added that while the blunthead puffer was the first to be documented in the Adriatic, it is likely not the only one, explaining that "it was a female and we believe it would have spawned soon".
''The blunthead puffer's internal organs are poisonous, especially its liver," Joksimovic said. He added, "Fishermen used to catch it in the Mediterranean, mostly around Sardinia and in the western Mediterranean."
His institute plans to search for more new species in the Adriatic, as global warming is expected to influence sea life further in the next ten years.
''Sea temperatures in the Adriatic last summer reached up to 30 degrees Celsius. ...
The appearance of fish such as blunthead puffer that prefer warmer seas confirms the impact of global warming,'' he said.
Through the FAO AdriaMed project, the Institute of Marine Biology in Kotor plans to collaborate with similar institutions in Italy, Croatia, Albania, and Slovenia to help develop sustainable fishing.
United States opens embassy in Kosovo
The US Office in Pristina officially became the US Embassy in Kosovo on Tuesday.
The change reflects a new phase in Washington's commitment to the newly independent state, US officials said.

The US Office in Pristina officially became the United States Embassy in Kosovo on Tuesday (April 8th).
The United States joins Great Britain, Germany, Albania, and Switzerland in opening embassies in Kosovo since the former province declared independence from Serbia on February 17th.
"As a consequence of Kosovo's new status as an independent country, recognised by many of the world's most powerful and prosperous nations, we have now been granted permission by the US Congress to open formally as a full-fledged US Embassy," Chargé d'Affaires Tina Kaidanow said.
The first US mission in Kosovo was established on July 6th 1996 and has played a significant role in important decisions.
"While the US Office in Pristina has operated for many years with all the responsibilities and tasks of a busy diplomatic mission, the designation as an embassy reflects a new phase in our development and underscores our deep and lasting commitment to work on the progress of Kosovo and all its people," Kaidanow said.
"Every day, we engage in efforts aimed at improving the lives of ordinary people in Kosovo and addressing the needs of Kosovo's many diverse ethnic communities," she added.
The US mission has worked to improve Kosovo's economic performance, to develop its democratic institutions, to celebrate its diverse cultural and ethnic heritage, and to ensure full rights for all ethnic communities.
"We have developed contacts with a huge range of people from every background and every political orientation, and we value the insights and opinions they provide," said Kaidanow.
Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu, who attended Tuesday's ceremony, paraphrased late President Ibrahim Rugova, who lauded the friendship between Kosovo and the United States. "The United States is our friend, and we will co-operate closely."
Sejdiu said the embassy opening was only one part of establishing the diplomatic relationship.
The second part comes when Kosovo opens its embassy in Washington.
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci echoed those sentiments, saying the opening was about more than a change of status.
"Empowering this office with the status of embassy says to the world that the United States has faith in Kosovo.
And we as a people are humbled and honoured."
"As Kosovo continues on its journey among the free and democratic nations of the world, we will always have a special place in our heart for the people of the United States of America," Thaci added.
Report: Bulgarian drug trafficking finances key terrorist groups
A Bulgarian parliamentary committee adopted a report Wednesday suggesting that part of the funding for operations by terrorist organisations such as Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad came from drug trafficking through Bulgaria.

Some of the huge profits from drug trafficking through Bulgaria have ended up in the coffers of terrorist groups based in the Middle East, according to a report adopted by a Bulgarian parliamentary committee on Wednesday (April 9th).
Bulgarian crime rings involved in trafficking synthetic narcotics sometimes team up with Arab citizens linked to terrorist organisations, reaping significant profits from smuggling through the Balkan nation's territory, lawmakers said.
"We can draw the conclusion that part of the money accumulated from drug trafficking is used to finance the operations of terrorist organisations such as Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, and Christian militias," the parliament's 27-member Internal Security and Public Order Committee said.
Hezbollah is a Lebanese-based Shiite guerrilla organisation, while Islamic Jihad is a Palestinian militant group operating in the Palestinian territories, particularly on the Gaza Strip.
Both are listed by the EU and the United States as terrorist organisations.
Situated on one of the main drug trafficking routes through the Balkans, Bulgaria "is a transit country, as well as a producer of illicit narcotics", the US State Department said in February.
The parliamentary committee's report focuses on the production and distribution of synthetic drugs and problems in efforts by Bulgaria's interior ministry.
Based on information provided by the State National Security Agency, the panel noted a significant decline in the number of amphetamine labs closed by police in 2006 and 2007.
Law enforcement agencies shut down nine such facilities in 2004 and another four in 2005.
Those numbers dropped to a mere two in 2006 and to only one last year.
Similarly, the amount of illegal drugs seized by police dropped considerably -- plunging from 1,018kg in 2005 to just 169kg in 2007.
The lawmakers attributed this fall to the interior ministry's "alarming practice" of leaking classified information to criminals under investigation.
They took up the matter amid a raging scandal involving questionable contacts between shadowy businessmen and high-ranking ministry officials.
Two senior police officials have been arrested.
It also emerged that Interior Minister Rumen Petkov had met with alleged underworld bosses, prompting calls for his resignation or dismissal. He refuses to quit, and Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev backs him.
Mincho Spasov, chairman of parliament's Interior Committee, told reporters on Wednesday that Petkov's actions were reprehensible.
"If I were in his place, I would quit," he said.
Last week, opposition parties in parliament filed their fifth motion of no confidence against the government over the case.
A vote is expected on Friday.
The EU, which has repeatedly criticised Bulgaria for its ineffective campaign against organised crime and high-level corruption, urged Sofia this week to take urgent action, particularly after the murders of two prominent figures.
Borislav Georgiev, the chief of a nuclear energy company, and Georgi Stoev, the author of several books on the Bulgarian mafia, were shot dead within 24 hours.
"Shootings have continued to take place on a regular basis over the last couple of years and without successful prosecution," European Commission (EC) spokesman Mark Gray said. "Urgent action is required."
EU experts are due to visit Bulgaria next month ahead of an EC report in July on the country's progress in fighting high-level corruption and contract killings.
More than 150 people have been killed by gangland assassins in Bulgaria since 2001, with not a single suspect convicted.
Turkish State System to Receive Major Overhaul
Turkey is streamlining its government.
The changes could mean far fewer deputy ministers and as few as eight ministries, compared to the current 20.
By Fatih Baran for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 02/12/03
Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) plans a major overhaul of public administration, with an eye to reducing barriers and corruption.
The reform programme, which has been submitted to the cabinet for signatures, would introduce private sector practices into the country's bloated and inefficient bureaucracy.
The government had originally intended to legislate a local administration reform plan, but decided to enlarge the scope of reforms.
Under the planned overhaul, the Personnel General Directorate -- one of the most critical units of the state -- will be abolished and Human Resources units, similar to those in the private sector, will be established.
A Strategic Development unit, to be established in the public sector, will direct the development in different sectors.
The number of ministries will be reduced from 20 to eight, with several ministries merged.
Also reduced would be the number of deputy ministers.
Overall, the reforms would shrink government by about 50 per cent and entirely change the structure of the state.
As a result, power would be transferred to local governments -- with the exception of areas covered by the Justice, Defence, Finance and Labour ministries.
Undersecretaries of ministries will become "vice ministers", taking and leaving office as governments change.
The reform also stipulates that the Foreign Ministry, National Security Council General Secretariat and the National Intelligence Organisation and affiliated bodies will be excluded from the general rules and procedures on state hierarchy.
In addition, the Prime Ministry High Board of Supervision will be dissolved and its duty, staff, assets and budget allocated to the Court of Accounts, which would become the highest supervisory body for auditing state expenditures.
"With this revolutionary reform, the powers of the central government will be transferred to local administrations," said Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin as he unveiled the package. He added that at least 500 trillion Turkish liras would be saved annually.
Greece to be first European country to receive Azeri gas directly
BAKU, Azerbaijan -- A senior Azeri energy official said on Wednesday (April 6th) that Greece will be the first European country to which Azerbaijani gas will be supplied directly.
Rovnag Abdullayev, president of state oil company SOCAR, was speaking after his company and Greece's national gas company DEPA signed a memorandum of understanding on the side lines of a Greek-Azeri business forum in Baku.
Currently, Azeri gas is delivered to Greece via Turkey.
Inaugurating the forum alongside Azeri President Ilham Aliyev, Greek President Karolos Papoulias emphasised efforts his country is making to emerge from its deep economic crisis.
He urged Azeri businesses to take advantage of Greece's new investment framework. (Trend, ANA-MPA - 06/04/11)

Businesses Say "No" to Corruption in Bulgaria
Meeting in Sofia, business representatives from around the world have called on Bulgaria to take steps against corruption, which they say poses a serious obstacle to the country's development.
By Ivelina Puhaleva for Southeast European Times in Sofia - 06/01/04
Widespread corruption in Bulgaria is a serious obstacle to the country's entrepreneurs, concluded participants at a business forum of international organisations and experts held last month in Sofia.
According to the president of the Bulgarian International Business Association, Kirko Kirkov, companies perceive the phenomenon as something "improper, but unavoidable, efficient and convenient".
"Corruption saves time, aggravation and resources in relations between the business and the state administration.
It is not good, because this way we can do no plans," he said.
The association is made up of foreign and Bulgarian businessmen. Nearly 200 businesses and companies from more than 25 countries are members, including Paribas, Citibank, Bulgarian-British Chamber of Commerce, Coca-Cola, Danone and Shell.
Kirkov said that the practice of giving money or "presents" to state administrative officials must end.
The business community sees corruption as most widespread in the spheres of privatisation, public procurement, tax services, import and export control and the judiciary system.
It can be much easier to form a new political party than establish a business in Bulgaria, some businessmen complained.
While the full effect of corruption on the economy may be difficult to measure, it plainly sends disconcerting signals to direct foreign investment.
Further, corruption nourishes criminal activity by permitting organised criminal groups to operate outside or on the margins of the law.
Major foreign investors care more about the honesty of courts than about cheap labour.
Corruption decreases the national GDP by approximately 0.9 per cent to 1.2 per cent annually, according to data from the Market Economy Institute.
Those figures also reveal that more than a third of Bulgarian businessmen set aside anywhere from 2 per cent to 10 per cent of the transaction value to bribe officials.
The results of a recent sociological survey conducted by Vitosha Research show that most bribes rarely surpass 250 Bulgarian leva, and it is more a question of saving time than any material advantage.
The enormous amount of permits and patents required by Bulgarian law -- three times more than those required in EU countries -- are at the root of corruption practices, experts say.
For example, in Finland, operating within the telecommunications sector requires only one permit, compared to 12 in Bulgaria.
To combat corruption, representatives of the International Business Association have proposed establishing "clear and simple procedures for access to public institutions", as well as fast and effective control over violators.
Transparency in the actions of state administration representatives is also of paramount importance.
Barroso, Rehn visit Macedonia
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn pledged the EU's commitment to Macedonia's European future, while stressing that the pace of progress depends on implementing reforms and meeting EU standards for free and fair elections.

European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso and EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn visited Macedonia on Friday (17 February).
They held talks with top-level officials, including President Branko Crvenkovski, Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski, Deputy Prime Ministers Radmila Sekerinska and Musa Xhaferi, and Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva.
Receiving EU candidate status was "a major victory for your country" and "clear proof of the EU's commitment to your European future," Barroso said at a press conference. "I want to convey to your citizens a message of confidence and courage on your road to the EU."
However, both Barroso and Rehn struck a cautionary note, saying that further progress towards membership hinged on reforms.
In particular, the EC president said, Brussels will be watching to see whether this year's parliamentary elections meet European standards.
He added that further progress is needed in judicial and police reform.
Although Macedonia has taken important steps forward in overhauling its judiciary, he said, implementation is lagging.
Commenting on Buckovski's earlier description of candidate status as a one-way ticket to the EU, Rehn said he agreed.
However, he warned, "the speed is pretty much in your hands and reaching the next stations depends on how well you will be able to undertake the critical reforms and implement them on the ground."
For his part, Buckovski said that Macedonia does not have time to wait.
"We should continue on the reform course, we should continue the reform processes and move Macedonia towards the EU as fast as possible," he said.
Barroso also touched on another key issue -- liberalising the EU's visa regime for researchers, students and members of the business community.
Negotiations with Macedonia about the issue will begin on 28 March, he said.
However, he stressed, it is up to the bloc's 25 member states to decide on the liberalisation.
During the visit, Sekerinska and Michael Lee, director general of the Enlargement Directorate-General, signed two 53.9m-euro agreements.
The first one is a 47.9m-euro CARDS programme for regional projects, and the second involves an additional 6m euros from CARDS use in the police reform process.
Albania's Berisha argues boycott does not hinder visa liberalisation
TIRANA, Albania -- The opposition Socialist Party's (SP) two month-long parliamentary boycott does not hinder the visa liberalisation that Albania is seeking in 2010, Prime Minister Sali Berisha told lawmakers Thursday (November 12th).
He reiterated that the majority is ready to establish a parliamentary panel to look into the SP's demands.
The SP insists the June general elections were "manipulated" and says the boycott will continue until an investigation is conducted.
A crack in the party surfaced Thursday when five SP lawmakers invited colleagues to quit the boycott for the sake of EU integration reforms and return to parliament next week. (Balkan Web, Ora News, Alsat, Top Channel, Klan - 12/11/09)
Romanian government survives no-confidence vote
Romania's centrist government has survived a parliamentary vote of no confidence initiated by the opposition over a package of health reform laws.
(Bucharest Daily News, Nine o'Clock - 22/02/06; AP, Reuters - 21/02/06)
"We are creating a health care system for the benefit of the citizen, not for the benefit of some people who work in the system," Romanian Prime Minister Calin Popescu-Tariceanu told a joint session of parliament. [Getty Images]
Romania's centrist government survived a parliamentary vote of no-confidence Tuesday (21 February), thus also securing the automatic passage of a package of health reform laws aimed at improving the ailing sector's efficiency and bringing it closer to EU standards.
After four hours of heated and highly politicised debate, the ruling coalition won the vote by 246 to 214.
Several MPs representing parties in the ruling coalition reportedly supported the opposition's motion.
Seeking to avoid lengthy parliamentary debates and to ensure the speedy approval of the proposed bills, Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu moved to invoke special powers last week, saying his government was assuming responsibility for the legislation.
In response, the opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the Greater Romanian Party (PRM) filed the no-confidence motion, describing the laws as "anti-reform". The left-wing PSD, which was in power from 2000 to 2004, argued that the proposed reforms would harm ordinary people and limit their right to health protection.
"The real beneficiaries of this legislation are the wealthy and we firmly reject this anti-social and unconstitutional initiative by the government," PSD Vice President Titus Corlatean said. "This reform does not deal with the biggest problem of the health system, which is an acute lack of money."
Accusing the PSD of being responsible for the current poor state of the country's health system, Tariceanu said the only motive for the opposition's move was to block health reforms designed to improve patient care.
"We are creating a health care system for the benefit of the citizens, not for the benefit of some people who work in the system," the prime minister said during a joint session of parliament.
Increased state support for the health sector has failed to resolve problems confronting it, such as negligence, conflict of interest and corruption, as well as the pervasive lack of financial discipline, accountability and transparency, Tariceanu said last week.
"The public health has gotten worse while funds allocated to health care have grown steadily," he stressed, noting that in 2005 alone, Romania spent 2.8 billion euros on health care.
Citing a World Bank report, Reuters said Romanians paid 303m euros in bribes for health services in 2004.
Before its submission to parliament, the government-proposed reforms were subject to a nearly three-month public debate involving health experts, patients' associations, ministers, politicians and others.
The legislation includes laws on national health programmes, on public and private health insurance systems and on hospitals.
Separate laws deal with the status of physicians, dentists and pharmacists.
Legislative provisions, aimed at reducing corruption, improving health care and boosting the cash-strapped system's revenues, include the introduction of new taxes and measures to raise the accountability of health service managers.
The PSD said on Tuesday its next step would be to challenge the health reform laws before the Constitutional Court.
Croatia present in the most UN peacekeeping missions
There are 17 UN peacekeeping missions active in the world, and Croatia's military and police are participating in 15 of them.
By Ana Blazevic for Southeast European Times in Zagreb – 19/05/08

The UN's latest "Monthly Summary of Contributors of Military and Civilian Peacekeeping Personnel" put Croatia at the very top, with contributions to 15 out of 17 ongoing missions.
Croatia is followed by Bangladesh, Nepal, Nigeria and Sweden, all of which participate in 14 missions.
Just a few years ago, Croatia itself was the beneficiary of a peacekeeping mission, the key UN instrument for maintaining international peace and security.
The missions help countries torn by conflict to develop and maintain conditions for peace.
Croatian troops are currently serving in Burundi, the Western Sahara, Haiti, Cyprus, Lebanon, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia and Eritrea, Kosovo, Liberia, Nepal, Sudan, Timor-Leste, India and Pakistan, Cote D'Ivoire and Georgia.
Four continents are currently home to 68 Croatian peacekeepers.
When it comes to manpower, Pakistan tops that list with 10,629 people allocated around the world.
Croatia first sent troops to Sierra Leone in 1999.
Nearly ten years later, a group of 95 Croatian soldiers will go to the Golan Heights, between Israel and Syria this summer.
Before parliament voted recently, Mate Raboteg, the ministry of defence state secretary, called the new mission a true honour for Croatia, more evidence that it merited its non-permanent membership on the UN Security Council.
With Croatia's path to NATO nearing its culmination, Croatians more than ever are expressing doubts about NATO missions around the world and the possibility of Croatian deployments abroad.
There are more than 200 men and women participating in NATO's ISAF mission in Afghanistan.
Croatians first went there in 2003.
Most of these missions are not considered dangerous.
The NATO mission in Afghanistan is the riskiest, says Tonino Picula, vice president of parliament's Foreign Policy Committee.
"But we also have to be careful about whom we send," says Picula, "so that the incident in the Western Sahara, when a Croatian soldier wrote graffiti at an archaeological site, does not happen again ... we should not disturb the image of our country and the UN."
EP wants visa dialogue, then roadmap for Kosovo
BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Parliament (EP) called on the European Commission (EC) to start a visa liberalisation process with Kosovo, similar to other countries in the region, and asked for a roadmap that would lead to facilitation of visas, followed by full liberalisation.
Tanja Fajon, EP rapporteur on visa liberalisation for the Western Balkans, said on Thursday (November 12th) that Kosovo should not be left out of the visa process "because Kosovo cannot be a black hole in the region".
EP members supported the proposal on visa liberalisation for Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia effective on December 19th.
They say Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina should be included in the visa liberalisation process by mid-2010. (Zeri, Express, Kosova Sot, Koha Ditore, Lajm - 13/11/09)
Religion classes in BiH kindergarten curriculum spark debate
Bosnia and Herzegovina kindergarten classes may become separated into Islamic and non-Islamic classes if a ministry plan is approved.

A plan by educational authorities in Sarajevo to introduce religion classes in kindergarten has divided the public -- between those who think it's a religious right, and those who see it as a threat to multi-ethnicity.
A large part of the Sarajevo population is Bosnian Muslim.
Parents of Bosniak students were polled by Children of Sarajevo head Arzija Mahmutović about adding the Islamic classes to the curriculum.
Mahmutovic is responsible for the 24 public nursery schools in the capital.
However, non-religious parents disagree with the plan, and have started circulating a petition under the slogan "Stop Religious Segregation in Kindergarten".
"I do not want to explain to my 3-year-old son Sven, who is in love with [his Muslim classmate] Esma, why they suddenly have to sit in different rooms.
Nobody has the right to separate them," Vedrana Pinjo-Neuschul, a Bosnian Muslim married to a Jew, wrote.
The petition has received about 5,000 signatures.
Many Islamic parents in Sarajevo say the petition represents "a culmination of an anti-Islamic campaign".
The education ministry will decide whether to implement the same model that exists in colleges -- religion classes as a voluntary option -- or whether they will reject it out of respect for multi-culturalism.
The debate is being supervised by the OSCE, which says that "education in Bosnia and Herzegovina should be inclusive, not exclusive."
"In theory, there is nothing wrong with this, beyond of course adding a subject to the pre-school curriculum that most experts would contend ought not to be taught until students grow much older.
It does raise questions about exclusivity and discrimination, for reports also suggest that such instruction would be purely Islamic in orientation."
"In a multi-national country such as BiH, this threatens to work against the fundamental freedoms guaranteed in the country's own constitution.
Unless it cultivates and creates this sense of belonging among its citizens, regardless of their race or religion or culture, BiH has little prospect of taking its desired place in the larger European family of democratic states," the organisation says.
Business Roundup
A review of business and economic news from the Balkans since 4 March:
(Various sources – 04/03/05 - 11/03/05)
Croatian Telecom (HT) netted 256m-euro revenues in 2004, according to the financial statement approved by the company's board on Tuesday (8 March).
Mobile services through HT's wireless carrier, T-Mobile, were the most profitable, while the Internet services branch posted the lowest revenues.
The macroeconomic performance of the Albanian economy has been remarkable by both regional and international standards, the IMF said Thursday (10 March). Following a slowdown in 2002, economic growth recovered to about 6 per cent in 2003 and 2004, the Fund noted, praising the government for keeping inflation under 4 per cent.
The external current account deficit has narrowed by almost 3 percentage points of GDP and the public debt-to-GDP ratio was reduced by 11.5 per cent to 55.25 per cent in 2002-2004, the IMF said.
Gross foreign investment in Bulgaria reached 1.96 billion euros -- 10 per cent of GDP -- in 2005, registering a 5.8 per cent year-on-year increase.
Austria tops the list of countries with investments in Bulgaria, accounting for about 16 per cent of total foreign investments over the past 13 years.
Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) government decided to revoke zero import duties for milk and meat from Croatia and wheat products from Serbia-Montenegro.
The action followed protests by Bosnian farmers.
Bucharest's City Hall announced that a consortium between ABN Amro and JP Morgan has been selected to broker a 120m-euro bond which municipal authorities plan to float on international capital markets.
No details about the maturity period, interest and launch have been disclosed yet.
The EBRD said on 9 March that the last of a series of four regional seminars will be held on 14 March in Skopje.

An IMF mission led by Hans Flickenschild kicked off a visit to Bulgaria for talks with the finance ministry.
The government's plans for additional state expenditures are expected to be the main topic of discussion.
On arrival, Flickenschild urged local political parties to be moderate in their pre-election promises, particularly with regard to wage growth.
Serbia's Finance Ministry said it has officially asked the legislature to revise the formula for calculating parliamentarians' salaries.
The ministry warned that a recent decision by parliament's administrative committee to double deputies' salaries violates projections in the 2005 budget.
Turkey's leading wireless company, Turkcell, said it may withdraw from the tender for the Iranian telco Irancell, following a decision by the Iranian Parliament to limit the Turkish firm's participation to 49 per cent.
Turkcell, which submitted the winning bid last year, had planned to purchase 70 per cent.
Migrant camp bulldozed in Greece
Thousands of migrants hoping to board ships bound for Western Europe had been staying in makeshift tents, without running water or hygiene.
Authorities cleared out the site Sunday.

Greek police cleared out an illegal migrants' camp in the western port city of Patras on Sunday (July 12th).
The camp, set up around 13 years ago, was being used mainly by Afghans.
"This has been a successful and effective, even if late, demolition," Patras police chief Thanassis Davlouros said.
The camp population had reached up to 1,800 several months ago.
With no running water or proper hygiene facilities, it raised health issues and was becoming a growing source of concern among Patras residents.
Migrants stayed at the camp while preparing to sneak onto ships bound for Italy and other parts of Western Europe.
The number of people living in the makeshift camps has reportedly shrunk in recent months following large-scale arrests and measures by the port authorities to halt the illegal boarding of Italy-bound ferries.
Many occupants are said to have abandoned the site around April, after hearing that authorities planned to close it down.
The operation was launched around dawn Sunday.
Around 80 officers and riot police moved in as bulldozers razed the camp.
Only a makeshift mosque and a tent used by volunteer doctors were left intact.
The authorities said they discovered a total of 44 minors, who were taken to a special centre in northern Greece.
Fifteen people found to possess legitimate documents were moved to a local hotel and another 15, who had no travel documents, were detained and taken for questioning.
"All legal procedures and measures concerning the future of these people have been taken," Euronews quoted Davlouros as saying.
He also told Reuters that the immigrants found during the raid were "mainly Afghans".
While the operation was still in progress, a large fire broke out in the camp and firefighters were called in to prevent the blaze from spreading to nearby buildings.
Local media reports said the reason for the incident was unclear, and that the authorities had previously removed propane canisters from the area.
The blaze caused no injuries.
Meanwhile, ATMs, four cars belonging to state organisations and the entrance of a court building were also torched.
Authorities say the incidents were the work of self-styled anarchists who support the immigrants.
According to Greek news agency ANA-MPA, a second makeshift camp, inhabited by immigrants from African countries mainly, was also raided by police in Patras later Sunday.
An unspecified number of people found to lack legitimate travel documents were detained.
Greece has often been criticised for its treatment of illegal immigrants.
The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), other international organisations and rights groups have also been urging the country to ensure better conditions at reception facilities for immigrants.
Business: Montenegro's tourism industry takes it on the chin
Just 277,000 tourists have visited Montenegro this year.

The number of tourists who visited Montenegro in the first half of 2009 dropped 7% compared to the same period last year, while the number of overnight stays dropped 9%, Tourism Minister Predrag Nenezic announced on Wednesday (July 15th).
He says a total of 277,000 tourists visited during the period, spending a total of 1.5 nights in the country's hotels and other tourist facilities.
Bulgaria and Greece signed an agreement on Tuesday (July 14th) to build a natural gas pipeline linking the Bulgarian city of Stara Zagora and the northern Greek town of Komotini.
The project will be implemented by the Bulgarian Energy Holding, Greece's natural gas monopoly DEPA and Italy's Edison SpA.
Turkey's Koc Holding ranks 172nd on the list of the world's 500 largest corporations, released annually by Fortune Global .
The Turkish company moved up 14 places outpacing such giants as Canon, Walt Disney, Lufthansa, Bridgestone and Coca-Cola.
The European Investment Bank and Cyprus's three biggest banks -- Bank of Cyprus, Marfin Popular Bank and Hellenic Bank -- signed a 228m-euro loan agreement offering long term loans to Cypriot SMEs, media reported.
The agreements are part of a broader programme to boost liquidity of European SMEs.
The IMF criticised the Kosovo administration for increasing spending by 39%.
According to the IMF, the government is spending more than it can afford and is adopting laws that have no certain financial support.
The IMF urged the government to avoid any further salary increases in the public sector prior to the November municipal elections.

Macedonian students win US State Department award
Four Macedonian students were honoured for a website dedicated to the issue of child poverty.
By Marina Stojanovska for Southeast European Times in Skopje -- 21/07/06

Four students from the Metodija Mitevski Brico Primary School in Delcevo, Macedonia, were co-winners of a prize conferred by the US Department of State for websites that teach about the importance of international affairs and diplomacy.
Ana Gjorgievska, Elena Gjorgievska, Zoran Dimitrovski and Zikica Popovski, the designers of the site, will be granted $2,000 each, and their teacher Roza Stamenkovska and the school will receive $500 each.
The students were Platinum Prize winners in the 2006 Doors to Diplomacy contest.
Their site, fightpoverty.mmbrico.com, focuses on child poverty and ways in which international relations can address the problems that contribute to it.
"Our school is involved in several projects and one of them is the project for connecting schools via the internet through which we learned about the Web-diplomats competition," Stamenkovska said. "Last year we worked within a project, All Together -- United World where we won a letter of praise.
This year, we applied again and made a project treating a less global topic, poverty, with special emphasis to children poverty."
"The website has multifold goals: elevating the awareness with older populations, decreasing poverty through presentation of the consequences and uniting all young people in creating a joint resolution that will be delivered to any government in the world," Stamenkovska said.
Upon the news of the award, the students and Stamenkovska were received by President Branko Crvenkovski and Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski.
A total of 305 teams of students-- ages 15 to 18 -- from 46 countries took part in the competition, sponsored by the Global SchoolNet Foundation and the US State Department.
Along with the Delcevo students, students of the Florida Virtual School in Orlando, Florida, also won the Platinum Prize for their website "Golden Bridges: Connecting People to Peace".
Istanbul Governor Says Group Behind November Bombings Broken Up
Confirming al-Qaeda's link to the November suicide bombings, Istanbul's governor says the cell behind the blasts has been broken up.
The announcement follows new arrests and the reported seizure of more than 500 kg of explosives.
A total of 35 people have been charged so far.
(Reuters, AFP, BBC - 26/12/03; AFP, AP - 25/12/03; BBC - 24/12/03)
The group behind the November suicide bombings in Istanbul has been broken up, city governor Muammer Guler said at a news conference Friday (26 December).
He confirmed that the group is linked to the al-Qaeda terrorist network.
"We have uncovered all the details related to the organisation of the attacks," Guler said, adding that this had helped prevent further incidents.
Suicide bombers rammed pickup trucks loaded with explosives into the Beth Israel and Neve Shalom synagogues in Istanbul on 15 November.
Five days later, similar attacks targeted the British consulate and the offices of the London-based HSBC bank in the city.
A total of 62 people were killed in the four explosions, which injured more than 700 others.
The resulting police investigation has resulted in the arrests of dozens of suspects.
"The suicide attacks were carried out by elements trying to organise for al-Qaeda in Turkey," Guler said. "We can comfortably say that we have broken up the organisation's Istanbul activities."
Al-Qaeda and a Turkish group, the Islamist Great Eastern Raiders Front (IBDA-C), claimed responsibility for the bombings.
Police have so far brought charges against 35 people, Guler said.
A state security court in Istanbul is also expected to decide whether any of the 10 suspects sent there on Friday will be charged.
Harun Ilhan, who has reportedly confessed to being a member of the al-Qaeda network, was among those ten and was taken earlier to the site of the Neve Shalom synagogue to help recreate events surrounding the attack there, Reuters reported.
Ilhan is said to have spent a year in Afghanistan after evading military service in Turkey.
During Guler's press conference to announce the progress in the investigation, police displayed five Kalashnikov rifles, pistols, walkie-talkies and eight sacks of RDX explosives seized during the probe.
More than six tonnes of chemical fertiliser were used in the four blasts, Reuters quoted the Istanbul governor as saying.
A report in the semi-official Anadolu news agency said more than 500 kg of explosives were seized during raids on sites in three districts of Istanbul -- enough to build five truck bombs similar to those used in the November bombings, sources say.
Security experts say Turkey is an attractive target for militant Islamists who hate its secular political system and close links with the West.
Trial against terror suspects kicks off in BiH
The trial against three suspects charged with plotting terrorist attacks on unidentified Western targets in Europe opened in Sarajevo on Thursday.

The trial of three suspects charged with plotting terrorist attacks on unidentified Western targets in Europe opened in Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) State Court in Sarajevo on Thursday (20 July).
Mirsad Bektasevic, a 19-year-old Swedish national of Bosnian origin, and Abdulkadir Cesur, a 21-year-old Turkish national living in Denmark, were arrested on 19 October 2005 on suspicion of terrorist activities.
A police raid on the premises they were renting turned up a "suicide belt" and black masks, nearly 20kg of explosives, and videotapes showing how to make of a bomb and giving instructions for prayer before a suicide attack.
The third indictee, 29-year-old Bajro Ikavonic, is a BiH citizen.
He was arrested the following month along with two other Bosnians, Senad Husanovic and Amir Bajric, who were later released on bail.
Bektasevic and Cesur arrived in BiH with the intention to commit a terrorist act -- either there or elsewhere in Europe country -- in order to pressure countries to pull their forces out of Iraq and Afghanistan, prosecutors say.
The two men allegedly rented apartments in Sarajevo and made contact with Ikanovic, from whom they bought explosives.
An audiotape of a conversation over a mobile phone showed Bektasevic, codenamed "Maximus," as asking a man identified as Abdul Basit to send him money "for the really good stuff I found here".
After busting the group last year, the BiH authorities notified the Danish and British authorities of their findings.
That led to several arrests, including that of Basit.
Swedish authorities have also co-operated in the investigation.
Quoting the indictment, the AP reported that the "persons arrested in Great Britain, who are charged with the criminal act of causing an explosion and general danger, Junuz Culi and Vasem Ahmet Mugala, owned a Swedish telephone number and a Bosnian telephone number that was used by suspect Mirsad Bektasevic".
Rejecting all charges, defence attorneys have described the indictment as legally untenable and the evidence as "questionable".
But the prosecutors appear confident they will be able to prove their case.
Canadian investors look to Southeast Europe, Turkey
With reforms under way and the potential for EU membership, Southeast Europe is increasingly becoming an area of interest to Canadian investors and firms.

Canadian business investors are showing a heightened interest in Southeast Europe and Turkey, seeing the region's potential as a new market and gateway to other markets.
At a conference in Toronto last month, members of the business community, investors and area experts discussed the experiences of leading Canadian companies already doing business in the region, highlighting the profound socioeconomic changes that are under way.
The goal of EU membership is the driving force behind many of these changes, said Linda McDonald, director of the Europe commercial relations division at International Trade Canada.
Two countries -- Bulgaria and Romania -- are already on the threshold of EU membership, with entry slated for 1 January 2007.
Croatia and Turkey are in negotiations, and Macedonia is an official candidate for membership.
With careful planning and strategic selection of partners, Canadian companies can benefit, McDonald said.
With a skilled labour force and investment opportunities in areas such as telecommunications and information technology, tourism, mining, energy, construction, healthcare and agriculture, the region has much to offer, conference participants noted.
As a more favourable investment climate develops, companies will be increasingly keen to explore the possibilities.
According to Ivan Vejvoda, executive director of the Balkan Trust for Democracy of the US German Marshall Fund, countries in the region are beginning to catch up with other members of the Central European Initiative (CEI).
Creating economic opportunity is needed so people can actually feel the benefits of democracy, he said.
The conference, "Business Strategies in an Enlarging EU: Opportunities in South Eastern Europe and Turkey", was jointly organised by the Munk Centre for International Studies at the University of Toronto and the Canadian-Turkish Business Council.
It drew 110 participants, including leading Canadian business investors with significant experience in the region.
In the last decade, bilateral trade between Canada and Turkey, which is the world's 17th largest economy, has more than tripled. In 2004, it totaled $975m, with Canadian exports at $365m and imports from Turkey at $610m.
Canadian direct investment in Turkey is now valued at over $766m.
Macedonian government seeks better access to justice through mediation
As an alternative to litigation, mediation has the potential to lessen the burden on the judiciary and foster greater efficiency.
A new law drafted by the Macedonian government seeks to promote this method of dispute resolution.
By Marina Stojanovska for Southeast European Times in Skopje – 27/04/06
“We are very keen to promote this efficient way of resolving business disputes in Macedonia," said IFC Senior Programme Manager Antoine Courcelle-Labrousse. [File]
A new law drafted by the Macedonian government promotes mediation as an extra-judiciary procedure for resolving disputes.
The law -- part of an overall judicial reform package aimed at meeting EU criteria -- will be applicable in civic, trade, employment and consumer disputes, though it will not apply to collective employment relations, criminal issues and administrative issues.
As an alternative to litigation, mediation has the potential to lessen the burden on the judiciary and foster greater efficiency.
The experience of other countries where mediation has been introduced shows that small and medium-size enterprises are typically the first to turn to this approach.
In mediation, the two sides in a dispute agree to be assisted by a third party in reaching an acceptable solution.
The whole procedure is transparent and the costs are borne by mutual agreement between the two parties.
The amount of the fee is determined by a previously established list.
The mediator is often an attorney, but can also come from another profession.
In any case, anyone taking on this role must have obtained a certificate from the Chamber of Mediators.
This month, the justice ministry signed a memorandum of understanding with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) -- a part of the World Bank Group -- on developing an efficient mediation system over the next three years.
"We are very keen to promote this efficient way of resolving business disputes in Macedonia.
This is an important part of our strategy of promoting a vibrant private sector and of improving the overall business climate in the country through both our investment and technical assistance activities," said Antoine Courcelle-Labrousse of the IFC.
The initiative is part of the IFC's Alternative Dispute Resolution project, launched in 2004 with funding from the Netherlands.
Since then, a legal framework for mediation has been taking shape, three training programmes for 50 prospective mediators have been delivered, and two roundtables and an ADR conference have been organised to promote use of mediation.
Kosovo's Vetevendosje movement works to block border crossings with Serbia
The Vetevendosje movement clashes with police in a protest aimed at blockading two border crossings with Serbia.

Police were using pepper spray, water cannons and tear gas Saturday (January 14th) against demonstrators marching to protest at two border crossings with Serbia, in Merdar/Merdare and Dheu i Bardhe/ Bela Zemlja.
The main opposition movement "Vetevendosje" (Self-determination) organised the demonstration, saying the government has failed to implement parliament's decision to impose for full political, economic and trade reciprocity with Serbia.
Police said some protestors threw rocks in the Podujevo area, near Merdar/Merdare.
A Kosovo TV report quoted a police spokesperson as saying 14 protesters were arrested and eight police officials were injured.
Vetevendosje leader Albin Kurti was among those injured, and was given medical treatment before returning to the protest, the movement said.
Vetevendosje accuses Prime Minister Hashim Thaci's government of implementing agreements "that undo the Republic [of Kosovo] and force Kosovo to kneel before Serbia." Protecting domestic production is at stake, says Vetevendosje.
Neither of the crossings is in the Serb-majority northern part of the country, which has been volatile since mid-summer.
Earlier Saturday, as he first headed towards the Merdar/Merdare crossing, Kurti told reporters that the heavy police turnout would not change his plans, while reiterating that the protest is designed to hinder the flow of Serbian goods into Kosovo, not the freedom of movement of people.
He was stopped by a police cordon about 400m from the crossing, and accused police of blocking the movement of people.
The interior ministry had said in a news release that it would exercise its duty in accordance with its mandate to prevent any blockade.
"The right of some citizens to protest and express their discontent will not be allowed to be abused at the expense of the free movement of the other citizens and goods in the territory of the Republic of Kosovo," the ministry said.
It asked the public not to support illegal forms of dissent, underlining that Kosovo Police will show "zero tolerance towards the illegal blockade of roads".
Thaci, for his part, has little patience with Vetevendosje or its protest, telling his cabinet Wednesday that patriotism nowadays should be defined as full respect for Kosovo's Constitution and its laws.
"The perspective of the state of Kosovo is in integration and not in the barricade."
Kosovo President Atifete Jahjaga had chided Vetevendosje as well, saying in effect that organising a street protest does not signal the "exhaustion of possibilities of action within the institutions of the country.
As in any other case, I express my firm stance as president ... against actions that hinder the free movement of people and goods."
The embassies of France, Germany, Italy, the UK and the US urged Vetevendosje to refrain from any violence or provocation of Kosovo Police personnel.
"Such actions will not only be illegal, but would also raise political tensions in Kosovo and negatively impact Kosovo's image abroad," they said in a statement.
Adding that they are confident that Kosovo Police -- supported by EULEX and KFOR -- "will show restraint and professionalism in dealing with any provocations" the diplomats stressed that "ultimately, Vetevendosje will be responsible for the consequences of its planned actions."
EU Special Representative in Kosovo Fernando Gentilini warned that any action that aims to raise barriers instead of lowering them risks undermining progress achieved so far.
"I encourage everybody to refrain from actions that aim at hindering any of these freedoms, since such moves would only represent a setback in the European agenda," he said in a statement.
Kurti sought support in neighbouring Albania, but the foreign ministry responded with a statement saying it condemns the extremist calls of "some Albanians in Kosovo and Albania" to block the border crossings with Serbia.
Nonetheless, a busload of Albanians was stopped by police Saturday at the Morine border with Kosovo.
Other political parties in Kosovo do not support the planned blockade, but various NGOs, businesses and syndicates are divided over it.
Kosovo political analyst Belul Beqaj, a university professor, tells SETimes the blockade of the border crossings "can be seen as an unreasonable act, but [Vetevendosje's] commitment to realise ... their political aims, despite the consequences, cannot be denied".
Serbian consumers bear brunt of high retail prices; government intervenes
Government action has temporarily lowered trading margins on some foods in Serbia, where wages are among the lowest in the region.
By Katica Djurovic and Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 14/01/12
Some economists say a lack of competition unfairly drives up food prices in Serbia. [Reuters]
A regulation to make food more affordable has -- for now at least -- trimmed the trading margins on flour, sugar, cooking oil, milk and meat to 10%.
But it is drawing protests from the Employers' Union, which warns that the regulation will lead to the shutdown of many small and medium-sized businesses.
The rule, which went into effect this month and expires on July 1st, cut trading margins on some foods from as much as 30%.
Serbia has some of the lowest wages in Southeast Europe, and residents on average spend half their salary on consumer goods.
Officials hope that cutting the margins will boost demand and allow people to buy more.
"No one is happy when administrative measures are needed to regulate the market, but there are situations where it is impossible in any other way to establish balance in the market, where the lack of real competition is reflected in high margins," Minister of Agriculture and Trade Dusan Petrovic said.
Some analysts doubt that the regulation will produce long-term results.
"In Serbia, food is mainly expensive because of costly production, i.e. low productivity," Marica Vukovic, an editor in Beta News Agency's economics department, told SETimes.
"When it comes to basic agricultural products, they are more expensive than in Europe, because state subsidies are lower. [While] all countries subsidise agriculture to protect the citizens from shortages, the agricultural budget in Serbia is smaller both in nominal and percentage terms compared with GDP in other countries."
She says the main reason for the regulation's adoption is the upcoming election campaign.
Serbia must hold a general election no later than May.
Nor does she does not expect the regulation to yield essential results, given its limited duration.
Beyond that, "Savings in the household budget will be felt only by larger families, which buy big quantities of bread, milk, yogurt and cooking oil," Vukovic said.
Economist Mahmut Busatlija of the Economics Institute in Belgrade does not expect any major results either.
"Food in Serbia is expensive because of the monopoly on its import.
Only a few companies are operating in that field and they often do not procure food from European producers, but rather from some duty free zone brokers.
This makes the prices of imported goods seem unrealistically high and the money is drained from Serbia," Busatlija told SETimes.
The average salaries in Southeast European nations. [SETimes illustration]
The average salary in Serbia is about 376 euros, with inflation of 8.1%.
Unemployment is about 20%.
In Southeast Europe, only Macedonia has an average salary lower than Serbia.
By comparison, Slovenia's average wage is 975 euros, and Croatia's wages average 715 euros.
"The price of the products in our supermarkets is influenced by the market: it depends on the type of product, brand, category, purchasing power and other expenses such as transport, electricity, storage," Slobodan Rudan told SETimes.
He is director of operations at the Delhaize Group, which operates the retail chains Maxi and Tempo in Southeast Europe.
Before price controls went into effect this month, the price of sugar in a Serbia supermarket averaged 111 to 113 dinars per kilogram, about 10% more expensive than in Podgorica and Skopje.
Milk prices in major cities of the region range from 70 to 80 euro cents per litre, while in Serbian markets consumers paid from 85 to 90 euro cents.
The Consumers Protection Movement says Serbian merchants decide on the level of trading margins, which is highly chaotic due to insufficient control.
"Everyone arbitrarily determines margins.
Therefore, the same product can have a different price in a Belgrade supermarket and in a small shop in central Serbia," Petar Bogosavljevic, Movement director, told SETimes.
According to Bogosavljevic, when purchasing power declines, merchants tend to lower the prices and margins, in order to attract consumers and increase profit.
In Serbia however, prices consistently rise, he said.
Bogosavljevic says the main reason for constantly increasing margins is the lack of competition.
The arrival of new mega-markets in the country would mean more competition, lower margins and lower prices.
"That is the price we pay for the retailer's monopoly, which enables them to reap high profits without fearing competition," Dragan Milicevic, author of the analysis of retailers' margins in Serbia, told SETimes.
Those most unhappy with the high prices are consumers, many of whom are willing to hit the road in search of better deals.
"I've been travelling occasionally to Timisoara in Hungary to buy electronics, clothes, shoes and food for my household.
Retail chains in Hungary are cheaper than in Serbia and I'll keep going to Hungary until the cheap supermarkets arrive in Serbia, or until domestic merchants lower the prices," Vesna Vlajic, a retired bank accountant, told SETimes.
Success of Serbian Presidential Elections Uncertain
Sunday's Serbian presidential election is being overshadowed by opposition attempts to force the government to call early parliamentary elections.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 13/11/03
On Sunday (16 November), Serbs will once again go to the polls to choose a president.
Will voter turnout be high enough for the elections to succeed?
By law, turnout must surpass 50 per cent in order for the results to be counted as valid.
If this condition is not met, new elections will be scheduled 30 to 90 days later.
If the requirement is met, but no one candidate receives 50 per cent or more of the votes, a runoff election between the top two candidates will be scheduled 14 days after the first round.
There is no voter turnout requirement in the second round runoff.
Serbia has been without a president since 2002, when Milan Milutinovic surrendered to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), which has indicted him for war crimes in Kosovo in 1999.
The acting president, as ordered by the constitution, is Serbian Parliament Speaker Natasa Micic. The previous two election rounds in late 2002 failed because of low turnout.
Despite numerous warnings from the OSCE, Serbian authorities have not annulled the first round turnout requirement, and it is again uncertain whether the elections will succeed.
Polls conducted by Belgrade-based agencies indicate voter turnout on Sunday will be between 36 per cent and 43 percent.
According to analysts, the election's success will hinge on the 23 per cent of those why say they have not decided yet whether to vote.
Many believe the absence of last year's leading candidates -- Vojislav Kostunica and Miroljub Labus -- will negatively affect turnout.
Both are calling for early parliamentary elections, arguing that presidential elections will not resolve the crisis in Serbian politics.
Polls show that as many as two-thirds of the public agree.
Kostunica and Labus, both of whom lead opposition parties, have declined to back DOS presidential candidate Dragoljub Micunovic, who has been trying to win over their supporters.
According to public opinion polls, Micunovic will win around 47 percent of votes.
His biggest opponent will be Slobodan Milosevic's former associate, Serbian Radical Party Vice President Tomislav Nikolic, who is expected to receive approximately 39 per cent of the vote.
The remaining 14 per cent will likely be divided among the three other candidates.
The US Embassy in Belgrade and the OSCE have urged voters to turn out Sunday, as it is in Serbia's interest to get a president.
They also called on the Serbian government to annul the election census.

Turkish Banking Regulator Says Tycoon's Family Embezzled Almost $6 Billion
Inspectors reported that Kemal Uzan and his family pocketed an amount equivalent to 3 per cent of Turkey's GNP, using a specially designed computer programme to conceal their activities.
(FT - 06/10/03; BBC - 28/08/03; AFP - 26/08/03; Reuters, AFP - 20/08/03; FT, AFP - 26/07/03)
Inspectors at Turkey's banking watchdog have reported that business tycoon Kemal Uzan and his family embezzled almost $6 billion in what is being described as the biggest bank fraud in Turkish history, the Financial Times reported Monday (6 October).
Members of the Uzan family and senior officials at Imar Bank, which the family owns, allegedly used a specially designed computer programme to conceal bank deposits, allowing them to pocket funds equivalent to 3 per cent of Turkey's GNP.
Turkey's Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BDDK) has sent the 54-page report -- the result of an inquiry initiated in June -- to prosecutors, along with a request that 22 people allegedly involved in the crime be prosecuted.
The list includes Kemal Uzan, his brother Yavuz, his son Hakan, and top Uzan company officials.
Another son, Cem Uzan, leader of the Youth Party, is reportedly not on the list.
He has charged that the investigation into his family is politically motivated and aimed at blocking his party's rise.
"The bank hid more than 90 per cent of the deposits it collected and did not show it in the accounts it published for the benefit of the public and in official documents," the BDKK report said.Under Turkish legislation on the insurance of banking deposits, the missing funds automatically become the liability of the state.
While in New York for the UN General Assembly session last month, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said authorities were shocked by the extent of the embezzlement at Imar.
In addition to closing the bank, they have also seized two power utilities owned by the group, suspended three television stations controlled by the Uzans, replaced the management of the clan's second bank and invalidated the privatisation tender for Turkey's petrochemical giant, PETKIM, which the family had won.
In August, a New York court sentenced the Uzans to pay $4.3 billion to Motorola.
The judge said the family had kept Motorola's money for themselves, perpetrating "a huge fraud ... through an almost endless series of lies, threats and chicanery".
The Uzan group grew rapidly into an industrial and business empire during the 1990s, controlling over 100 enterprises -- including banks, power utilities, television stations and the country's second-largest mobile phone operator, Telsim.
Recently, Turkey asked Interpol to arrest Kemal Uzan and his brother Yavuz following their failure to appear in court to answer charges in connection with the Imar fraud case.
As part of the investigations, a third brother, Bahattin, was arrested earlier.
Hakan Uzan, meanwhile, is also said to have disappeared days before authorities issued an arrest warrant for him and his father.
As part of the investigation, authorities have frozen the family's bank accounts and imposed travel bans on the Uzans.
Police have conducted several searches of their properties.
Tensions in Turkey over Erdogan's possible presidential bid
Turkey's military and the secular elite have never been entirely comfortable with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan or his Justice and Development Party.
Now the party is poised to take control of the presidency as well as the government.

Registration of presidential candidates began in Turkey on Monday (April 16th) and will run until April 25th.
Because the head of state is elected by Parliament, most political analysts expect a candidate from the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) to succeed incumbent President Ahmet Necdet Sezer.
All eyes are on Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
While many consider him the likely AKP candidate, becoming president would oblige him to give up the party leadership -- potentially weakening AKP ahead of the parliamentary elections. Furthermore, the prospect of an Erdogan presidency has set off alarm bells among Turkey's secularists.
The AKP rose from the ashes of the now-defunct Welfare Party, a pro-Islamic grouping that was banned in 1998 for allegedly violating Turkey's constitutional principles.
Sezer, who was chief justice of the constitutional court at the time, said the party was shut down "because of its actions against the principles of the secular republic."
In 2001, Erdogan launched his new party, billing it as moderately conservative -- along the lines of Christian Democratic parties in Western Europe.
Since gaining power, the AKP has presided over an economic boom and the launch of membership talks with the EU.
At the same time, Erdogan has courted controversy with steps some see as undermining the division of state and religion -- for instance, by moving to ease a ban on the wearing of headscarves by civil servants, and by attempting to criminalise adultery.
Such actions, secularists charge, are proof that the AKP is simply the old Islamist wolf dressed up in moderate conservative clothing.
They accuse the party of seeking to fundamentally change Turkey's political culture by systematically placing officials loyal to political Islam in senior administration positions.
"The reactionary threat has not changed its objective of altering the basic characteristics of the state," Sezer told Parliament on the first day of the legislative year. "Attempts to re-interpret the concept of secularism, to elevate religion to the political level and to extend the base of reactionary threat are generating social tension."
With the AKP now poised to control both the government and the presidency, these warnings have grown more heated.
Speaking at a Military Academy conference last week, Sezer claimed the Turkish Republic, since its inception, "has not faced any threat as significant as that of today".
The state has the right and responsibility to "protect the democratic and secular structures as well as the unity of the state".
The Turkish Army's chief of general staff, General Yasar Buyukanit, has on more than one occasion hinted that the military would be ready to step in if it sees Turkey's secular underpinnings being threatened.
"Aren't there those who express the need to redefine secularism at every opportunity?
Are they not in the most senior positions of the state?
Isn't it true that the fundamental principles of the Republic are under attack?
If one cannot answer no' to these questions, then there is a threat of Islamic fundamentalism in Turkey, and every measure must be taken against this threat," he said.
At the weekend, crowds estimated in the hundreds of thousands staged a rally in Ankara, demonstrating against the possibility of an Erdogan nomination.
He has rejected the criticism.
During a trip to the United States last October, he insisted that the alleged threat to Turkish secularism does not exist, and that the debate is pointless.
He called on officials to refrain from making statements that could cause unnecessary tensions in the country.
Parliament will begin electing the next president either on April 26th or May 3rd.
Up to four rounds of voting could be held.
Romanian political crisis runs a high economic risk
The ongoing political instability in Romania is undermining the country's appeal to investors, analysts say.

A recently released report from Ernst and Young suggests that many businesses are interested in Romania but worried about its stability.
Continuing political quarrels are undermining the country's potential as a magnet for investors, it warns.
Out of 200 managers surveyed, 58% said they were concerned about political instability, along with poor infrastructure, a lack of research centres and inadequate living standards.
"At a time of an intense political crisis, there is a negative effect investment decrease in certain areas, mainly in those which much depend on the state administration, infrastructure and utilities," says Ovidiu Nicolaescu, president of the National Council of Small and Medium Enterprises.
In comments quoted by Radio Romania, he said the unstable political environment could lead foreign companies to begin channeling investments to other countries in the area.
The economic repercussions could be serious, Nicolaescu warns.
Political turmoil is also one reason behind the international ratings company Coface's decision not to boost its rating for Romania, which stands at A4.
"The risks for 2007 mainly originate in the political environment, as the dissensions within the governing coalition may lead to sudden elections and slowing reforms, despite EU monitoring," the Wall Street Journal quoted managing director Cristian Ionescu as saying.
US Ambassador Nicholas Taubman is also concerned about the impact of political instability on foreign investments.
"We need to be realistic and recognise that the recent political turmoil in Bucharest has raised doubts beyond Romania's borders as to whether this is the right place at the moment to pursue investment opportunities.
People in private industry and in government are asking a lot of questions about Romania, trying to understand where the country is headed," he said.
"What I know for certain is that it is very important for Romania to continue to make progress in key areas such as justice reform and fighting corruption.
Losing traction on these reforms would not send the right signal to Romania's partners," Taubman said.
The political crisis is far from over.
Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu's Liberals have succeeded in ousting President Traian Basescu's Democrats from the governing coalition.
They have formed a new alliance with the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania.
However, the new government is a minority one.
It depends on support from the opposition parties, particularly the Social Democrats.
As a result, political analysts say, its prospects are shaky.
Russia urged to respect fundamental rights
Brussels and Washington are voicing concern over the Russian police response to weekend anti-Kremlin protests.

The EU and the United States expressed concern Monday (April 16th) about the violence used by Russian police in a crackdown on anti-government demonstrators.
"The excessive use of force that we saw over the weekend is worrying and assaults on the media ... are unacceptable," Thomas Steg, a spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel, told reporters.
Germany currently holds the EU's rotating presidency.
"The German government expects and demands a thorough clarification of the events in Moscow and St. Petersburg, particularly the actions which prevented journalists from doing their jobs," the spokesman added.
Riot police beat and chased peaceful demonstrators who took to the streets Saturday and Sunday to protest President Vladimir Putin's policies.
About 350 people were briefly arrested during the rallies, which were organised by The Other Russia, an opposition coalition.
The detainees included former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, one of the leaders of The Other Russia, and a representative of Germany's public TV.
The European Commission is "very concerned" about the events, said its external affairs spokesperson, Christiana Hohmann.
She said freedom of expression and freedom of assembly were "very important values", and that Russia's membership in international organisations such as the UN and the OSCE obliges it to respect those values.
The EU is expected to raise the issue during talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of a meeting of the bloc's foreign minister in Luxembourg next week.
Merkel is also likely to bring up the matter during a Russian-EU summit due to be held in the Russian city of Samara on May 18th.
"An opportunity to campaign for the opposition and freedom of expression are the necessary conditions for free and fair elections," said Jacek Saryusz-Wolski, the Polish head of the European Parliament's foreign affairs committee.
In Washington, US officials also expressed their concern.
"We are deeply disturbed by the heavy-handed manner in which this weekend's demonstrations ... were broken up by the authorities and by an emerging pattern of use of excessive force by the authorities in reaction to similar events," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino told reporters.
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack described the crackdown as "inconsistent with the Russian government's stated democratic values".
"The fact that there's an apparent attempt by the security services to stifle that freedom of expression, to stifle the ability of these opposition political parties to fully participate in that political process, is disturbing," he said.
The president of the 46-nation Council of Europe, of which Russia is a member, weighed in as well.
"We condemn this disproportionate use of force," Rene Van der Linden said.
Freedom of expression and freedom of assembly are basic rights in democratic countries," he added.

Albania's power utility KESH is weighing a reduction of electricity prices for the domestic agricultural sector, according to information from the Albanian Agri-business Council.
The price adjustment is expected to take place by year's end.
At present, Albanian farmers pay around 0.80 euros per kWh.
Two years of construction at the Tirana-Dajt ski lift on the Dajti Mountain have been completed, according to project co-ordinator Arben Peto.
The Albanian Institute of Studies and Forest Projections oversaw the 6.5m-euro project, in co-operation with Austrian partners and the Italian-Albanian Bank.
The EBRD said on 6 June it extended a long-term debt of 29m euros and equity deal of 1m euros for internationally run real estate projects in Bulgaria.
The funds are going towards building two office complexes and a residential one in Sofia, as well as a hotel and a residential complex in Varna.
The Croatian electronics group Koncar reported consolidated revenues of 66.5m euros from January-April 2005, a 2.8 per cent increase year-on-year.
The energy and transport departments performed best, accounting for 73 per cent of total sales and 42 per cent of all sales abroad.

European Parliament supports Bulgaria, Romania's Schengen accession
Finland, the Netherlands continue to mount objections despite a general consensus that the criteria have been fulfilled.
By Tzvetina Borisova for Southeast European Times -- 15/10/11
The European Parliament met last week in Brussels. [Reuters]
European Parliament (EP) members on Thursday (October 13th) approved a resolution urging all EU member states to allow Bulgaria and Romania to join the so-called Schengen border check-free area.
The call came despite fierce opposition to the bids from the Netherlands and Finland.
"Romania and Bulgaria have fulfilled all the criteria for successful conclusion of the Schengen evaluation process," stated the document, pointing out Bucharest's and Sofia's bids should be judged "solely on the basis of existing membership criteria".
The EP rejected a proposal to introduce additional criteria for the two countries by strengthening the Schengen acquis on the basis of concerns related to organised crime and corruption.
Thursday's resolution came on the heels of a similar document approved by a large majority at the EP in June.
It signals a general agreement that the two candidates have done what was required in order to boost security at their borders.
At a meeting of the EU interior ministers in September, however, the Netherlands and Finland announced their decision to veto Bulgaria's and Romania's Schengen accession, citing ongoing problems with corruption and organised crime.
Romanian political scientist Gabriel Andreescu agrees these are serious issues.
He adds another concern associated with his country.
"There are also the troubles related to the Romanian citizens who disturb life in Western Europe villages and cities," he told SETimes.
Franz-Lothar Altmann, associate professor at Bucharest State University and head of the Western Balkans Section at the German Institute for International Politics and Security, believes domestic politics in Finland and the Netherlands is playing a role.
"Strong right-wing populist parties exist that have substantial influence on internal politics," he told SETimes, indicating that "sceptical remarks" about their bids can also be heard from Austria.
Bulgarian analyst Tihomira Trifonova, from the Centre for Policy Modernisation, agrees.
"In terms of technical preparations to control and guard the EU's external borders, I see no reasons why Bulgaria should not join Schengen," she told SETimes.
"The problem right now is of a purely political nature and has to do with public pressure that politicians in some EU member states are facing," she said.
As for the next meeting of EU interior ministers later this month, experts are not that hopeful.
"Bulgaria and Romania will hardly join Schengen before next year," says Trifonova.
Andreescu agrees. "The Western countries have today a lot of reason to delay the two countries' accession to Schengen."

Albanians in southern Serbia demand more rights
Students in Presevo, Bujanovic and Medvedjia should have the right to educational materials in their own language, advocates say.

Ethnic Albanians from the three municipalities in southern Serbia, Presevo, Bujanovac and Medvedja are holding a series of protests against what they say is continued discrimination, especially over the past six years. The next one is scheduled for November 28th.
Riza Haljimi, the only Albanian deputy in the Serbian parliament, says progress in achieving rights ended with the 2003 assassination of then Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.
"It all stopped; so for a long time we've lived in a kind of ghetto," Haljimi, chairman of the Party for Democratic Action, tells SETimes.
Two demonstrations were held within the past several weeks, one on September 13th and the other a week later. The September 20th rally drew about 1,500 people.
Protestors demanded that pupils in elementary and secondary schools be provided textbooks in Albanian, as well as for Serbia to recognise diplomas issued by Pristina University.
Serbian textbooks are not translated into Albanian and the use of textbooks from Pristina is prohibited.
As a result, around 12,000 students lack materials in their native language.
The only approved spelling book is from Albania, with parts heavily edited.
"For example, the Albanian spelling-book had "beautiful city Pristina", but this was changed to "beautiful city Nis" [accompanied by] the image of Skull Tower -- for Serbs the symbol of crimes from the time of the Turkish Ottoman Empire," Jonuz Musliu, president of the Assembly of Bujanovac tells SETimes.
Frustrated by the lack of progress, Musliu resigned two months ago as member of the Co-ordination Body for South Serbia.
Serbian Minister of Education and Science Zarko Obradovic tells SETimes he believes that in Bujanovac, Presevo and Medvedja, much has been accomplished to improve Albanians' access to education.
"The problems in education are not the real reason for Albanian protests in southern Serbia and education should not be misused for political purposes," Obradovic tells SETimes.
The nationalist opposition in Serbia is also suspicious.
"It's the same strategy as the Albanians in Kosovo had in the 1980s, behind which are political intentions," Serbian Radical Party Vice-President Dragan Todorovic tells SETimes.
However, the Serbian government's Co-ordination Body for Presevo, Bujanovac and Medvedja believes that the protests are not without justification.
The head of the Co-ordination Body, Minister for State and Local Administration and Minority Rights Milan Markovic, says it has invested significant resources in the development of the three Albanian municipalities.
However, he adds, there are serious issues remaining and it is time for the education ministry to address them.
"If we do not provide Albanians the rights that apply to other national minorities in Serbia, we will be in a position where 60,000 members of these communities are not integrated into the institutions," Markovic told SETimes. "At some point this can become a huge problem."
Young people in Serbia seem to know little about the problems of their peers in the south.
"I do not know what language their books are, but I think they should be in Serbian, as it is the official language of our country," Belgrade high school student Vladimir Spasic tells SETimes.
Sale of Croatian Islands Sparks Investigation
Croatia's state prosecutor has reacted strongly to the questionable sale of coastal properties, demanding cancellation of the deeds.
By Miranda Novak for Southeast European Times in Zagreb - 29/03/04

Croatian media reported late last month that several Adriatic islands had changed owners under suspicious circumstances, with millions of euros being exchanged in the process.
The state prosecutor has since demanded cancellation of the deeds of sale related to coastline property.
As a result, the new owners of Smokvice Male and Mali Krknjas -- for which more than 2m euros were paid -- will not receive the most valuable parts of the islands: the shorelines.
The islands are located near the Dalmatian towns of Sibenik, Zadar and Trogir.
The Mali Krknjas company purchased the island of Smokvice, while the Valadria company bought Mali Krknjas.
Public suspicions were aroused by the similarity of the names involved, and a request was filed to verify their relationship.
"In spite of formal registration in the land registry, the coastline cannot be subject to private ownership," said Deputy State Prosecutor Snezana Frkovic.
"That is why we will demand that the border of the state coastline be established on the islands purchased by the Mali Krknjas company.
After that, we will file a suit in which we will demand cancellation of the deed of sale referring to maritime property."
A US firm, Trenton & Partners, founded the Valadria company.
But state prosecutors say they have not identified who exactly is involved.
Later, another questionable transaction was discovered.
The islands of Frasker and Fraskeric near the southern coast of Istria -- considered the most exclusive portion of the Adriatic -- were bought in 2000 by the Frasker company.
Frasker owners Miodrag Skrbic and Mikhail Pevtsaev, allegedly backed by Russian and Czech investors, planned to spend 16.5m euros on developing these islands for elite tourism.
But the community of Medulin, which has jurisdiction over the islands, decided that it would not permit any urbanisation beyond that approved by local residents.
No construction is permitted on the islands that were sold and an urban development plan has not been adopted for them.
Thus, it is not clear what economic potential they offer investors.
For this reason, the State Prosecutor's Office is co-operating with the tax department and the police in trying to discover who in fact stands behind the companies that bought these islands.
The Office for the Prevention of Money Laundering also began an investigation of its own to see whether the money used to purchase the islands entered Croatia legally.
Many expect that the new owners of the islands will probably request concessions for the use of the maritime state property.
Such requests would have to be ruled on by local self-government.
The prosecutor's office, meanwhile, announced that it would send a letter to the government and to the Croatian Ministry of the Protection of the Environment and Space Management, requesting that the state be more attentive to the issue of island urbanisation and to the granting of concessions for use of maritime properties.
Macedonia's culture minister says co-operation "fruitful"
Elizabeta Kanceska-Milevska spoke to SETimes about efforts to build bridges with other countries in the region.

Macedonian Culture Minister Elizabeta Kanceska-Milevska [Klaudija Lutovska/SETimes]
Countries in the region can find a common language through culture even when their governments disagree, says Macedonian Culture Minister Elizabeta Kanceska-Milevska.
In an interview with SETimes, she discusses the importance of culture to Macedonia's EU integration process, steps taken by the current government to promote culture, and challenges which her ministry faces -- including the problem of artefact theft.
SETimes: What is the role of culture?
Elizabeta Kanceska-Milevska: In Macedonia, our culture is our identity, something that differentiates us but also makes us closer to, and connects us with the rest of Europe and the world.
For the first time since Macedonia's independence, culture is at the centre of -- and a function of -- the development of the state.
This government treats culture as on a par with, say, foreign policy, which was not the case in the past.
It allocates a base amount of over 65m euros annually -- a significant investment for Macedonia.
This increased care is evidenced by our building a new archeological museum in Skopje in which the major portion of the Macedonian heritage will be presented; a new educational museum complex to be completed in May 2011; and numerous investments, such as building a new concert hall for the Macedonian Philharmonic Orchestra.
In the past three years, we fully examined and researched the main 20 out of 5,000 archeological sites, including Stobi, Heraklea, Isar-Marvinci and Vardarski Rid.
I must add that culture also plays an important part in Macedonia's EU integration process.
The latest annual EC report two weeks ago particularly praises Macedonia for its progress in the area of culture.
SETimes: Can you elaborate on the importance of culture in linking Macedonia with other Balkan countries and the EU?
Kanceska-Milevska: I am particularly satisfied that co-operation is very fruitful with the states in the region.
We signed agreements in the area of culture with all regional countries through which we further intra-institutional and cross-country ties.
While governments at times do not find a common language, cultural institutions continually do.
For example, renowned Macedonian movie and theatre directors Milco Mancevski and Slobodan Unkovski work with -- or in -- Greece.
With Croatia, we have an intensive exchange of projects, including exhibits of 140 artists in the Museum of Contemporary Art.
Macedonia has also excellent relations with EU member states like Slovenia and Austria, with which we also concluded an agreement for cultural co-operation.
We have signed an agreement with Estonia -- just like we had with Turkey in 2010 -- as Tallinn will be the European Capital of Culture in 2011.
The exchanges are numerous and win-win for all concerned.
SETimes: Does Macedonia have a cultural policy?
Kanceska-Milevska: Macedonia has a clearly defined cultural policy and a strategy that can be summed up as: preservation, presentation and promotion.
We implement activities in all segments of culture -- museums, galleries, theatres, libraries, the musical-scenic arts, film arts, international promotions and exchange, as well as local cultural development.
Culture can be and is also viewed as a useful industry from a political and an economic standpoint.
There is a significant economic aspect to it depending on whether and how culture is directed.
We are interested in developing an additional dimension as well -- cultural tourism.
SETimes: What challenges do you face in your work?
Kanceska-Milevska: A particular challenge is the significant theft of Macedonian cultural heritage.
We passed laws and organised seminars to highlight and prevent these criminal activities, and continue to work closely with the interior ministry, but it is hard to bring some of the stolen artefacts back.
One way we tried to put a stop to the theft is through complete and systematic examination of the most important archeological sites.
We did this for the ancient town of Stobi, for example, turning it into a national institution, and now there is a service that protects it.
Culture in itself is a challenge -- a live, moving matter.
Every cultural event for us is a challenge as well as a measure of human success, even success for the country.
SETimes: Can you share a particular achievement that has made a qualitative difference?
Kanceska-Milevska: Changing the status of artists.
We succeeded in better valuing the labour and the intricate complexities involved in their efforts to create art.
Previously, artists were compensated per project.
We have artists of the highest expression and those people in Macedonia are now full time employees.
This approach can perhaps be examined by others in safeguarding regional artistic talent.
Olympics Chief Urges Greeks to Focus on Essential Projects
International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge has urged the organisers of the Athens Olympics to focus on completing essential projects, saying he is confident in the success of the games if the Greeks work at a very fast pace.

International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Jacques Rogge has urged the organisers of the 2004 Athens Olympics to focus on essential projects and work at top speed, as there is no room for delays.
Five and a half months before the opening ceremony of the Olympics begins on 13 August, the IOC chief believes there is time to make the Games a success.
"Very much has been achieved, much remains to be done," Rogge said Saturday (28 February), after a two-day IOC executive board meeting in Athens. "There is still enough time to have excellent games provided our Greek friends continue at a fast pace.
I remain confident."
Currently, 15 of the 39 sports venues are reportedly complete, and another 13 are about 90 per cent complete.
The projects still to be finished include a huge, 120m euro steel-and-glass roof over the main Olympic stadium, designed by award-winning Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava.
Calatrava has assured both Rogge and the Greek government that the roof will be completed on time.
"I am interested in the core delivery of the games," Rogge said.
"If we have the stadium without the roof, but still functioning well, I am perfectly happy," he added, urging the organisers to concentrate on the "vital" projects and put aside the nonessential ones.
The projects causing the biggest concern include a 30km suburban railway linking Athens' new airport with sports venues, and a tramline, running several weeks behind schedule.
Both projects are considered critical given heavy traffic problems in the Greek capital, where more than one million visitors are expected to arrive in August.
"It will take a great effort to get these things done," said Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, the head of the 2004 Athens Olympics Organising Committee. "But we haven't come this far to let challenges like these stop us now."
On security, Rogge said everything possible was being done to prevent any incidents at the Games.
Greece has set aside more than 650m euros for security measures for security, three times the budget at the 2000 Sydney Games.
"Am I concerned?
I am always concerned at all Olympic Games until the last athlete has left the Olympic City the day after the closing ceremony.
Am I concerned in particular on the particular issue in Athens or more in Athens than in other Games?
No," Rogge said.

Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said in Tirana on Monday (April 12th) that he believes Albania will benefit from the EU visa liberalisation process this year and obtain EU membership candidate status.
"The EU Council of Ministers could take a decision before the summer to enable Albanian and Bosnian citizens to move freely without a visa by this year's autumn," Frattini told a joint conference with his Albanian counterpart Ilir Meta.
Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou held talks in Cyprus with President Demetris Christofias, local political leaders and Archbishop Chrysostomos II during a two-day visit that began Sunday (April 11th).
Before his visit, Papandreou met with Cypriot Foreign Minister Markos Kyprianou in Athens to discuss Cypriot reunification issues.
Serbian President Boris Tadic encouraged members of the Albanian minority Thursday (April 8th) to establish a National Council, saying he is proud that Serbia is among the few countries that have enabled their minorities to set up such councils.
Elections for the Albanian council will take place on June 6th.

Former Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos was laid to rest Monday (December 15th) after a funeral service at the St. Sophia church in Nicosia.
The veteran Greek Cypriot politician died of lung cancer on Friday.
He was 74.
A heavy smoker, the former president developed severe breathing problems in November and was admitted into the intensive care unit of Nicosia General Hospital.
Following his death, the Greek Cypriot government declared a three-day official mourning period, with flags at all public buildings and schools flying at half staff, and all official events and public engagements cancelled.
Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat expressed his condolences to Papadopoulos's family and the Greek Cypriot community over the former president's death.
"I share their sorrow," he said.
Senior Greek officials and politicians, including Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis, Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis and the leader of the main opposition socialist PASOK party, George Papandreou, arrived in Nicosia on Monday for Papadopoulos' funeral.
Demetris Christofias, who defeated Papadopoulos in presidential elections held earlier this year, praised his predecessor for the "devotion and passion" with which he served his community in his political career, which spanned more than half a century.
"In this category of political men, Tassos Papadopoulos has a distinguished place," the president noted in his speech at the funeral service, officiated by the head of the Cyprus Orthodox Church, Archbishop Chrysostomos II.
"Our respect and recognition for all he has offered to our homeland and our people, for all his struggles and his political actions, will accompany him during his long journey."
Papadopoulos, who was elected president in 2003, left politics after losing to Christofias in the February vote.
His term in office saw Cyprus enter the EU, but with the Turkish Cypriots in the north shut out.
Papadopoulos spearheaded opposition to a peace plan put forward by then UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, with the president making an emotional televised appearance ahead of twin referenda being held on the island.
The plan then went down to defeat in the Greek Cypriot referendum, although it was approved in the north.
During his five-year tenure as Cyprus's fifth president, Papadopoulos also oversaw the adoption of the euro as the country's currency.
Born on January 7th 1934 in Nicosia, Papadopoulos studied law at King's College in London. After his return home in 1955, he joined the EOKA guerrilla group, which fought against British rule.
Two years later, he became head of the group's political arm, and in 1959 he took part in the London conference on his country's future.
At age 25, Papadopoulos became the youngest member of Cyprus's first government, headed by Archbishop Makarios. Over a period of 12 years, he served as minister of interior, minister of finance, minister of labour and social insurance, minister of agriculture and natural resources, and minister of health and agriculture.
He was first elected to parliament in 1970, on the ticket of the United Party, which he had co-founded a year earlier.
Cyprus was divided along ethnic lines in 1974, after Turkish troops invaded the country's north following an Athens-backed coup aimed at uniting the island with Greece. Between 1976 and 1978, Papadopoulos headed the Greek Cypriot negotiating team in intercommunal talks with the Turkish Cypriots.
In 1977, he submitted a proposal for a federated state of two distinct areas, a formula on which all subsequent initiatives for resolving the Cyprus problem have since been based.
Papadopoulos returned to parliament in 1991 as a representative of the centre-right Democratic Party and was elected as its leader in 2000.
Annan Calls for Tolerance in Kosovo, Hails Yugoslavia's Reform Efforts
Before heading on to Belgrade, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan assured the people of Kosovo that the UN would continue helping the province.

UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, speaking in Pristina earlier this week, assured the people of Kosovo that the UN would continue helping the province.
He urged them to overcome the legacy of the past and build a tolerant, multiethnic society anchored by democratic institutions and the rule of law.
"Though Kosovo has already covered a lot of ground, it is now that the really hard part begins," Annan said Monday (18 November). He added there was a need to redouble efforts to ensure that "the blessings of progress" reach everyone in the province.
While in Kosovo, the UN chief met with international and local officials, including President Ibrahim Rugova, Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi, Parliamentary Speaker Nexhat Daci and Kosovo Serb politicians.
After a visit to the ethnically divided northern town of Mitrovica and several villages, Annan noted that, although the situation still appeared difficult, there were signs of progress.
He condemned the recent bombings in which one Serbian Orthodox church was completely destroyed and another severely damaged.
"The incidents of last weekend, where bombs were thrown in the churches, is not anything anyone can condone," Annan said.
After nearly two days in Kosovo, he headed on to Belgrade.
Speaking to the press after a meeting with Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica and other senior officials, Annan hailed the efforts Yugoslavia was making to reform its institutions and improve relations with neighbouring countries and the EU. He expressed the hope that Yugoslavia will one day enter "the common European home."
Annan said his discussion with Kostunica focused on interactions with the UN war crimes tribunal. Kostunica acknowledged there were problems, but insisted the government was committed to co-operation with the international court.
Annan is to meet UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte in Belgrade on Wednesday.
Another issue was Yugoslavia's participation in peacekeeping operations. "I did remind the president that Yugoslavia was a very important peacekeeper and sent many soldiers to UN peacekeeping and I thought it was time that they reconsidered participation in this operation," Annan said.
On Tuesday, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic called for direct talks with the political leaders of Kosovo, as a transitional step towards negotiations on the future of the province.
Djindjic, who says he discussed this proposal with Annan, wants talks to address security, the return of refugees and property matters, among other issues.
Macedonians hope for visa-free travel to EU in 2009
Long queues outside embassies and pages of complex documentation are a fact of life for Macedonians wishing to visit EU-member countries.
But relief may be in sight.

Positive comments from the EU have fueled hopes in Macedonia that a fully liberalised visa regime could be in place during 2009.
A recent report from Brussels on implementation of the visa liberalisation roadmap found significant progress in a number of areas, including document security and measures against illegal migration.
The visa issue is a huge one in Macedonia, where long queues of applicants outside foreign embassies are a common sight.
Early this year, the EU introduced visa relief for some categories of citizens, allowing them to obtain visas quickly and free of charge.
Nevertheless, for most, the procedure remains complex, requiring different documents and long waits.
Skopje has taken a number of steps designed to meet EU standards.
Last year, biometric travel documents and ID cards were introduced.
Personal data is now better protected.
Significant progress has been made in implementing a deal with the bloc on migration and re-admission.
The process is far from complete, however.
The European Commission has announced another assessment in early 2009 to monitor further progress.
The foreign ministry says that after this report, Macedonia will expect a positive response from EU member states regarding fulfilment of the roadmap requirements.
The country is already working to build support within the bloc, with some success.
In November, members of the Parliamentary Committee of the Macedonian Assembly and EU parliamentarians held a joint meeting in Skopje, announcing their support for the visa liberalisation.
Macedonian Deputy Prime Minister for European Affairs Ivica Bocevski was in Paris recently, meeting with Jean-Pierre Jouyet, France's secretary of state for European Affairs.
Jouyet delivered a strong statement of support for EU integration in the Western Balkans, including Macedonia.
Meanwhile Estonia's foreign minister, Urmas Paet, has voiced his country's support for liberalising the visa regime with Macedonia.
This should happen no later than 2009, Paet said.
BiH parliament gives police reform another chance
One week after a parliamentary committee rejected two key police reform laws, MPs have sent the legislation back for further consideration.

Lawmakers in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) have rejected a negative report on two police reform laws, issued last week by a parliamentary panel, the joint defence and security committee.
Meeting on Tuesday (March 18th), the MPs decided to give the committee a 48-hour deadline to voice a new opinion.
MPs from all the ruling coalition parties except one -- the Party of Democratic Action (PDA) -- voted against the committee report.
The top international envoy in BiH, High Representative Miroslav Lajcak, praised parliament's decision.
He said it provides a clear signal that lawmakers want the opportunity to adopt police reform legislation, which is a remaining major condition for signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU.
He also urged the defence and security committee to allow parliament to hold a direct debate and vote on the police reform package.
"The European future of BiH's citizens -- regardless of where they live, their age, gender or ethnicity -- is in the hands of the 12 members of parliament's joint defence and security committee.
It is their responsibility to decide whether BiH's citizens will take a critical step towards membership of the EU and sign the SAA," he said.
Public support for integration into the EU runs as high as 70%, the envoy added.
The defence and security committee rejected the two key bills on March 12th.
One was a draft law on the directorate for the co-ordination of police bodies, and the other concerned independent and supervisory bodies of police structures.
The committee also rejected all 93 amendment proposals that had been filed concerning the draft laws.
Lajcak strongly criticised the rejections, saying the committee was squandering valuable time.
"Every day wasted is a day further away from signing the SAA," he said."The stance that parliamentary parties adopt in this matter will decide on the possibility of the European perspective for BiH and its citizens."
BiH Prime Minister Nikola Spiric also urged the main political parties not to reject the laws.
"Their adoption means we will sign the SAA," he said.
"We, the members of the Council of Ministers, had dilemmas, but we decided that what matters most is to sign the agreement with the EU.
Please keep the laws on track, for the sake of the European future of the country," Spiric added
KFOR: "deliberate intent to kill "on part of Kosovo Serbs
Serb protesters in Kosovo used grenades, Molotov cocktails and gunfire in a deliberate effort to kill people, international officials said on Wednesday.
They accused Belgrade of failing to use its influence to prevent violence from erupting.

A Ukrainian police officer serving with UNMIK died of injuries sustained when a grenade went off near him, international officials confirmed on Tuesday (March 18th).
"Yesterday morning in north Mitrovica an UNMIK police officer was murdered," Police Commissioner Larry Wilson told reporters at a special press briefing. "His name was Officer Kynol Iyor.
He arrived in Kosovo on December 17th of last year as a part of the Ukrainian formed Police Unit."
"A grenade went off right next to him. He died overnight of his injuries," said Principal Deputy Special Representative Larry Rossin, who attended the briefing with Wilson and the commander of KFOR, Lieutenant General Xavier Bout de Marnhac.
In all, 42 international police officers sustained injuries, Rossin said.
Violence broke out Monday after UNMIK police and KFOR troops moved to regain control over the Mitrovica courthouse, which had been taken over Friday by a group of Serb demonstrators.
De Marnhac said that the Kosovo Serb crowd that attacked UNMIK police specifically set out to cause casualties.
"Clearly a red line had been crossed with the deliberate intent to kill people," he said. "Molotov cocktails, fragmentation and grenades and direct fire have been targeted at UNMIK and KFOR soldiers.
And we are not going to tolerate that."
The three officials said there were clear indications that Monday's violence was not spontaneous but orchestrated.
They criticised Serbia, suggesting that officials in Belgrade failed to use their influence to prevent challenges to UNMIK's authority, such as the taking over of the Mitrovica courthouse.
The Serbian government "exercised undoubted, decisive influence over all of the political leaders in northern Kosovo", Rossin said.
"We have never had what we would consider a clear and unambiguous renunciation of this kind of violence" by Belgrade officials, he added.
Rossin also shed light on how the Kosovo Serbs managed to gain control of the courthouse Friday.
Police at the scene, he said, were constrained in what they could do because Kosovo Serb demonstrators put women and children out in front -- a tactic he described with disgust.
"We are not going to injure women and children.
We find it reprehensible that there should be women and children pushed out front, but that's the way it is," he said.
The officials also responded to charges by Serbian Minister of Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic that UNMIK acted prematurely.
Samardzic, who was in Kosovo during the courthouse occupation, said he had reached an "agreement in principle" that no action should be taken until he arrived in Mitrovica to negotiate a peaceful end to the occupation of the courthouse.
"In spite of this, they carried out this violent operation and provoked the populace, causing clashes in the streets," Samardzic said.
Rossin said no deal had been reached, and that he had made clear to Samardzic that UNMIK would act "at a moment of our choosing".
The operation became necessary because of indications that Kosovo Serbs were planning to attack additional UN facilities, he added.
Croatia, Slovenia turn to arbitration
A deal on the border dispute between Croatia and Slovenia was signed Wednesday by the countries' prime ministers.

In a move hailed by the international community, Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor and her Slovenian counterpart, Borut Pahor, signed an agreement in Stockholm on Wednesday (November 4th) that is expected to end the sea border dispute between two countries.
The decision was welcomed by the EU, the European Commission and the United States.
According to the agreement, the issue, which has been a stumbling block in Zagreb and Ljubljana's bilateral relations since the independence of the two countries in 1991, will go to international arbitration -- and the decision will be binding.
The dispute intensified last year when Slovenia used its EU member status to block Croatia's EU negotiation talks.
Now, Croatia hopes to finish the negotiations by the end of next year, and join the EU in 2011.
"Today we have not just turned a page, we have opened a whole new book," said Kosor. "Now I hope that we will also receive the support of our respective parliaments and that today's agreement can give new hope to our neighbours in Southeastern Europe."
Pahor said that mutual trust and respect between he and Kosor paved the way for the signing.
Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt also signed the agreement, as his country holds the rotating EU presidency.
The Croatian parliament approved the deal on Monday, underscoring that the agreement does not pre-judge the outcome of international arbitration.
It is crucial for sovereign countries to know exactly where their border is, Pahor said. "That was not possible to know in the past 18 years, but now we are on the road to succeed."
"We are in a situation that either both politics and both countries will see a joint interest that will lead us to stability, or they will focus and find only the differences in the views of the two countries.
That would lead us into conflict and [an] instable situation," Pahor said.
For now, the path seems to be to stability.
However, the public from both sides of the border fear that this is not a "win-win" situation: for instance, 87% of Slovenians fear that the agreement favours Croatian interests.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn congratulated all parties on reaching a "historic agreement".
"This is a most European way of peaceful settlement of disputes," Rehn said. "I encourage both countries to proceed with ratification without unnecessary delay, and hope that Croatia makes the last mile in the [EU] negotiations, which are reaching the final stage."
Sanader Urges EU to Set Unconditional Starting Date for Croatian Membership Talks
Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader says his country should be offered an unconditional invitation to start its EU accession talks.
EU leaders are expected to announce this week that talks could open in spring 2005 -- provided Zagreb co-operates fully with the UN war crimes tribunal.
(EurActiv - 15/12/04; AFP, EUpolitix, EUobserver, HINA, Radio B92 - 14/12/04; VOA, Irish Examiner, The Scotsman, Deutsche Welle, HINA - 13/12/04)

Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader urged EU leaders Tuesday (14 December) to set a starting date for Zagreb's accession talks with the Union without introducing new conditions.
His call came ahead of the two-day EU summit, opening in Brussels on Thursday, at which the leaders of the 25 member states are expected to endorse a decision on Croatia's bid to join the Union.
EU foreign ministers met Monday to examine draft conclusions presented by the current Dutch EU presidency in preparation for the summit.
At a press conference after the meeting, Dutch Foreign Minister Bernard Bot indicated that Croatia would be told it could begin entry talks "around April 2005", provided it co-operates fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
The EU, which has told Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Serbia-Montenegro that their prospects for future membership depend on full co-operation with the ICTY, has been voicing concern over Croatia's failure to arrest and hand over retired General Ante Gotovina -- the UN tribunal's third most-wanted indictee after Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic.
However, the foreign ministers' draft statement, which the EU leaders are expected to approve during the upcoming summit, reportedly offers no details as to how Croatia's co-operation would be confirmed.
Gotovina went into hiding in June 2001, weeks after the ICTY indicted him over his alleged role in war crimes committed by troops under his command in 1995, including the killings of at least 150 Krajina Serbs.
Last month, chief UN prosecutor Carla del Ponte said he represented "the only remaining obstacle to the co-operation of Croatia with the ICTY".
She insists that Gotovina has been sighted in Croatia and is being protected by a well-organised support network, including within state structures.
While maintaining that Gotovina has fled the country, authorities in Zagreb have pledged that he would be arrested if found.
"We have to solve the case of Gotovina in the sense that he stands trial at The Hague," Sanader told the AFP on Tuesday, stressing his government's commitment to meeting its obligations to the ICTY.
If Croatia can prove its full co-operation with the ICTY and begin its accession talks next spring, it is expected to join the EU in 2008 or 2009.
In other news, the Croatian National Security Council held a closed-door meeting Tuesday, called by Sanader and President Stipe Mesic.
Co-operation with the ICTY and international co-operation with secret services were among the items on the agenda, according to the Croatian news agency HINA.
War Crimes Issue Blocking Serbia-Montenegro's Progress Towards Integration
Belgrade's lack of co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal is straining the state union of Serbia-Montenegro and jeopardising its chances for EU integration, according to federal President Svetozar Marovic.
The EU confirms the issue is endangering the likelihood of a feasibility study for Serbia-Montenegro.

Belgrade's lack of co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) is threatening to destabilise the state union of Serbia-Montenegro, federal president Svetozar Marovic warned recently.
In failing to meet its obligations to The Hague, he said, Serbia is also endangering the state union's prospects for EU integration.
Failure to co-operate "directly jeopardises the European future of Serbia-Montenegro, as well as the stability and survival of the common state", Marovic said, charging that certain "political forces" within Serbia are largely to blame.
EU security chief Javier Solana, who was briefed by Marovic on the situation in Serbia-Montenegro, agreed that the actions of some Serbian government ministries are blocking progress.
He warned that the co-operation issue is throwing into question the likelihood of a feasibility study on Serbia-Montenegro's association with the EU.
On 10 December, the Serbia-Montenegro Council for European Integration met to try to forge a breakthrough.
Marovic and federal Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic attended, along with the Serbian and Montenegrin presidents, prime ministers and other top political figures.
According to Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus, the council agreed that generals sought by the ICTY should be given a deadline for surrender, measured in weeks, not months.
Calling the meeting very successful, Labus said the atmosphere during the three-hour talks suggested a calming of tensions between Belgrade and Podgorica.
During a visit to Brussels Tuesday (14 December), Marovic assured Solana that both constituent republics understand they must demonstrate a full commitment to meeting their international obligations before March 2005 -- the final deadline for obtaining a positive response from the EU concerning the feasibility study.
Asked by reporters whether this meant that Serbia had pledged to arrest the ICTY indictees, Marovic said authorities had made "firm guarantees" that all obligations would be met.
However, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica has so far advocated only the voluntary surrender of indictees, and it is unclear what will happen if the indictees fail to turn themselves in.
Jovan Simic, an adviser to Serbian President Boris Tadic, doubts the indictees will surrender anytime soon -- especially generals Sreten Lukic and Nebojsa Pavkovic, who have serious health problems.
Tadic, meanwhile, has repeatedly stressed that co-operating with the ICTY is a prerequisite for Serbia's political stability, characterising failure to do so as "national treason".
Draskovic has warned that the door to EU and NATO membership will remain shut as long as the indictees are not extradited to The Hague.
Were its obligations to be met, he said, Serbia would stand a good chance of joining the Partnership for Peace programme quickly.
Moreover, the issue of war crimes indictees is also blocking Serbia from taking its rightful place among European nations, Draskovic said.
"Europe wants us, and our people deserve to join the EU and avoid the fate of being a black hole.
Europe is waiting for us, but that waiting has its limits."

Pinpointing the Montenegro-Kosovo border
Despite hope from both countries, controversy remains.

Amid squabbles over the issue, Montenegro and Kosovo are planning formal negotiations to establish a definitive, legally binding border.
Officials have tried to stay positive, with Montenegrin Foreign Affairs Minister Milan Rocen insisting that his country "does not have any difficult issues which cannot be solved by talking to our neighbours".
On October 27th, he told parliament "There are no open issues with Kosovo and no issues concerning the border demarcation," he told parliament on October 27th.
However, Rocen acknowledged he had not yet been fully briefed on the matter.
"I don't want to get into the context of it and I don't have enough relevant information to comment on it in public," he said.
At the same time, the Montenegrin interior ministry issued a toughly-worded statement, declaring that the country would not give up a single square metre of its territory.
Recent incidents have raised the level of concern.
According to Kosovo media, signs reading "Welcome to Montenegro" were erected on the Kosovo side of the disputed Kulla/Kula border area, near Pec -- a territory that includes 21 villages.
In protest, over 200 Albanian villagers blocked the main highway leading to the border crossing.
Their representative, Sadri Zeka, claimed that nearly 1,000 hectares have been appropriated by Montenegro.
According to Kosovo's Telegrafi news agency, the protest prompted a meeting between Kosovo's regional and border police, as well as the Peja/Pec mayor and the Montenegro border police chief inspector.
Nusret Kalac, the mayor of Rozaje, a small Montenegrin border town adjacent to the disputed area, told TV Vijesti that his municipality has and will continue to maintain roads and provide security in the area.
"We have done this and we shall do this, and if someone is bothered by the border or not, if someone has [territorial] appetites, that is their business," said Kalac.
Emilo Labudovic, an MP representing Montenegro's Serbs, disagrees.
Belgrade's B92 quoted him as saying ethnic Albanians had crossed into his village, occupied pastures and cut down forests.
"Montenegro's border police are not reacting," he claimed.
Kosovo officials seem to believe the border demarcation process will be relatively easy and will be shorter than the one recently concluded with Macedonia.
Government spokesperson Memli Krasniqi was quoted in the daily Zeri on October 27th as saying that Kosovo and Montenegro do not have border disputes.
Interior Minister Zenun Pajaziti told the daily Bota Sot"it will be a process of joint management of this issue … and no concern is expected."
Pajaziti could not say when exactly the border demarcation -- and the initiation of formal diplomatic relations with Montenegro -- may take place, but expressed hope it will happen soon.
Last month, Montenegrin Minister of Human and Minority Rights Ferhat Dinosa told local media that he expects diplomatic relations to be established by the end of the year.
Not everyone in Kosovo agrees.
The leader of the Vetevendosja (Self-Determination) movement, Albin Kurti, has long warned that the two countries would have trouble demarcating the border.
He suggests the answer can be found in a 35-year-old document: Yugoslavia's 1974 constitution, in which Kosovo's borders are defined.
EC Lifts Ban on Duty-Free Imports of Serbian Sugar
Noting progress in customs reform, the EC has decided to restore preferential tariffs for sugar imports from Serbia-Montenegro.
Officials say the move is intended to support democratic reforms, especially in light of Boris Tadic's election as Serbian president.
By Dusan Kosanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 03/08/04
"We have seen great progress in the customs department, which is key in the context of the story that original products are leaving the country," said Geoffrey Barrett, chief of the EC delegation to Serbia-Montenegro. [EU]
The European Commission (EC) has decided to scrap the ban on duty-free imports of sugar from Serbia-Montenegro as of 7 August.
This is good news for the Serbian industry, which has suffered the consequences of the "sugar affair" for over a year now.
However, Brussels conditioned the move on the Serbian government completing a probe into the affair and punishing those responsible.
The authorities are already investigating Miodrag Kostic, owner of MK Komerc.
His company is believed to have illegally repackaged imported sugar, which was later sold to the EU under the preferential tariff arrangement.
The EC wants the names of those who participated in the scam, as well as the amount of re-exported sugar -- that is, the amount of damages Serbia will have to pay the EU.
Serbia-Montenegro was granted the preferential tariffs starting in late 2000, but they were suspended in May 2003 when the export scandal came to light.
Explaining the move to restore them, the EC said it was encouraged by new measures which clearly distinguish locally-produced sugar and provide the necessary co-operation in determining product origin.
"We have seen great progress in the customs department, which is key in the context of the story that original products are leaving the country," said Geoffrey Barrett, chief of the EC delegation to Serbia-Montenegro.
Nevertheless, European importers will have to keep checking all origin certificates for agricultural products coming from Serbia.
Officials also said the move by the EC was a demonstration of support for democracy and reforms, especially in the light of Boris Tadic's election as Serbian president.
Restoring special trade concessions means that Serbian sugar refineries will now be able to export sugar at 600 euros per tonne, up from 200 euros per tonne.
Thanks to the renewed preferential tariffs, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus said, sugar exports will pour about 83m euros annually into state coffers.
Sugar beet farmers and refineries can now breathe a sigh of relief, as sugar surpluses can once again go the EU.
Since Serbia needs about 220,000 tonnes and already has substantial reserves, it is estimated that between 100,000 tonnes and 150,000 tonnes of Serbian sugar could be exported to the EU this year.
Macedonia celebrates Feast of the Epiphany
The Christian belief that whoever retrieves a cross from a lake or river on the Epiphany will have luck all year long continues in Macedonia.
By Marina Stojanovska for Southeast European Times in Skopje -- 22/01/10 Photos by Tomislav Georgiev
Jovan Rilkovski, 30, from Ohrid (centre) recovered the cross.
Ohrid, known as the Jerusalem of Macedonia, is the centre of the country's Feast of the Epiphany celebrations.
Epiphany -- or "God shining forth" -- is celebrated in the Eastern Orthodox calendar on January 19th.
In the eastern church, the feast echoes the baptism of Christ in the Jordan River by St John the Baptist.
It also commemorates the revelation of Jesus as the Messiah and is considered the third most important day in the Orthodox year after Easter and Pentecost.
Each year, the faithful arrive in Ohrid to observe the feast day while the more courageous dive into an ice-cold lake to retrieve a wood-and-brass cross said to bring good luck to the one who finds it.
On Tuesday more 20,000 people gathered for the event.
Epiphany liturgies were held at 9am, after which two religious processions started at St George Church in Dolna Maala and St Nicolas Gerakomija in Varosh.
Both marches merged into one big celebration in the city square.
The cold did not deter a crowd of 1,000 at the harbour as the Metropolitan Debarsko-Kichevski, Bishop Timotej, blessed the water and the cross about to be thrown into the lake.
The cross was wrapped with red and white yarn and adorned with basil.
In Orthodox churches throughout the Balkans, basil is used in the preparation of holy water and often placed near altars.
The Epiphany liturgies were held at 9am.
The cross was recovered by 30-year-old Ohrid resident Jovan Rilkovski.
He and his friends then climbed aboard the boat "Macedonia" and sang the popular hymn "Vojordanie".
Rilkovski received a gold cross award weighing 1kg from festival organisers. "
There is no bigger joy for me than retrieving the cross.
It is my fourth success on the Day of Epiphany, and, I may say, that during the previous three times my family and I were followed by happiness and good health," said Rilkovski.
In Macedonia, it is customary that the person who finds the cross, accompanied by a band, visit the families in Ohrid, which in turn give money to the swimmer, who donates the cash to charity.
After the wood-and-brass cross makes its rounds in Ohrid, it is returned to the church of St Nicolas Gerakomija where it stays until the following year.
During the Epiphany celebration, most Ohrid residents -- and those in cities across Macedonia -- swim in the lake and fill bottles with water blessed by the bishop.
The faithful believe that those who swim in the blessed water are cleansed of their sins and can begin the new year fresh.
"The Epiphany celebration is the most beautiful and emblematic of the city of Ohrid tradition, especially in the winter time," said Mayor Alexander Petrevski. "Local government employees and Ohrid citizens do their best to attract a high number of tourists during the festivities."
This year, Ohrid gave EU envoy to Macedonia Ervan Fuere an Honorary Citizen award.
He regularly participates in Epiphany festivities there and this year took part in retrieving the wine barrel thrown into the lake Wednesday, Fisherman's Day, in honour of St John.
EU ministers voice support for Ahtisaari's Kosovo plan
Expressing support for UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari and his proposed settlement to the Kosovo status issue, EU foreign ministers urged Belgrade and Pristina on Monday to participate constructively in consultations set to begin next week.

UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari received strong backing from the EU on Monday (February 12th) for his proposed settlement to Kosovo's status issue.
"The proposals create the basis for Kosovo's sustainable economic and political development and for strengthening the stability of the entire region," EU foreign ministers said in a statement following a meeting in Brussels.
After nine months of largely inconclusive talks between Serbian and Kosovo Albanian officials last year, Ahtisaari presented his proposal during visits to Belgrade and Pristina on February 2nd.
While allowing Kosovo to adopt a constitution and national symbols, such as a flag and an anthem, within the framework of internationally supervised self-rule, the blueprint also offers broad autonomy for the province's Serb minority.
Voicing their "full support" for the former Finnish president and his efforts in the process to determine Kosovo's final status, the EU foreign ministers welcomed Ahtisaari's intention to engage Serbian and Kosovo Albanian negotiators in intensive consultations on his plan.
In their conclusions from Monday's meeting, the bloc's top diplomats "urged Belgrade and Pristina to participate actively and constructively in these consultations", which are scheduled to begin in Vienna on February 21st.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, who attended the meeting, also took the opportunity to condemn the violence that broke out during a weekend pro-independence protest in Kosovo.
Unhappy with the fact that the Ahtisaari plan does not mention outright independence for Kosovo, an ethnic Albanian political movement organised a rally that ended in clashes with police and the deaths of two demonstrators.
Kosovo Interior Minister Fatmir Rexhepi has resigned over the incident.
"There is no place in Kosovo for violence to achieve political objectives," the AP quoted Rehn as saying Monday. "Those who resort to it only damage their own cause."
Cinemas becoming a thing of the past in Serbia
Pervasive movie piracy in Serbia is helping to kill off the cinema industry, leaving moviegoers with fewer options.

As movie theatres gradually close their doors in Serbia, a long-cherished form of entertainment and recreation is coming to an end.
One of the main reasons, people in the waning industry say, is the lack of serious government action against movie piracy.
In March 2006, under the threat of international sanctions, the government publicly burnt 347,456 pirated CDs and DVDs. While the action raised expectations of a serious campaign against violators of intellectual property, it turned out to be a one-time effort.
Loss of ticket sales is one of the factors that has forced Beograd Film, the country's largest cinema company, out of business.
It will be auctioned on Friday (February 16th).
With 18 movie theatres in Belgrade alone, the company was once worth an estimated 20m euros.
Now the price will likely be less than 5m euros, out of which 2m euros will go towards paying off debts.
Unpaid for months, the employees and management of Beograd Film went on strike late last year.
As a result, half of the capital's cinemas were closed to moviegoers.
With ticket sales declining steadily over the past 15 years, the strike was simply the last nail in the coffin.
According to general manager Miroslav Cenic, the company's illustrious history ended with only 13% of seats being sold.
For moviegoing Belgraders, the options have narrowed.
Only a few multiplexes are open in the capital on the regular basis, and even these are in trouble.
As long as one can buy the latest blockbuster on the street for a fifth of the box office price, cinemas will be at a huge disadvantage.
The loss is felt not only by moviemakers, distributors and cinema owners, but also by those who like watching movies the traditional way -- in front of the big screen.
Macedonia seeks to woo investors to "business paradise"
Low tax rates, a one-stop shop for business registration and the country's status as an EU candidate are among the advantages highlighted in a new promotional campaign.

In a bid to increase the amount of international business in Macedonia, the government of Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski has launched a promotional campaign aimed at foreign investors.
"Invest in Macedonia, a new business paradise in Europe" is the slogan.
Through paid commercials in 50 leading papers and magazines in 35 countries, including 21 EU members, the government hopes to make international investors aware of the business advantages in Macedonia.
These include low tax rates, a one-stop shop system for business registration, access to a burgeoning consumer market, 3.1% inflation, and the promise of EU accession.
Gruevski cautions against unrealistic expectations.
"We don't believe that after the promotion, investors will just pour into Macedonia," he said. "Our initial goal is to encourage investors to think about investing in Macedonia."
The government also has announced a tender for 20 consultants who will be tasked with placing information abroad concerning business in Macedonia, the prime minister noted.
He said the Foreign Investment Agency, whose budget has been increased five times over the past year, would readily provide information for investors through a special phone line.
"I am convinced that this investment the government is making now to advertise Macedonia will only be 1% of the first investment that will come to Macedonia," Gruevski said.
Implementing cadastral reform and overhauling the country's judiciary will also help woo investors and draw more foreign capital to the country, he added.
The promotional efforts are already having an impact, according to the Foreign Investment Agency.
"So far, the Agency has received up to 70 e-mails, mostly from US companies that are asking for more detailed investment information," agency head Viktor Mizo said, expressing optimism that the trend will continue.
Business: Greece brings its deficit into line with EU rules
The EC considers ending its imposed fiscal surveillance on Greece.
Also in business this week: the Albanian government seeks to stabilise the state power utility KESH.

EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said late last week that the EC would discuss ending its fiscal surveillance imposed on Greece in 2004.
During a news conference, Almunia said Athens has managed to bring its deficit into line with EU rules, cutting it below the Stability and Growth Pact ceiling of 3% GDP in 2006.
Serbia's central bank made two interventions into the foreign exchange market, selling 37m euros and 38.4m euros respectively.
The purpose was to prevent a strong depreciation of the Serbian dinar.
Local analysts say recent political events, particularly the election of ultranationalist Tomislav Nikolic as parliament speaker, may have spurred a demand for foreign currency.
The Albanian government will allocate some 40m euros this year to support the state power utility KESH.
The authorities and the IMF agreed on the subsidy, as a measure to help stabilise the company.
Bosnia and Herzegovina's GDP growth has accelerated to 6.2% in 2006, the highest rate recorded in the past six years, according to preliminary data from the central bank.
The rate is 0.7% higher than in 2005.
The consortium of Hutchison Port Holdings, Global Holding and Aegean Exporter Unions won the privatisation auction for Izmir seaport, with a bid of 944.3m euros. Four investor groups participated in the tender.
The winning consortium must pay at least 50% of the final price before signing the agreement.
Izmir is Turkey's largest export seaport.
The Macedonian government decided to pay back a 38.3m-euro debt to the IMF prior to the 2010 deadline.
Together with early repayments to the World Bank and the European Investment Bank, Macedonia's foreign debt will now drop to 216.2m euros.

Turkey More Competitive Than Greece in Tourism
The tourism industry in the Balkans is picking up, with the Turkish coasts of the Aegean Sea making big progress in attracting tourists, due to lower costs and stepped-up advertising.
By Vassilis Vassiliou for Southeast European Times in Athens – 11/04/05

As the summer fast approaches, people in the tourism industry are preparing for their big season.
Southern Europe is the predominant choice for most Europeans -- with Spain, Italy, Greece and Turkey being the strongest players.
Tourism traffic has steadily risen in the Balkans in the last few years, after the region combated the problem of political instability.
It had affected perceptions of the whole area, rather than specific countries.
Although Greece received overwhelming media attention last year during the Olympics in Athens, and the government quadrupled the advertising budget for tourism from 7.5m euros to 30m euros, the growth of tourism has been less than expected.
While Turkey has managed to attract large contracts with the big European tour operators, Greece has a long way to go.
Last year, a ministry of tourism was established for the first time.
Tourism Minister Dimitris Avramopoulos -- the former mayor of Athens -- is scheduled to meet with representatives of the big European tour operators like TUI, Neckerman, Thomas Cook and First Choice, in order to understand their needs for next season.
Turkey, on the other hand, is doing quite well.
With an annual rate of increase of as much as 23 per cent for inbound tourism, it is expected that the country may overtake Spain as the leading holiday destination for Europeans.
Turkey spent 117m euros for tourism in 2004, compared to nearly 176m euros spent by Spain.
Most of the European tourists come from the UK and Germany.
Nearly a fifth of those tourists visited Greece in 2003, but Turkey waged an impressive campaign in 2004 and swept tourists away from both Greece and Spain.
More price-conscious tourists from Central Europe are choosing Greece and Turkey over Spain, causing double-digit increase rates for both countries.
While Spain is starting to feel the need to rebrand itself, Turkey is enjoying the full benefits of having low wages and well-developed beaches along its coastline.
Greece has been testing the waters, looking to next year.
While local associations try to further improve the service quality and communication of their offerings, a study from the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB) suggests that the overwhelming majority of visitors are just looking for sea and sun.
Greece is able to capitalise on this for three months of the year, but is losing out during the other nine months.
The government is doing everything it can to promote the development of alternative tourism on all sides.
There are grants available to individuals for building agrotourism accommodations in rural areas, there are low-interest loans for hotels to expand and renovate, and there are efforts to reach the high end of the market by promoting the construction of golf courses.
According to the AUEB study, however, these efforts are too new to affect the market much before 2006.
New Mayor Wants to Change Bucharest's Look
The new mayor of Bucharest promises to turn the city into a huge construction site for the next three years.
About one billion euros will be spent to solve some of the capital's most serious problems.

When it rains, only their rubber boots help them through the thick layer of mud that covers the streets.
The water for drinking or washing comes from wells and, after usage, goes straight into the soil, as no sewage network is available in the area.
In winter, wood stoves heat the houses.
This picture of life in a remote rural area is also the norm for Bucharest's outskirts.
Many of city's two million residents still live in nearly the same conditions as 100 years ago -- only electricity separates them from their ancestors.
About one third of Bucharest's 5,300 streets lack at least one of the following: running water, a sewage system, natural gas network or asphalt.
Bucharest's new mayor, Adriean Videanu, says he is going to change that.
Videanu counts on dozens of projects his predecessor, Traian Basescu, prepared before leaving office to become president of Romania.
"We have a project [that envisions] paving 1,850 secondary streets and expanding and modernising 300km of water pipes and 270km of sewage lines.
It will cost about 475m euros -- most of the money will come through an external loan," Videanu said.
The main roads will also be targeted -- and 60m euros will be spent for capital repairs this year.
Since 1989, the number of cars registered in the city has increased fivefold.
In order to make the nightmarish traffic more fluid, 21m euros will be invested in an automatic system of traffic management.
The most congested crossroads will be controlled by specialists.
Another 90m euros will be used to build a bridge over Bucharest's main railway and one big underground parking lot.
Public transportation must change as well.
Videanu promises to finish the rehabilitation of the tram lines and to buy 500 new buses.
The road and underground infrastructure in the historical centre will also receive money.
Authorities hope to transform a ruined area into a point of interest for tourists and investors by next year.
Analysts Expect Transfers of Mladic Aides to Help Solve Srebrenica Puzzle
Analysts believe that the pending trials against some of Ratko Mladic's close aides, who have been transferred to The Hague in the past few months, could provide answers to some important questions concerning the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.
(Blic - 11/04/05; BBC Monitoring, Fena, Radio B92 - 10/04/05; AP - 09/04/05; Reuters, BBC, Institute for War and Peace Reporting - 08/04/05)

Nearly a decade after the July 1995 massacre of more than 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys, at least two questions -- who made the decision for the slaughter and when -- remain unanswered.
The pending trials against several close associates of wartime Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic may help uncover the final pieces of the Srebrenica puzzle, the Institute for War and Peace Reporting (IWPR) reported Friday (8 April).
Former Bosnian Serb Army (VRS) Security Chief Ljubisa Beara, said to have been Mladic's right-hand man, was extradited to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in October 2004.
Six others charged with war crimes in connection with the Srebrenica massacre have also been transferred to The Hague: Milan Gvero, a former VRS morale officer and an unofficial Mladic spokesman, and three former members of the VRS's Zvornik Brigade -- Vinko Pandurevic, Drago Nikolic and Milorad Trbic.
Two others -- former VRS main staff officer Radivoje Miletic and former military police General Ljubomir Borovcanin -- are already in the ICTY detention centre.
The Serbian government said Friday that Vujadin Popovic, former assistant security commander of the VRS's Drina Corps, would be transferred to The Hague this week.
In addition to other counts of war crimes brought against them, Beara, Pandurevic, Nikolic and Popovic have been charged with genocide or complicity in genocide.
Borovcanin has also been accused of complicity in genocide.
Like Gvero and Miletic, he faces four counts of crimes against humanity and one count of violations of the laws or customs of war.
Beara and Gvero have pleaded not guilty to all charges against them, while those who have already made their first appearance before UN judges have used their right to defer their pleas for 30 days.
Borovcanin and Beara's transfers to The Hague could prove particularly important, Dr Jan Willem Honig, a senior lecturer in war studies at King's College in London, told the IWPR.
"They are the key players that provide a link between the VRS regular military units and Mladic, and maybe, by implication, [former Bosnian Serb President Radovan] Karadzic," said Honig, who is also the co-author of the book "Srebrenica: Record of a War Crime".
Citing a source from Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) intelligence agency, the Sarajevo-based daily Dnevni Avaz reported Saturday that Mladic was currently in a military facility in Pancevo, northeast of Belgrade.
He had arrived there recently, after hiding in the vicinity of Niksic, Montenegro.
According to the report, three people, including an army officer on active duty, were protecting him.
The source says it was Mladic's arrival in Pancevo that prompted Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic's sharp remarks last week, when he accused the Serbian intelligence agency of shielding Mladic.
With the approach of the 10th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre -- often described as the single worst atrocity in European history since World War II -- Serbia and BiH's Serb-run entity, Republika Srpska, have come under increasing pressure to arrest and hand over the fugitive.
New Cyprus peace talks launched
A meeting between the leaders of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities Wednesday marked the official launch of fresh negotiations aimed at ending Cyprus's 34-year division.

Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat launched a new round of peace talks Wednesday (September 3rd) amid high hopes that the process will lead to a deal ending the Mediterranean island's 34-year ethnic division.
"We must, at long last, put an end to the suffering of our people and reunite our country," Christofias said as he headed for the meeting, held at UN Special Representative to Cyprus Taye-Brook Zerihoun's residence in the UN buffer zone dividing Nicosia.
The talks were attended also by former Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, who has been serving as UN special envoy for Cyprus since July.
Talat's chief aide also appeared optimistic about the eventual outcome.
"This is a historic day, a beautiful day," Reuters quoted Ozdil Nami as saying. "Both leaders will be sending a message of hope to their people ... to the world, that they are willing to negotiate."
The most recent attempt to resolve the issue ended in failure in April 2004, when Greek Cypriot voters overwhelmingly rejected a UN-sponsored reunification deal.
Although the majority of Turkish Cypriots voted in favour of the proposal, only the internationally recognised Greek-run part of the island joined the EU on May 1st that year.
Hopes for the stalled peace process rose earlier this year after Christofias won a presidential runoff, pledging to spare no effort towards ending the island's division.
In their first face-to-face talks on March 21st, he and Talat agreed to start preparations for new direct negotiations.
Under the deal, six working groups and seven technical committees were established in April to work out the details of a reunification agreement before the launch of UN-sponsored comprehensive peace talks.
After several meetings to assess the progress made by the panels, about six weeks ago Christofias and Talat set September 3rd as the starting date of the new negotiations.
In his opening remarks Wednesday, Christofias stressed that any solution should rest on the principles he and Talat have reaffirmed during their previous meetings.
"We must consistently adhere to the agreed common basis… a bizonal, bicommunal federation with political equality, as defined by the relevant Security Council Resolutions, with a single sovereignty, citizenship and international personality," he said.
An agreement will have to be "approved by the people in separate simultaneous referenda with no arbitration or artificial timetables, to safeguard the Cypriot ownership of the process and that the outcome will be a Cypriot solution by the Cypriots and for the Cypriots," Christofias added.
The focus of Wednesday's meeting is on procedural issues, with substantive talks scheduled to begin on September 11th.
A host of reunification issues will be discussed during the negotiations, including governance, EU matters, the economy, health and the environment.
Security, property rights and territory are expected to be among the thorniest issues.
A solution to the Cyprus issue would mean an end to the international isolation of the Turkish Cypriots, who account for less than a fifth of the island's population of nearly 800,000 people.
While no deadline has been set for the negotiations, Talat has voiced hope that an agreement could be reached by the end of this year.
The two leaders, who are expected to meet at least once a week during the talks, have decided to establish a secure hotline so that they can have direct phone contact during the process.
Praising the two sides for overcoming difficulties that arose over the past few months and for their commitment towards reaching a solution, Downer warned of potential difficulties and challenges in the months ahead.
"The Cyprus problem is not insurmountable and the negotiations which you begin today can and must have a successful outcome," he said at Wednesday's talks. "You own this process and, as a result, your continuing leadership is a critical element to make it succeed."
Serbia finds humanitarian use for mafia property
Homes and buildings once owned by crime bosses are being reused for civic purposes.

Serbia has been implementing the law that provides for the confiscation of property acquired through criminal means.
The value of properties seized so far has been estimated at 200m euros.
This includes facilities owned by Milorad Lukovic Legija -- convicted of organising the assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic -- and drug lord Darko Saric, wanted for smuggling cocaine from Colombia.
According to the Serbian Justice Ministry, the confiscated facilities will primarily be used for humanitarian purposes: retirement homes, youth centres and centres for the disabled.
Four such facilities have already been handed over to the Belgrade city administration, including Darko Saric's house.
It is now a centre for the recovery of child cancer patients, said Slobodan Homen, a ministry senior official.
"We give away only the best facilities because many of them fell into disrepair, as their owners are on the run.
The state is also raking in serious revenue from renting out [confiscated] apartments, more than 100,000 euros per month, which goes to charities.
We finance the work of soup kitchens or aid municipalities hit by a natural disaster, such as the floods in the Trgoviste municipality," Homen said.
He explained that leasing out large, luxury villas is especially profitable.
An example is property previously owned by Saric, which was offered to foreign states for their embassies.
Apart from houses, many commercial venues are rented out, he adds.
Other facilities are given to institutions that fight crime, Homen said.
"One confiscated facility in Kragujevac is now a police station, and other facilities were handed over to the gendarmerie and prosecutors' offices."
He also said that over 100 cars were seized so far and all were given away to the financial inspectorate, the Security Information Agency, the army, and primary health care units.
About 15 companies were seized, along with thousands hectares of land.
Three hotels estimated at around 30m euros each were seized in Serbia's northern province of Vojvodina.
"One should be cautious with companies, since many are in debt," Homen said.
He said the state does not sell seized facilities, but rather runs them like a good host, and if anyone whose property was confiscated is cleared of criminal charges, their property will be returned to them.
While many citizens welcome this use of ill-gotten gains, they remain outraged that criminals are able to amass such levels of wealth in the first place.
"The state must not allow criminals to be richer than the state," says Belgrade resident Mitar Golijan.
"It would be better yet if the state did not have to seize criminals' property to solve citizens' problems," adds Gordana Krstic.

LOT Houses Show Changing Face of BiH Peacekeeping
Groups of peacekeeping soldiers living in more than 40 houses in local communities throughout BiH are now the first point of contact that residents, politicians and police have with the troops.

Five US SFOR soldiers and handful of local authorities in Ugljevik, in northeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), sat around a table on a recent morning, hammering out the logistical details as to how area authorities could collect weapons held by civilians.
"We're not professionals, and we can't pick up explosives and weapons and keep them at our houses," said Deputy Mayor Aco Tomic.
Meetings between SFOR soldiers and local authorities are nothing new.
What is new is that when the soldiers went home after the meeting, they headed to their own house in town, rather than to a nearby military base.
Since July, more than a dozen Indiana National Guard troops have been living in this three-story house -- which, apart from a wooden weapons-discharging box outside and a bright yellow sign forbidding photography, blends in with the other grey-stone façade houses on the street.
Along with meeting regularly with municipal officials and police, they have a "receiving room" where local people can come to them with their concerns.
They visit political party offices. They read the local press, courtesy of their two live-in translators.
"We are the direct liaison for the general populace, and as observation teams we monitor what goes on in the areas that we cover,"said Sergeant Charles Mitchener.
The restructuring of the NATO peacekeeping force in preparation for an EU takeover at the end of the year -- which included a drawdown to 7,000 troops in June -- paved the way for the Liaison and Observation Team (LOT) house concept, of which the Ugljevik house is part.
More than 40 of the houses are scattered throughout BiH.
Today, while the adults seem to be accepting -- only giving passing glances to two soldiers eating in a local restaurant -- the children can be downright friendly.
At the house, a group of kids passing by shouted a chorus of "Hi"s in English up at one soldier on the balcony.
"How are you guys?" he asked in the local language. "We're good -- we're going to school,” hollered one girl, before they erupted into giggles.
"I interact with the kids all the time, and that's how I’ve been learning Serbo-Croatian," said Specialist Donald Pence, adding that the "real experience" was the best thing about living and working in the town.
Another guardsman, whose first deployment to BiH was in 2002, said that living here was much better than living insulated on base.
"I'd prefer to be in the house," said Sergeant Matt Beck. "This is the main focus of the US mission now -- it's kind of a proving ground for this concept."

A new bridge over the Danube River linking the Romanian town of Calafat with Bulgaria's Vidin is expected to be fully operational in 2008.
Actual construction of the multi-million-euro facility is due to begin in 2005.

A bridge linking the Romanian town of Calafat with Bulgaria's Vidin will be fully operational in 2008, according to Bulgarian Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg and his Romanian counterpart, Adrian Nastase.
It will be the second bridge to connect the two countries via the Danube River.
The two leaders attended a ceremony Sunday (20 June) marking the 50th anniversary of the opening of the first bridge, on 20 June 1954.
Joining the port cities of Ruse in Bulgaria and Giurgiu in Romania, it was completed in two years and three months. At the time of its construction, the 2.2km structure was one of the longest bridges in Europe.
Meeting at the bridge's mid-point, the prime ministers said that while the facility once commemorated Communist-era "friendship", it now symbolises the two countries' common path to eventual EU membership.
After the ceremony, Saxe-Coburg and Nastase flew to Calafat, where Romanian Minister of Transport, Construction and Tourism Miron Tudor Mitrea made a short presentation regarding the new bridge project.
Nastase voiced confidence that the project would be completed by 2008.
Saxe-Coburg said he hoped it could be finalised even earlier.
The overall cost of the project, according to the Bulgarian News Network, is 230m euros.
Romania has approved 48.2m euros for construction, while Bulgaria has agreed to provide 62m euros.
The EU and other West European donors will finance the rest.
Last week, Bulgaria said it would sign an agreement with Germany's Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau on a 20m-euro credit for the construction of the Vidin-Calafat bridge.
One-tenth of the financing will come in the form of grant money.
Kreditanstalt has already provided a 470,000-euro loan for some of the technical studies relating to the project.
Fifteen companies from Bulgaria and from EU member states have submitted bids for the design and construction of the project, according to Bulgarian media.
Up to eight companies will be short-listed and invited to submit their offers.
Prior to the actual start of construction next year, other procedures will be initiated for the selection of a construction supervisor and a reviewer, as well as for choosing a contractor to build the adjoining infrastructure on Bulgaria's territory.
The selection procedure for the design and construction contractor is open to companies based in any of the EU member states, as well as in Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey.
Canadian troops leave BiH
SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- The mission of Canadian troops in BiH officially ended on Monday (March 29th) with five officers and one non-commissioned soldier returning home.
Canadian Ambassador to BiH Pierre Guimond noted at a ceremony in Sarajevo that Canada was among the first countries to send peacekeepers. He said that BiH is moving in the right direction and Canada's focus for the time being is Afghanistan.
More than 40,000 Canadian soldiers have served in Balkan missions since 1991. (RTRS, Srna, Fena, AFP, Canadian Press - 29/03/10)
Mitrovica: temporary fix, long term problem
NATO has prevented an escalation in the border crisis, but the underlying issues remain hard to resolve.

With NATO peacekeepers taking charge of disputed border control points, the crisis in Kosovo's north has abated for the time being.
But the long-term issues remain, experts say, with little sign that Belgrade and Pristina can reach an agreement.
A lack of rule of law is the major contributing factor to the crisis in Kosovo's north, the commander of KFOR said in a recent interview with German media.
Multiethnic criminal gangs, composed of ethnic Albanians as well as Serbs, have been allowed free rein.
"For these structures, radical and criminal, it is about maintaining power. It's about money, and they are the ones who really have the say in the north today," General Erhard Bühler told the German newspaper Tagesspiegel.
"These are the ones that control the armed forces that control the roadblocks and pay the people who stand guard at roadblocks.
And basically they take the peace-loving population in the north as a sort of hostage."
Although representatives sent by Belgrade reached an agreement with KFOR that paves the way for the removal of barricades and the restoration of free movement, analysts say the deal is only a temporary measure that does not resolve the larger issues.
"It may provide comfort on the ground, but does not provide a solution to the northern political problem," political commentator Fatlum Sadiku told SETimes.
A lasting solution can only be achieved through dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina, analysts say -- a dialogue that has had problems getting off the ground.
"Dialogue is a necessity and no one has the opportunity escape from this process," said Ramadan Ilazi, executive director of the FOL Movement in Pristina. "But the dialogue [so far] has never been between Kosovo and Serbia, but rather was a dialogue of Belgrade and Pristina with the European Union."
Hampering the effort, however, is the fact that Belgrade and Pristina have radically different assumptions about the future of northern Kosovo, with its predominantly Serb demographic.
While the government of Kosovo is intent on bringing the area under its authority, local Serb communities remain opposed to such a plan -- and Belgrade, which has vowed never to recognise Kosovo as an independent state -- continues to back them.
According to Ilazi, the Ahtisaari Plan offers the best long-term hope for the north.
It has been proven to be sustainable solution, he says, because Serbs in the southern parts of Kosovo are able to live with it.
"This plan has been a success in the integration and development of the Serbian community which was living in the ghetto in the South, and the examples of Strpce, Gracanica and other municipalities that have accepted the plan clearly demonstrate an improvement in the quality of their life," he said.
Sadiku, meanwhile, is convinced that the integration of the north will happen when "rule of law exists there and criminal and radical gangs are fought".
With both Serbia and Kosovo aspiring to eventual EU membership, Brussels has attempted to steer the focus towards the long-term picture, urging both sides to get back to the negotiating table.
"The EU underlines the need to return to the dialogue and to resolve the underlying issues without delay.
The EU expects to see rapid and substantive progress on this," said Michael Mann, spokesperson for the bloc's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton.
"We hope that a pragmatic and de-escalating interim solution that is acceptable to all parties can be found as soon as possible," Mann added.
RS commemorates Jasenovac concentration camp victims
BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- More than 1,000 people gathered on Sunday (May 1st) at the Donja Gradina memorial in Republika Srpska (RS) to commemorate victims of the notorious Jasenovac concentration camp, run by Ustasha forces in World War II.
Memorial services for Serbs, Jews and Romas killed in the camp were held as part of Holocaust Remembrance Day.
Among those attending the ceremony were RS President Milorad Dodik, RS Parliament Speaker Igor Radojcic, Serbian Parliament Speaker Slavica Djukic-Dejanovic, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon and Russian Ambassador to Sarajevo Aleksandar Bocan Harcenko.
Donja Gradina was the biggest mass execution site within the Jasenovac complex. More than 360,000 people, most of them Serbs, were killed there. (Nezavisne Novine, RTRS, Srna - 01/05/11)
Species of Adriatic fish threatened with extinction
Fishing overexploitation, pollution and global warming may result in roughly 100 of the 434 fish species in the Adriatic Sea becoming endangered, according to local experts.

Several species of fish are endangered, experts say. [Getty Images]
There has been an obvious reduction of fish species in the Adriatic if today's species are compared with those of ten, 20 or 30 years ago, experts warn.
"The entire Croatian fishing industry depends on small blue fish," says Dr. Alen Soldo of the University of Croatia. "If there were no small blue fish, the fishing industry could face a collapse."
He said hake and Norway lobster are the most endangered by commercial fishing, adding however that overfishing is not the only factor contributing to the problem.
"Commercial fishing is definitely endangering some fish species, but pollution and global warming are also contributing to the effect," he said.
Due to global warming, the average temperature in the Mediterranean will increase by 1.2 degrees Celsius, Soldo said, but added that the actual changes cannot be predicted at the moment.
"Commercial fishing might change in a few years or a few decades and other fish species may move into the Adriatic while others would leave due to warming," Soldo said. "In fact, some species have already moved into the Adriatic and others have left for colder waters."
Inadequate fish species monitoring contributes to the issue, Soldo said. "We know that mostly sharks and ray are endangered.
They did not have a natural enemy, but their fishing overexploitation could allow for a fast reduction of these species.
Since there is no proper monitoring of fishing quotas in the Adriatic, we are not able to say much about whether tuna fish are endangered.
However, we know that Croatian fisheries can fish less than 900 tonnes of tuna a year," he said.
According to the head of Croatia's Fishing Authorities, Ivan Katavic, the country has 3,692 commercial fishing ships and boats that catch 52,000 tonnes of small blue fish annually.
Croatia also exports 6,700 tonnes of tuna to Japan per year, as well as 108m euros worth of fish to Italy, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia.
Troika members confirm no agreement reached, differ on next steps
Members of the international troika that mediated 120 days of Kosovo status talks were in Belgrade and Pristina this week to present their report.

The latest round of talks on Kosovo's future is effectively over, and no agreement was reached, a troika of international mediators said this week.
"We … regret that the two sides were not able to agree on a settlement on Kosovo's status," the EU's representative in the group, Wolfgang Ischinger, said in Belgrade Monday (December 3rd).
"Our work ends with a report that we are finalising.
That of course doesn't mean that the negotiations on Kosovo could not be explored in other form or elsewhere," he said.
He and the two other troika members visited Belgrade and Pristina to present their report to the two sides in the talks, prior to submitting it to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon on December 10th.
They said their report would contain details of the positions expressed by Belgrade and Pristina during 120 days of negotiations.
It will not make any proposals for status, but will note that the two sides could not agree.
The troika appears split over the next potential step in the status process.
US envoy Frank Wisner said that once the report is submitted, it would now be up to individual governments to "take over" the Kosovo issue.
But Russian representative Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko insisted that any decision must be made by the UN Security Council.
As in previous rounds of the status process, the two sides remain fundamentally at odds over the future of Kosovo.
The Kosovo Albanians insist they will not settle for anything short of independence, while the Serbs continue to offer various forms of "broad autonomy".
Serbian Minister for Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic and Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic both suggested more talks could be in store.
"We believe that the negotiations do not end with the troika's report.
It is a very important phase and what has been said from the very beginning is that this phase was much more successful than the first one run by [former UN envoy] Martti Ahtisaari," Samardzic said.
Jeremic, meanwhile, warned against any unilateral moves by Kosovo leaders, who have been warning independence could be declared unilaterally if no international agreement is reached.
"Any kind of change of status and international status in Kosovo must be secured by a decision from the UN," the Serbian foreign minister said.
Kosovo leaders, however, have ruled out more talks, saying they consider the negotiations process to be over.
President Fatmir Sejdiu reiterated that independence is the only acceptable solution.
"We think that Ahtisaari's project will be implemented," he said, referring to the plan proposed earlier this year by the former envoy.
It calls for "supervised independence" under the guidance of the international community.
Kosovo's goal is to become a modern and democratic state for both the majority and minority communities, Sejdiu said.
In other news, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer stressed that KFOR is ready to protect the Serbian minority in Kosovo.
At a joint press conference with Croatian President Stipe Mesic, he said the coming weeks will be a sensitive time.
The Kosovo status issue cannot be solved by violence, he said.
Mesic, meanwhile, urged Kosovo's Serbs to become actively involved in Kosovo politics.
He called on Belgrade to clear the way for their participation.
Host of Problems Impede Return of Internally Displaced Persons in Kosovo
Internally displaced persons in Kosovo continue to face major problems impeding their return to their pre-conflict homes, a UN envoy said after visiting the region.
(UN News Centre, UN Office at Geneva - 24/06/05; Refugees International - 15/06/05; BBC - 13/06/05)
Earlier this month, both the BBC and Refugees International reported on hundreds of Roma --many of them children -- living in refugee camps in Kosovo. [AFP]
While the situation in Kosovo appears to have improved, the number of minority returns remains very low, the UN Secretary General's Representative on the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) said Friday (24 June) following a visit to the region.
During his three-day tour of Kosovo, Walter Kalin was told that there had been fewer interethnic incidents over the past few months.
But IDPs and returnees said they were still concerned about their own safety.
One reason they cited was persistent low-level harassment.
Other major problems include curtailed freedom of movement, lack of employment opportunities and insufficient funding, according to the UN representative.
"Particularly deplorable is the fact that considerable numbers of IDPs are forced to continue their dismal lives in camps and elsewhere because there is no donor money available to implement their return," a statement issued by the UN Office at Geneva (UNOG) quoted Kalin as saying.
Urging Kosovo's provisional institutions and UNMIK to address these problems, Kalin expressed concern that none of them had a clear-cut responsibility for the IDPs. As a result, many were "largely neglected," Kalin said, stressing that the activities of the relevant authorities have been focused exclusively on refugee returns and not on those still living as IDPs in Kosovo.
"This is especially true for Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian IDPs who together with the other non-Serb minorities feel caught between the two main ethnic communities in Kosovo," the UNOG statement said.
Kalin further appealed to the international community to take urgent action to evacuate scores of Roma people affected by lead poisoning in camps in northern Mitrovica.
"This situation is an emergency," he said. "A failure to act now would amount to a violation of the right of the affected children to have their health and physical integrity protected."
Earlier this month, the BBC and Refugees International (RI) reported on the case of hundreds of Roma living in refugee camps in Kosovo, in the vicinity of a lead smelter in Mitrovica.
Although the facility is no longer in use, the area is likely contaminated with extremely high levels of poisonous lead.
The Office of the UNHCR reportedly set up the makeshift camps in 1999 as a temporary shelter for Roma, Ashkali, and Egyptian IDPs who fled their homes in southern Mitrovica.
Although the initial intentions were for the displaced people to spend no more than 90 days in the wooden huts, they have not been moved.
Zitkovac, one of three camps in the area, is said to be the worst affected.
Containing mostly children, its wooden huts are close to the old smelter and within several hundred metres of a toxic slag heap, the BBC reported.
According to WHO, which describes the situation as an environmental disaster, at least one child has died from lead poisoning.
"Children between birth and six years old are the most vulnerable as they are in the primary stages of growth and development," the RI said in a report.
"Lead poisoning affects the entire body and has severe and permanent health consequences … According to the WHO reports, the most significant and irreversible effect is on IQ levels."
UNMIK officials told the BBC earlier this month that the Roma had been offered temporary accommodation in less contaminated areas but had refused it.
Preferential Export Status to Boost Serbian Trade With US
Serbian exports to the United States could triple as a result of US President George W. Bush's decision last month to grant Serbia-Montenegro preferential export status.
Food, flooring, tires and electronics are among the products slated for export under the new arrangement.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade – 18/07/05
"This decision has great importance for our economy and there is no doubt that it is highly stimulating for the enhancement of trade with the United States," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica. [AFP]
With US President George W. Bush's decision last month to grant Serbia-Montenegro preferential export status, the final remaining sanctions Washington imposed in 1992 against the former Yugoslavia have been lifted.
The decision will primarily benefit Serbian businesses, which will now be able to export a broad range of products to the United States duty free.
Instituted in 1987, the general preferential system is intended to help developing countries achieve economic growth through the expansion of trade.
It provides preferential duty-free entry for more than 4,650 products from 144 countries and territories around the globe.
Speaking on 1 July, US Ambassador to Serbia-Montenegro Michael Polt indicated that the move reflected economic reforms and the improved business climate in the country.
"We conducted a study and came to the conclusion that there is a free market in Serbia, that there are laws protecting US investors, and based on that we made the decision," Polt said.
Washington's goal in providing the preferential export status is to help boost the development of Serbia-Montenegro's economy, Polt said.
Asked whether future US support would be tied to Belgrade's co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, he said relations between the United States and Serbia-Montenegro are not based on a policy of conditions, but on common interests and goals.
In the early 1990s, Serbia's exports to the United States totaled some $200m. During 10 years of wars and sanctions, exports plummeted to a mere $20m.
Analysts now predict the level could triple.
Gaining preferential export status is "good political and economic news", said Serbian International Economic Relations Minister Milan Parivodic.
It opens up a market of around 280 million consumers for Serbian companies, he said, noting that the United States, the EU and Russia combined make up a total market of 930 million consumers.
According to Parivodic, the first goods up for export to the United States are food products, flooring, tires and electronic industry products.
Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica also hailed the preferential status.
"This decision has great importance for our economy and there is no doubt that it is highly stimulating for the enhancement of trade with the United States," he said.
Floods Wreak Havoc in Romania
Twenty people have been killed and thousands left homeless in the worst floods to hit Romania in 50 years.

Heavy floods have killed 20 people in Romania over a one-week period and have left thousands homeless, authorities said Sunday (17 July).
The floods, the result of torrential rains that have swollen rivers and dams, are said to be the worst to hit the country in 50 years.
The disaster has caused significant material damage, particularly in the eastern counties of Bacau, Braila, Galati and Vrancea.
The death toll was the highest in Vrancea, where 13 people were reportedly killed by the deluge, the Romanian news agency Rompres reported Sunday after a meeting of the country's National Emergency Committee, attended also by President Traian Basescu and Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu.
"Our first priority at this moment is to save human lives," Reuters quoted Basescu as saying before leaving for the county of Buzau, south of Vrancea.
Tariceanu said he did not expect the death toll to rise further, as no more people are reported missing.
He said army helicopters are airlifting food, drinking water and other emergency aid to stranded villagers. Efforts to pump away floodwater also are under way.
"The army will help the population with manpower and equipment," the prime minister said Sunday morning.
"Beds and tents have started to be distributed."
In 103 settlements across the four counties, more than 10,000 houses were flooded and 509 were completely destroyed, according to Rompres. Over 11,000 people had to be evacuated.
Of a total of some 90,000 animals were killed by the floods, 20,000 died in the raging waters in Vrancea county alone.
About 85,000 hectares of farmland and nearly 1,300 hectares of pastures have been inundated and more than 550 bridges have been damaged or destroyed.
In addition, a total of nearly 500km of roads have been damaged.
Efforts to repair the infrastructure began Saturday with the help of military engineering troops.
Tariceanu promised that electricity, gas and water supplies would be restored as soon as possible.
The government has allocated around one billion new lei (about 280m euros) for the reconstruction of infrastructure and is seeking additional international aid.
The Romanian daily Ziua reported Monday that Agriculture Minister Gheorghe Flutur has asked the EU to redirect 110m euros of the funds earmarked for Romania under the Sapard programme for investments in rural infrastructure and dams.
In talks Saturday with Stability Pact co-ordinator Erhard Busek, Foreign Minister Mihai Razvan Ungureanu appealed for assistance in coping with the flood situation, the Mediafax news agency reported.
Serbia's Ivanovic: Belgrade-Pristina talks could start in March
BELGRADE, Serbia -- State Secretary for Kosovo Oliver Ivanovic said Saturday (February 5th) that talks between Belgrade and Pristina could start in March.
He said the first topic to be discussed should be the fate of missing and kidnapped people.
Ivanovic said the success of the talks will depend on the constructive approach of Kosovo Albanians. (Tanjug, RTS - 05/02/11)

Roma plight surfaces again in Baia Mare
The city's plan to demolish Roma dwellings and relocate their inhabitants has drawn fire.
By Paul Ciocoiu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest -- 08/09/11

Months after a controversy surrounding the building of a segregation wall, Baia Mare -- a city of 200,000 in the country's northwest -- has again come under fire.
City authorities say they plan to relocate over 2,000 Roma who live mostly in makeshift dwellings.
They will be moved to a yet-to-be-built neighbourhood for social cases outside the city on the banks of the Craica River.
Local NGOs and other institutions are sharply criticising the city government's plan, however.
They echo concerns voiced by Amnesty International and other organisations that the move is discriminatory.
The US Embassy in Bucharest has also questioned the move.
"Roma inhabitants were not notified of the planned demolition and city authorities have declared their intent to evict these people without regard for their health or safety," the embassy said in a press release.
Marian Mandache, head of the Roma NGO Romani Criss, says that putting five different Roma communities together will result in the five small problems of those communities becoming one larger problem.
"There is the risk of a conflict breaking out anytime among them," Mandache told SETimes, adding that his group had communicated the drawbacks of the plan to the mayor and other city authorities.
"We asked for people to be consulted in a serious manner; not to disconnect those communities from the city; and finally, to change the location of the future social neighbourhood where these Roma are planned to be moved, because the place is right next to the water cleaning station and a former waste dump," he said.
As an alternative, the NGO has proposed constructing the new community on the very site where the Roma now live.
"Why buy lots of land outside the city and not use the current one which will be vacated after the dwellings are demolished?" he said.
Mayor Catalin Chereches, however, is sticking to the current plan.
"Of course we have spoken to them; everything is done according to the manual.
We have had this plan going on for three months and we spoke to every Roma there and the local Roma organisations," Chereches told SETimes, insisting that the US Embassy had been deliberately misinformed by NGOs.
"There is this poverty hotbed where people have been living in makeshift barracks for about 17 years, with no running water, sewage, electric power or central heating," Chereches said. "Does anyone want these people to keep living in the same dire conditions instead of offering them a decent standard of living?"
"We are observing the law and we are putting order in this community," Chereches said.
The new neighbourhood, he added, will be built in a strategic location that cannot be disclosed now.
German participation in Eurozone bailouts gets court approval
A ruling by Germany's constitutional court said on Wednesday will allow the Eurozone's biggest economy to continue participating in bailouts for debt-laden members.
(Various sources -- 05/09/11 - 07/09/11)
"The euro is the guarantor of a unified Europe," Merkel said. "If the euro collapses, Europe collapses." [Reuters]
Germany's top court ruled on Wednesday (September 7th) that the country's contribution to Eurozone bailouts agreed last year was legal, rejecting lawsuits aimed at blocking Berlin's participation in emergency loan packages for debt-stricken members of the 17-nation area.
The decision of the Federal Constitutional Court came in response to claims challenging the legality of Germany's decision to take part in both the first, 110-billion-euro rescue package for Greece and the 440-billion-euro European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).
The court in the southern city of Karlsruhe required the government to get the approval of the parliamentary budget committee before agreeing to provide any further financial guarantees for future emergency loans to troubled Eurozone nations.
Judge Andreas Vosskuhle, president of the constitutional court's second chamber, said it was "a very close decision".
"It should not be mistakenly interpreted as a constitutional blank cheque authorising further rescue measures," he stressed.
Observers said the court's judgment would also prevent the introduction of common eurobonds that several countries, including Belgium and Luxembourg, have been calling for as a tool for dealing with the current turmoil in the Eurozone.
While it could effectively complicate crisis response efforts in the euro area, the court's decision was welcomed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Addressing lawmakers during a budget debate later on Wednesday, she said the ruling was a confirmation of her government's policy of balancing solidarity in the 17-nation euro area with member states' individual responsibility.
Defending the euro, she also stressed that its importance is not confined solely to merely a currency shared by the members of a common monetary zone.
"The euro guarantees a unified Europe," the German leader told lawmakers. "If the euro collapses, Europe collapses."
British daily Financial Times quoted Merkel as also stressing that no countries with a shared currency had ever gone to war with one another.
The European Commission (EC) also hailed the German constitutional court's decision, which would allow Berlin to take part in future bailouts, including the second rescue package for Greece approved by the leaders of the Eurozone nations in July.
Pia Ahrenkilde, the EC's chief spokeswoman, said the EU's Brussels-based executive arm "has taken note with satisfaction of the constitutional court ruling".
The move, she added, "has an important bearing on the capacity of the Union and of its member states to act, to surmount the sovereign debt crisis affecting certain member states".
Ahrenkilde also expressed the EC's confidence that Germany's democratic institutions "will be able to comply with this ruling while ... maintaining their capacity to act effectively and decisively".
In a televised address on Tuesday evening, Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos announced an urgent plan of immediate privatisations, pledging also that the government will speed up public sector and labour market reforms to cut public spending.
Turkey's earthquake strategy
Situated on some of the world's most active fault lines, Turkey grapples with earthquake preparedness and awareness.
By Menekse Tokyay for Southeast European Times in Istanbul -- 08/09/11
Poor construction and infrastructure make Turkey vulnerable to earthquakes. [Reuters]
Since 1950, nearly 32,000 people have lost their lives in earthquakes.
The most destructive was the August 17th 1999 Marmara quake, measuring 7.4 on the Richter Scale, which killed nearly 17,000 people and left approximately 600,000 homeless.
Marking that 12th anniversary, the government announced a national earthquake strategy and action plan.
"Our main objective is to prevent or reduce the social, economic, environmental, political and physical damage or impact of earthquakes," said Deputy Prime Minister Besir Atalay.
The new earthquake strategy draws on studies prepared by a parliamentary sub-commission, with the co-ordination of the Earthquake Advisory Board, and incorporates plans prepared by 13 institutions.
In drafting the plan, the government also consulted relevant NGOs and academics.
Construction engineer and AKP deputy Professor Pelin Gundes Bakir emphasises the importance of collaboration among political parties, universities, engineers, architects and NGO representatives on such a crucial matter, regardless of their ideological approaches.
"Human-focused issues like earthquakes and urban regeneration should be elaborated with a supra-party approach," she says.
The plan consists of seven main objectives, 29 strategies and 87 actions.
In this framework, new living environments that are more sustainable and resistant to damage will be established.
The plan also aims to establish monitoring stations and an early alert system for tsunamis, as well as preparing danger maps.
An uninterrupted communication system will also be established under the new plan.
It also initiates an urban regeneration process while strengthening critical infrastructure facilities as well as main public buildings.
However, according to the Chamber of Civil Engineers, the plan only focuses on retrofitting buildings and, consequently, excludes housing demolishment and the reconstruction of old buildings which cannot be strengthened due to financial limitations.
Experts also criticise the plan for including public infrastructure at the expense of private buildings, still leaving large sections of the population vulnerable to earthquakes.
It is estimated that in Istanbul alone, 90% of buildings are not resistant to earthquakes and a considerable budget and time -- nearly 20-25 years -- would be needed to retrofit all the buildings in the city.
On the other hand, the plan requires that natural disaster and emergency issues are included in the curriculum of primary and secondary education, while in higher education there will be specific programmes for natural disaster management.
The plan also takes into consideration the need for protecting historical and cultural heritage from the impacts of earthquakes.
"This new plan provides a roadmap for co-ordinating multidimensional measures against the danger of earthquakes, and identifies a to-do list under independent but interdependent sub-projects. For this, the government adopts a long-term perspective including all physical and spatial decisions," says Professor Ertaç Erguven, head of the Earthquake Engineering and Disaster Management Institute of Istanbul Technical University.
However, the plan has not satisfied all experts, including Professor Muzaffer Tuncag, former head of the Chamber of Civil Engineers.
Tuncag argues that the plan does not break new ground as it repeats what had been said before by scientific circles and associations. "The main objective should be to put into practice corrective actions," he points out.
Can Kosovo avoid the fallout of the eurozone crisis?
Experts say Kosovo's vulnerability is mixed, and largely depends on the health of the German economy.

Nearly a decade ago, in an attempt to gain financial security, Kosovo adopted the euro as its currency. By turning from the Deutsche Mark in 2002, the then-province hoped to avoid devaluation of its currency.
However, does Kosovo now face a possible crisis with the other 17 countries that use the euro?
Though the Kosovo Central Bank maintains that adopting the euro brought monetary stability, Pristina banking expert Liridona Hashani stresses that this stability and integration with Europe's financial sector involved significant trade-offs.
"The transformation from the Deutsche Mark to the euro was not easy.
There was an increase of prices, which still today has its own impact, but it helped Kosovo to be financially stable and to be part of a larger zone with the same currency," Hashani tells SETimes.
She believes the crisis in the eurozone will not impact Kosovo.
"Kosovo depends on the currency circulation of Germany, and so far these two countries have not experienced any challenge in their financial stability," Hashani says.
Rudina Heroi-Puka of GAP Institute for Advanced Studies agrees that events in Germany will be determining factors in Kosovo.
"We are more connected with the crisis of the euro in Germany, so the possibility of a crisis there will also reflect on us," Heroi-Puka tells SETimes.
Lumir Abdixhiku, executive director of RIINVEST Institute, says that Kosovo is more at risk as a result of the government's management of public finances.
"I rather see a domestic financial crisis caused by hyper-expenditure of government and potential debts that await the country than the effects of the European crisis.
Remember that our country has a worrisome imbalance of revenues with expenses, and the country's only hope remains the immediate revenue generated by the privatisation of PTK (Kosovo's Post-Telecom)," Abdixhiku tells SETimes.
He says these risks will increase since that privatisation is not expected this year.
"[This could] seriously jeopardise the financial stability in the country and relations with the IMF," Abdixhiku says.
Heroi-Puka warns that in developing countries like Kosovo, a financial crisis will have more dire effects.
"If such a crisis strikes, the country will have a more difficult economic situation compared with other, developed countries … price increases and a reduction in purchasing power will [be reflected by] an increase in unemployment and poverty."
Abdixhiku said that Kosovo lacks stable trade relations with the EU, thus avoiding a major impact from the eurozone crisis.
"Kosovo is not an exporting country; therefore any change in the value of the euro … enables the country to [easily trade] in markets that are not part of the eurozone," Abdixhiku said.
However, the impact may be felt in terms of donations by European countries that will be less able to offer aid due to their domestic financial situations.

Two companies submit bids to complete Bulgaria's Belene nuclear plant
Russia's Atomstroiexport and the Czech company Skoda Alliance have submitted their bids for the construction of Bulgaria's second nuclear power plant at Belene. The winning bidder for the 2 billion euro project is expected to be announced in about six months.
(Standart, Novinar, Trud, Dnevnik, The Moscow Times - 02/02/06; Sofia News Agency, Interactive Investor, Dnevnik, Mediapool, Sofia Echo - 01/02/06)
Regardless of which bid wins the tender for the completion of Bulgaria's nuclear power plant in Belene, it will be controlled by Russia's Gazprom. [AFP]
Two companies have submitted bids for the design and construction of Bulgaria's second nuclear power plant (NPP) at the town of Belene on the Danube River, about 250km northeast of Sofia.
The winning bidder for the project, estimated to cost about 2 billion euros, should be announced by 1 August.
The Czech company Skoda Alliance unloaded 29 metal containers with half a tonne of paperwork in Sofia on Wednesday (1 February), while Russia's Atomstroiexport brought in 177 boxes with three tonnes of documentation the previous afternoon.
Each of the companies has submitted different offers for three different project scenarios.
As the offers were officially opened Wednesday, Yulian Zhelyazkov of Bulgaria's National Electricity Company (NEK), who heads the Belene NPP tender commission, said the evaluation procedures would likely be completed in no less than six months' time.
After that the commission will present its assessment to NEK's board of directors, which will announce the winning bidder.
In the meantime, each of the companies will be allowed to change the parameters of their offers.
The tender commission will be assisted by consultants from Deloitte and Parsons.
According to local press reports, however, no matter which company is selected, it will be controlled to some extent by Russian giant Gazprom.
Its bank is said to have recently acquired Skoda JS, which is part of the Skoda Alliance consortium.
Gazprombank also owns 51 per cent of the shares of Atomstroiexport, which will use the French company Framatome as a subcontractor.
The conditions potential bidders had to meet included an annual turnover of at least $5 billion and previous experience in the construction and commissioning of pressurised water reactors.
The new NPP project envisions the construction of two Russian-designed VVER reactors of 1,000 megawatts each, the same as those of Units 5 and 6 at the Kozloduy NPP in Bulgaria and at the Czech Temelin NPP.
Canada's Atomic Energy Canada Ltd had proposed to supply two 700-megawatt CANDU heavy water reactors, but withdrew from the tender after Bulgaria decided against that technology.
Seeking to offset an expected drop in the country's electricity output following the planned shutdown of two 440-megawatt Soviet-era reactors at the Kozloduy NPP in December 2006, and to help sustain its leading position on the regional power market, Bulgaria gave the green light for the Belene plant last April.
Currently, Kozloduy accounts for about 40 per cent of Bulgaria's overall electricity output.
The Belene project was first launched in 1986, but was suspended in 1991, due to financial problems and pressure from environmental groups.
By that time, Bulgaria had already spent over 1 billion euros on construction and the purchase of a 1,000-megawatt Skoda reactor.
The first of the two reactors is expected to become operational by 2011 and the second by 2013.
The Sofia daily Trud quoted representatives of both companies as insisting Wednesday that, if they are selected, the price of electricity will be "sufficiently low"
Rohan: Kosovo's delegation determines when talks begin
Negotiations between Pristina and Belgrade can get under way as soon as the Kosovo side decides who will take part in its delegation, deputy UN special envoy Albert Rohan said Monday, one day before a Contact Group meeting that urged Kosovo's status be resolved by year's end.

The deputy UN special envoy for negotiations on the status of Kosovo, Albert Rohan, arrived in Pristina on Monday (30 January) to reschedule the date for the talks between Kosovo and Serbia.
"Talks between Kosovo and Serbia will start as soon as the Kosovo side decides who will take part in the delegation," he said.
"We are ready and the Serbians are ready, too.
So it depends really on Kosovo's leaders," Rohan said. A round had been scheduled for 25 January in Vienna, but had to be postponed because of Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova's death on 21 January.
Rohan met with UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen briefly Monday before he departed for London to take part in Tuesday's Contact Group meeting.
According to Rohan, the international community is ready to start negotiations tomorrow.
"We don't have a deadline.
It depends entirely on Kosovo leadership … It really depends on how quickly we can get a delegation from here to Vienna to start the talks," Rohan said, emphasising the need to proceed.
"The sooner the talks start, the better for everybody," he said.
His visit came a day before the Contact Group meeting in London, where diplomats from Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States called for an agreement on the province's status by the end of this year.
On Wednesday, US envoy to Kosovo Frank Wisner echoed that call.
Arriving in Pristina for consultations with the Kosovo negotiating team, he said he was bringing a message of "full support" from Washington for completing the process during 2006.
In other news, Radio B92 reported that Serbian President Boris Tadic and Democratic Party of Kosovo leader Hashim Thaci met briefly on the sidelines of the Socialist International forum in Athens.
The impromptu meeting Tuesday was arranged by Greek opposition leader George Papandreou and Greek President Karolos Papoulias.
Tadic extended his condolences on the death of Rugova, and both expressed their stances on Kosovo's status -- Tadic favouring the retention of Serbian sovereignty, and Thaci advocating full independence.
Development of air traffic under way in Albania
With the number of travelers to Albania on the rise, the government is working with a German consortium to transform Tirana's Mother Teresa International Airport into an important regional connection point.

Tirana Airport Partners (TAP), an international consortium formed by two German companies, has an exclusive contract with the Albanian government for the operation and management of Tirana's Mother Teresa International Airport, the only one in the country offering international flights.
The contract, signed in 2004, is a stepping-stone on the road to transforming Albania's international airport into an inportant connection point in Southeast Europe.
The consortium pays an annual concession fee and, in return, is entitled to the airport's income.
It has pledged to upgrade and modernise the facility.
The Albanian government plans to "increase the co-operation with TAP, profiting from the experience of this strategic partner.
We will guarantee our full support.
Their success would be considered a success for Albanian authorities too," says Transport and Telecommunications Minister Lulezim Basha.
Albania has been seeing a rise in the number of travelers, and TAP is negotiating to bring other airlines into the country, according to the consortium's executive director, Reinhard Kalenda.
In recent years, Albania has drawn the attention of a number of international carriers.
Austrian Airlines, Hungary's Malev, Greece's Olympic Airlines, Serbia-Montenegro's JAT, Italy's Alitalia, Slovenia's Adria Airways, Turkish Airlines and Bulgaria's Hemus Air all offer regular, scheduled flights to Tirana.
Several domestic companies, such as Albanian Airlines, Albatros Airways and Ada Air, also offer direct flights to and from European cities.
In 2005, UK flagship carrier British Airways (BA) announced it was launching regular direct flights between Gatwick Airport and Tirana.
The flights, scheduled for Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays, are expected to give a substantial boost to travel in and out of Albania.
BA projects that 25,000 travellers will use the new London-Tirana route in the first year, with the number rising incrementally afterwards.
Meanwhile, the government is also considering developing domestic air traffic in the southern cities of Saranda and Vlora, which are considered to be the top destinations for tourism in the country.
Kukesi Airport, in the northeastern part of the country is under construction.
According to the long term plans, all three airports will eventually become licensed for international flights.
In Wake of Election Defeats, Turkey's Main Opposition Party Eyes Transformation
A hotly contested race for the post of party leader is the latest sign of turmoil within Turkey's Republican People's Party.
A change in direction is expected, but some worry that the party is in danger of splitting.

Amid a heated race for the leadership of Turkey's Republican People's Party (CHP), incumbent party leader Deniz Baykal has called for an extraordinary congress, to be held on 29 January.
He did so after the CHP's disciplinary panel voted 8-7 not to expel his main rival for the post, Mustafa Sarigul, over corruption allegations.
The move is the latest sign of a growing rift among members of the CHP, Turkey's main opposition party, which has stumbled in recent elections.
Baykal has come under fire for the party's failure to catch up with the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), which enjoyed a decisive victory in the 28 March local elections.
The CHP garnered only 18 per cent of the vote.
According to many analysts, the current turmoil within the party is a sign that it in a process of transformation into a more solidly Social Democratic party.
However, some warn that the party could be in danger of breaking apart.
So far, several different factions have emerged, each supporting a different candidate.
In addition to Baykal and Sarigul, two other party members -- Hursit Gunes and Zulfu Livaneli -- are vying for the top post.
As the two main contenders try to rally support across the country, Baykal's opponents have been seeking ways to unite.
Internal divisions are not the only source of trouble for the CHP.
Two members of the party's Supreme Disciplinary Board, Cafer Dursun and Engin Baba, are currently facing disciplinary action themselves due to accusations of bribery.
These two will not vote during the party congress.
The general consensus among political observers is that some sort of shift is needed if CHP wants to regain its momentum.
Many say it has faltered because the public does not see it providing an answer to ongoing problems such as economic instability, political corruption, unemployment and unequal income distribution.
At the same time, analysts say, the CHP has suffered because of its emphasis on domestic rather than international issues.
The AKP's international stance, by contrast, has boosted its popularity at a time when EU membership and foreign relations in general are pressing items for Turkey.
Serbia-Montenegro Parliament Okays Role in International Peacekeeping
The Serbia-Montenegro Parliament recently adopted a law clearing the way for Serbia-Montenegro to join international peacekeeping missions.
The first such participation by could be in Haiti.

Participation in international peacekeeping missions would be subject to parliamentary approval, according to Serbia-Montenegro Defence Minister Prvoslav Davinic. [AFP]
A new law approved by the federal parliament last month clears the way for Serbia-Montenegro to participate in peacekeeping missions abroad.
The first such participation could be in Haiti, according to the head of the country's centre for peacekeeping operations, Colonel Petar Cornakov.
Authorities have already signed a decision to form a 400-soldier battalion for a possible role in the UN's Haiti peacekeeping operation, Cornakov said.
It would be the first unit from Serbia-Montenegro to join such a mission, though the country has previously sent teams of three to five army officers to participate in missions strictly in a monitoring capacity.
Under the law, missions are to be proposed by the federal Council of Ministers and then sent to lawmakers for consideration.
"Each mission must be approved by the Serbia-Montenegro Parliament", says Serbia-Montenegro Defence Minister Prvoslav Davinic.
Moreover, the law requires that both constituent republics give the go-ahead before Serbia-Montenegro can send peacekeepers abroad.
It also requires that peacekeepers be withdrawn in cases of "extreme danger", as established by the UN's danger degree system.
Serbia-Montenegro's Army consists mainly of recruits.
While the new law gives professional soldiers the opportunity to volunteer for international peacekeeping missions, it does not require soldiers who are completing mandatory military service to participate.
According to Cornakov, the proposed Haiti battalion will include an engineering and infantry band, with 150 officers and lieutenant officers each, along with a military police platoon and a medical team with 50 soldiers each.
After candidates are selected, they will begin training for the mission on 1 February.
The process will cost 30m euros, Cornakov said.
The UN pays each peacekeeping soldier 786 euros per month.
Rupel: Disputes Should Not Mar Good Slovenia-Croatia Relations
A statement by Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel on Wednesday suggests a joint Croat-Slovenian committee could be set up soon to review problems between the two countries.
A meeting of their prime ministers is also being planned.

Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel suggested Wednesday (19 January) that a joint Croat-Slovenian committee could be set up soon to discuss bilateral ties.
The ongoing disputes between Ljubljana and Zagreb should not cloud the relations between the two countries, nor Croatia's EU accession bid, the minister stressed.
Slovenia and Croatia have argued over a number of issues since declaring their independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991.
The dispute over Piran Bay, on the Istrian peninsula, has led to a number of border incidents and remains one of the most critical issues in bilateral relations.
A small stretch of land at Slovenia's southeastern border with Croatia is also the subject of disagreement.
The two countries signed an accord on access to international waters in 2001, but it has not been ratified by Croatia yet.
The Krsko nuclear power plant, located in Slovenia but built and owned jointly by the two countries, as well as the outstanding debts of the now defunct Ljubljanska Banka to Croatian depositors have also fuelled disputes. '
''There are a number of problems with Croatia that Slovenia can only solve in the framework of the EU,'' Rupel said at a news conference in Zagreb on Wednesday. ''Therefore I wish that Croatia would get closer to the EU as soon as possible,'' he added.
Slovenia joined the EU on 1 May 2004, along with nine other Central and East European countries, becoming the first former Yugoslav republic to be admitted into the bloc.
Croatia is due to start its EU accession talks in March and is expected to gain full-fledged membership in 2009.
The latest incident, in which Croatian border police detained a Slovenian politician in September last year, prompted a threat from Ljubljana that it would block Zagreb's EU bid.
The threat was withdrawn soon afterwards.
Urging both countries to seek a solution through dialogue, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana noted that the door to EU membership remains open for all Balkan states.
"On that way, they have to learn to solve conflicts through dialogue and collaboration," Solana said.
Rupel said Zagreb had agreed to his proposal that a joint expert committee be established to discuss bilateral relations.
According to him, an informal meeting between the Slovenian and Croatian prime ministers, Janez Jansa and Ivo Sanader, was also being planned.
But he offered no details as to the timing or location.
Zagreb has indicated that it would seek international arbitration on the border issue in the event a solution is not reached through bilateral dialogue.
BiH disabled needs lack initiative
High unemployment rate among the disabled in Bosnia and Herzegovina is largely due to lack of legal framework.
By Anes Alic for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo -- 28/01/12
Poor access to facilities is one of the problems disabled persons face in Bosnia and Herzegovina. [Reuters]
The disabled in the Federation Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) face many challenges -- from the slow implementation of laws ensuring their right to employment to poor recognition of their accessibility needs.
Authorities organised a workshop on unemployment for the disabled last month, proposing several strategies and projects.
But even that event was held in a venue that was not accessible to people in wheelchairs.
"[These] situations are typical of the politicians' general attitude toward the disabled," Elvira Beslija, secretary-general of the FBiH Association of Paraplegics, told SETimes.
According to unofficial data -- since there are no formal numbers on the disabled -- there are 350,000 disabled persons in the country -- 100,000 in Republika Srpska (RS) and 250,000 in FBiH.
The disabled unemployment rate is around 85%.
It took five years for the FBiH parliament to pass the Law on Professional Rehabilitation, Training and Employment of Persons with Disabilities, and another year to implement it.
The law was adopted in early 2010 and parliament pledged to form a special fund for its maintenance, which came through in April 2011.
Both the law and the corresponding fund were implemented in RS in 2005.
Since then, 1,000 disabled persons have found jobs.
But on the state level, no such law or fund exists.
The law was in part due to BiH's obligation as a signatory to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
The law obligates all public companies and institutions to employ at least one person with disabilities for every 39 workers until 2013, after which the ratio will be one to 16.
Companies and institutions that fail to implement this provision are fined 25% of the average FBiH monthly salary, which was 423 euros in 2011, for not filling positions reserved for the disabled.
BiH's two entities allocate 532,000 euros annually to support the employment of the disabled, and the entity governments have offered year-long subsidies to employers who hire the handicapped.
According to Beslija, however, these actions have not garnered results.
"We need to create a long-term positive atmosphere for the employment of persons with disabilities," she said.
Several organizations representing the disabled decided to take measures into their own hands, founding companies and employing only their members.
Librag company, formed in 1996 by the Sarajevo Association of Deaf and Hearing Impaired Persons, specialises in metal works.
It employs only the disabled, its own members.
"We almost went bankrupt a few times, but somehow made it through, mostly due to the help from foreign organisations and embassies," Librag Director Jasminka Karahasanovic told SETimes.
If the FBiH government "had passed the law [on the disabled] when it should have, six years ago, we would be strong and self-sustainable, with a chance to employ more people.
But until the law was passed, we depended solely on the good will of the authorities and foreign donations," she added.
Mirza Jasarevic, from NGO Centre for Development and Support, says that the funds FBiH spent on social welfare since the end of the armed conflict could have employed half the entity's disabled.
"[The disabled] comprise the largest welfare category and a large part of the electorate," Jasarevic told SETimes.
Serbia-Montenegro Mulls Dropping NATO Lawsuit
Serbia-Montenegrin Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic has suggested dropping the country's lawsuit against NATO at the International Court of Justice as a sign the country genuinely wants to join Euro-Atlantic structures.
By Dusan Kosanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 02/08/04

Two key issues are hampering Serbia-Montenegro's Euro-Atlantic integration.
One is lack of full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal and the fact that indictees -- particularly Bosnian Serb wartime leader Ratko Mladic -- remain at large.
The second is the country's lawsuit against ten NATO countries for the 1999 campaign.
The suit was brought before the International Court of Justice at The Hague by the regime of Slobodan Milosevic.
Serbia-Montenegrin Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic has said he will propose to the Council of Ministers that the charges be dropped.
The European Commission's Ambassador to Serbia-Montenegro, Geoffrey Barrett, said that dropping the charges would help the country's EU accession chances.
"It is necessary to face the past courageously on the road to European integration," Barrett said.
In proposing the suit be dropped, Belgrade is taking up a suggestion made by NATO Secretary Jaap de Hoop Scheffer during his 19 July visit to Serbia-Montenegro.
Officials in Brussels are welcoming the move.
At home, the proposal has received support from the Democratic Party (DS), led by Serbian President Boris Tadic.
The DS advocates doing everything possible to facilitate membership in the EU and NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme as soon as possible.
"If that means that certain charges should be dropped, then we have to take that step, as our country cannot dictate conditions to the international community," the DS said in a statement.
However, the most influential party in the Serbian government -- the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), led by Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica -- is arguing that charges filed by Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia against Serbia-Montenegro should also be dropped.
"We think that all lawsuits should be looked upon as a whole, because they are all parts of the same problem," a DSS official said.
As expected, the Serbian Radical Party and Milosevic's Socialists have fiercely criticised Draskovic's initiative.
Political analysts caution that dropping the charges is not the most significant issue affecting Serbia-Montenegro's hopes for joining the PfP programme.
The international community's main request, they note, is the arrest of Mladic and co-operation with the UN tribunal.
Withdrawing the lawsuit would mostly be a sign of goodwill, a signal to NATO that Serbia-Montenegro genuinely wants to join the Alliance.
Since it is illogical to sue a system while seeking to be part of it, the charges will have to be dropped sooner or later, Serbian media commentators say.
Political dialogue resumes in Macedonia
Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski and Democratic Union for Integration leader Ali Ahmeti, whose party left parliament two months ago, met last week to discuss the country's political situation.

In what is being hailed as a breakthrough move, Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski met with opposition leader Ali Ahmeti last week, following an almost two-month political crisis.
The Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) left Parliament in January because of the assembly's non-compliance with the Badinter principle in decision-making.
Under the principle, at least two-thirds of the members of Macedonian minorities in parliament should vote in decisions affecting minorities.
The absence of the DUI, and the lack of political dialogue, created a climate of exclusivity and affected the ability to adopt laws necessary for reforms required for EU and NATO membership.
Prior to the meeting, the United States, NATO and the EU encouraged the opposition and ruling parties to sit down and discuss the problems.
After a long exchange of letters, the dialogue was resumed.
Gruevski, Ahmeti and their respective teams discussed political issues for more than six hours.
Ahmeti set a list of conditions, including a constitutional amendment under which the government would be elected under the Badinter principle, and the adoption of laws to solve the status and social problems of former National Liberation Army members.
Gruevski, however, rejected the two proposals.
He said that would mean a change in the state arrangement of Macedonia.
"There is no example in the world of such a way of government formation," the prime minister said.
He encouraged the DUI to return to politics and asked for support for government projects on compulsory secondary education, laws on the public prosecutor and information society, the parliamentary rulebook and constitutional amendments.
The meeting did result in an agreement on drafting a list of laws that would be adopted under the Badinter principle.
A task group, consisting of representatives of the two parties, will be formed to submit a proposed list, which will become a component of the parliamentary rulebook.
A member of the DUI team, Agron Buxhaku, said exclusivity is no model for dialogue.
He said the task groups should discuss all the issues, because without compromise, there cannot be further dialogue.
Foreign embassies' representatives attended the meeting, a precondition set by the DUI, despite initial opposition from Gruevski.
Following the meeting, the US embassy and the EU, NATO and OSCE missions issued a joint press release, saying it was an exceptionally important step towards confidence building among parties.
"We encourage all the parties to continue … in these efforts and work in the spirit of reaching a consensus.
It is essential for continuation of the reform process in both the parliament and state institutions," the statement said.
However, DUI said it would wait to see "concrete results" before returning to Parliament.
2008 Eurovision: an economic win for Serbia
As host of the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest, Serbia outdid its predecessors by hosting two semifinal contests and numerous rehearsals along with the final.

Belgrade successfully hosted the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest last month, benefiting commercially and economically and attracting tourism to Serbia.
Organising the contest cost Serbia 21m euros.
National radio and television (RTS) spent 8.5m euros, while the state gave RTS more than 10m euros to purchase high-definition equipment.
The city of Belgrade alone invested 2m euros.
During the event, between 11,000 and 15,000 tourists visited Belgrade and brought about 10m euros in direct income. Tourist visits brought an estimated 15m euros overall to Serbia, said 2008 Eurovision Serbian media executive producer Sandra Susa.
"We were careful with every single euro ...
RTS spent 8.5m euros, but Serbia profited with more than 1 billion euros. ...
During their ten-day stay in Belgrade, [journalists] enjoyed our city and perceived the Serbs as a friendly and open people who know how to live," said RTS head Aleksandar Tijanic after the event.
The final financial report for the event, however, will be released the next month.
Media experts agreed that the advertising for Belgrade outweighed any revenues from the event.
"It is great to have that kind of advertisement when millions are watching you and when you have organised the event so well. Finally, we have done something on a grand scale," one editor for a Belgrade paper told Southeast European Times.
Worldwide media reports praised Belgrade's efforts.
"The 2008 Eurovision song contest in Belgrade will be remembered as a magnificent show," wrote ITAR-TASS.
"Serbs used their chance to change their image in the world, from the one they had under Milosevic, to present Serbia as a normal country," said CNN.
"Serbia and Belgrade proved that they are a part of Europe," reported BBC.
Most of the 3,500 journalists covering the song contest agreed that the organisation was excellent.
Many expressed fascination with Belgrade Arena, where the contest occurred and where the stage symbolises the confluence of Belgrade's two rivers, the Sava and the Danube.

Germany will play a leading role in mapping out a way forward for Greece, US President Barack Obama said on Tuesday (June 7th), while pledging his country's support for efforts to prevent the Balkan nation's debt crisis from triggering the first default in the eurozone.
"Germany is going to be a key leader in that process. And the politics of it are tough," Obama said in a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Washington.
While voicing confidence that Berlin and other key EU players will be able to help Greece return to the path of economic growth and gain better control over its mounting debt, the US president cautioned that this would require both time and patience.
The United States has assured Germany and the other countries involved of its backing for actions towards that end, as it is also in its own interest to be "supportive", because "America's economic growth depends on a sensible resolution" to the current crisis.
"It would be disastrous for us to see an uncontrolled spiral and default in Europe, because that could trigger a whole range of other events," Obama warned.
Europeans would be the ones to ultimately decide what measures need to be taken to prop up Greece, but they would have to involve private investment, he added.
What Athens should do is implement structural reforms to improve its competitiveness, as well as ensure that its economic system becomes more transparent, he noted.
Merkel, who began her official visit to the United States on Tuesday morning, said Europe is "very well aware" of its responsibility as a key player in the global economy, so -- just as the United States is -- it is taking steps to generate growth and boost employment.
"Through the global financial and economic crisis, we've seen how interdependent we are," the German chancellor said. "The stability of the eurozone is therefore an important factor of stability for the whole of the global economy.
So we do see clearly our European responsibility and we're shouldering that responsibility together with the IMF."
The events in recent months have shown how problems in one of the 17 countries in the eurozone can affect the stability of their shared currency, the euro.
The purpose of the assistance within the bloc is to deal with such negative influences, Merkel noted.
"There's actually a ban on bailouts in the treaties underpinning the (EU) stability and growth pact.
But if a country is in danger and thereby endangers the euro as a whole, it is in each and every country's vested interest to see to it that this common currency area is not endangered," she said. "And we will act in such a way, however, that sustainability is guaranteed."
During their talks, the two leaders covered a range of other pressing global issues, including NATO's operations in Libya and Afghanistan, Iran's nuclear programme and the historical changes in the Middle East and North Africa.
Obama said he and Merkel agreed that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi must "step down for the sake of his own people".
The chancellor, who refused to contribute German troops to NATO's military campaign in Libya, said Germany "will be showing that it is responsible and committed to the Libyan cause" in the post-conflict period, when there will be many problems to address.
"Germany supports the NATO operation simply by being present in the stance there, and also by stepping up our commitment in Afghanistan," Merkel noted. "It is our joint will that this NATO mission is successful."
Echoing her words concerning Germany's future role in Libya, Obama said his expectation would be "that there will be full and robust German support" for all the work that will be required after Gaddafi is gone.
Ankara seeks moderator role in Syria
Is Turkey doing enough to back reform?
By Alakbar Raufoglu for Southeast European Times -- 08/06/11

Exiled Syrian opposition activists delivered a strong message at a conference in Antalya last week.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, they said, must step down and hand power to his vice-president until a council is formed to transition the government to democracy.
Analysts say Turkey demonstrated support for reform by allowing the event -- dubbed "Conference for Change in Syria" -- to be held on its territory.
Nevertheless, Ankara's position remains nuanced.
Metin Yilmaz, an AKP deputy and spokesman for parliament's Foreign Affairs Commission, says the ruling party will "not be silent" as the bloody crackdown against demonstrators next door continues.
"We want Syria to be a country with a good future, democratic values and respect for human rights," Yilmaz told SETimes.
Turkish politicians, he added, are busy with the June 12th elections, but after them, Ankara "will be more firm on its Syrian policy".
Ali Ozturkmen, a representative of the Syrian opposition Turkmen Movement and conference participant, told SETimes they rely on Turkey.
"We want Turkey to help us make our country become not a terrorism hub, but a united and friendly neighbour," he said.
Participants in the Syrian protests are awaiting Turkey's help and even raise its flag during the demonstrations, he added.
Veysel Ayhan, a Syria analyst at the Ankara-based Center for Middle Eastern Strategic Studies, was at the conference.
He says that by hosting the anti-Assad regime conference on its territory, Ankara is sending a message of support to the opposition, even on a diplomatic level.
"This is the second stage of Turkey's policy on Syria," Ayhan told SETimes.
The first step, he said, was when Turkey called on the Assad regime to initiate reforms -- a demand which went unheeded.
As a further step, he suggested, Turkey might support international sanctions against Syria, if the oppression continues.
"This would be a big blow to the regime."
Speaking about the Antalya conference, Ayhan said the participants agreed everything must be done to change Syria from a totalitarian country to a secular democracy.
Mehmet Sandir, chairman of the Turkey-Syria Friendship Group in parliament, takes a contrasting perspective.
He worries the anti-regime conference in Turkey might spoil the country's relationship with Assad.
"I hope this conference took place with the Syrian administration's knowledge, otherwise it wouldn't be right," he commented, arguing Turkey should not contribute to the destabilisation of Syria.
"What I've been explaining to the Ankara administration for months now is that, as an ally of the West, we should explain to them [the West] the Syrian realities," said Sandir, a representative of the Nationalist Action Party (MHP).
"The instability of Syria will embroil the Middle East; it will be a worse situation than Afghanistan," Sandir warns.
Muharrem Hilmi Ozev, Syria analyst at the Ankara-based Center for Turkey-Asia Strategic Research, believes that even though Turkey sympathises with the Syrian opposition, it didn't exclude the Assad regime's point of view.
"But the fact is that after the Antalya conference the opposition has entered Syrian politics," he said, arguing Turkey is trying to play a moderator role between the two.
Meanwhile, Ankara cannot go further than supporting the opposition, Ozev says, as "the country will lose its moderator role."

School violence in Kosovo turns deadly
Experts claim violence in Kosovo's school system is reaching worrisome levels.

The murder of 19-year-old Muhamet Cakaj at Pristina's Sami Frasheri High School by fellow students is only the latest of several high-profile incidents highlighting a growing problem of public violence in Kosovo's schools.
The issue has galvanized public opinion.
"This case and others are evidence of the lack of security for students in the schools and facilities around them.
Above all, it is an indication of the failure of educational and security institutions to address this serious problem that is beginning to reach worrisome proportions," commented Avni Bytyci of the NGO INPO, one of the few organisations that has addressed the problem.
The numbers support INPO's concerns: In the first semester of 2011, more than 210 incidents involving students, many resulting in severe injuries, have been reported.
The situation is worse than in 2010 when, according to police, there were 37 incidents involving serious bodily injury, 36 cases of property damage, 15 robberies and an undetermined number of minor injuries.
Experts struggle to explain the rise in violence, but Aferdita Spahiu of the Kosovo UNICEF office says, "Studies conducted in Kosovo show that violence manifests [itself] because of poverty or other factors, posing a high risk to child development."
In addition to student-on-student violence, youngsters also report teacher-initiated violence against students.
Shpend, 18, a student from Pristina, says that teachers take their frustration out on students for no reason at all, and often physically attack them.
"Last month, one teacher said he did not like a girl's shirt and told her if she wore it next time, she could forget about passing the subject.
Also, a pupil was watching something on his mobile phone, and the teacher came and slapped him," Shpend said.
Retired teacher Rexhep Gashi from Pristina acknowledges that teachers at times overstep boundaries to assert power over the pupils.
"Many teachers before 1999 used [their position] as a means of showing their power to beat the children, expel them from class or used grading, which is not correct and should have been avoided," Gashi said.
But Gashi also said that pupils can be hard to work with, as many still face war trauma and poverty -- and neither parents nor the government address either issue.
"They read news that even with a good education it is difficult to find a job, which confuses them and brings them up in a wrong way," Gashi said.
Pristina teacher Agron Ismajli agrees it is hard to teach today because pupils are continually disruptive and very rude, but beatings have subsided in recent years.
"I remember those years, when beating a child because he did something was a school practice, but today it is 90% different.
And it is not at all beating; those who practice it mostly spank them on the bottom or pull their ear," Ismajli said.
In an attempt to address the issue, Kosovo's Education Ministry said it is working with schools and the community to formulate an awareness policy about the dangers and consequences of physical abuse.
But the contribution of family, schools and society are irreplaceable, it said.
"I appeal primarily to parents and other responsible institutions of the country, but also the whole society, to exert their influence on their children every day in order to prevent violence at school and around it," Minister of Education Rame Buja told SETimes.
Destination Albania: government hoping holiday travellers return in droves
The tourism industry is banking on a repeat of last year's crowds.
By Linda Karadaku for Southeast European Times in Tirana – 08/06/11

It was a banner year for tourism: Albania had about 3.5 million tourists last year, a whopping 32% increase over previous years.
Authorities are anticipating more of the same this year.
"Our expectations are based on the improvements in infrastructure we've done and the tourism environment in general," Endri Jorgoni, chief of cabinet in the ministry of culture and tourism said.
"However," he acknowledges, "the political situation might have a negative impact on that."
For eight years now, Dritan Xhengo, 35, has been operating a tourism agency in Tirana that offers everything from tickets and packages to travel insurance.
Xhengo, who studied in the UK and Slovenia, agrees that the political situation might impact the number of tourists visiting Albania, however, he notes, "so far, so good".
He says European tourists come to Albania, either as a couple, groups or individually, and there is an "extraordinarily positive change" compared to a few years ago.
Most of the Western tourists prefer study tours, cultural tourism, and archaeology.
Many come from Britain, Italy, Finland and Denmark.
"Albania is cheap for them," Xhengo says.
He notes, however, that Albania still "exports" more tourists than it "imports".
He says this is due to the comparatively low level of services in Albania and an eagerness to see other cultures in Europe.
"Comparing money you spend with the quality you get, it's cheaper abroad than at home," Xhengo says.
Albanians had preferred going to countries where no visas were needed, like Turkey, but in the wake of visa liberalisation, this preference is shifting towards Croatia, Spain and Greece.
Jorgoni says he is unaware of a discrepancy between "export" and "import" of tourism, but admits that the main problems encountered within Albania are a persistent lack of infrastructure, including roads leading to the most popular attractions.
"It has been spontaneous tourism until now," Jorgoni says, adding that the government is working now to institutionalise it.
One focus is boosting investments in tourism.
A new draft law "favours investments in tourism and transforms the ministry of Tourism and Culture into a one stop shop and a manager of tourism", Jorgoni says.
The draft legislation notes that the tourism sector "has great potential in contributing to the social and economic development of the country, bringing more revenue, strengthening the currency and opening jobs".
Tirana resident Enkelejda Beqo says she has chosen to spend vacations in different countries because she likes meeting new people, seeing different cultures and visiting places rich in history.
"It is also about spending vacations in places where you know nobody … and where service is in line with quality and cost," Beqo said.
New Albanian president sworn in
A political impasse that threatened to push Albania into early elections has ended, and the country has a new head of state.

Bamir Topi was sworn in as president of Albania on Tuesday (July 24th).
He pledged to work for the country's Euro-Atlantic integration.
Along with Croatia and Macedonia, Albania is hoping to be invited to join NATO in 2008.
It signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU last year, thus completing a major first step on its path towards eventual membership in the 27-nation bloc.
"Nowadays, everything needs to change as we are coping with new historic challenges wanted by the Albanian people," Topi said as he took the oath at a ceremony Tuesday evening.
The event began with a special plenary session of the country's 140-seat parliament and continued at Tirana's Palace of Brigades.
A 50-year-old biologist and researcher who once served as agriculture minister, Topi is deputy leader of Albania's ruling Democratic Party. He has been elected a member of parliament three times since the end of communism in 1991, and is considered a moderate.
Recent polls suggest he is the most popular figure in politics, according to the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network.
Topi replaces Alfred Moisiu, whose five-year term expired on Tuesday.
Topi was elected on Friday with the support of 85 of the 91 lawmakers attending the voting session.
Three previous ballots failed to produce a winner, as none of the presidential candidates managed to receive the constitutionally required minimum of 84 votes. In the third round of voting on July 15th, Topi won 50 votes, while his leftist opponent Neritan Ceka gained 32.
On Friday, seven opposition MPs ignored a boycott called by the Socialist Party, thus helping to end a political impasse that was pushing the country towards early elections.
Reiterating their support for Albania's EU bid, the Union's foreign ministers welcomed on Monday the successful conclusion of the elections process and urged "all political forces to work together in moving forward with the reforms needed".
Topi, whose post vests him with power over the judiciary and the armed forces, has promised to restore the political balance and to promote institutional reform.
"I pledge to bring balance to the Albanian political climate and modernise our institutions to make sure we live up to the challenge of joining the EU and NATO," Reuters quoted him as telling lawmakers Friday.
As he took office Tuesday, Topi called for unity, vowing also to stay above the political parties and interests.
He also said he would back measures that would ultimately boost the credibility of politicians.
Freedom House report concludes democracy deteriorating in Montenegro
Confidence in the judicial system is low, and Montenegro's leaders have not shown a strong commitment to fighting corruption, says an international NGO.
By Nedjeljko Rudovic for Southeast European Times in Podgorica –25/07/07
According to the Freedom House report, the public lacks confidence in Montenegro's judiciary. [FH]
Montenegro did not strengthen civil liberties during 2006, and democracy in the country deteriorated slightly, according to the latest report by Freedom House.
In particular, the NGO cited a sluggish fight against corruption, excessive government influence on state television, and public mistrust of the judicial system.
Montenegrin authorities have demonstrated little political will to combat corruption, and parliament has failed to strengthen conflict of interest laws, Freedom House said.
Lengthy court processes, as well as excess leniency in corruption and organised crime cases, are eroding confidence in the judiciary, it said.
According to Freedom House, Montenegrin state TV is supposed to serve as an unbiased source of information for the public, but instead continues to reflect a pro-government stance.
The report also assessed laws on NGOs, which it found to be among the most liberal in the region.
However, it said, the laws are frequently abused.
"There are more than 3,600 NGOs. Most of them do not function or they are used as a folding screen for small businesses like cafes, taxi services, or foreign language schools," Freedom House said. "Only around 200 NGOs can be considered representatives of civil society.
They still do not deserve the respect of the public or government."
Despite the lack of progress this year, however, the report expressed confidence that the pace of reform is likely to pick up.
The public is demanding it, Freedom House said, and the EU accession process requires it.
"Citizens are ready for progress and they have high expectations of the political leadership," it said. "The inactivity during 2006 probably won't continue because Montenegrins seek change to improve their living conditions."
Montenegro's dedication to fighting corruption will be tested as the country moves ahead in its bid to join the EU, Freedom House suggested.
"For real progress in this field they need concerted efforts by the government, judiciary, police, prosecutors, parliament and public," the NGO said.
Montenegro split from its former state union with Serbia in May 2006.
Since then, it has been busy establishing an independent state structure and organising elections.
Opposition parties in Macedonia join forces
United opposition parties -- calling themselves "The Front" -- want significant changes in Macedonia, beginning with a a new government.
By Zoran Nikolovski for Southeast European Times in Skopje -- 08/02/10

Twelve political parties in Macedonia signed a co-operation agreement last week with the common aim of toppling Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski and the coalition making up his ruling VMRO-DPMNE government.
"Our utmost objective is to defeat the VMRO-DPMNE-led coalition," said coalition leader Branko Crvenkovski as the new bloc was announced in Skopje on February 1st.
Crvenkovski, a former Macedonian president, said the wide range of parties have put their differences aside for the good of the nation at a critical time.
Symbolically called The Front, the multiparty union is led by Crvenkovski's Social Democratic Union for Macedonia (SDSM).
The coalition is comprised of a wide range of current allies and former rivals -- from the left, the ultra-left and communists, to the dominant centre.
Their single aim is to topple the ruling centre-right coalition, which has been in power since the parliamentary elections of July 2006.
Observers are generally sceptical that The Front will accomplish its goal anytime soon, pointing to polls that suggest the Gruevski government remains very popular with the public.
The Liberal Democrats -- vehemently criticising Gruevski while continuing their challenges to Crvenkovski -- did not join The Front.
Also declining was the Democratic Party of Albanians, led by Menduh Thaci.
Ljube Boskovski, 49, is a former interior minister in Gruevski's ruling government. Acquitted of war crimes in connection with the 2001 torture and murder of ethnic Albanians in the village of Ljuboten, Boskovski is now a fierce critic of Gruevski.
New Alternative leader Gjorgi Orovcanec spoke to the crowd at the signing of the multiparty agreement, saying that the Gruevski government had not delivered on any of its promises.
"We do not have any investments, we do not have any money, we do not have any production, we do not have any friends."
Gruevski would not comment on the challenge now rallied against him, saying only that he has no fear of losing power.
Analysts have pointed out that only a small number of voters lean towards most of the parties who have signed on to The Front.
Professor Jove Kekenovski says the united opposition's impact is mostly psychological, while political expert Albert Musliu applauds a consolidated opposition as a corrective to the current government.
Did Albania breach NATO security?
The majority coalition in Albania's parliament is upset at the opposition for going public with information suggesting Albania sold secret NATO information.

Recent claims by Albania's opposition that the government sold classified NATO information to Russia and Serbia have put authorities in Tirana in an unenviable position.
"The Albanian secret service (SHISH) head Bahri Shaqiri reportedly told a closed-door parliament meeting that NATO is alarmed".
While SHISH didn't publicly deny that characterisation, the parliamentary majority coalition began blaming the opposition for making the issue of Shaqiri's testimony public.
NATO's office in Tirana did not issue a comment, but former US Ambassador to Albania John Withers described situation as "complex".
Albania has been a member of NATO since April 2008, and the institution responsible for maintaining the security of Alliance information is the Department of Security of Classified Information (DSIK).
SETimes sought an explanation from DSIK's Director for Vetting and Central Registration Mark Ndreca.
SETimes: How is NATO classified information received, administrated and distributed?
How do you ensure information is not leaked?
Mark Ndreca: The mutual exchange of information between Albania and NATO has been an ongoing process.
It is based on specific and well-defined legal standards.
Of course, in order to ensure the security of this information, it has been necessary to have in place a legal framework on classified information.
All our legislation is based on the standards of the document of NATO security policy.
SETimes: Who has a right to access NATO classified information, and what procedures govern the process?
Ndreca: A person needs to fulfill certain criteria, and one of these is being equipped with adequate security certificates.
Everyone who needs to know classified secret information needs to receive a security certificate.
Naturally, the certification of the public administration is a dynamic process, conditioned by the need of the institutions to have access to information at a certain point of time.
There are a number of people who have already had access to NATO classified information due to the nature of their work.
Our department gives out the certificates.
SETimes: Following vetting procedures, how many people have access to such information and who is disqualified?
Ndredca: The process of vetting is done in close co-operation with the national as well as partner intelligence units.
At the same time, this process is done in co-operation with respective DSIK units in NATO member countries.
Normally, when according to procedures someone is refused the right to access information, one should not continue to hold a work position that requires one to have access to classified information.
SETimes: Is your department aware of the parliamentary debate over whether the government has given out NATO information to non-members?
Ndreca: DSIK is the national authority responsible for the security of classified NATO information.
Its duty is to supervise the activity of the institutions that are in possession of the classified information.
We have not received any information from the intelligence services which confirm officials that have received the security certificate have spread classified information of NATO while unauthorised to do so.
Plenty of shoes to choose in Montenegro
Paris has a tower and China a wall.
Observers note that what Montenegro seems to have a surplus of is shoe stores and that could be good for business.
By Brian Salmi for Southeast European Times in Podgorica -- 08/02/10
Shoes abound in Podgorica. [File]
Shoe stores, shoe stores and more shoe stores.
Everywhere you look in the Montenegrin capital, you see shoe stores.
So many, in fact, that Montenegrin tourism officials looking for ways to promote the city may want to consider pitching Podgorica to the world as Shoehalla, a mecca for footwear.
Though locals can be oblivious to their omnipresence, visitors are often baffled by the abundance of retail outlets selling footwear in Podgorica.
Why are there so many shoe stores in Podgorica?
Southeast European Times was determined to find out.
A quick fact-finding mission through streets close to a Bata outlet confirmed the suspicion that Podgorica is awash in shoe stores.
Within ten minutes walking distance from the town square there are three dozen stores selling shoes alone.
There are another 51 shops offering footwear along with clothes and athletic goods.
Certainly Podgorica must be one of the most shoe-happy cities in the world.
Beyond the city core, the puzzling density of footwear boutiques persists.
Though dozens of shoe shoppers and shoe store workers were asked, no one was able to account for the confounding number of shoe stores.
Perhaps playing coy, Bata Manager Dragan Pajkovic said with a straight face: "I don't think there are so many shoes stores in Podgorica."
Really?
In the face of such evidence?
A visit to Astra Shoes -- owned for the past decade by Dusan Soc, 50 -- brought some clarity.
Soc said that when he bought the store, "Shoes were one of the few commodities that shop owners could get in abundance on credit."
International trade sanctions leveled against Serbia in 1992 meant there was no export market available for footwear manufacturers.
In that atmosphere, shoe stores began to spring up all over Podgorica to move product.
Soc gets most of his shoes from Novi Pazar in southwest Serbia, a city which he said is home to "more than 350 shoe manufacturers".
He believes that most of his competitors also get their stock from Novi Pazar but says few will admit it, preferring to pass off their wares as the handicraft of Italian designers.
Though the tsunami of cheap Chinese shoes washed across the West, it has yet to break on Montenegrin shores, according to Soc.
"We can get better shoes from Serbia at the same or better prices," he said.
If the global recession does not end soon, said Soc, it could wipe out many of his competitors.
But he is confident of enduring, sure that he will retire and pass on his 25sq m shop to his children.
"My customers have been shopping here for 40 years and they will do so for another 40 years."
Kosovo, Serbia agreements draw ire
Albanian bloggers blame the Kosovo government -- and the EU -- for reaching the agreements that they view as Serbia's big political win at Pristina's expense.
By Linda Karadaku for Southeast European Times in Pristina -- 24/03/12

The two recent agreements reached by Belgrade and Pristina in their negotiation process -- on Kosovo's participation in international forums and on technical border issues -- were heralded by country officials and the international community.
But many bloggers view them as deleterious to Kosovo's interests.
The agreement on representation stipulates Kosovo will participate in international forums but without the word "Republic" next to "Kosovo" as well as with a footnote referring to the UN Security Council Resolution 1244 and the ICJ ruling on Kosovo's declaration of independence.
Meanwhile, dissatisfaction grew after initial difficulties in implementing the agreements.
The Serbian and Kosovo delegations have walked out of regional conferences over the way Kosovo was represented.
Kosovo bloggers are upset and blame Prime Minister Hashim Thaci for handing Serbia a victory at the expense of Kosovo and also blame the EU for siding with Belgrade.
"The EU has caused confusion with the latest dialogue and neutral stand toward Kosovo's independence by taking into consideration the opinions of the five countries and ignoring the opinions of 22 countries [EU members who recognize Kosovo]," University of Pristina Professor Belul Beqaj told SETimes.
The EU was quick to respond that the agreement on representation was made public and is very clear.
"In terms of its use in meetings, it is for the organizers to decide where to put the footnote," EU spokesperson Maja Kocijancic told SETimes.
"I do not know why some accuse the EU instead of asking: are our representatives the ones who, in fact, helped Serbia obtain candidate status?" Fisi said, backing the Union.
But others disagree.
Serbia's candidate status makes all the difference, according to Dielli, because the agreements allow one party to progress on the EU accession path.
"In five years, Serbia will be in the EU. After 50 years, let us wait and see about Kosovo."
Inga places the blame squarely on the prime minister.
"Hashim Thaci has made Kosovo his own house, he does whatever he wants with it, sells and buys it, changes its constitutional name," she said.
"EU stayed in Kosovo after the war and saw how ready we are to have a state.
There is no ministry in Kosovo which is not investigated for corruption, most mayors are suspected of corruption and blackmail, and some have even been sentenced. ...
Europe has seen how much we weigh," Arsim said.
"By accepting the footnote, Kosovo has offended the 87 states that have recognised it as a state," added Shala.
Ballisti agreed, saying the government made a mistake to negotiate without the people's explicit approval.
"The footnote is nothing else but another nail in the series of many that Serbia has put anytime you talk to them and when you enter talks without an agreement with your own people," he said.
Some bloggers, like Lifipi, defended the government, saying the agreements are the best it could have done under the circumstances.
"Which one of you would have gotten a better solution for an agreement or has had a better plan for the agreement?" Lifipi said.
Like people like government.
See you in the EU in 50 years," Cuki concluded.
RS passes controversial referendum law
Republika Srpska's parliament passes a law that allows the BiH entity to hold referendums on national issues.
There are concerns -- denied by RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik -- that the measure may pave the way for a referendum on independence.

Shunning warnings from the international community, the parliament of Republika Srpska (RS) adopted a law Wednesday (February 10th) that could pave the way for a future referendum on the entity's independence, further destabilising Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
Amendments to the law on plebiscites -- tabled by RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik's ruling Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) -- were approved after two days of heated debate in the 83-seat assembly.
The new legislation was passed 46 to 16, with six abstentions.
Bosniak members of the RS parliament boycotted the vote, insisting the bill violates both the Dayton Peace Accords and the BiH Constitution.
The law allows citizens of the Serb-run entity to hold referenda on national issues while only covering a few technical aspects, such as voting procedure and the manner in which a plebiscite can be called.
It does not specify when a referendum can be organised or which questions will be asked.
Dodik has repeatedly threatened to call a referendum on RS's independence if the entity's autonomy was at risk.
While he has not made direct secessionist threats in recent months, he raised the plebiscite issue in December when the RS parliament rejected High Representative Valentin Inzko's decision to extend the mandates of foreign judges and prosecutors working in Bosnian courts.
Dodik denied on Tuesday that the new Law on Referendum and Civic Initiative was aimed at facilitating the entity's secession from BiH or violating the Dayton Accords.
"We want to pass a law and then call a referendum about support of the Dayton Peace Agreement and decisions disparaging it," he said.
Dodik has often challenged the authority of Inzko, the top international envoy who -- under Dayton -- has overarching powers in BiH, including the ability to impose laws and fire elected officials.
The RS prime minister -- currently under investigation by foreign prosecutors for alleged involvement in corruption -- insists that there is no need for an international presence in the country's legal system.
The entity's citizens, Dodik says, should decide all such matters.
The law was approved despite the international community's stated warnings that plebiscites on such questions could further undermine BiH's stability.
"While a referendum can be a legitimate mechanism in the right circumstances, it can be counterproductive, and even provocative, when used to pursue a narrow political agenda," the US Embassy in Sarajevo said in a statement Tuesday. "The United States would consider provocative any referendum that threatens the stability, sovereignty or territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina."
Inzko has reportedly warned the leaders of Bosnian Serb parties, which backed the law, the passing of this referendum would further isolate RS from the European and world communities.
Croatian President to Make Historic Visit to Serbia-Montenegro
Stipe Mesic's one-day visit to Belgrade on Wednesday will be the first by a Croatian head of state since his country declared independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991.
(Electronic Telegraph - 09/09/03; Reuters, HINA, Southeast Europe Online - 08/09/03; Tanjug - 05/09/03 - 08/09/03)
Stipe Mesic is due to arrive in Belgrade on Wednesday (10 September), becoming the first Croatian president to visit Serbia-Montenegro since his country declared independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991.
Mesic's one-day visit seeks to create "a better climate for the settlement of open issues between the two countries", the Croatian news agency HINA quoted Tomislav Car, an official in the president's office, as saying during a news briefing in Zagreb on Monday.
Euro-Atlantic integration, regional co-operation and bilateral relations are expected to be key items on Mesic's agenda.
He is scheduled to hold talks with Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic, Speaker of the state union's Parliament Dragoljub Micunovic, acting Serbian President Natasa Micic, and Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic.
Other topics likely to be discussed include further liberalisation of the two countries' visa regimes, refugee returns and the search for those who went missing during the 1991-1995 war that claimed 20,000 lives.
The two countries established diplomatic relations in 1996.
But it was only after reformist governments came to power in both Zagreb and Belgrade in 2000 that ties warmed.
On Monday, Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic noted that several issues have been addressed over the past few years, including pensions, visas and, most significantly, the dispute over the Prevlaka peninsula.
Belgrade wants to build good relations with Zagreb, Svilanovic said, adding that all issues with resolutions in the interest of the two countries' citizens will be discussed.
Mesic said Saturday that goodwill exists in both Serbia-Montenegro and Croatia for resolving all open issues.
Croatia and Serbia-Montenegro are both seeking integration into Euro-Atlantic structures.
To achieve that goal, both countries have to meet key requirements, including co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, progress in refugee returns, and stepped-up regional co-operation.
Croatia submitted its EU membership application in February and is hoping to start accession negotiations before the end of next year.
Mesic was the last chairman of Yugoslavia's rotating presidency.
He left his post when Croatia declared its independence in 1991.
Nine years later he became president.
Last October, Mesic became the first head of state to testify at former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's trial in The Hague.
He described the defendant as a warmonger who sought to create a Greater Serbia at the expense of the republics within the former Yugoslavia and their people.
Macedonia political landscape continues to shift
Almost all of the political parties in Macedonia have held congresses and elected new leaderships, while several smaller political groupings have been forced off the map -- in part due to a new law setting a higher membership threshold.
Southeast European Times correspondent Marina Stojanovska surveys the changes.

The Macedonian political stage is bustling as never before.
Almost all parties have held congresses and elected new leaderships.
The past period has seen enlargement of the right wing, in particular of the ruling VMRO-DPMNE party and the dissolution of the Social Democrat-led For Macedonia Together coalition, formed in 2000.
One of the contributing factors has been a new law on political parties which requires parties to have 1,000 members to register, instead of the previous 500 members.
As a result, many smaller political groupings have had to assimilate into larger ones.
The League for Democracy, the first political party to be established in Macedonia after communism, has joined the VMRO-DPMNE, as has the Agricultural Party.
The head of the latter, Marjan Gorcev, formerly belonged to the VMRO-DPMNE and served as agriculture minister under former Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski.
DRUM, a party founded by former VMRO-DPMNE Vice-President Dosta Dimovska, has also returned to the fold.
In all, eight parties have now been absorbed by VMRO-DPMNE.
Small parties are not happy with the amended law on political parties.
The former leader of the League for Democracy, university professor Gjorge Marjanovic, has filed a motion with the Constitutional Court, urging it to reconsider the changes.

Last month, the Court launched a procedure concerning the articles in question, which also require parties to deposit signatures at local units of the ministry of justice, and to complete registration within 45 days.
The judges expressed concerns that the provisions may violate the constitutional principle of freedom of political assembly.
Meanwhile, the opposition Social Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDSM) has undergone a few quakes in the several months since it lost the most recent elections.
Its leader, former Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski, was ousted in a no-confidence vote.
A congress to elect a new leader then followed.
Radmila Sekerinska, the former deputy prime minister in charge of European integration, became the new SDSM leader.
With her came an entirely new party leadership.
Elections for municipal level heads are now underway, a move seen as part of Sekerinska's efforts to consolidate the party.
The ruling VMRO-DPMNE also held a congress, re-electing current Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski as its leader.
In terms of public opinion, the situation resembles that of the 2002 parliamentary elections, except with roles reversed.
Now, as then, the ruling party enjoys strong popularity, and the opposition is mired in low poll numbers.
However, the ruling party today is the VMRO-DPMNE, which has the confidence of 23% of the population, according to recent surveys. In 2002, it was the Social Democrats, who are currently able to muster only around 8% of voter support.
Political analysts see such a phenomenon as quite normal.
"It is natural that people who voted for an option in elections give the same option great support for a certain period hoping that it will solve the pressing economic problems," says political analyst Mersel Biljali.

Should the government fail to deliver on its campaign promises, its rating will slowly but surely decline, Biljali says. That is exactly the fate suffered by the SDSM.
Despite the government's high rating in 2002, it was not able to meet citizens' expectations concerning economic improvement and investment.
It remains to be seen how effective Sekerinska will be at putting the Social Democrats back on the road to political recovery.
The latest development is the breakup of the For Macedonia Together coalition, which was formed ahead of the 2000 local elections.
It then went on to triumph in 2002, and subsequently backed Branko Crvenkovski in his 2004 race to the presidency.
The second largest party in the coalition For Macedonia Together, the Liberal Democrats, has undergone a political shakeup.
At its most recent congress, party leader and former Mayor of Skopje Risto Penov resigned from his post.
Former Defence Minister Jovan Manasievski then took over the helm.
Immediately after the congress, he announced the party's departure from the coalition, saying it was in danger of losing its identity to the SDSM.
The Liberal Democrats now plan to run independently in the next local elections, expected in 2009.
Ethnic Minorities Lack Representation in Serbia, Party Says
The Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians, Serbia's strongest ethnic minority party, is urging the international community to push for an end to discrimination.
Part one of a two part series.
By Dusan Kosanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 27/01/04
Although ethnic minorities account for more than 30 per cent of Serbia's population, according to the last census, none of the non-Serbian communities will have representatives in the new parliament.
The Coalition for Tolerance -- formed by significant political parties of Hungarians and Bosniaks, two major ethnic minorities in Serbia -- did not win the required 5 per cent of votes in the 28 December parliamentary election.
International organisations consider the Serbian election law inadequate, as it fails to protect minorities' rights by way of "positive discrimination", ensuring parliamentary seats for all ethnic groups.
Pro-European parties in parliament have promised to amend the law, saying that their ranks include all nationalities, not only Serbians.
However, Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians (SVM) leader Jozsef Kasza maintains that those MPs cannot be considered authentic representatives of their people.
One reason the minorities' election efforts failed lies in their parties' disarray.
Some declined to join the Coalition for Tolerance, joining forces instead with the so-called "Belgrade parties".
Those include the Democratic Party, which allocated two MP seats to Bosniaks for their support.
According to Kasza, the December elections did not result in Serbia moving towards Europe, rather Belgrade "took three steps back" as a result of the strong showing by the ultranationalist Radical Party.
Kasza expressed disappointment with the Coalition for Tolerance's poor results in central Serbia and Belgrade.
By contrast, in the northern province of Vojvodina, his party came in second.
"Tolerance and co-existence, which have been nourished for centuries, will either be strong enough to act outside the area, or the nationalist leadership will further radicalise the people of Vojvodina," Kasza said.
The SVM sent a letter to international institutions, warning that the new political situation could foster a negative attitude towards minorities.
A number of incidents that occurred in Vojvodina as the Radical Party celebrated its election victory provide cause for alarm, he suggested.
The SVM is urging the international community to press for changes in the election law and for incorporating SVM-drafted amendments into the Law on Human and Minorities' Rights.
Such changes, the party believes, would create pre-conditions for a multicultural society.
"We can accept Serbia as our homeland more easily if Serbia accepts our culture," the letter said.
De Hoop Scheffer Praises Reform Progress in Albania, Calls for Continued Efforts
During a Balkan tour last month, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer urged Albania to step up the implementation of reforms and continue the fight against organised crime and corruption.

NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer visited the Adriatic Charter countries -- Albania, Croatia and Macedonia -- last month as part of a Balkan tour ahead of the upcoming NATO summit in Istanbul.
In Tirana, he called on Albania to boost the implementation of reforms, a crucial requirement for integration into Euro-Atlantic structures.
"The key elements for this [integration] are the reforms in the defence field and in what I want to call the values of the society," de Hoop Scheffer told reporters after talks with Albanian President Alfred Moisiu and Prime Minister Fatos Nano.
He said the Albanian government is committed to the reform process and considers the ongoing fight against organised crime and corruption very important.
"The government understood the comments of the NATO Secretary General," Nano said after the meeting. "The Istanbul summit will recognise the progress and the aim to enlarge the Alliance in the future with countries from the Balkans."
Moisiu praised NATO's presence in Southeast Europe, emphasising its role in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Macedonia.
De Hoop Scheffer said Albania has made progress in reforming its military, saying, "Albania's aim for NATO integration is legitimate and needs to be supported." He commended Albania's participation in peacekeeping operations, which he described as "a huge responsibility".
During a meeting with Defence Minister Pandeli Majko, de Hoop Scheffer said he appreciated the military's co-operation with Euro-Atlantic structures.
Majko, meanwhile, confirmed that Albania will be an active member of the Partnership for Peace initiative.
"The participation of the Albanian military in operations led by NATO will have a priority in the future," he said.
De Hoop Scheffer urged the Adriatic Charter members to work together.
"I would like to encourage Albania, Croatia and Macedonia to co-operate with each other, not only for NATO integration but also for improving the stability and security in the region," he said.
Guca: music and madness
The trumpet festival in Guca marked its 50th anniversary this year, with close to a million visitors from all over the world.

During the trumpet festival in Guca, the complexities of life are forgotten and the small town seems to breathe to the rhythm of the instrument.
The festival atmosphere is best described by its slogan "You only live once."
The town, population of 2,000, welcomed almost a million visitors to this year's festival, marking its 50th anniversary.
The streets become too small for so many guests, the music is too loud and everyone overindulges in fun, food and drink.
Guca is a place you come to go wild.
"Excellent atmosphere, lots of people and one really feels welcome.
I would like to come back next year, I really enjoy the atmosphere here, and the music of course," Italian visitor Stefano told SETimes.
Chris is from England, while Ella from the Netherlands.
"Guca is amazing, we've been here for 11 days, we arrived a day before the start," Chris explains.
"The festival is incredible, complete madness.
We've also met many great people and I'm sure we'll see them again," Ella adds.
Marina from Zagreb will be heading for rehabilitation after Guca.
"I am staying at an apartment with my friends from Bosnia, America and Bulgaria.
It was fantastic, but after the four days we spent in this madness, I'm going to need rehabilitation," she tells SETimes.
Guca is becoming a tourist attraction and has drawn the attention of both Serbian and foreign officials.
This year, US Ambassador to Belgrade Mary Warlick, Russian Ambassador Alexander Konuzin, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Ivica Dacic and Infrastructure Minister Milutin Mrkonjic attended the festival.

Students of music from China, India and Mexico came to study the attraction and phenomenon of the trumpet.
They also had an opportunity to visit the Trumpet Museum -- by which Guca expresses its respect for the instrument that has made it famous.
"There are two Serbias, one that wants to join Europe and the other that wants to bring Europe to Serbia.
Guca is the other Serbia, because visitors from as many as 80 countries regularly come to the trumpet festival," the head of the festival organizing committee Slobodan Jolovic told SETimes.
The 50th festival was doubled in length -- from the usual five days to ten -- and apart from the usual festival competition, it also included the World Trumpet Players and Brass Orchestras Competition.
The winner of the title of best orchestra was Dejan Petrovic's Trumpet Orchestra, and Ekrem Mamutovic from Vranje was named as best trumpet player.
The World Competition drew orchestras from other continents, such as Australia and North America, but the Serbian musicians came away with the accolades again.
In this category, the places were switched -- Petrovic was named the best trumpet player, while the best orchestra was the one led by Mamutovic.
"I have been playing the trumpet since I was six, that was one of my first toys. At the age of 13, I debuted in Guca and here I am today, winning these awards.
After all that, I really don't think it gets any better," one of the best trumpet players of today," Mamutovic told SETimes.
Although this year's trumpets have just fallen silent, preparations for the next festival in Guca are already beginning.
"Next year the festival will be back to its usual five-day duration.
Young people make up the majority of Guca's visitors, which is why we will try to adjust the program to them even more," the town's Culture Center Director Adam Tadic told SETimes.
UNESCO: Romanian church joins world heritage list
The tourism industry hopes for a boost following UN recognition of an eighth church at Bukovina's famous Sucevita Monastery.

A 16th-century church in northern Romania has been added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites.
Meeting in Brasilia this month, the international organisation decided to inscribe 21 new sites on the list and approved extensions for several others.
One of the extensions was for the Sucevita Monastery complex in Bukovina.
Seven churches at the site already received world heritage status in 1993, and UNESCO has now decided to add an eighth.
The Resurrection Church is the only one of the set not built by a ruling voivoda, or local administrative leader, but rather by the members of a powerful aristocratic family, the Movilesti, some of whom acceded to the throne of Moldova and Wallachia.
According to a legend, a woman trying to redeem her sins carried the stones necessary for the construction of the monastery in her oxen-drawn cart over a period of 30 years.
The church, with its striking green colour, was built in Moldavian style, which combines Byzantine and Gothic elements with features seen in the old local wooden churches.
It also contains Ottoman themes.
Specialists have named it "the testament of Moldavian art" due to the complexity of its frescoes and architecture.
Locals see the decision as de jure recognition of Sucevita's splendor.
"Being one of the most impressive of Bukovina's monasteries, both in dimensions and presentation of the exterior paintings -- the only one still preserving the frescoes of the north wall -- Sucevita was already considered de facto 'heritage' by both tourists and locals", Dana Vatamaniuc, a local guide, told SETimes.
The decision could give local tourism a boost.
"Since Bukovina has recently been affected by floods and the effects of the global economic crisis, leading to a decrease in the number of tourists (both Romanian and foreign), the unexpected publicity generated by UNESCO's decision may give new hope to locals involved in the tourist business," Vatamaniuc said.
Publicity alone doesn't suffice, however.
"If locals know how to preserve the authenticity of the region, authorities adopt the appropriate development and promotion strategies, and visitors encourage a sustainable tourism based on the local traditions and culture, the painted churches of Bukovina may become one of the most visited sites of Romania," she said. "We only have to seize this opportunity."
More than 900 sites are currently on the World Heritage List.
In Romania, other sites include the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve, the group of fortified churches and villages in Transylvania, the Horezu Monastery, the Dacian fortresses in Orastie, the wooden churches in Maramures County and the historic city of Sighisoara.
Science and Technology: Free internet for Bulgarian rail customers
Major Bulgarian railway stations are getting free internet.
Also in science news: Croatian innovators win awards at the INPRX show, and almost one-fourth of Serbian scientists will continue their careers abroad.

Major railway stations in Bulgaria will be equipped with free wireless internet access, the Transport Ministry announced.
The project was launched on June 18th at five stations in Sofia, Burgas, Varna, Plovdiv and Gorna Oriahovitsa.
Croatian innovators won 21 awards at the 25th INPEX invention show held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, from June 16th to June 18th.
The Croats participated with 13 innovations.
The show brought together 1,800 participants from 15 countries.
More than 21% of Serbian scientists intend to continue their careers abroad, according to a poll by the Science Ministry, among 756 scientists of various ages.
Around 40% are younger than 35.
The main reasons for leaving Serbia are the low standard of living, working conditions, insufficient funding and low salaries.
Cypriot archaeologists discovered what they believe to be soldiers' barracks belonging to a Phoenician fortress at least 2,500 years old.
The finding at the ancient kingdom of Idalion, 16km south of Nicosia, is part of what experts consider the largest ancient administrative hub on the island.
Science in Turkey needs more independence from politics so the country can achieve the status of a "scientific society", according to the 2009 Science Report by the Turkish Academy of Sciences, published on Wednesday (June 23rd).
The document outlines the need for more extensive scientific research and development, and state support beyond the public sector.

Ashdown Says Police Reform Necessary for BiH's EU Integration
Bosnia and Herzegovina is at a crossroads, Paddy Ashdown told Bosnian Serb lawmakers Thursday.
Whether it moves forward towards EU integration or becomes the only Balkan country left out of the process depends on achieving police reform in line with EU principles.
(Office of the High Representative -- 21/04/05 - 22/04/05; SRNA - 21/04/05)
Police reform is the last major challenge Bosnia and Herzegovina must meet to enter the path towards EU integration, High Representative to BiH Paddy Ashdown told Republika Srpska lawmakers. [OHR]
Three days before the start of negotiations on police reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), High Representative Paddy Ashdown urged politicians in Republika Srpska (RS) on Thursday (21 April) to seek a compromise solution that will lead to an agreement.
"Police reform is the last great reform necessary for Europe.
This is the final hurdle for the RS and BiH to enter into the European path," Ashdown said, addressing the RS National Assembly.
He also warned lawmakers that they had less than four weeks to decide which way they want to go.
"There are two options: a bright future and a dark one," he said. "Membership in the EU is the only future that offers BiH prosperity, security, and stability.
You can choose this option if you want to.
But there is a black option, too. And you can choose that as well."
The EU is expected to decide next month whether to allow BiH to start talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement, the first step towards eventual full-fledged membership in the Union.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn has indicated that if BiH politicians reach a successful deal on police restructuring, in line with EU principles, Brussels will give the green light for the talks.
The three principles laid down by the European Commission (EC) for police reform in BiH are: exclusive police competency at the state level, but operational control at the local level; police areas drawn up on the grounds of operational efficiency, not political control; and no political interference in policing.
The main goal is to make it easier for police to fight crime, Ashdown said.
While those principles are fixed, the ways to achieve them are not, so there is much room for compromise, the top international envoy to BiH noted. "There is a lot RS can win from this if it wants to," he said.
Referring to concerns in RS that police reform would be a step towards abolishing the entity, Ashdown insisted there is no such agenda.
"There is no plot to open up, by clandestine means, the question of constitutional reform," he said. "This is not an attack on RS.
There is no attempt to abolish the entities." Nor, he added, did it imply that the RS interior ministry had to be abolished.
Rather, Ashdown said, it would bring benefits such as better equipment to fight crime and equal payment in the two entities for the same job.
Citing the results of a new poll conducted only in RS, Ashdown said 79 per cent of respondents said they want BiH to join the EU and 51 per cent had voiced support for the establishment of a state level police service, if it would place the country on the path to Europe.
"A clear 59 per cent of RS citizens think that criminals have more influence over politicians, than ordinary citizens," the envoy noted, adding that according to 77 per cent of the respondents, "Police need to do more to fight crime." This is what the three EU principles are designed to do, he added.
Speaking to reporters later, RS Prime Minister Pero Bukejlovic said it is possible to find a compromise solution on police reform without changing the RS and BiH constitutions.

Serbian Parliament Rejects Draft Law on Opening Security Files
Several years after the overthrow of Slobodan Milosevic's regime, Serbia still has not passed legislation providing for public access to secret service files kept on individuals.
By Davor Konjikusic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 22/04/05

Following the overthrow of Slobodan Milosevic's regime and the rise to power of the new democratic authorities, many expected the disclosure of secret service files, both their own and those of others.
Several years later, this has yet to happen.
Most recently, parliament rejected a proposal by the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO), a ruling coalition member, on regulating access to the files.
The SPO had submitted a draft law, demanding a summary procedure for its adoption.
At the end of March, however, MPs blocked the proposed legislation, saying it did not include solutions to possible "political, security, legal, ethical or other consequences".
The proposal would have provided citizens access to any of their personal files that were kept prior to the adoption of the law.
All files, not just certain categories, would have been subject to disclosure, with the only exception being files that could jeopardise Serbia's international relations.
Politicians have repeatedly pledged their readiness to tackle the issue of access to Security Information Service archives, but parties hold different opinions about what should be done.
Since Milosevic's ouster in 2000, the public has been presented with several draft laws written by NGOs and political parties.
Because of inadequate political will and negative assessments from the security services, however, none have been adopted.
Under public pressure, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia opted for a partial solution and allowed citizens who suspected that they were subjects of interest to check whether a file on them existed.
If so, they were allowed to read their files at secret service facilities.
According to the interior ministry, nearly 8,000 citizens submitted requests as a result of the government decree.
Subsequent verification, however, indicated that only 413 citizens actually had files kept on them.
In June 2003, the Constitutional Court of Serbia deemed the government decree unconstitutional, necessitating a full-fledged law to regulate the files, instead of a mere decree.
The draft law that has received the most attention is one proposed by the Centre for Antiwar Action.
It is controversial because of a clause allowing persons who were the subject of security files to publish their contents.
Opponents say this would "threaten the conspiratorial nature of the service" and potentially damage state interests.
Turks, Cypriots protest Turkey's plans to build nuclear plants
ANKARA, Turkey/NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Hundreds of activists in Turkey and Cyprus attended demonstrations Saturday (March 19th) against Ankara's plans to build nuclear power facilities.
Late last week, Turkey stated it remains firmly behind plans to build two nuclear power plants over the next 12 years --one near the town of Sinop on the Black Sea coast and a second one at Akkuyu, 25km from a seismic fault line.
Protestors in Istanbul and Mersin marched with banners reading "Don't let Akkuyu become Fukushima", referring to the critical situation at the Japanese nuclear plant after the disastrous earthquake ten days ago.
In Cyprus, about 50 Greek and Turkish Cypriots protested by wearing masks and white overalls.
On Friday, Greece urged Turkey to abandon its plans to build the nuclear facilities.
President Karolos Papoulias said that the EU should intervene to prevent a "catastrophe at its threshold". (Dogan - 19/03/11; ANA-MPA, Ethnos, Ta Nea - 18/03/11)
EP investigates Romanian member for bribery
STRASBOURG, France -- The European Parliament (EP) opened an investigation Sunday (March 20th) into allegations that a Romanian member and two colleagues in the institution were involved in bribery.
The British newspaper Sunday Times reported that Adrian Severin, a former Romanian deputy prime minister, along with Ernst Strasser of Austria and Zoran Thaler of Slovenia, accepted offers of up to 100,000 euros per year in return for proposing amendments in the EP.
The alleged wrongdoing was brought to light during an eight-month investigation by the paper, a probe that initially involved a total of 60 EP members.
Three of them are said to have responded to the offer.
Severin denies all accusations, insisting he had the right to work as a "political consultant". (Mediafax, Hotnews.ro, Realitatea - 20/03/11)

Santorini, one of Europe's premiere destinations
Volcanic sand and breathtaking views make Santorini Greece's most prized getaway.

The southernmost island in the archipelago of volcanic islands in the Aegean Sea -- Santorini -- is arguably Greece's main attraction.
Its spectacular beauty, along with its dynamic nightlife, has made the island one of Europe's tourist hotspots.
Fira, the capital, is located atop a hill.
From a distance, it looks like the mountain is covered with snow, but if you look closer it is actually veiled with white and pastel houses.
Numerous pathways and narrow alleys lead to many wonderful spots.
One of them is Franco's Bar, known for its fantastic view overlooking an old harbour.
Franco's made Newsweek magazine's "The World's Best Bar" list.
Most visitors stay in Kamari and Perivolos.
They typically go to the capital on excursions that include a boat tour to the local volcano, and a swim in the yellow water, which got its color from the volcanic sulphur.
On the way back, many visit Oia, located on the island's northern side.
Oia boasts the richest view in the caldera and unforgettable sunsets.
The island's beauty was featured on the big screen in the 2001 movie "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider", featuring Angelina Jolie, which was filmed in Oia.
The Perissa and Perivolos beaches, which are practically connected, are full of cafes and dance clubs.
Most visitors come to swim here because it is a spot where the Aegean is calm, and some of the beaches have unusual light black sand.
For an added adventure, one can take a ferry from Santorini to nearby Therasia on the opposite side of the volcano.
Simply getting to the harbour is fun.
Travelers can walk down Santorini's numerous steps, take a cable car for a more breathtaking aerial view, or for a traditional approach, ride a donkey.
While amenities can be pricey, the food is excellent.
The swordfish at Taverna Petros is highly recommended.
Gust of electronic music to refresh Kotor
World-class DJs and hip-hop artists will perform at the Maximus discotheque on the Montenegrin Coast.

Music and dance lovers are gearing up for the opening of the third annual Refresh Festival on Thursday (July 30th) in the ancient city of Kotor.
This year, the spotlight will be focused on the DJ stage at the Maximus discotheque, which will host some of the biggest names in techno and house music.
World renowned French house DJ and producer Bob Sinclar will headline this year's four-day festival, which is about to blow a burst of cool electronic dance music onto the scorching Montenegrin coast.
It kicks off with progressive house legend, English DJ and producer Steve Lawler.
His countryman, Darren Emerson, will headline Saturday.
Swedish techno artist Adam Beyer will be sandwiched between the two DJs Friday.
"World, Hold On", which climbed to the top of Billboard's Club Play Songs chart in 2006, was Bob Sinclar's call for global peace, but when he drops that bomb on Sunday night, his fans will explode on the dance floor.
While the techno crowd is cutting a rug on the second floor, the hip hop hordes downstairs will be shaking their booties to AJs Nigrutin and Sky Wikluh, with acts from across the region.
With an emphasis on house and techno, Refresh held an open call to discover new DJs. From a pool of hundreds of respondents, four have been selected to open for the headliners.
"We are very proud of a large number of young people that applied for the open call.
We had the chance to realise the DJ scene in Montenegro has many young and talented DJs," Media Manager Marija Vujovic said.
I know it will be fantastic, I am going with great friends and we are going to be partying until dawn," said Podgorica resident Marko, 21.
I am really excited about the DJs they brought this year," said 19-year old Milena, of Kotor.
EU reiterates support for Western Balkan nations' integration
EU foreign ministers accepted Iceland's application for membership in the bloc Monday, leaving some in the Balkans to wonder about their prospects.
(Euobserver, Wall Street Journal, Irish Times, B92, Emportal, Makfax - 29/07/09; AFP, Reuters, FT, BBC, Fena, Swedish EU presidency - 27/07/09; FT, Fena - 26/07/09)
Iceland's application has raised some concern among EU aspirants in Southeast Europe. [Getty Images]
Reiterating their support for the Western Balkan countries' prospects of joining the EU, the foreign ministers of the 27-nation bloc promised on Monday (July 27th) to consider Albania's application for membership as soon as possible.
The EU hopes "to give a new impetus to the European integration process in the Western Balkans" in the coming months, Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said after the talks in Brussels.
His remarks came after fellow foreign ministers agreed to accept Iceland's formal application for bloc membership and to forward it to the European Commission (EC) for assessment.
The North Atlantic island of about 300,000 people is already a member of the European Economic Area, which means that its laws are in line with two-thirds of EU legislation, EU Commissioner for Enlargement Olli Rehn said on Monday.
He noted however that Iceland will not be put on a faster track to membership; rather, its bid "will be treated by the book".
Analysts believe that in the event of a positive EC assessment of Iceland's application, Brussels is likely to launch accession talks with Reykjavik next year.
Under that scenario, the country could then join the bloc in the latter half of 2011 at the earliest.
Several EU foreign ministers, including Bernard Kouchner of France and Alexander Stubb of Finland noted that the fact that Iceland faces economic pressure following its bankruptcy last year is no excuse for a preferential treatment.
"It would be a political error to put Iceland before the Balkan countries," Kouchner said at a news conference in Brussels.
Analysts have cautioned about possible frustration among EU hopefuls in the Balkans, should newcomer Iceland make quick progress towards bloc membership.
For example, Croatia's membership talks, which should be completed by the end of this year under the country's EU roadmap, have been blocked since December due to its border dispute with Slovenia.
Macedonia has been awaiting a start date for its negotiations with Brussels since December 2005, when it was granted formal recognition as an EU candidate.
Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis indicated on Monday that Athens would continue blocking the opening of entry talks with Skopje until the two countries resolve their long-running name dispute.
Stalled reforms have prevented Bosnia and Herzegovina from making headway along its European integration path.
Aside from its difficulties with Kosovo, Serbia needs to arrest and hand over former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic to the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague to make progress on its road to accession.
Montenegro's formal application for EU membership, which was submitted in December, was accepted and forwarded to the EC for examination in April.
That same month Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha handed in his country's official application during a visit to Prague.
The EU had warned that it wouldn't accept it unless Albania's June 28th parliamentary elections were deemed free and fair.
Minorities say Albania discriminates against the right to nationality
Minorities in Albania plan to challenge the Constitutional Court decision to make the category "nationality" unconstitutional in legal and civil registries, as well as on census forms.

Ethnic minorities in Albania -- Macedonians, Greeks, Serbs, Montenegrins, Vlachs, Roma and Egyptians -- announced they will pursue a lawsuit at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, following Albania's Constitutional Court ruling last week to erase the category "nationality" in legal and civil registries.
The court determined that "nationality" is not necessary to include on the census forms to enumerate the population in Albania.
A particular bone of contention is erasing "nationality" in the official books documenting birth, including for already recognised minorities like the Greeks in the south of Albania and the Macedonians in the Mala Prespa area.
The Albanian court acted on the legal challenge issued by several local judges as well as the Red and Black Alliance, one of the main opponents of recording ethnicity and religious identity in the Albanian census that took place last October.
"Some artificial Greek minority is going to ask for special status, maybe for a percentage in parliament or government," said Albania's Higher Council of Justice deputy head Kreshnik Spahiu.
The Council is chaired by President Bamir Topi to monitor the judiciary.
The minorities claim the government openly discriminates by making it unconstitutional for citizens to be of any other nationality than Albanian.
Some already sent protest letters prior to deciding to challenge the court ruling in Strasbourg.
"The already recognised minority of Macedonians living in the Mala Prespa area can no longer declare themselves as such.
We demand that the Albanian authorities allow the free expression of nationality for all Macedonians throughout Albania, not only in Mala Prespa," Edmond Temelko, president of the Macedonian Alliance for European Integration, told SETimes.
"The Greeks who are recognised as a minority in the southern part of the country also can no longer declare themselves as Greeks.
That is valid for the Serbs and Montenegrins as well, not to speak of the others which were not recognised as minorities to begin with," Temelko added.
"The situation is very worrisome for us.
Our politicians of all stripes, minority media, intellectuals and the country must not allow the realisation of this insidious plan of Tirana against us," Greek resident Dimitris Doutsis told the newspaper Vouliarati.
The court's decision comes just weeks after minorities voiced protest regarding the unfulfilled promises by Albanian politicians to record citizens' ethnicity during the census.
Vangel Dule, representative of the Greek minority's Party for Human Rights also condemned the international community representatives in Tirana for ignoring the minorities' pleas for dialogue and co-operation.
"[T]he legal struggle on the issue of nationality will be continued in Strasbourg because the [constitutional court's] decision is contrary to Article 20 of the constitution of the Republic of Albania," Dule said at a recent meeting of all minorities' representatives in Korca.
At the meeting, minorities' representatives signed a joint declaration, saying they do not recognise the results of the October census.
The headcount was rife with manipulations, abuse and was conducted without sufficient transparency, they said.
"The greater percentage of minority members responded positively to our call for a boycott and they are not enumerated.
The law on the census [is] not to reveal the actual number of minorities, but to manipulate the statistics, which represents a continuation of the discriminatory policy of the totalitarian regime," the declaration said.
"Article 20 of the census law stipulates a $1,000 fee for all who will declare themselves non-Albanian if they were not entered as such in the registers.
With such actions, the Albanian state continues the policy inherited from the previous totalitarian system to artificially show it is ethnically homogenous and not a multi-ethnic country," Temelko said.
The minorities appealled to the government to initiate a genuine dialogue to amend existing legislation and to respect their rights based on international standards.
At the beginning of October, Albanian Foreign Minister Edmond Haxhinasto met with his Macedonian counterpart Nikola Popovski, telling him the census results would mirror reality and that Macedonians and all minorities would be permitted to declare what they are.
"Careful implementation of the censuses is important for the process to be aligned with the international and European legal framework regarding the area of human rights," Macedonian Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Borce Stamov told SETimes.
What is needed to meet international standards, he said, is "full and consistent respect for the principle of self-identification and not misusing the provisions of domestic law".
Bulgaria apologises to its Turks for "Revival Process"
The Bulgarian parliament adopted a resolution condemning the assimilation policy conducted by the country's communist regime against ethnic Turks back in the 1980s.
By Svetla Dimitrova for Southeast European Times in Sofia -- 18/01/12

Nearly 22 years after the end of communism in Bulgaria, the country's parliament adopted a declaration last week condemning a campaign in the second half of the 1980s aimed at the forceful assimilation of the country's ethnic Turks.
Launched by Todor Zhivkov's totalitarian regime in 1984, the so-called "Revival Process" culminated in 1989, when more than 360,000 Bulgarian citizens of Turkish descent were forced to flee their homes and seek shelter in neighbouring Turkey.
As part of the campaign, the country's communist authorities initially tried to force ethnic Bulgarian Muslims, and then ethnic Turks, to change their Turko-Arabic names to "traditional" Bulgarian ones. There were cases of beatings, killings and unlawful detention of people who refused to do so.
The declaration, proposed by the right-wing Democrats for Strong Bulgaria (DSB) party of former Prime Minister Ivan Kostov, was adopted on January 11th with the backing of 112 of the 115 lawmakers that attended the session, while the remaining three abstained.
"We firmly condemn the assimilation process against the Muslim minority living in the Republic of Bulgaria, including the so called 'Revival Process'," the document said. "We declare that the expulsion of more than 360,000 Bulgarian citizens of Turkish descent was a form of ethnic cleansing conducted by the totalitarian regime."
The declaration further urged the country's chief prosecutor and judicial authorities to make sure that the lawsuits against the alleged masterminds of the campaign be brought to a conclusion.
The DSB insisted that the perpetrators of the crimes committed against the ethnic Turks during one of the darkest episodes in Bulgaria's modern history should not be left unpunished due to the expiration of the statutory period of limitations.
The adoption of the document was hailed by Turkish experts and the government in Ankara, who described the move as belated.
Welcoming Bulgaria's decision "to face up to a dark period of its history that caused many people to suffer", the Turkish foreign ministry also urged Sofia to take steps to bring to justice those responsible for the campaign and "to redress in all its aspects the grievances" those who were expelled as a result.
Muzaffer Kutlay, a Balkan expert with the International Strategic Research Organisation (USAK) in Ankara, said the declaration was "an important step forward for Bulgaria to settle accounts with its past" and towards a further improvement in its ties with Turkey.
The move "will provide the two countries with an opportunity to establish confidence between them," Kutlay told SETimes. "Also by acting with the virtue of apologising, Bulgaria gained a lot of credibility in the sight of Turkey."
Urging Bulgaria to "continue this trend in a sustainable manner," she also believed there was need for the Balkan nation to "take sincere steps in the field of education in Turkish language".
Bilal Simsir, who served as Turkey's ambassador to Tirana from 1985 to 1987, downplayed the importance of the declaration.
"This decision does not have any significance in practical terms, because Bulgaria does not recognise the concept of 'minority' that has a place in the international law," he told SETimes.
"If, and only if, Bulgaria recognises minority rights in the country in line with international agreements, such declarations of the Parliament and the related apologies will have a real meaning."
Bulgarian Helsinki Committee Chairman Krassimir Kanev told SETimes that he doubts that the masterminds of the campaign of the late 1980s "will ever face justice, despite the declaration's call for this".
Bulgarian experts, however, viewed the parliament's move as a positive step.
Harlan Alexandrov, a lecturer on social anthropology at the New Bulgarian University in Sofia, said the assembly's move should have "a healing effect" for the members of the country's ethnic Turkish community.
"Some of them still remember the violence, others have been told about it by their parents," he told SETimes.
Alexandrov told SETimes that Turks should now feel "relieved and become less susceptible to manipulations".
There have been recurrent warnings by members of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF), particularly its founder and leader, Ahmed Dogan, that Bulgarians could stage a second "Revival Process" against ethnic Turks.
The party was founded in 1990 to represent the interests of the Turkish ethnic minority.
It has been represented in all assemblies in the past two decades and has been a member of three coalition governments since 1992.
Former MRF deputy chair Kasim Dal, who spent three and a half years in prison in the 1980s after refusing to change his name, said he supported the declaration, stressing however that "it should have been adopted much, much earlier".
"Better late than never," he told SETimes on Tuesday, adding that this should have happened back in the early 1990s, so that the architects of the campaign "could have been brought to justice".

Kosovo Albanians cautiously optimistic about the future
In the first of two articles concerning expectations about Kosovo's future, SETimes correspondent Blerta Foniqi-Kabashi discusses status and other issues with members of the ethnic Albanian majority.

Kosovo's Albanians -- the province's majority population -- differ in their views of what the final status of Kosovo will be.
Some feel certain that Kosovo will soon become an internationally recognised sovereign state, while others are not sure how or when this will happen.
However, all agree on one thing: the province cannot remain under Serbian authority.
"I don't know what kind of independence there will be, but I am sure that Kosovo is on a good track," University of Pristina economics student Afrim Kabashi says, adding that unity among Kosovo's leaders is crucial.
"I am not saying that they aren't united, but they should be closer to each other," he says.
A fellow student, Ard Matoshi, urges Kosovo's people to be patient as the status issue is resolved.
"I am angry with the delay of the process, but when I remember what kind of progress has been achieved during past years in Kosovo, I think we don't have a reason to be pessimistic and intolerant," Matoshi says.
According to Zijadin Gashi, a journalist with the daily newspaper Zeri, the public is alarmed by the apparent hesistancy and disagreement among Contact Group members.
These delays are "the main factor that is creating suspicions and turmoil",Gashi believes, adding however that the long-term picture provides reason for optimism.
"Kosovo is oriented towards the EU.
I think that over the next several years, we will fulfil all the criteria for being a member of the Union," he says.
Burim Ramadani, of the University of Pristina, thinks there can only be one outcome of the status process, despite the delays.
"We are at the end of a quite long process of negotiations and transition.
I think that the status settlement is going to be fully based on the people's political will -- no doubt, everyone knows this will is for Kosovo independence," he says.
Ramadani is confident that Kosovo will be a "consociation state" -- with the minority communities granted the necessary rights to represent their interests and their goals.
"As consociation theory says, a large scale of decentralisation, community rights, constitutional design and the electoral system will guarantee that minorities, in particular Kosovo Serbs, will have power within the political structure of Kosovo."
However, status will not solve all of the province's long-term challenges.
"Kosovars are going to have to face real problems," Ramadani said.
"The large level of corruption could be the most dangerous thing in post-status Kosovo, as well as organised crime."
Bekim Ukaj, a law student, believes democratic institutions, a good justice system and economic growth are the keys to a brighter future for Kosovo.
"These are necessary parameters for a well-functioning state," he says.
Some -- particularly the unemployed -- are sceptical that things will change for the better.
Since 1999, says Smajl Sinani, he has been hearing pledges of independence and economic development.
"The leaders promised us that we will have enough work places and the integration process will help to work not only in Kosovo, but also abroad," Sinani says.
His wife wants their family to leave and work outside the province.
"I will work anywhere -- we have five children, who many times have had nothing to eat," she says.
Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia which has been under UN administration since 1999.
While Serbia's nominal sovereignty is recognized by the international community, in practice Serbian governance in the province is virtually non-existent.
The province is governed by UNMIK and the local Provisional Institutions of Self-Government, with security provided by the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR).
Kosovo Serbs have mixed feelings about their future
Getty Museum to repatriate rare artefacts to Greece
Greece can expect the return of two ancient masterpieces, including a 4th century BCE gold funerary wreath, under an agreement with California's J. Paul Getty Museum, announced on Monday.
(Businesswire, Los Angeles Times - 11/12/06; The New York Times, UPI - 10/12/06; ANA-MPA, Kathimerini - 05/12/06; Reuters, DPA - 21/11/06)

The J. Paul Getty Museum said on Monday (December 11th) it would return to Greece two ancient artefacts, believed to have been smuggled out of the country in the early 1990s.
"We are pleased to announce today we have reached an agreement in principle on the return of two objects -- a Gold Funerary Wreath and a Statue of a Kore -- that have been claimed by the Hellenic Republic Ministry of Culture," said a statement, signed by Greek Culture Minister Georgios Voulgarakis and Dr. Michael Brand, the Getty Museum director.
"A formal agreement, which will be signed soon, will include details about the return of the objects to Greece, as well as plans for future collaboration between the Hellenic Republic Ministry of Culture and the J. Paul Getty Museum," it said.
The US museum obtained the two rare objects -- both dating back to the 4th century BCE -- in 1993.
It reportedly paid $4.45m for them.
Monday's announcement followed nearly a year of talks between Greek officials and the US museum.
It has been a decade since Athens first claimed that the pieces originated in Greece.
Citing Greek police sources, The New York Times reported on Sunday that the funerary wreath, decorated with solid gold leaves and twigs, was dug up by a farmer in 1990 near Serres, in northern Greece.
It then reached the art market through Germany and Switzerland, where the Getty's former antiquities curator, Marion True, reportedly first saw it in 1992.
Eventually, the Getty bought the rare antiquity for $1.15m.
On November 21st, an Athens prosecutor charged True and several others over their alleged involvement in the deal.
The curator resigned last year after Italian authorities pressed charges against her, accusing her of conspiring to obtain stolen antiquities.
In July, the Getty Museum returned two other antiquities to Greece -- a 4th century engraved tombstone from the ancient city of Thebes, also purchased in 1993, and a 6th century BCE marble relief, bought by J. Paul Getty himself in 1955.
In September, Germany's University of Heidelberg returned an important small marble fragment from the Parthenon.
It likely would be put on display at the new Acropolis museum, which is expected to open next year.
The Greek authorities hope other national treasures and antiquities would be repatriated, particularly the Elgin Marbles kept at the British Museum, which include much of the Parthenon frieze.
About a week ago, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution tabled by Greece on the return or restitution of cultural property to countries of origin.
"The adoption of this resolution in itself signals and guides the countries to help so that the antiquities from all over the world will return to their homes," Voulgarakis said in a speech at the UN on December 4th, welcoming the General Assembly's move. "The illegal trade of antiquities is in the same category as the illegal trade of weapons, narcotics and people.
It amounts to a form of organised crime that is directly related to mobsters and money laundering."
Kosovo seeks increased co-operation with its neighbours
Kosovo, Montenegro and Macedonia are working to resolve political issues and increase regional economic integration.

Kosovo and Montenegro are planning to sign a series of agreements in the fields of economy, infrastructure, investments and tourism in an effort to improve regional co-operation.
Kosovo Minister of Foreign Affairs Enver Hoxhaj visited Podgorica last week to discuss the plans.
"Regional infrastructure projects, such as a railway and a highway, are to advance relations between countries and make the European perspective of the region more certain," Montenegrin Prime Minister Igor Luksic said after the talks.
Hoxhaj said ties between the two countries, as well as with Macedonia, are a key to boosting the regional countries' economies.
Macedonian Parliament Speaker Trajko Velanjovski visited Pristina on January 10th, where he said the two countries' relationship is positive.
The Macedonian parliament recently adopted two agreements with Kosovo -- a declaration recommending Kosovo be recognised and a ratification on border demarcation with Kosovo.
"This is a sign of the intensive co-operation between our two countries.
I am pleased to say that procedures for ratifying agreements and treaties between the countries in the field of security, justice, economy and finances have been intensified," Veljanofski said during his visit.
Kosovo analysts say it is important that in the first weeks of 2012 Kosovo and its neighbours keep high level contacts, but they are worried over future challenges the countries will face.
Although the demarcation agreement has been ratified with Macedonia, Montenegro has not yet done so.
Pristina Centre for Conflict Studies head Abdullah Hasani told SETimes that Kosovo will create a demarcation border in 2012, which, according to him, should not disturb the relations between Kosovo and Macedonia.
"I would like to see an example with Macedonia in which both countries create the demarcation without problems.
But in Montenegro, I fear that some groups might use this [demarcation] process for their own political reasons," Hasani said.
He added that the demarcation process with Montenegro is also more challenging due to ethnic issues.
"We have seen that the inclusion of Montenegrins in Kosovo's constitution and the rights of Albanians in Montenegro has been on the agenda of senior leadership for a while, and Hoxaj's statement shows that," Hasani said.
"The example with Macedonia should be considered -- where Albanians are more numerous than in Montenegro, and where ethnic issues did not become an obstacle to resolving open issues."
Fatlum Sadiku, a freelance Kosovo commentator for different newspapers, told SETimes that co-operation between Kosovo, Macedonia and Montenegro should intensify.
"Cross border co-operation, which exists for decades due to cultural, economic and family ties should be the focus of the [three] governments."
Sadiku says practical matters that make daily life easier need to be addressed.
"The creation of a free trade zone across the border would attract more investments and develop the economy.
Many that live in the areas around the border leave [due to the lack of employment, economic development] in search of a better life," Alber Gashi, a researcher at the European and Turkey Policy Institute in Pristina told SETimes.
The EU funds allocated for cross border co-operation should be put to better use, he said.
"Such projects aim to prepare border areas to be level with the economies of their countries when they join the EU, but right now I don't see such projects as having a long-term impact on the population living in border areas," says Gashi.
Savings measures irk consumers, businesses in Croatia
The new government started to implement savings measures, but it faces resistance.

Leading a country with a deficit of nearly 3 billion euros and a debt of 47 billion euros, Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic has launched measures to slash spending and boost revenues.
As the country looks towards EU accession in 18 months, it is clinging to a credit rating just one level above speculative.
Central Bank Governor Zeljko Rohatinski has said that Croatia faces a "very, very tough year ahead", and recommended that 1.2 billion euros must be cut from the budget.
The new government, which took office last month, proposed reintroducing a 6% tax on mobile phone services, which the previous administration scrapped last October.
"We assess it will bring [40m euros] annually to the budget," the government said last week.
The tax, which is expected to be adopted this week, would be in effect until June 2013.
The new plan also reinstates the tax on SMS and MMS messages, which was abolished two years ago.
"It's an income of 8m euros annually.
It may not be much money for the state, but it would be enough to save 20,000 jobs in the textile industry," Deputy Prime Minister Radimir Cacic told SETimes.
In response, mobile operators have threatened layoffs, reduced investment and appealed to the Constitutional Court.
"We are shocked that the government decided to revive the EU criticised anti-business moves of the previous [administration] as one of its first actions," VIP Net, one of three mobile operators in Croatia, said in a statement.
Other measures -- concerning the rules of public spending for civil servants in ministries and state administrations -- will reduce the use of state employee's cars, mobile phones, business cards, airlines and business trips.
The number of officials in state institutions -- deputy ministers, state secretaries, ministers' assistants -- will be reduced by one third.
This alone should add 130m euros to the state's coffers.
The government has also announced a VAT increase, as well as the possible introduction of property tax to increase economic growth.
Banks have come out in support of the measures, saying they will back the government to help the state economy recover.
"We expect a year where we will make additional joint efforts in dialogue with the government to restructure and start encouraging the growth of the economy," Croatian Banking Association (HUB) spokesperson Ivana Prgomet told SETimes.
However, Faculty of Economics professor and Zagreb Institute of Economics member Zeljko Lovrincevic told SETimes that these measures are only small steps forward.
"Expenditures [for] pensions, wages and other income is very difficult to reduce.
It takes a lot more than the abolition of officials' telephones to fill the state budget," Lovrincevic said.
The Croatian Employers' Association warned that the new taxes will have a negative effect on the economy.
"It's extremely important to us to reduce the amount of total taxes and to reduce the cost of state administration.
Therefore we welcome any reform in this direction, because it's the only way we can run the economy," Association Director Davor Majetic told SETimes.
Either way, consumers think that the savings measures are going too far.
"Manufacturers and traders listen to all announcements of possible tax changes and therefore, increase their prices.
I bet that there is not a single worker in Croatia who does not think that he will live worse this year than the last.
They negotiate on prices and taxes, and we all know who will pay all that," Goran Masonicic, a 34-year-old retail employee from Zagreb, told SETimes.
The government has promised that it will "not touch" the incomes of the most vulnerable categories of the population -- pensioners and welfare recipients -- and that the tax on basic foodstuffs will remain zero.
For now.
Albania's EU hopes hinge on vote
Prime Minister Sali Berisha seeks a new mandate, while Socialist opponent Edi Rama calls for change.
Meanwhile, Brussels will be watching carefully to see if standards are met.

Albania's general election on Sunday (June 28th) could be the most significant since the end of communism.
At stake is the country's EU accession process, which could slow to a crawl if significant irregularities occur.
"No more problems, no more excuses, no more apologies for past failures. This time these elections have to work," OSCE Ambassador in Albania Robert Bosch said on Wednesday (June 24th).
The same day, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn reiterated that a successful vote will pave the way for the integration process to move forward.
"Albania needs to prove it has embraced Western democratic standards," said Ambassador Audrey Glover, who heads an observation mission sent by the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR).
"If it doesn’t go well, it will make things very difficult."
Violence has already marred the campaign, however. A car bombing on June 18th killed opposition Christian Democratic Party member Aleksander Keka, 34.
Prior to that, a man was shot dead during an argument over putting up campaign posters, and in May an opposition lawmaker was killed.
Tensions have been high in what is expected to be a very tight contest.
The results will determine whether incumbent Prime Minister Sali Berisha and his Democratic Party will lead the country for four more years, or whether the opposition Socialists -- headed by charismatic Tirana mayor Edi Rama -- will get another turn at the helm.
In all, four alliances are in the race.
The Democratic Party has teamed up with the Alliance of Change, and the Socialist Party is partnering with the Union for Change.
Two smaller groupings have also formed -- on the right, the Pole of Freedom headed by the Movement for National Development and on the left, the Socialist Alliance for Integration headed by the Socialist Movement for Integration.
During the campaign, the ruling Democratic Party highlighted its existing achievements, such as a new highway connecting Albania and Kosovo, and said it is ready to deliver on visa liberalisation and the accession process.
"We have kept our promises during these four years … and our victory is the victory of European projects," Berisha said at a rally in Fier on Tuesday.
Rama based his party's "new policy" strategy on a number of young candidates, and an alliance with the country's newest party, G99.
The party was formed this year as a derivative of the civic movement in Albania called Mjaft.
"This is not a battle between socialists and democrats.
It's a battle to close the old world that has kept hostage for 18 years in transition and open a new world," Rama told supporters in Durres on Tuesday.
Poll projections are too close to call.
Zogby International, contracted by Top Channel TV, said in its latest survey that 40% of those polled voted for the Democratic Party, while 38% voted for the Socialists.
Greeks eye neighbours' Schengen plans
Part of the Schengen Zone since 2000, Greece has had the opportunity to experience both the advantages and the challenges of life without borders.
By Christos Ringas for Southeast European Times in Athens -- 25/06/09

With the EU considering an end to visa restrictions for Western Balkan states which have met the criteria, Greece occupies a unique position in the discussions.
Aside from Slovenia, it is the only Balkan state with full membership in the Schengen Zone -- a status which has considerably enhanced its regional role.
Government officials say they are committed to the process.
"Greece … is in favour of liberalising the visa regime so that the citizens of the Western Balkans can travel freely in all the countries of Europe," Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis said after a May meeting with her Serbian counterpart, Vuk Jeremic.
Public opinion, however, entertains some scepticism about the benefits of open borders, with some worrying it will contribute to a rising tide of economic migration.
In recent years, Greece has found itself in the position of admitting more than 2 million foreign workers.
While they have become a vital part of the economy, the influx has also altered the country's social and cultural fabric.
Remembering a time of greater homogeneity, Greeks are still coming to grips with such changes.
Moreover, many blame migration for the rising tide of organised crime.
Fewer border restrictions, critics argue, could be a boon to trafficking networks which operate across the Balkans.
Even as it mulls the prospect of removing the hurdle of visas, Greece still maintains restrictions designed to keep economic mobility under control.
Children of legal immigrants, for example, do not become naturalized, but remain designated as foreigners.
At the same time, the authorities have taken steps to make life less difficult for visitors.
In May of last year, the country eliminated the visa application fee for Serbs, and has said it will extend this privilege to other countries which have met the required provisions under the Schengen acquis.
Greece currently requires visas from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey.
Bulgarian, Croatian and Romanian citizens are allowed to enter the country without one.
During her meeting with Jeremic, Bakoyannis described Serbia as an "integral part of the European family".
Greece, she said, is "ready to receive many Serbian friends as tourists who will come to visit us this summer".
She has also given her backing to Albania's efforts to meet the Schengen criteria.
"We support the visa liberalisation process with Albania as a very important process for the increase of inter-human contacts among the Western Balkan countries," she said.
Macedonia, meanwhile, is waiting to see if the decades-old name dispute with its neighbour becomes a factor.
The European Commission recently confirmed that Skopje has met the requirements for visa-free travel.
In the past, Athens has suggested that its stance on easing the visa regime would be linked to the name issue.
In a May 11th statement to the A1 television network, however, Greek Ambassador Aleksandra Papadoniou said that her country supports Macedonia's inclusion the Schengen "White List".
She did not name any special conditions.
According to Macedonian Deputy Prime Minister Ivica Bocevski, Greece is unlikely to block the process, even though it earlier derailed Macedonia's NATO bid and has threatened to veto its EU accession.
New momentum in Macedonia name talks?
An OSCE meeting in Corfu will provide an opportunity for talks between the foreign ministers of Greece and Macedonia, and UN envoy Matthew Nimetz says the time is ripe for moving the process forward.
Serious obstacles remain, however.

UN-appointed mediator Matthew Nimetz will visit Skopje and Athens from July 6th to 9th in search of a solution to the long-running name dispute between Greece and its northern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.
The two sides resumed talks this week in Geneva after a four-month hiatus.
The discussions were in preparation for next months' meetings, Nimetz said, and no new proposal was put forward.
However, both countries "expressed willingness to talk and to find a solution", the envoy said. "Now is a good time to move the negotiation process forward," he added.
On Thursday (June 25th), Macedonian Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki said he sees the possibility of fresh momentum.
Speaking at a press conference with visiting Slovak Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajcak, he suggested the upcoming OSCE ministerial conference in Corfu could provide an opportunity to jumpstart the dialogue.
"A new dynamics and pace" are possible, the foreign minister said.
The country's prime minister, Nikola Gruevski, has said he "wishes [for] things to go in a positive direction".
Despite the optimistic tone, however, fundamental sticking points remain.
Greece says an acceptable name would be one that includes a geographic reference, such as "north", and would be used internationally.
Its neighbour, however, says that countries which already call it "Republic of Macedonia" should continue to do so.
"The solution must not be imposed on the countries which recognised us under our constitutional name, and there are more than 120," Macedonian negotiator Zoran Jolevski said.
Any deal, he added, must neither compromise national identity nor violate Macedonia's constitution.
Milososki has dismissed the idea of a geographical reference as unnecessary.
And Gruevski says a negotiated agreement would have to be put before the citizens in a referendum.
Greece, meanwhile, continues to accuse the neighbouring country of maintaining an inflexible attitude, and of not really being committed to resolving the issue.
Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis says she expects "authorities in Skopje to show a different political approach", one which is oriented towards a mutually acceptable solution.
She confirmed that the Macedonian government has requested a meeting between herself and Milososki during the OSCE session in Corfu, and said she will try to arrange it.
Stambolic Murder Trial Opens in Belgrade
The trial of Slobodan Milosevic and eight others charged in the murder of former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic opens in Belgrade on Monday (23 February).
Most of the defendants have also been charged with the attempted assassination of Serbian Renewal leader Vuk Draskovic.

The trial of nine people indicted for the murder of former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic opens at Belgrade's Special Court on Monday (23 February).
Most of the defendants are also charged with involvement in the attempted assassination of Serbian politician Vuk Draskovic.
Slobodan Milosevic, who is on trial at The Hague, is accused of ordering both crimes.
Stambolic disappeared while jogging in a Belgrade park in August 2000.
He had been expected to run against Milosevic in presidential elections later that year.
The case remained open until last April, when police unearthed his remains from a ditch in northern Vojvodina during the investigation into Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic's assassination.
Once Milosevic's mentor and close friend, Stambolic was ousted by his protégé in December 1987.
Later, Stambolic criticised Milosevic's policies during the Balkan wars in the 1990s.
The former Yugoslav leader has denied any involvement in the murder, claiming last August he had no reason to seek the death of someone he did not consider a threat to his political career.
"Ivan Stambolic was no longer a person of interest ...
He was a completely forgotten politician," Milosevic insisted in a public letter written from his prison cell.
His wife, Mira Markovic, believed to be hiding in Russia, has been charged with incitement in the same case. She, too, has denied the charges.
Nikola Barovic, a lawyer representing the Stambolic family, dismissed Milosevic's argument, telling the BBC saying that Stambolic remained "an important figure" even after his ouster.
"He could keep a stable and friendly relationship with all other ex-Yugoslav republics, from Macedonia to Slovenia, and - inside Yugoslavia - with Montenegro.
I think that was one of the motives why Milosevic gave the order to kill Mr Stambolic," Barovic said.
Milorad "Legija" Lukovic -- the suspected mastermind of Djindjic's assassination -- has been charged with orchestrating Stambolic's abduction and killing, thought to have been carried out by members of a now-disbanded special police unit created during the Milosevic regime.
Lukovic remains on the run and will be tried in absentia.
Others indicted in Stambolic's murder include the former head of Milosevic's secret police, Radomir Markovic, and former Yugoslav Army chief-of-staff Nebojsa Pavkovic.
Croatia's Sanader sacks ministers after shocking daytime murder
The Croatian government vowed to step up its fight against organised crime following a Mafia-style murder in Zagreb on Monday that prompted Prime Minister Ivo Sanader to sack his interior and justice ministers.

Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader fired his interior and justice ministers and the head of the national police Monday (October 6th), pledging to crack down on organised crime in the country.
He made the announcement just hours after a gunman murdered the daughter of a prominent lawyer in broad daylight in downtown Zagreb, about 100m from a police station.
Speaking at an urgent news conference Monday evening, Sanader told reporters he would ask parliament to approve the sacking of the interior and justice ministers, Berislav Roncevic and Ana Lovrin, as well as of national police chief Marijan Benko.
He named Tomislav Karamarko, a member of his Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) who currently heads the Security Intelligence Agency, as his new interior minister and former deputy foreign minister Ivan Simonovic as Lovrin's successor.
Veteran police officer Vladimir Faber is to replace Benko as head of national police.
Lawmakers are widely expected to support Sanader's proposal for the dismissal of the three officials following the Mafia-style murder.
A gunman shot Ivana Hodak, a 26-year-old law intern, in the hallway of her apartment building at about 11am.
Passersby said a man aged between 30 and 35 years, wearing a grey jacket and no mask, ran out of the building afterward.
The victim's father, Zvonimir Hodak, is the prominent lawyer representing former Croatian General Vladimir Zagorec, whom Austria extradited to Croatia last week to face charges of stealing 3.5m euros' worth of diamonds used as collateral in wartime arms deals. Her mother, Ljerka Mintas Hodak, is a former deputy prime minister.
Police immediately set up roadblocks throughout Zagreb.
Expressing his condolences to the Hodak family, Sanader said the killing was an "awful tragedy that we fully condemn", and urged police to step up its fight against organised crime.
"We will not tolerate organised crime and Mafia slayings," the prime minister said.
President Stipe Mesic called it a "heinous crime".
"All those who are saying that something must be done to improve security in Croatia are right," he said. "Citizens have the right to be alarmed."
Mesic also called a meeting of the National Security Council, which is expected to convene on Friday.
The government has declared war on organised crime, Deputy Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said on Monday.
Sanader told reporters that, among other steps, authorities will draft an anti-Mafia law.
But opposition politicians criticised the government for dragging its feet, with Zoran Milanovic, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, saying it was "too late" for resignations.
PACE issues resolution on Bosnia and Herzegovina, angering RS leaders
On September 30th, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe passed a resolution on Bosnia and Herzegovina aimed at smoothing its future path towards EU membership.

At its session in late September, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) passed a resolution urging BiH institutions to move forward with constitutional changes, revoke entity-level voting in the state parliament and strengthen state institutions so BiH could make full progress on its EU bid.
It also called for deletion of all discriminatory provisions from the country's constitution.
Entity-based voting, requiring approval by the two separate administrative entities in BiH -- Federation of BiH and Republika Srpska (RS) -- of any parliamentary decision, became law in BiH with the Dayton Peace Accord, which ended the 1992-1995 conflict in the country.
Some observers say this voting method is vulnerable to misuse by either entity for blocking parliamentary decisions it dislikes.
The Dayton Accord remains the country's constitution.
The resolution stemmed from a report by the PACE co-rapporteurs for BiH, Kimmo Sassi of Finland and Mevlut Cavusoglu of Turkey.
Sassi and Cavusoglu attributed an ongoing impasse on BiH reform to the RS, alleging it has been impeding reforms and undermining state institutions.
This report and the resolution met fierce objections from the Bosnian Serb parliamentarians at the session -- Milica Markovic and Mladen Ivanic.
They demanded deletion of three parts of the resolution: the ones appealing for revocation of entity-based voting; condemning the RS National Assembly resolution calling for self-determination; and blaming the RS for undermining BiH state-level institutions.
However, the PACE deputies rejected their demands.
Just days before adoption of the CoE resolution, Bosnian Muslim BiH presidency member Haris Silajdzic spoke at the PACE in Strasbourg, France, on this topic.
He criticised entity-based voting, saying it constitutes a major obstruction to parliamentary decision-making and thus hinders the progress of BiH on its path to Europe.
Silajdzic also called for "large-scale reform of the Dayton constitution, the lack of which may endanger peace and stability in BiH and the region".
RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said RS representatives would never accept elimination of entity-based voting, because "this would mean giving up on the institutional mechanisms underlying the Dayton Peace Accord and maintaining balance in BiH".
Even if the CoE resolution is theoretically nonbinding, BiH must comply with its provisions in order for the CoE to suspend monitoring of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The country became a CoE member in 2002 but still has not met all of the membership conditions imposed on it at the time.
Mevlana: The Smiling Face of Islam
In contrast to terrorist and extremist groups such as al-Qaida and Al Haramyn, a poet-mystic who died more than 700 years ago continues to be a reminder of the gentle face of Islam.
By Fatih Baran for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 19/01/04
Amid the violence of militants and extremists, a poet-mystic who died more than 700 years ago continues to be a reminder of Islam's gentler side.
Mevlana Celaleddin Rumi, known simply as Rumi in English-speaking countries, is known for his philosophy of peace, tolerance and brotherhood among people from all religions and rituals.
His words still echo today.
A mystic poet, Rumi founded the Mevlevi sect (also known as the Whirling Dervishes or Sufism), and his poetry helped reshape Islamic thought.
He has been a strong influence in Turkey, widely considered the model for a moderate Muslim society and a bridge between the Islamic Middle East and the Christian West.
Each year in December, followers and tourists flock to Konya to pay their respects to Mevlana on the anniversary of his death.
The Sufi philosophy is based on love, attraction, the dance and peace.
Man is viewed as a microcosm, and needs to know himself to understand the macrocosm.
Sufism continues to gain respect and fondness thanks to its insistence on a direct spiritual relationship between God and the human being, transcending the strictures of traditional religions.
According to Mevlana, the human being is a triangle, composed of Spirit, Reason and Love.
The core of Sufi philosophy can be summarised by one of the poet's sayings: "Never think bad ideas.
If you do, one day they will turn on you." The Sufi leads a life of poverty, self-denial and abstinence.
"Poverty is my pride" is a common Sufi saying.
The ritual dance of his followers symbolises a release from earthly ties, liberating the soul and preparing it for union with the divine.
The dance consists of three parts, which represent the stages of knowing God, seeing and uniting with God: In the first stage, the dancers whirl three times accompanied by the mournful sound of the ney.
During the second part, they remove their coats, symbolising the release of the soul from earthly concerns.
Then they slowly begin to whirl with their right hands palm up and left hands palm down.
"What we receive from God we give to man, while we have nothing ourselves," the gesture says.
In recent years, Mevlana's philosophy -- with its mysticism, humanism, universalism, and ethical precepts -- have drawn more and more people.
The past three or four decades have witnessed a Rumi explosion throughout the Western Europe, Great Britain, and the United States.
Sufism provides a window into Islam that contrasts with the violent messages promoted by extremists.
Through the gentle philosopher-poet, many have come to see that Islam can also be a religion of tolerance and love.
Berisha nurtures Albanian-Israeli ties
Though the main focus of his trip was on business and investments, Prime Minister Sali Berisha also gave Israel support on the Palestinian issue.
By Linda Karadaku for Southeast European Times in Tirana -- 23/11/11

On a three-day trip to Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha criticised unilateral efforts by the Palestinian Authority to achieve the status of a sovereign state.
Such moves "do not advance a political solution, but sabotage the peace process", Israel's National News Agency quoted him as saying.
"The Palestinians must understand that this is not the way,'' Berisha said. ''Peace between Israel and the Palestinians must pass through direct negotiations and promises of security for the two states."
Berisha met with President Shimon Peres, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other key officials during the visit, which concluded on Wednesday (November 23rd).
He sought to boost business ties with Israel further, encouraging investors to participate in projects such as the construction of around 443 new hydropower stations.
During his meeting with Peres, he pointed to agriculture, education, tourism, energy and information technology as key fields in for fostering economic co-operation.
According to analyst Henri Cili, a professor at the European University of Tirana, the visit demonstrates the importance of Israel's influence in international relations and the growth of Israeli business dealings in Albania.
''There are at least 20 Israeli companies doing business in Albania in different fields, such as fishing, energy, services and more,'' Cili told SETimes.
He said the trip highlights Albania's role in the international arena.
''It will also have an impact on Kosovo, which Israel has not recognised yet as a state.''
Albania has taken a cautious approach to the Palestine issue, he said, describing Berisha's stance as realistic and pragmatic.
"I don't think it will have any impact on the relations with Turkey or other countries.
There are very good, traditional relations with Turkey.
The relations with Israel are very important," Cili said.
Meanwhile, Alban Bala of the Tirana-based firm Comport says strengthened economic ties can help Albania cope with the current global economic downturn.
Investments in agriculture represents a tangible benefit for Albania while also providing Israel with additional food supplies at a time when food commodities are expected to undergo significant price increases, he said.
In addition, Bala said, the real estate market in Albania -- which is likely to see rising prices as the country progresses towards EU accession -- could be strengthened by a fresh infusion of Israeli liquidity.
''At the same time Albania needs to develop its own capital market, which is of interest to cash-rich countries like Israel," Bala said.
Ties between the two countries reflect a long tradition of friendship.
The Balkan country has been widely praised for the fact that none of the Jews sheltered in Albania during World War II were handed over to the Nazis.
Then-communist Albania granted Israel formal recognition shortly after Israel declared its independence in 1948.
Diplomatic relations, however, were not established until August 1991 when the communist system collapsed.
Belgrade, Pristina resume technical dialogue
Negotiators returned to the bargaining table this week in Brussels, seven weeks after violence at a border crossing halted the process.
By Igor Jovanovic and Linda Karadaku for Southeast European Times in Belgrade and Pristina -- 23/11/11
The border crossing issue is one of the main problems that Belgrade and Pristina need to solve. [Reuters]
The delegations representing Belgrade and Pristina struck an agreement Monday (November 21st) on the mutual recognition of university diplomas.
The EU, which facilitated the talks, confirmed that following the agreement reached in principle on July 2nd, "the two parties agreed that the European University Association will be asked to certify diplomas issued by universities of each party for use by the other in connection with further education and/or public employment."
Dukagjin Pupovci, director of Kosovo Education Centre, does not believe Kosovo will benefit much from this agreement, but Presevo Valley and other Serbian citizens who studied in Kosovo, will.
"However, it depends on the Serb side: how serious it is on that and if they will accept the diplomas after they are verified from the European University Association," Pupovci told SETimes.
The sides meeting in Brussels have other items on the agenda including Pristina's presentation in regional assemblies, the civil registry, and integrated border management at the crossings between Kosovo and Serbia.
These technical negotiations were suspended on September 27th after clashes between Serbs and KFOR soldiers at the Jarinje crossing in northern Kosovo.
Belgrade and the Kosovo Serbs then announced the presence of Kosovo customs officers at the northern crossings was unacceptable and local Serbs set up barricades at the crossings in protest.
In the meantime, the dialogue with Pristina became a condition for Belgrade to obtain EU candidate status on December 9th -- when the EU Council is to make a decision on the matter.
After the talks in Brussels, the head of Belgrade's team, Borislav Stefanovic, said his delegation had done what it could to achieve agreement, but did not know whether it would be enough to greenlight Serbia's EU candidacy.
"In any case, it's up to us to do everything, not because of any deadlines or the candidacy, but rather because those problems have been present for a long time and have to be solved, and because we have an acute, burning crisis in the north of Kosovo and Metohija," Stefanovic said.
He added that no other solutions had been achieved because Pristina insisted that they reflect the statehood of Kosovo, which Serbia cannot stomach.
The head of Kosovo's delegation, Edita Tahiri, seemed to acknowledge as much, telling local media that deep conceptual differences remain between Pristina and Belgrade.
Stefanovic put it this way: "I can say we've closed this round with a concrete agreement, which was no simple feat, and it turned out to be true that we haven't accepted anything that had been pompously announced by Pristina as the recognition of a state border."
Belgrade Faculty of Political Sciences professor Predrag Simic told SETimes that the problems in Kosovo were very complicated and that the tight deadline involved poses an additional constraint.
"On the one hand, the EU Council session and the decision on Belgrade's candidacy is approaching, and on the other so is the general election in Serbia.
Working on a tight schedule creates risks for both the negotiators and the relations between Belgrade and Pristina," Simic said.
But the opposition in Serbia is using the talks to accuse authorities of acknowledging Kosovo's independence for the sake of their positions before European officials.
"If we get the candidacy, it will mean nothing to the economic and other development of the country.
If we don't get it, again it is nothing.
The final result of the talks is Serbia giving up on Kosovo and Metohija," says Democratic Party of Serbia Vice-President Slobodan Samardzic.
Kosovo's Independent Media Commission hampered
For nearly a year now, the Kosovo Council of Independent Media Commission has not been fully operating.
By Safet Kabashaj for Southeast European Times in Pristina -- 23/11/11
The Kosovo Assembly’s failure to elect new Independent Media Commission members caused a number of setbacks. [Reuters]
The Kosovo Independent Media Commission (IMC) has become nearly inoperative since December 2010 due to lack of a number of Council members.
With four members reaching the end of their two-year mandates, and the Kosovo Assembly failing to replace them, the seven-member body lacks enough personnel to function.
"Because of the Council's vacancies we are unable to manage a significant part of the sector we regulate," Naile Selimaj Krasniqi, the IMC executive director, told SETimes.
A long list of tasks awaits completion.
These include requests for new licenses and demands by cable operators for technical and operational reforms.
The commission should also play a role in amending current regulations and shaping a national strategy on digitalisation.
Tomor Halilaj runs the "Intersat" cable provider in Drenas/Gllogovac, central Kosovo.
Although he has submitted the necessary documents, his request for a license remains on hold.
Meanwhile he is at risk of being penalised for operating illegally.
"I'm desperately waiting for the license approval in order to sleep in peace," he told SETimes. "I face executive office warnings to submit documents.
And then they tell me they are unable to approve the license in absence of a complete Council."
In its 2011 Progress Report, the European Commission highlighted the problem, noting that the Kosovo Assembly has yet to complete the appointment of five IMC Council members.
In early 2011, the IMC submitted to the Assembly a list of eight candidates, out of an original 17 public nominations, for four of the open spots.
An ad hoc committee representing all the parliamentary parties shortened the list to four and submitted those names for voting.
In July, however, the assembly rejected the proposed candidates, without indicating how to move forward.
Berat Buxhala, an MP from the ruling Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK), chaired the committee.
He says his group completed its part of the task.
"What's happening with the IMC is catastrophic," he told SETimes. "Clearly it's the assembly that is to blame for the delay.
I did my job as head of the ad hoc committee and it's up to the presidency to proceed.
But it's absolutely inexcusable."
Another committee member, Alma Lama of the Vetvendosje opposition party, says that while the Assembly bears partial responsibility, the root problem is at the government level.
"There is a temptation from the government to put control on independent institutions.
Having this situation best fits them, and this is the reason why new IMC Council members are not elected," Lama told SETimes.
The Kosovo Assembly's disregard is not something new, says Filloreta Bytyqi, former head of the Council.
Since 2008, she said, the assembly has yet to elect a seventh member of the Council -- a direct duty of the legislative body.
"Delays from the assembly started in 2007, following the end of the mandate for two Council members," Bytyqi said.
The indecision, IMC officials say, comes even as the media landscape becomes increasingly complex, leaving the Council powerless in the face of mounting obligations.
In addition, decentralisation is under way, with considerable uncertainty about the final outcome.
"We are have a strategy on digitalisation, in which other stakeholders are involved, but in the absence of the Council's final approval, there is a potential risk of having it contested at the last minute," Krasniqi said, adding that her organisation's credibility in the eyes of the public is taking a hit as well.
War horrors still affect many BiH citizens
Nearly half of BiH's population is still affected by the 1992-95 war.
Experts warn the problem may get worse if left untreated.

"For years now, I have the same picture night in and night out -- a grenade falls beside the trench, an explosion and the co-fighterˈs screams, who was a mere metre away from me.
I attempt to chase the scene away, but without success.
I start to perspire, get out of the bed, light a cigarette, and so it has been for years," a 50-year-old veteran of the BiH war told SETimes.
Mehmed Alic, another war veteran, has a similar story.
He spent three years in the trenches, was shot four times and survived, despite doctors' expectations.
However, the sniper shot that killed his close friend still haunts him.
The feeling that the bullet was intended for him has been put in check since he shared his trauma with a psychologist.
Alic said it was hard to agree to see a psychologist, but he could no longer watch his family suffer because of his frequent mood swings.
"My own children avoided me.
They said that they were sick of a dad who always shouted, never smiled and only talked about the war," Alic said.
Experts note there is a constant increase of people suffering from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), even though the war ended 16 years ago.
Former military are the most numerous victims, but do not seek professional help because of the fear of discrimination.
"Many avoid seeking help from professional psychologists or psychiatrists, because they are afraid they would lose a hard obtained employment," Dragan Sajic, president of the Banja Luka Association Jedinstvo for people who suffer PTSD, told SETimes.
According to the World Health Organisation, 10% of BiH citizens, or 400,000 people, are diagnosed with PTSD.
However, associations assisting PTSD sufferers claim the correct number is more than four times that.
Doctors explain that PTSD is a normal response to abnormal life conditions.
"Ex soldiers are mostly unemployed, without a high opinion of themselves, have huge existential problems and are additionaly burdened by post-war health issues.
They are often suicidal and wish to solve [through suicide] the social injustice towards themselves and similar people," Tuzla psychologist Branka Hadzi-Ristic told SETimes.
"A person suffering from PTSD can commit suicide if they are unhappy or sick, but if they are under the constant care and take medication regularly, this should not happen," Dzubur Kulenovic of the Tuzla PTSD association Stecak told SETimes.
PTSD does not affect only war veterans, but also those who were raped or imprisoned during the war.
Obrad Bubic, representative of Republika Srpska's Association of Concentration Camp Victims, said that in the last two years nearly 200 former camp inmates sought professional help in Banja Luka.
"PTSD is transferred onto the family and consequently on society and not much is known because these people are not in focus like the war veterans.
Instead of experiencing a cozy family atmosphere, many are living in a vortex of fear which will leave a trauma upon generations to come," Professor Doctor Mevludin Hasanovic, who daily treats PTSD cases, told SETimes.
NGOs and governmental organisations bringing together war veterans from throughout BiH also work on reducing the war-related consequences on mental health and offer joint group work to all who need help.
Associations continue to bear the burden, as BiH entity budgets are not nearly sufficient to deal with the problem.
Banja Luka sociologist Ivan Shijakovic says society has given up on PTSD victims even though they can offer society a lot.
"It does not play to the BiH authorities' benefit for these individuals to find a way out from illness, so the affected are completely marginalised, left to their own devices and presented to society as weirdos who are to be avoided.
The key problem is that we still lack specialised institutions which should seriously undertake such problems," Sijakovic said.
"We are aware we looked at each other through weapons' scopes, but now have to heal our wounds ourselves.
We are offering a helping hand to identical organisations from the other entity because we are all comrades against the suffering," an FBiH veteran told SETimes.
Women candidates missing from Albanian elections
Despite promises to increase the number of women in government, the May 8th candidate lists fall short.

Though promising to respect gender equality and political representation, political parties in Albania have neglected calls to include women candidates in the May 8th local elections.
In all, only 17 out of the 768 candidates, or 3%, are women.
This comes three months after political leaders promised to respect the election law, which stipulates that 30% of candidates must be women.
"Unfortunately, we have a deep contrast between political parties' promises to raise women's presence in political decision making and the official lists of candidates," President Bamir Topi said at a meeting organised by the OSCE earlier this month on enhancing women's role in governance.
"This means that political parties still haven't transformed gender equality and representation into cultural behaviour.
Still, women are considered as unreliable candidates in such an aggressive political environment where, unfortunately, people don't always vote for the candidates' programmes and values," Topi said.
OSCE Ambassador in Tirana Eugen Wollfarth says "Improving the existing gap of gender equality in all governance structures remains a challenge. All national and international partners have a considerable responsibility to help."
Women's rights activists have differing opinions regarding who is responsible for the poor representation of women in politics.
"Certainly, it is the political leaders' fault.
They are mainly responsible.
They do not leave equal spaces for both genders," Blerina Metaj, a member of a coalition for the encouragement of women, youth and minority participation in politics, told SETimes.
UN Women National Programme co-ordinator Fiorela Shalsi blames parties and the electoral code, which doesn't have the teeth to ensure quotas are applied.
"Global statistics show that one of the main difficulties faced by women and young girls to enter politics is the lack of support from political parties themselves.
So women in Albania do not run in elections because they don't feel supported by male politicians.
They fight against discriminating party mechanisms which deny women access to important and correct information," she said.
Equal representation in decision making is a long battle and intervention must be multidimensional, Shalsi says.
But not all activists agree.
Elsa Ballauri, head of the Albanian Human Rights Group, says women are their own enemy in this regard.
"The worst harm comes from themselves.
Women are the ones who do not understand how important they are and do not know how to show their feminine personality, especially in politics.
They change their personality and become masculine as they start to collaborate with men," Ballauri told SETimes.
"Women in the family are the ones who carry on the patriarchal culture, where men should be God.
And she does this, teaching to her daughter and son, respectively, how to obey and serve and the other how to benefit and lead."
Albania showing critical signs of economic crisis
The signs are not good for the Albanian economy, and the finger-pointing is well under way.

Though the government largely refuses to acknowledge it, a number of economic indicators are showing critical signs of decline in the Albanian economy for the first quarter of 2012, following a slowdown in economic growth over the past two years.
Inflation reached 0.6% during February, according to INSTAT, marking the very limits of deflation, also confirming serious hits in both demand and consumption.
There are declines in private and public investment.
The construction and industry sectors , in particular have been among the hardest hit.
Albanians consumed less, as imports fell for a number of categories and exports fell by 21% during the two first months of the year according to INSTAT.
Remittances, one of the main sources of income in the Albanian economy from emigrants working abroad, were down by 9% last year compared to 2010.
Shkelqim Cani, former governor of Central Bank of Albania, says the government should have accepted the crisis a long time ago.
"The government did not take any measure and now we are suffering the consequences of their lack of knowledge, manipulation of reality, and their inaction," Cani told SETimes.
He predicts this year will be even more difficult.
"The debt cost was extremely high and has now reached disturbing limits." He added that with 2013 being an election year, debt levels will soar further.
Debt levels reached the maximum limit of round 60 % of GDP.
Gjergji Filipi, director of research at the Agenda Institute, a think tank, is also concerned.
"Consumers and the biggest investor in the country, the government, visibly spent less in 2010 and 2011, and data from these first months of 2012 confirmed that the country is immersed into crisis," he told SETimes.
But Sherefedin Shehu, an MP representing the ruling Democratic Party, has a different take on the matter.
A member of parliament's Committee for Economy and Finance, he told SETimes "Consumption setbacks are caused by another direction, the saving trend," suggesting saving is a psychological response to international crises.
"The crisis is not caused by Albanian factors.
Albania is only influenced by the crises; we are having growth deceleration, not a drop in economic growth," he stressed.
The Central Bank has been lowering several time the interest rate for Lek, to the actual lowest historic rate of 4. 25% in attempts to increase consumption, but the market reaction was quite weak.
"Monetary policy could have been more aggressive.
Central Bank could have realized an aggressive reduction of interest rates, within a trimester with 1 %," said former Central Bank Governor Cani.
In terms of solutions, Shehu suggests one way out of economic slowdown would be "government partnership with the private sector" to boost investment and employment.
Cani thinks reforms aimed at institutions, public administration, infrastructure, human capital, and good governance would offer a way out, as well as support for small and medium enterprises and agriculture.
Filipi says structural problems must be addressed, as opposed to "cosmetic" interventions.
He acknowledged however that "Deep reforms might be painful and unpopular, but their delay enlarges the problem."
The IMF is projecting an economic growth rate of 0.5 % for Albania this year, slightly lower than the regional level of 0.7 %.
Ever optimistic, the Albanian government projection remains 4.3 %.
EUFOR, NATO troops raid Mladic family homes
International troops raided the homes of two of Ratko Mladic's relatives in Bosnia and Herzegovina Tuesday in pursuit of clues to the war crimes fugitive's whereabouts.

International troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) searched the homes of former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic's sister and sister-in-law early Tuesday (February 10th) as part of a new action against the top war crimes fugitive's support network.
EUFOR, which led the operation, said the raids fulfilled the request of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
The goal was "to look for information which could assist the ongoing search" for the UN tribunal's most wanted indictee.
NATO troops and Republika Srpska (RS) police also took part in the raids in the towns of Vojkovic and Kasindol, near Sarajevo, where Mladic's sister, Milica Avram, and sister-in-law, Radinka Mladic, live.
International forces carried off numerous items for further examination but made no arrests.
"Both operations were co-operative, went smoothly," EUFOR spokesman Patrick O'Callaghan told Reuters on Tuesday. "Interviews will be ongoing; documentation will be looked into."
Mladic went on the run about 13 years ago, shortly after UN prosecutors issued their initial indictment accusing him of involvement in a host of war crimes committed during the 1992-1995 conflict in BiH.
Mladic allegedly committed genocide during the 43-month siege of Sarajevo and the 1995 Srebrenica massacre of up to 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys.
His pursuers think Mladic is hiding in Serbia, where authorities recently put up "wanted" posters offering a 1m-euro reward for information leading to this arrest.
EUFOR also noted on Tuesday that anyone who provides such information may be eligible for the reward of up to 3.9m euros, offered by the United States several years ago.
Full co-operation with the ICTY, including the arrest and handover of indicted war criminals, is a key condition that Balkan countries hoping to join the EU must meet to gain admission to the 27-nation bloc.
Noting the RS interior ministry's continuing co-operation in efforts to bring indicted war criminals to justice, EUFOR commended its members "for their professionalism, courage and determination to bring this issue to a close".
Raffi Gregorian, the acting high representative in BiH, also issued a statement Tuesday voicing his support for the joint operation against Mladic's support network and for future efforts towards his capture.
Referring to Mladic's defiance of numerous calls from Serbian authorities for his surrender, Gregorian said there could hardly be "a more dishonourable act for an officer than to abandon subordinates in order to save himself".
The other war crimes indictee from the Balkan conflicts still sought by the ICTY is former Croatian Serb leader Goran Hadzic.
BiH firms prepare to export fish to EU member states
Four fish producers from BiH are preparing to enter the lucrative EU fish-export market.

This spring, shoppers in EU countries might be able to find fish from Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) on their shelves.
After a long struggle to meet EU regulations, four BiH firms -- from Mostar, Blagaj, Banja Luka and Stolac -- have permits to export fish to the Union's member states.
Fish -- primarily trout -- is one of the few BiH export commodities that the country's veterinary office determined could compete in the demanding EU market.
"This export permit provides us with an opportunity to place our fish for sale in stores throughout Europe.
We already have arrangements with the countries to export fish, so deliveries could start as early as next month," says Sanel Saric, director of Norfish from Blagaj.
However, having pocketed those permits as early as last year, the four firms are still reluctant to begin actual exports.
Their managers say the prices possible under EU tax rates are too low to be profitable.
The companies object to the EU's tax-free export quota for trout, which they consider too low.
Currently, the maximum each firm can export while enjoying a tax exemption is 60 tonnes of trout per year.
They are negotiating with the Union for a higher quota before taxes kick in.
Since the EU has high hygienic standards for importing food, BiH runs a billion-euro trade deficit annually with the bloc and exports only several million euros' worth of products annually to the Union, mainly raw materials or semi-finished goods that do not require safety or quality certificates.
The BiH veterinary office, though, is trying to obtain export permits for dairy products, honey and chicken, as well as for some non-perishable red-meat products.
The country's exporters could benefit if they obtained permission to place the Conformite Europeene (CE) stamp on their goods.
CE-marked merchandise can be sold throughout the EU without requiring modification in each member state.
Local businesspeople, unaware of EU consumers' demanding standards, still believe the International Organisation for Standardisation's "ISO" certificates will suffice to placate EU shoppers and do not bother to meet CE certification requirements.
Radomir Marinkovic, co-ordinator of PHARE programmes in BiH, warns that such stubborn merchants will soon find themselves unable to sell to the CEFTA countries too, since they are quicker than BiH to adopt European rules.
He faults the government for failing to educate exporters on the importance of the CE mark.
Survey suggests Croats growing less enamoured with EU
Results of a survey by the Balkan Monitor were presented last week in Zagreb.
According to the poll, many Croats are less than enthusiastic about Union accession.

Although the majority of Croatians are satisfied with their lives, 64% believe their country is going in the wrong direction, according to the Balkan Monitor survey.
However, only 7% would go abroad for better economic prospects.
The results of the poll were presented at a conference last week in Zagreb.
The Balkan Monitor poll -- which took place in September and October 2008 -- is the largest public opinion survey to take place in the region.
It is a joint project of the European Fund for the Balkans and the Gallup Agency.
The study continually monitors the views of Balkan residents on living standards, the EU, employment opportunities, residence abroad and the performance of their governments.
At the conference Friday (February 6th), Robert Manchin, director of Gallup Europe, presented the poll results.

Poll shows 1 in 3 Macedonians fears a new conflict in region
"European institutions must take responsibility ... if they want to support the integration of Balkan states into the EU.
Also, it is evident that Croatia is a leader in regional EU integration and most of the Croats don't see themselves as [part of the] Balkans," Manchin said.
Only slightly more than 25% of those polled support Union membership.
Slightly more citizens say that EU membership is beneficial for their country than say it is harmful (29% versus 26%), but a plurality of respondents (38%) did not take sides on that question.
The survey suggests Croats are becoming less passionate about the EU.
Pollsters consider the ongoing maritime border dispute with Slovenia one of the main factors sapping respondents' enthusiasm for the Union.
Aside from presenting the results of survey research, panelists weighed in on the topic "Croatia: tired of EU reforms?" Participants included Manchin, European Fund for the Balkans member Hedvig Morvai, National Board for EU Negotiations President Vesna Pusic, philosophy professor and NGO activist Zarko Puhovski, Croatian Foreign Ministry State Secretary Davor Bozinovic and Delegation of the European Commission in Croatia head Vincent Degert.
According to Bozinovic, Croatia's positions remain unstated in only three of its EU negotiating chapters.
"These chapters concern administration of justice, fundamental rights and market competition.
I do think that we have time to complete our goals in the next period," Bozinovic said.
Commenting on the survey results, Pusic said that many times, they reflect emotion.
"It is clear that in Croatia we must have zero tolerance of organised crime.
For us, the most important is reform of the judiciary," she argued.
Puhovski doubted the warmth of Brussels' welcome for Zagreb, saying that currently Croatia cares more about entering the EU than the EU does about admitting Croatia.
Only 46% of Croats felt "welcomed by the EU", as opposed to 82% of Kosovo respondents.

The 'What ifs?' in Kosovo
There is considerable concern that anymore delays in the adoption of the Ahtisaari proposal for the monitored independence of Kosovo will provoke a unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo’s leaders.

In the past week, the EU has made increasing calls not to further delay the decision on the Kosovo status issue.
On Wednesday (July 4th), EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn cautioned that Europe would pay the price of any failure in the Kosovo status issue -- not Russia or the United States.
His call follows a statement from EU security chief Javier Solana's spokeswoman on Tuesday, saying that Brussels wants a consensus on the Kosovo status to be reached as soon as possible.
The bloc favours a quick UN Security Council adoption of a new resolution based on former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's blueprint, which calls for supervised independence.
At this point, the credibility of the entire government in Kosovo is in doubt -- in order to hold on to shred of authority, officials in the province are hinting that might have to go it alone.
They likely thought everything would be completed by the end of May, and hope surged for the adoption of the Ahtisaari plan. Now they find themselves backtracking.
In the event that there is no Security Council resolution, Kosovo’s leaders have warned that they will move on.
It remains to be seen just how much more patience the international community can encourage there.
Last month, US envoy for Kosovo Frank Wisner reiterated Washington's support for Kosovo's independence, and said sovereignty for the province must be the end goal.
However, he said, "it is important that independence be achieved as a result of a UN Security Council resolution that will set the stage for recognition, and will open the door to your acceptance into NATO and the EU."

A unilateral declaration is dangerous for a number of reasons.
First, it will split the EU and the region, thus undermining years gained in the promotion of regional stability and integration.
Balkan states need to be able to say that Europe and the United States want the Ahtisaari plan, and since we want to be part of the Euro-Atlantic clubs, what choice do we have?
In essence, a single Security Council-EU/US voice allows them to shift blame and put everyone in the clear.
In the absence of unanimity from the Security Council, the EU and the US, the question of Serbia plays a bigger role.
While Albania would be among the first to set-up shop in Pristina, the rest of the region would have to weigh things more carefully.
For example, Montenegro, which requires good relations with Serbia, would not be among the first to recognize Kosovo.
Macedonia has less to lose and cannot afford to alienate its Albanian minority.
Bulgaria and Romania would, like Montenegro, be better off at the end of the line of recognition rather than the front of it.
Bosnia would be in no position to offer recognition given the destabilizing effect it would have on its weak federation." Croatia and Slovenia could afford to sit on the fence on the whole issue.
While Great Britain has been steadfast in its support of the Ahtisaari plan, the proposal for more negotiations between Albanians and Serbs by French President Nicolas Sarkozy was not well-received in Kosovo.
Belgrade will continue to put off a final solution for Kosovo, relying on Russian help, in an attempt to convince as many countries as it can than an independent Kosovo would be a dangerous international precedent.
Consequently, Belgrade's diplomatic offensive is largely aimed at the undecided members of the Security Council -- Slovakia, South Africa and Indonesia -- but also EU members that could have problems with their own separatists as a result of the secession of Kosovo.
Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica has said that Belgrade will insist on the continuation of talks with Pristina, while also demanding that these talks not be accompanied by time limits or prearranged outcomes in the event of failure.
Belgrade has also called for a new international mediator.
At the same time, Belgrade will strive to consolidate its position in Kosovo, especially in the province's north, which has little in the way of ties with Pristina.
The main problem, however, is that only 40,000 of the 130,000 Serbs left in Kosovo live in the north, with the remainder residing in enclaves surrounded by Albanian-populated areas.
Minister for Kosovo and Metohija Slobodan Samardzic has said that Serbia intends to invest in Kosovo and do everything it can to ensure as great a presence for its institutions in the province as possible.
The external factors aside, a unilateral declaration will not do Kosovo much good.
While UNMIK could stay, a new EU mission could not start.
The UN will not find itself any more welcome, and there will be divisions within the EU.
Most importantly, the Balkans will again face instability.
Court backs proposal to allow people to elect Turkish president
Turkey's Constitutional Court, considered a bastion of the secular establishment, issued a surprise ruling Thursday.
By Ahmet Gormez for Southeast European Times in Ankara -- 06/07/07
"There will be a referendum," said Hasim Kilic, deputy head of the Constitutional Court. [Getty Images]
Turkey's Constitutional Court sided with the government on Thursday (July 5th), ruling that a referendum should be held on constitutional amendments that would allow the people -- rather than Parliament -- to elect the country's president.
Six of the court's 11 members voted against the appeal.
“There will be a referendum," court deputy head Hasim Kilic told the crowd of journalists waiting in front of the building.
The vote is likely to be held on October 21st.
The legislation was adopted by the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) when its candidate for president, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, failed to get the required two-thirds majority in parliament.
In addition to establishing a popular vote for president, it reduces the head of state's mandate from seven years to five years and sets a two-term limit.
Parliament's term is cut from five years to four.
Incumbent President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, a staunch secularist who has often clashed with the AKP, vetoed the legislation, but it was again approved by parliament.
The president, together with the main opposition Republican People's Party, then appealed an appeal with the Constitutional Court.
The ruling comes just two weeks before the July 22nd general elections.
For months, Turkey's secular establishment and the AKP, which has its roots in Islam, have been waging a bitter political battle.
Secularists have called a series of protests, drawing millions.
During these so-called "Republic meetings", participants carried Turkish flags and rallied against the AKP, shouting "Turkey is secular and will remain so".
The Constitutional Court is considered a key part of the secular establishment, leaving many surprised by the ruling.
Some media reports suggest it is a sign that the battle between secularists and the AKP is over, at least for now.
Turks will now decide whether they want to choose their head of state, or if they prefer that the elected members of parliament do so. Still uncertain is when this country of 70 million will actually get a new president.
By law, parliament members elected on July 22nd should elect a president within 30 days.
But the referendum on a popular vote for president will not be held until late October.
A bellwether of political change in Serbia?
Fresh from its victory in a local election, the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) emerges as a contender.

The local election on Sunday (April 25th) in the small town of Arandjelovac, outside of Belgrade, attracted a lot of public and media attention, with many regarding it as a gauge of the nation's political pulse.
The race for city council revealed that the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) – which was still part of the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) in the most recent general election of May 2008 -- has become a popular political option.
According to preliminary results, SNS won the most votes (26.1%), five percentage points ahead of President Boris Tadic's ruling Democratic Party (DP).
The opposition Liberal Democrats -- who regularly back government initiatives -- won a single seat.
The DP could still secure a majority in the Arandjelovac council if it forms a coalition with its partners at the state level.
The bloc of parties around the DP could expect to secure 21 seats, while the combined opposition would be left with 20.
"The election results in Arandjelovac show that the citizens voted for a pro-European government and backed the parties that comprise the ruling majority at the state level," said DP's Nada Kolundzija.
Branko Ruzic of the Socialist Party agrees.
"I expect a government to be formed in Arandjelovac that will correspond to the government at the state level." Socialists are in coalition with the Democrats in parliament.
In the Arandjelovac election, SP coalesced with two smaller parties and won 14.24% of the vote.
Progressives said they are "enjoying the victory" and it is too early to talk about possible coalitions.
"It would be better for them to talk with the strongest political party, and in Arandjelovac -- and I think in Serbia too -- that is the Serbian Progressive Party.
They should not be counting votes and looking for ways to cheat the Progressives," SNS leader Tomislav Nikolic said.
He explained that the Arandjelovac SNS chapter would decide if there is room to negotiate with the ruling Democrats.
"From what I know of the Progressives, they never say no to talks."
The Serbian Radical Party, a formidable parliamentary force in the past, will likely not be represented in the Arandjelovac assembly.
The Radicals hope a repeat vote at one polling station will allow them to clear the 5% election threshold, for which they need an additional 60 votes.
Deputy leader Dragan Todorovic told SETimes the party is still recovering from "the coup and betrayal" brought about by SNS.
"We expect our leader, Vojislav Seselj, to return from The Hague by year's end, which will additionally strengthen our political position," said Todorovic.
The opposition has been collecting citizens' signatures for calling early general elections since February.
Petar Stamatovic, a pensioner from Belgrade, believes the election in Arandjelovac is a reflection of the public's desire for a change of government in Serbia.
"The Progressive Party is now the strongest party in Serbia, and that should be proven by calling an early general election," Stamatovic told SETimes.
Many, like student Milica Zivkovic, disagree.
"I believe this government should be given a chance to complete its term in office until 2012.
I do not see what good an early election could do at this time," said Zivkovic.
Tadic has rejected all calls for early elections.
Romania, Georgia, Azerbaijan sign key energy memorandum
The new AGRI project will diversify gas transport routes to the EU market.

A few weeks ago, Romania, Georgia and Azerbaijan signed a memorandum in Bucharest that lays the basis for a major project that will ensure transport of Caspian gas to the EU market.
Dubbed the AGRI project (Azerbaijan Georgia Romania Interconnection), it aims to diversify transit routes while reducing dependence on Russian gas.
The memorandum was signed by Adriean Videanu, Romania's minister of Economy, Trade and Business Environment; Azeri Minister of Industry and Energy Natig Aliyev and Georgia's Minister of Energy Alexander Khetaguri.
The signing of the memorandum came after a year of trilateral negotiations.
The signatories agreed on founding a project company based in Bucharest that will oversee a feasibility study, the last step to be undertaken before construction begins.
The Azeri gas will move through Georgia and Romania before being delivered to EU consumers.
According to the memorandum, the gas will be first transported to the Kulevi harbour on the coast of the Georgian Black Sea.
There, it will be liquefied before being shipped to the Romanian port of Constanta and distributed on the European market through the national pipeline system.
"AGRI won't replace Nabucco, it is complementary to Nabucco," said Videanu. "Romania will insist that AGRI is placed on EU's priority list of energy corridors."
Videanu explained that AGRI -- currently assessed at 2 billion to 4 billion euros -- is the fastest and most effective gas transport project under construction along Europe's southern corridor.
He added the project could be finalised before the Nabucco because there are no political barriers for its completion.
Videanu's Azeri counterpart termed the signing of the memorandum a "historic event".
"It is a project important to all the states around the Black Sea," said Aliyev.
Romanian President Traian Basescu characterised the signing as "a major step for each of the three countries equally, but also for the EU".
According to the Romanian news agency Mediafax, AGRI's capacity may be about 7 billion cubic meters of gas per year, about 2 billion of which is for domestic consumption in Romania.
Last year, Azerbaijan produced 23.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas with plans to increase it to 28.5 billion.
Aliyev said that Azerbaijan's gas reserves are 2,200 billion cubic meters.
Romania annually consumes around 16 billion cubic meters of gas, of which 11 billion is produced domestically.
Greek debt crisis travels across Europe
Europe's debt crisis deepened on Wednesday when Spain became the third eurozone member to have its credit rating downgraded.
Throughout the EU, anxiety is palpable.

While European and IMF experts scramble to forge a deal with Athens -- and top EU officials continue to voice their commitment to helping Greece avoid default -- fear is spreading that the debt crisis will spread as well.
The Standard & Poor' (S&P) credit rating agency cut Spain's long-term sovereign status from "AA+" to "AA" on Wednesday (April 28th) while suggesting that a further downgrade of Europe's fourth largest economy is possible.
The announcement came a day after the agency downgraded Portugal and reduced Greece's long and short-term debt to junk status.
"Contagion has already happened," Bloomberg news agency quoted OECD head Angel Gurria as saying Wednesday.
"This is like Ebola [virus]. When you realise you have it, you have to cut your leg off in order to survive."
European Council President Herman Van Rompuy has called an emergency summit of eurozone leaders -- slated to be held around May 10th -- to discuss the debt crisis.
The downgrading of three members of the 16-nation eurozone in less than two days exacerbated investors' concerns about the European debt crisis as EU policy makers faced mounting pressure to approve a huge bailout package for Greece.
Under a deal reached in Brussels last month, Greece would be able to get bilateral loans from other eurozone states and financial assistance from the IMF as a last resort, in the event it is unable to get loans in the financial markets.
Greece needs to raise 8 billion euros to repay bonds maturing on May 19th.
But Prime Minister George Papandreou complained on Wednesday that the interest rates his country is being asked to pay "are beyond any logic".
He urged the EU to "prevent a fire" from engulfing the European and world economy.
With eurozone financial institutions -- particularly those in Germany and France -- said to be holding up to 70% of Greek debt, European officials are keen to avert a Greek default.
Such fears and shaken confidence in the eurozone have battered the euro, which fell to a year low Wednesday of $1.3131.
"There is no doubt over the determination of the eurozone, of the European Central Bank (ECB), the IMF and the European Union to ensure the stability of Greece and therefore the stability of our currency," French Budget Minister Francois Baroin said on Thursday.
After talks with IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn and ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet in Berlin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for speeding up the ongoing rescue effort for Athens.
"Negotiations [in Athens] with the Greek government, the European Commission and the IMF need to be accelerated," she said. "We hope they can be wrapped up in the coming days and on the basis of this, Germany will make its decisions" about the scope of its contribution to the aid package.
The German public is staunchly opposed to any bailout for Greece.
Ahead of crucial May 9th regional elections in the North Rhine-Westphalia state, Merkel stressed that Greece will have to present a detailed budget savings plan for 2011 and 2012 to qualify for bilateral loans.
According to reports Wednesday, under the deal that is currently being discussed, Greece would get as much as 120 billion euros in aid from the eurozone and the IMF over three years.
Of that, up to 45 billion euros would be provided to Athens this year.
Germany, Europe's largest economy, would contribute about a fifth of the assistance, according to the AP.
EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn voiced confidence Thursday that the talks will be wrapped up "in the next days," and promised that the details of the rescue package would be made available soon.
The aid package under discussion "will give Greece sufficient breathing space from pressures of financial markets", Rehn told reporters in Brussels. "I want to underline that this is done not only because of Greece, but for every euro member state and its citizens to safeguard financial stability in Europe and globally."
BiH embraces adventure tourism
Bosnians take advantage of international media exposure regarding opportunities for adventure tourism to advance their economy and improve the country's image.

Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is being recognized internationally as the world's top destination for adventure tourism and thousands of skiers, rafters, mountaineers and mountain bikers are coming to visit.
Travel guide publisher Lonely Planet, French Geo magazine, and most recently, National Geographic, are only some of the media that have recommended BiH to adventure-seekers.
Dutchman Thierry Joubert exemplifies many who discover BiH, calling it "heaven on earth".
Joubert has taken residence there and established the Adventurous Tourism Association to advocate BiH tourism.
"BiH's wealth is its forests and tourists want to experience them just as they want to raft on the rivers Tara, Neretva, Una. ...
There are also the national parks Sutjeska, Vranica, Bjelashnica, the mountain villages Lukomir and Umoljan as well as a multitude of mountain tracks," Joubert said.
"Finally, something positive in the word about our country," says Safet Husic, mindful of BiH's unfortunate past reputation as a war-torn country.
But, Husic also voiced the concern there is a need "to learn to take care of BiH's natural beauty and not turn it into wild waste dumps."
Dragan Tesic argues that citizens are aware of BiH's tourist potential but say the government is not doing enough.

"I know the beauty of our mountains firsthand and the thing which surprises me the most is the negligence of our politicians to recognize the natural resources that we have.
Perhaps they would be aware of our 'heaven on earth' if they did not travel across the Europe and famous winter resorts," Tesic said.
Others are skeptical about adventure tourism, given concerns for tourist safety and alleged lacking infrastructure.
"It is definitely an adventure," said Ivan. "You never know whether or not you are going to come across minefields while wandering in those abandoned trails."
BiH has intensified efforts to clear minefields, a fact prompting Zdravko Vasilic to ask whether minefields are still a problem.
"Recently, one Slovenian died, I think it was at Mount Jahorina," recalled Vasilic.
Tourists however, praise the country's efforts to advance this sector.
"Bosnia has done a wonderful job in restoring its infrastructure.
It is deserving congratulations.
The country has some of the most beautiful arts and culture I have seen in Europe.
I went to Bosnia about four years ago and loved it.
Ah, yes the food is tasty!" Neil Pryde said.
UN Security Council Holds Special Session on Kosovo
All 15 members of the UN Security Council condemned a shooting last week, which left two Kosovo Serb youths dead and four injured.
(Independent - 19/08/03; UN, Serbian Government, AP, Reuters, AFP, Radio B92, RFE/RL - 18/08/03)
The UN Security Council met in a special open session on Monday (18 August) to discuss the situation in Kosovo.
All 15 members condemned last week's shooting, which killed two young Kosovo Serbs dead and injured four.
Participants voiced concern that violent incidents were continuing in the province and insisted that extremists must not be allowed to undermine Kosovo's future.
Serbia-Montenegro requested the meeting following the 13 August attack near the western town of Gorazdevac.
Speaking on behalf of his government, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Nebojsa Covic, who also heads the Kosovo Co-ordination Council, welcomed UNMIK's swift appointment of an international prosecutor to bring the perpetrators to justice.
He promised Belgrade's full support during the process.
Covic said the only reason an attack on young swimmers had taken place was because they were Serbs.
It was meant, he said, to show Serbs that they should leave, as there is no chance for a multiethnic society in Kosovo.
He called for vigorous and decisive measures to ensure that standards are fulfilled, including full implementation of Security Council Resolution 1244.
Welcoming statements by Serbia-Montenegro leaders that the country would remain committed to the peace process, US Ambassador James Cunningham said that Kosovo Albanian leaders had also condemned the shooting. As did other Security Council participants, the US representative stressed that the criminal acts must be punished and perpetrators must be brought to justice, and that there was a need to redouble the efforts to fully implement Resolution 1244.
Reiterating their adherence to the concept of "standards before status", speakers said the issue of Kosovo's status could not be discussed before agreed-on benchmarks, including dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina, were met.
Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic has said the latest spate of violence would delay the start of direct talks.
In related news, UN police spokesman Derek Chappell confirmed that a new attack took place on a Serb village in the Gorazdevac area on Sunday.
Gunmen sprayed the village with bullets in what he described as an "intimidation attempt".
There were reports that the attack had again targeted children.
Chappell also said that several cars carrying ethnic Albanians were stoned, and some of their inhabitants beaten, in apparent revenge attacks.
In Belgrade, meanwhile, a Serb man died in hospital one week after he was allegedly attacked by two gunmen while fishing near Pristina.
Police Replace the Army on Macedonian Borders
Macedonian police have taken over guarding the border with Greece and will gradually replace the Army on the borders with Bulgaria, Albania and Serbia-Montenegro by late 2005.
The newly established border police will eventually include 3,200 members.

Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi announced that a commission would be assigned to resolve the border issue with Macedonia. [AFP]
Earlier this month, Macedonian police took over security control of the country's border with Greece from the army.
The move is part of an effort to bring Macedonia into line with EU and NATO standards.
About 650 members of the newly established Border Police will police the 250km-long southern border.
At the handover ceremony, Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski said Macedonia was one of the last countries in Europe whose borders were guarded by soldiers rather than police officers.
Parliament Speaker Ljupco Jordanovski described the new service as a pillar of national security, and noted that its establishment is one of the terms of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
According to Macedonian Army spokesman Zoran Sekulovski, police plan to secure the entire border by the end of 2005.
By late this year, the police will take over policing of the eastern border with Bulgaria, and early next year they will take charge of the western border with Albania.
The army will hand over the northern border with Serbia-Montenegro by the end of 2005.
Border police are being trained at the Police Academy in Skopje.
Interior ministry sources say the force will eventually have 3,200 trained police officers, some of whom will be army professionals receiving instruction in police action.
About 7m euros will be spent on new information systems, communication equipment and vehicles.
The border with Serbia-Montenegro is seen as the most challenging.
Although Skopje and Belgrade have signed an agreement and the border is internationally recognised, it has yet to be marked off.
In addition, Kosovo officials have disputed a segment of the province's border with Macedonia.
According to Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi, the border is correct except for a stretch near the village of Debalde.
During a recent visit to Skopje, Rexhepi announced that a commission would be established to resolve the matter.
"I can say that both sides are disposed to this because we started from the premise that we should live together as neighbours," Rexhepi said.
The EU has granted 1m euros to aid in the demarcation of the Macedonia-Kosovo border.
Pensioners Face Similar Problems in BiH, Croatia, Serbia
Pensioners demonstrate peacefully in Banja Luka against pensions they say are too little and too late. [AFP] Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Croatia and Serbia may be at different places on the road to EU-type stability, but all three countries are struggling to pay pensions to their elderly populations.
By Beth Kampschror for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 17/03/03
Scratching an existence out of an $83 monthly pension is something that Semsa Trnka is familiar with.
Finding money to buy food doesn't come easily after she pays her telephone and electricity bills. Trnka, 72, a tiny, wren-like woman with fluffy brownish hair and sharp dark eyes, said that it doesn't help matters that she has to buy medicine for her bad heart.
"Nothing's free, everything's 5 or 10 [DM] apiece," she said, sipping coffee in her house in Sarajevo's hilly Breka neighbourhood.
She said that one of her sons, who's a writer, tries to help her out when he sells some books. Other than that, she's on her own.
"It's not just me, everyone in this neighbourhood is a pensioner," she said.
"Everyone here is suffering.
Some don't even have money to buy milk."
Trnka's troubles are familiar not just to the people in her neighbourhood, but also to the pensioners in the next-door countries of Serbia-Montenegro and Croatia.
All of them expected Yugoslavia -- which distributed kingly pensions on par with salaries every month -- to take care of them.
But then Yugoslavia went to pieces.
Pensioners are now residents of new countries that are all struggling to deal with their elderly populations.
Croatia is in relatively good shape following pension reform that began in 1995, according to Zoran Anusic, a pensions expert at the World Bank in Zagreb.
He said that Croatia is now in "fine-tuning mode" for its pension system and could be a model for the other new states.
Pensioners receive an average of $235 every month.
That may not be much, but the payments are on time.
Reform has worked -- the collection rate for companies paying into the pension fund is about 90 per cent.
Croatia's approach to pension reform contrasts starkly with the situation in Serbia, which Sonja Biserko of the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights called a "jungle".
"There's no system, there are no relevant laws, there's no judicial reform," she said.
Serbians are so anxious to work (the country's unemployment rate is about 40 per cent) that they'll take jobs in "grey economy" companies that don't pay taxes, health care or pension contributions.
As of November, Serbian pensioners were getting an average of $110.
Expectations were high in Serbia after the fall of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic more than two years ago, but the coalition government that replaced him did so on more of an anti-Milosevic platform than one of pro-social reform.
Biserko said it would be up to the foreign donors that support Serbia's budget to pressure the government.
"This is not a government that's prepared for such a difficult task," she said. "[Pension reform] is really something that Westerners must insist on."
In Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), the two entities, not the state, are responsible for pensions.
Payments in the comparatively wealthy Federation are higher, averaging $106.
But Republika Srpska (RS) pensioners can expect only an average of $66.
Even those miserable payments have only started being paid on time this year.
"[Pensions] aren't even that low in Albania," RS Pensioners' Association President Rade Rakulj told Radio Free Europe in December.
Pensions in the RS, he said, only average about 35 per cent of the average salary, whereas in Croatia and Serbia the figure is about 50 per cent.
The small pensions paid by both BiH entities is partly a side effect of reforms, said Office of the High Representative spokesperson Kevin Sullivan.
"They're not allowed to take money from Peter to pay Paul," he said of the entity pension funds, which are working under IMF rules not to pay out more than they receive in.
He also said that the funds have to pay pensions to thousands of people who worked for companies that no longer exist.
Heavy industry and mining companies were a major part of BiH's economy before they were destroyed in the 1992-1995 war.
Companies that do still exist often don't pay contributions to the pension funds.
Federation fund Deputy Director Bakir Mujic told Radio Free Europe that at least 3,000 companies were not paying contributions.
The only thing pensioners can do -- besides stand in Western Union lines at the bank for money from their family members abroad -- is protest, which happens occasionally in both entities.
Jozo Ljiljanic of the Federation Pensioners' Association told RFE that the situation is desperate, because 70 per cent of pensioners receive less than 200 convertible marks per month.
"It really can't go on like this, because pensioners are on the fringes of biological existence," he said. "It's totally unacceptable to us that pensioners are treated as the deadwood of this society."
Refugee returns across entity lines further complicate the situation.
Reporter magazine recently described the case of Djoko Klickovic, who had collected his pension from Serb authorities after leaving Sarajevo in 1992.
When he returned to his apartment in 2001, Federation authorities refused to pay his pension.
Returnee pensioners can claim pensions in the other entity -- on paper.
Sketchy application on the ground, however, is an economic obstacle to their return.
The two-fund system also affects younger peoples' decision to return to one or the other entity, for fear they might lose the pension contributions they've already paid into the other entity's fund.
The International Crisis Group recently suggested moving the responsibility for pensions to the state level to alleviate some of the problems.
Pensioners could return home without worrying about who will pay their pensions.
One state-level fund would also be less expensive, more transparent and easier to monitor for contributions than two entity funds.
And more contributions might mean a few more convertible marks every month for pensioners like Semsa Trnka.
"Everyone says, 'it'll be better, it'll be better'," she said.
"But who knows when it'll be better, or what will be better?"
Greek Cypriot Minister: New Cyprus Talks Likely to Begin in April
Consultations on a new Cyprus peace initiative could begin soon, with the goal of restarting negotiations based on the reunification plan sponsored by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan.
Officials caution, however, that adequate preparations must be made to avoid another failure.
(FT, Turkish Daily News - 31/03/05; Reuters, NTV MSNBC, Dunya, Cyprus News Agency, EurActiv, EUobserver - 30/03/05; AFP, Athens News Agency, Cyprus News Agency - 29/03/05)
"We have to ensure a successful conclusion, a solution to the Cyprus problem and not have a crisis on our hands because of the lack of a good negotiating framework," said Greek Cypriot Foreign Minister George Iacovou. [AFP]
UN-brokered consultations on a new Cyprus peace initiative are likely to kick off after the Turkish Cypriot presidential election on 17 April, Greek Cypriot Foreign Minister George Iacovou said Wednesday (30 March).
The discussions, expected to last several weeks or months, would set the stage for restarting negotiations on reuniting the divided island.
"Proximity talks would be likely, in the initial stages. It could also possibly be in April," Reuters quoted Iacovou as saying in an interview with Cyprus radio on Wednesday.
"We have to ensure a successful conclusion, a solution to the Cyprus problem and not have a crisis on our hands because of the lack of a good negotiating framework."
In the proximity talks -- an approach that has been applied in previous Cyprus peace initiatives -- a UN-appointed mediator shuttles between the Turkish Cypriots in the north and the Greek Cypriots in the south.
There are no direct consultations between the two sides.
The latest effort to resolve the Cyprus issue on the basis of a UN peace plan ended in failure in April 2004, when the Greek Cypriots overwhelmingly rejected the proposed deal.
Although the majority of Turkish Cypriots approved the UN plan, only the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot part of the Mediterranean island joined the EU on 1 May.
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has made clear that he would not initiate a new round of negotiations if the chances for reaching an agreement were slim.
This week, he met with Greek Foreign Minister Petros Molyviatis, who also called for the revival of Cyprus reunification efforts.
Both officials acknowledged the need for serious preparations.
"We should make sure that this time there is no failure. We cannot afford another failure," Molyviatis said following a meeting with Annan in New York on Monday.
Annan's spokesman Fred Eckhard said Tuesday that the UN chief wants to see -- in writing -- the Greek Cypriots' critique of the plan they rejected last year.
"He is waiting to receive this.
He wants to make sure that they are on firm ground before restarting negotiations," the AFP quoted the spokesman as saying. "He doesn't want another failure."
Putin, in Belgrade, talks energy and investments
Russia's prime minister receives a warm welcome during his visit.
But are hopes of assistance from Moscow too high?
By Bojana Milovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 24/03/11

That the Serbian public has high expectations from Moscow was demonstrated this week by the lavish welcome given Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
He arrived in Belgrade on Wednesday (March 23rd) to meet with President Boris Tadic and other top officials.
Hundreds of people gathered outside the Palace of Serbia, where the talks were being held, to greet the Russian leader.
When Putin showed up at a football game between two youth clubs --Belgrade's Red Star and Moscow's Zenit -- local fans began singing the Russian song "Kalinka" and unfurled banners with messages of welcome.
The game ended with a highly diplomatic score, 1:1.
In recent years, Russia's influence has been buoyed by major investments, such as Gazprom Neft's purchase of a majority share in the oil company NIS, and by plans for the South Stream gas pipeline to run through Serbia.
Prospects for investment and economic co-operation were high on the agenda during Putin's visit as well.
He confirmed that Russian companies will help Serbia build railroads.
Serbian construction workers, meanwhile, will take part in preparations for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi and the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
"We would like to utilise the great experience of our Serbian partners in the construction of tourist facilities," Putin said.
Tadic said he received assurances that the South Stream project would be implemented in the coming years. The pipeline, he said, is of great importance for the entire European continent.
He went on to say that Gazprom's investment in NIS yielded results, as the company is generating profits. Both countries are interested in the participation of NIS in regional markets, Tadic said, adding that he expects future investments in the Pancevo oil refinery.
He expressed Serbia's gratitude to Russia for providing a $200m loan to help Serbia cope with the global economic crisis, and for backing Belgrade on the Kosovo issue.
According to political analyst Vladimir Goati, however, the public should not overestimate Moscow's ability to help the Serbian economy.
Russia, he said, "is dealing with its own problems; hence one should not expect it -- despite its desire -- to invest in Serbia more than it has been doing so far," he told SETimes.
The Russian leadership sometimes overestimates its economic and diplomatic capabilities, fuelling high expectations, he added.
Energy remains the driving force in the Belgrade-Moscow relationship regardless of any other issues that are put on the table, Goati said.
"It is necessary for Serbia to have the South Stream pipeline pass through its territory and that is where, in my opinion, the importance of Putin's visit lies," he said.
EU integration was also a key topic of discussion during the visit.
The Russian leader insisted that Moscow is not worried about Serbia's ambitions to join the bloc.
"We will carefully monitor and work together on preventing European integration from damaging Russian-Serbian relations," he said.
Tadic replied that although Serbia is determined to attain membership, it also has a "strategic interest in co-operating with Russia".
"I see no way of the EU resolving its energy issues without partnership with Russia," Tadic said.
"Serbia will be part of that arrangement too."
Macedonia to professionalise public administration
Making Macedonia's public institutions is "an exceptionally important issue for us", says Information Technology and Administration Minister Ivo Ivanovski in an interview with SETimes.
By Misko Taleski for Southeast European Times in Skopje – 24/03/11

Macedonia's newly formed Information Technology and Administration Ministry is responsible for professionalising the country's public administration and bringing it up to EU standards.
Ivo Ivanovski, who heads up the ministry, spoke to SETimes about the upcoming reforms and their importance to Macedonia's EU integration.
SETimes: What are the main changes brought about by the new law on public administration?
Ivo Ivanovski: The law will enter into force in April, and all public institutions must submit data within three months on the number of employees, gender, equitable employment and employee profession.
In short, we are creating a public institutions registry.
Unlike past governments in Macedonia, this government will conduct an analysis of public institutions to make the administration more efficient.
It is an exceptionally important issue for us and will be a central part of the government's 2011 activities to be able to satisfy citizens' demands.
SETimes: What institutional changes will take place?
Ivanovski: We moved many employees from other ministries to the new ministry of IT and administration which now numbers 144.
It will carry out a significant number and quality of reforms more quickly.
Regarding efficiency, in the next three to four years, the ministry will initiate many projects to completely transform the concept of how public employees work.
Our goal is to satisfy the requirements of the citizens and the business community: a timely response by public institutions to every question or request, and a more skilled work performance.
Also, we will introduce IT technologies and practice for public employees, which will make their work easier and more efficient as well.
Citizens will get most services electronically, saving time and travel.
We live in an era of technological interconnectedness and must keep up with the advances.
SETimes: Given claims that the public administration is politicised, how can it be depoliticised?
Ivanovski: The main goal of the reforms in the administration is depoliticisation.
Macedonia must have a skilled and responsible administration able to deal with political and economic challenges ahead.
The new law sets much higher criteria for hiring public employees.
We want to prevent politics from interfering with public administration and stand ready to implement the criteria which are part of the European Community's values and are preconditions for membership.
SETimes: To what extent did the government tap international experience as well as contacts abroad regarding reforms in public administration?
Ivanovski: Surely international experiences and contacts helped us in finding applicable solutions through the new law.
For example, last year we examined closely the IT reforms by the Estonian government which helped professionalise and make the work of public servants more efficient.
We examined the possibilities for implementing their best practices in Macedonia.
Those are processes which will allow for greater transparency as well.
Estonia achieved them at the highest level by excluding or reducing the number of people in decision-making.
In addition, we examined the US and other European countries' best practices.
SETimes: How can public servants advance under the new system and at the same time have increased responsibilities?
Ivanovski: Under the new law, public employees will be able to advance much more quickly, but they must go through a newly introduced system of a "trial year" on the job.
In addition to the standard tests, we are also introducing psychological and personal integrity tests.
The candidate's education and grade average are already factored in.
We also have not made it easier to fire employees.
If a public worker is removed from his position because of failure to perform his work, the Agency for Administration will act as a secondary commission and will determine whether, based on the person's complaint, he can return to work.
The procedure's timeframe -- which used to be very drawn out -- will be significantly reduced.
A commission will be formed which will determine based on relevant evidence whether the employee acted responsibly on the job, and the Agency may -- or may not -- bring the civil servant back to the job in a much shorter time.
Turkey-EU visas: time is sensitive
Some say onerous visa procedures could force them to look for opportunities beyond the EU.
By Alakbar Raufoglu for Southeast European Times -- 24/03/11
Turkish citizens say getting a visa can take months. [Reuters]
Nihat Ozgun missed several business trips to EU countries last year, but not through negligence on his part.
Rather, he says, his required visa repeatedly failed to come through in time.
"Each time we applied to the [EU] consulates they somehow forgot, or failed to finish the visa processing in time," he told SETimes, calling the procedure "broken and unjust".
The 46-year-old project manager at the Samsun-based IT Company, on the Black Sea north coast of Turkey, says that when he and his colleagues attempted to meet with their European partners, they had to wait more than two months for their visas to be approved.
"It is time the [EU and Turkish] governments set aside all their political interests and think about common citizens," he said.
"It is absurd that citizens of Serbia, Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina all enjoy visa-free travel to Europe, whereas Turkish businessmen are often denied visas to attend trade fairs, and students cannot study here."
After nearly five decades of waiting in Europe's ante-room, Turkish businessmen are getting impatient.
Last month, EU interior ministers agreed to start a dialogue with Ankara on the issue, but there's a hitch: Austria, Cyprus, France, Greece, Germany and The Netherlands all say they oppose lifting visa requirements for Turkish citizens.
Ankara, meanwhile, insists it will not sign a readmission agreement until those requirements are removed.
"Turkey in no way accepts different treatment," the foreign ministry said in a statement.
According to Ulas Doga Eralp, an assistant professor at Sabancı University, the impasse is symptomatic of an "overall negative stance towards Turkey".
"At a time when Turkish public opinion is questioning the viability of the EU as a partner, the bloc's interior ministers' insistence on maintaining the unfair visa regulations could not have come at a more inconvenient timing," he said.
The current policy hinders trade relations while restricting freedom of travel for citizens of a candidate country, he said.
Meanwhile, the EU collects billions of euros annually in visa fees.
Alexander Burgin, assistant professor at Izmir University of Economics, takes an optimistic view.
"Turkey is now in the comfortable situation to demand talks about visa liberalisation because it can refer to the link between a readmission agreement and visa liberalisation talks that the EU made in recent readmission agreements with third countries," he told SETimes.
Visa waivers are likely for some groups, such as students and researchers, and multiple-entry visas could be provided for business executives, he said.
And even if quick progress towards visa liberalisation cannot be expected, Burgin said, it is significant that the European Commission was able to secure the political backing for initiating a dialogue. That, he added, could bring about a new dynamic in the stalled EU accession talks.
For Ozgun, however, time is of the essence.
"If we wait for more than a year I might lose my partners in Europe and our company will have to switch to local markets or Asia," he said.
Bulgaria Developing New National Security Strategy
Bulgaria is preparing a new National Security Strategy, which would likely be adopted by June.
An important advisory body chaired by the country's president discussed the draft paper Tuesday and made some recommendations.

President Georgi Parvanov has urged political forces in Bulgaria to reach a consensus on the country's new national security strategy. [AFP]
Bulgaria's Consultative Council for National Security (CCNS) met on Tuesday (15 February) to discuss a draft security strategy paper which is expected to be adopted by parliament before its four-year mandate ends in June.
The new National Security Strategy (NSS) will replace the one in effect since 1998 and will determine the country's policies in a number of key areas in the next decade.
The Council assessed the proposed strategy in positive terms, President Georgi Parvanov, who chairs the CCNS, was quoted as saying after Tuesday's meeting.
Generally, the draft strategy for security is in line with a number of NATO and EU documents and shows the possibilities for an integrated national response to the risks, threats and challenges of the new century, the CCNS said in a statement.
The Council is an advisory body composed of key government ministers and officials, security agency chiefs, military commanders and the leaders of parties represented in parliament.
However, Parvanov and other participants in the meeting also highlighted certain deficiencies and omissions in the draft, approved by the government on 6 January, that need to be addressed before it is put to the vote.
The Council also agreed that the final NSS document should focus more strongly on issues of significant public interest and concern, including demographics, ethnic issues, the integration of minority communities and the prevention of intolerance and xenophobia.
According to the CCNS, the strategy should "pay more attention to counteracting conventional crime that threatens ordinary people, their lives, health and property".
The body also cited the need for bridging the economic and digital divide between Bulgaria and the industrial countries, raising the standard of living, halting "brain drain" and modernising science and education.
Once approved, the document will serve as a basis for legislation and policies in the domain of national security, including Bulgaria's military doctrine and participation in military operations abroad, and other important areas. Parvanov urged politicians to reach political consensus.
"This is necessary as such a document will be implemented by more than one future cabinet," Parvanov said.
Opposition Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) leader Nadezhda Mihailova agreed with Parvanov and said her party plans to call a meeting of experts of different political parties to discuss the document.
The adoption of the Bulgarian security strategy should be based on consensus, because only on this condition could it ensure that the country's national interests as a NATO member and future EU member will be protected, she said.
Arrests increase on the border as Serbia's election nears
The Serb gendarmerie arrested two Kosovo police officers on Saturday, the same day that four Serbian police officers arrested in February by Kosovo police were released.

Tensions on the Kosovo-Serbia border are increasing as Serbia's May 6th election approaches.
Two Kosovo policemen, Shukri Binaku and Sami Beqiri, were arrested on Saturday (March 31st) by the Serb gendarmerie at the Merdare border crossing.
Serbian Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said "the incursion of the two KPS [Kosovo Police] members constituted a drastic violation of the Military Technical Agreement signed in Kumanovo in 1999," B92 reported.
"What are they doing in the territory of central Serbia and what agreement does that fall under?" Dacic asked, adding that "anyone who dared to violate the Kumanovo Military Technical Agreement this way would be arrested."
The officers were released to the custody of EULEX officials on Monday, April 2nd, and taken to Kosovo.
Pristina said the officers had been patrolling in the area of responsibility of Kosovo police.
"This insidious and organised act of the Serb gendarmerie testifies once again the orientation and the aggressive mentality of the Serb state towards the republic of Kosovo," the Kosovo Interior Ministry said in a statement.
Kosovo President Atifete Jahjaga considered the arrests "attack on the institutional and territorial integrity of the Republic of Kosovo."
The arrests were the latest in a series of detainments at the border that had Dacic warning of "reciprocal measures."
Kosovo police arrested four Serbs on March 28th for holding Serbian election material and voters lists.
Arber Beka, Kosovo Police spokesperson, told SETimes that the arrests were related to the attempts of Serbia to hold elections in Kosovo.
Serbia has scheduled municipal and parliamentary elections on May 6th and has said it will include areas of northern Kosovo in the count.
Pristina has strongly objected and said it would use force, if needed, to stop the election in its borders.
"We have an operative order [clarifying] what police should undertake in such cases," Beka said.
Kosovo Police also sequestered propaganda material of an alleged extremist organisation March 27th in Vushtri.
Police said they found newspapers named Srpske Novine in a car with five Serbs.
Police found 38 of the newspapers, which were published in Toronto by The Cetnic Movement of Ravna Gora (Cetnicki Ravno Gorski Pokret).
One of the five Serbs was held in detention for 48 hours, for inciting hatred and division.
She was released, but the investigation continues.
Also on March 28th, two Kosovo Albanians, including Hasan Abazi -- chairman of the Metallurgy Trade Union -- were arrested on espionage and drug trafficking charges, B92 reported.
Human Rights Watch demanded their release on Saturday, and suggested Kosovo should facilitate an urgent review by an EU Kosovo mission judge of the charges and house arrest of the four Serbs, the organisation added.
"The reciprocal measures are not in Serbia's interests and the Serbian police do not wish to do this.
But … this type of situation can obviously no longer happen without reciprocal measures.
If somebody wishes to compete in arrests, we have our answer," Dacic said.
On February 26th, five Serbs -- including four police officers -- were arrested in Kosovo, accused of disrupting the judicial order.
They were detained for 30 days.
Referring to Kosovo-Serbia dialogue and agreements reached so far, Dacic questioned the agreement on the freedom of movement "if Serbs can be arrested every day."
"These are open provocations and I can no longer prevent the police from blocking Koncul.
It will be seen in the coming days what is looks like when reciprocal measures are being introduced," Dacic warned.
Fisnik Rexhepi, political adviser to the Kosovo interior minister, said the arrest of citizens by Serbian Police is completely political and contrary to the agreement on the freedom of movement.
"The citizens of Kosovo, making use of the provisions of the agreement reached in Brussels, have intended to transit through the territory of Serbia, not exercising any official activity in this state.
This is the difference between the legal actions of Kosovo Police and the political and anti-European actions of the Serb state," Rexhepi told SETimes.
EU facilitator Robert Cooper said that political problems should be resolved through dialogue and negotiations, rather than through a selective law implementation, B92 reported.
"The EU expects both sides to fulfill the commitments they have assumed during the dialogue," he said.
Incumbent Parvanov expected to win Bulgarian presidential election
Most Bulgarians expect incumbent Georgi Parvanov to win a second term in the October 22nd presidential election.
But polls suggest the vote may go to a runoff due to low turnout.

Seven candidates are hoping to win Bulgaria's presidential election on October 22nd.
Due to an expected low turnout, however, the race is likely to be decided in a runoff a week later.
By law, at least half of the country's eligible voters of some 6.4 million must participate in the first round of the presidential poll for the person who has garnered more than 50% of voter support to win outright victory.
That is unlikely to happen, Tsvetozar Tomov, a sociologist at the Skala polling agency, said on Monday (October 9th).
A survey conducted by AFIS polling agency indicated that the number of people who intend to vote has declined by 9% since the campaign began, while the number of those saying they will definitely stay home has increased.
Two weeks before the vote, incumbent Georgi Parvanov remains the clear frontrunner in the race and -- whether they plan to vote or not -- 88% of the eligible voters believe he will win a second five-year term this month, AFIS reported.
While polls show Parvanov's support ebbing slightly in recent days, he is still well ahead of his challengers.
Between 35% and 37% of Bulgarians are expected to vote for him -- a figure that could translate into nearly 70% of voter support.
Three of the other six contenders, however, may stand a chance to finish second and proceed to the runoff on October 29th.
Volen Siderov, the leader of the ultranationalist Attack party, has the support of around 9% of all eligible voters, or about 19% of those likely to go to the polls on the 22nd.
Constitutional Court head Nedelcho Beronov, 78, is third in the opinion polls, about 1% to 2% behind the Attack leader.
Beronov was nominated for the post by the opposition Democrats for Strong Bulgaria, the Union of Democratic Forces and other smaller right-wing parties.
A similar distance separates Beronov from the other rightist candidate, Georgi Markov.
Sofia Mayor Boyko Borissov, one of the country's most popular politicians, recently announced his support for Beronov, describing him as the "least evil".
His move, he said in an interview last week, sought to prevent the risk of Siderov winning the presidency.
That, he said, would be devastating for the country.
Only 5% of the mayor's followers, however, are expected to cast a ballot for Beronov, while 46% have said they will vote for Parvanov, 12% for Siderov and 8% for Markov.
While they do not rule out a possible turn of tide among those competing for the second place, pollsters widely expect a runoff between Parvanov and Siderov.
Sejdiu says Kosovo interested in NATO presence after status
NATO representatives were in Kosovo last week to assess the security situation and hold talks with the province's leaders.

A 20-member NATO delegation arrived in Pristina last week for talks with Kosovo leaders on the Alliance's role after the final status settlement, and to observe the security situation in the province.
"We are interested in having NATO troops after the decision on Kosovo's status," President Fatmir Sejdiu said after meeting with the delegation.
NATO currently has more than 10,000 peacekeeping troops in Kosovo, representing 24 nations.
Meeting with Parliament Speaker Kole Berisha, delegation representative General Karl Lamers urged Kosovo's leaders to "work for creating a multiethnic society".
"A democratic and peaceful Kosovo is a stabilising factor for the whole region," he said.
Lamers also stressed the need to reach a "positive solution" on the status question.
"We need to support and co-operate with special envoy Martti Ahtisaari in order to reach an agreement this year -- this is our aim," he said.
For his part, Sejdiu reiterated the Kosovo Albanian demand for independence and sovereignty.
"We believe that 2006 will be the year of independence for Kosovo," he said.
He also urged that there be no delay to the status solution.
"Keeping in mind the Contact Group principles, the Kosovo's final status should be solved within 2006," the president said.
In comments last week, Ahtisaari suggested the decision could be postponed.
If Serbia sets an election date for the end of this year, the six-member Contact Group -- consisting of the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Russia -- might reconsider the timetable for the status decision, Ahtisaari told Finnish TV.
"Maybe it will mean that my proposal -- which is under preparation -- would be presented only after the elections," he said.
But representatives of the Contact Group have since appeared to rule out a delay."The Contact Group has not changed the agenda for Kosovo and we are still committed to realising our principles that Kosovo's status should be settled within 2006," said the US chief of mission in Pristina, Tina Kaidanow, after a meeting with Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku.
Ahtisaari himself now insists a postponement is not in the works. "No such directions have been given," Reuters quoted him as saying Monday (October 9th).
"[The] starting point for the schedule we have with the Contact Group is that this issue will be solved by the end of the year," he said.

Meeting in Athens, the finance ministers of the Southeast European Co-operation Process countries agreed this week to push for market reforms, strengthen the private sector and improve co-operation among the region's stock exchanges in a bid to boost the economies of southeastern Europe.
"We are in a position to achieve an economic miracle in our region," Greek Finance Minister Giorgos Alogoskoufis said at the close of the meeting.
The SEECP members are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia-Montenegro, Moldova and Turkey.
Albania's foreign trade deficit widened by 9.3 per cent year-on-year to 191m euros in December 2005, according to the latest official data.
The foreign trade gap increased by 20.4 per cent, in comparison to the previous month.
The EBRD released its new strategy for Romania, reaffirming support for the country's strategic goal of EU entry in 2007.
It stressed the need for improving competitiveness, attracting foreign direct investment, speeding up reforms in public administration and the judiciary, and waging an effective fight against corruption.
The EBRD also said it would provide a further 5.9 billion euros for projects in Romania, on top of the 2.9 billion euros already committed since November 2005.
Economic growth in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) remained strong during 2005, although the pace of growth decelerated in comparison to 2004, the World Bank said in a recent report.
It noted that BiH's industrial output growth dropped from 12 per cent in 2004 to 10 per cent in 2005, mostly because of weaker performance in the Federation of BiH.
Turkey's Oyak Group has given up a planned partnership with France's Arcelor for the Turkish state-run steel maker Erdemir.
It cited time constraints as the reason, but some sources also pointed to rumours of a hostile take-over bid for Arcelor by another international firm, Mittal Steel.
The cost of living index in Macedonia registered a 2.8 per cent increase year-on-year in January 2006, according to the latest official data.
According to the statistics, the average food and beverage expenses of a four-member household was approximately 168 euros last month.
Italy's UniCredito and Austria's Bank Austria issued a joint statement concerning the planned merger of three Bulgarian banks -- Bulbank (owned by UniCredito) and HVB Biochim and Hebros Bank (both owned by HVB-Bank Austria).
According to the statement, the merger should be completed by the third quarter of 2007.
The plan has already been approved by the Bulgarian anti-trust agency and now awaits endorsement by the country's central bank.
NATO Likely to Help Greece in Security Preparations for Athens Olympics
In the wake of the recent terror attacks in Turkey, Greece has suggested that it might seek NATO's help in its security preparations for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.
(Forward - 05/12/03; AP, VOA, Canadian Press - 03/12/03; AP - 02/12/03; AP - 28/11/03; Reuters - 27/11/03)
Greece has suggested that NATO could play a more direct role in security planning for the 2004 Summer Olympics.
Last month's suicide bombings in neighbouring Turkey have sparked new concerns that terror networks could try to launch attacks during the Games.
On Wednesday (3 December), Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos said that Greece has based its military planning for the Olympics on the greater strategic planning of the Alliance.
Speaking after a security meeting headed by Prime Minister Costas Simitis, he said Greece could seek NATO's help in the planning of measures to step up its counterterrorism capacity.
However, overall control over security operations will remain in the hands of the Greek police and military forces.
Speaking ahead of the meeting, Simitis said authorities were looking into the methods used in the Istanbul suicide bombings.
"We have tried to foresee every possibility.
The recent events, however, have shown us some new avenues," he said.
Greek Defence Minister Yiannos Papantoniou has said that he would not like to see visitors left with "the impression that Athens is a military camp".
Speaking ahead of a NATO meeting in Brussels this week, he said there would be no foreign forces on the ground, but NATO countries would keep troops on standby for quick deployment in the event of a major terror attack.
Stressing that the danger of terrorism "is not limited to a certain number of countries" and that Greece -- like any country -- be a target, International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Jacques Rogge said last week that security is the top priority for the Games.
"If the result of this means that athletes, spectators or officials have to undergo more security checks, let it be so," he told reporters at a news conference. "If we see police and-or armed forces at the games, let it be.
If it is needed, then we are glad that they are there."
Greece has allocated a budget of more than 620m euros for Olympic security.
In addition, it has created a 200-member unit trained to deal specifically with biological, chemical and nuclear terrorism and is putting together a list of biochemical resources that it could get quickly in the event of an attack.
In addition to its full co-operation with an international advisory group -- comprising Australia, Britain, France, Germany, Israel, Spain and the United States -- Athens has recently also intensified its security and intelligence co-operation with countries across the Balkans.
Kostunica: Serbia close to solving Mladic issue
Belgrade is "very, very close" to handing over Ratko Mladic to the UN war crimes tribunal and meeting its obligations to The Hague court, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said in Paris on Tuesday.
(Euronews, Blic - 12/04/06; Reuters, AP, BETA, Serbian Government, Makfax - 11/04/06)

Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica suggested on Tuesday (11 April) that the Belgrade authorities will soon move to arrest key war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic and deliver him to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
Full co-operation with the UN tribunal in The Hague, including the handover of the former Bosnian Serb military commander, is a precondition Serbia must meet to move ahead on its EU integration path.
Brussels has given Belgrade until 30 April to fulfil that obligation or risk seeing its Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) talks with the EU put on hold.
"We are now very, very close to responding to this obligation so as to be able to accelerate our path towards Europe," Kostunica told reporters in Paris on Tuesday after a meeting with French President Jacques Chirac.
"We will do everything to co-operate. Serbia will do all it can, right to the end, to achieve this."
It was the second time in the last two weeks that the prime minister has pledged Belgrade's commitment to a quick resolution of Mladic's case.
Facing an EU threat to suspend the SAA talks, Kostunica promised chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte late last month that the fugitive would be arrested and turned over "without delay".
Mladic was first indicted by the ICTY in 1995 for involvement in war crimes committed during the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
He faces 13 counts of crimes against humanity and violation of the laws or customs of war and two counts of genocide, including for the 1995 Srebrenica massacre and the 43-month siege of Sarajevo.
Mladic has been on the run for ten years now and is widely believed to be hiding in Serbia, where he lived under military protection until 2002.
Other issues the French and Serbian leaders discussed on Tuesday included the future of the Serbia-Montenegro state union, the country's EU accession efforts, and the UN-led negotiations on Kosovo's future status.
Chirac said France was asking all sides in the Kosovo status talks to seek a lasting solution that would respect each side's legitimate interests, the Serbian news agency BETA reported, citing a statement circulated by the French embassy in Belgrade.
Legally still part of Serbia-Montenegro, Kosovo has been under UN administration since the end of the 1998-1999 conflict.
The Kosovo Albanians, who make up 90 per cent of the province's population of 2 million people, hope that the UN-led negotiations will lead to full independence from Serbia.
Belgrade and the Kosovo Serbs want Kosovo to remain part of Serbia.
Reiterating Belgrade's stance, Kostunica on Tuesday called for a compromise "halfway between the pre-1999 status on the one hand and an independent Kosovo on the other".
Olympic Games Open in Athens
A spectacular opening ceremony in Athens marked the start of the 28th Olympiad and the return of the Games to their place of origin.
Modern technology conveyed the history of Greek civilisation and a message of hope for the future.

The world's greatest sporting event received a warm welcome home on Friday (13 August) as a crowd of 72,000 filled the Athens Olympic Stadium for the opening ceremony of the 28th Olympiad.
History combined with modern technology to create a spectacular performance witnessed by television viewers around the world.
The stadium's centre was transformed into an expanse of water, symbolising Greece's connection to the sea.
As hundreds of drummers played, five blazing Olympic rings appeared on its surface, while a young boy sailed across it bearing a Greek flag.
A dream-allegory employing sculptures, symbols and geometric shapes conveyed the history of Greek civilisation and culture and its evolution over the centuries, culminating in a message of new life and hope for the future.
The athletes then entered the stadium, and the parade of nations was under way.
In a break from the traditional marching hymns of past ceremonies, it was accompanied by upbeat music played by celebrated Dutch disc jockey DJ Tiesto.
Swiss tennis champion Roger Federer and Chinese NBA star Yao Ming were both chosen as flag-bearers for their respective countries and attracted great interest from their fellow competitors.
The teams from France, Italy and Cyprus received the warmest welcome from the audience, while the symbolism of North and South Korea marching as one team was understood and rewarded accordingly by the appreciative crowd.
Immediately after the parade, the Icelandic singer Bjork performed "Oceania".
She was followed by a tribute to past Olympic cities.
In the shade of an olive tree, Athens 2004 Organising Committee chief Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki and the president of the International Olympic Committee, Jacques Rogge, welcomed the athletes.
Greek President Constantinos Stephanopoulos officially declared the start of the Games.
The much-anticipated lighting of the Olympic Flame was performed by windsurfer Nikos Kaklamanakis, a gold medallist in Atlanta in 1996.
He made the run of the stadium before climbing the steps towards the giant cauldron, which lowered to greet him.
After offering his torch one last time to the crowd, he lit the Flame.
The cauldron then rose back into the night sky, accompanied by cheers and a magnificent fireworks display.
Croatian Investments in Serbia-Montenegro on the Rise
The normalisation of relations between Croatia and Serbia-Montenegro is unfolding primarily through the economy.
Pharmaceutical and agricultural firms are leading the way.

During the first quarter of this year, Croatian companies invested 6.5m euros abroad, mainly in Serbia-Montenegro.
According to data from the National Bank of Croatia, the total amount invested by Croatian firms abroad between 1993 and the end of March 2004 was approximately 943m euros.
During the first three months of 2004, Croatian firms invested in Serbia-Montenegro (44.8 per cent), Czech Republic (18.06 per cent), Hungary (13.21 per cent), Bosnia and Herzegovina (11.25 per cent) and Slovenia (6.21 per cent).
The normalisation of relations between Croatia and Serbia-Montenegro appears to be unfolding primarily through the economy, and analysts expect this trend will continue in the future.
Of the total of ownership investments in companies abroad, 63.12 per cent were directed towards milk processing and production of cheese, with another 31.54 per cent going into processing and conservation of fruits and vegetables.
This data reflects the considerable level of investments made by two of Croatia's largest food companies -- Agrokor and Lura.
At the start of this year, Agrokor announced plans to invest 30m euros in the Serbian market during 2004.
That includes 6.5m euros invested in Frikom, Serbia's largest producer of ice cream and frozen foods; Agrokor acquired a majority stake in the company at the start of 2003.
Also in 2003, Lura also became the majority owner of another Serbian firm, Somboled, pledging to invest in the modernisation of the firm.
The most important Croatian investor abroad, during the ten-year period from 1993 to the end of the first quarter of this year, has been the pharmaceutical manufacturer Pliva.
Of the total amount of investment abroad, 58.51 per cent has been in the pharmaceutical industry.
EU, SEE Countries Negotiating Creation of Regional Energy Market
The EU has launched talks with Southeast European countries on the creation of a regional energy market.
An agreement would pave the way for the integration of the regional energy sector into the Union's internal energy market.
(EurActiv - 23/07/04; Stability Pact -- 15/07/04 - 19/07/04; Seerecong.org)
"The proposed treaty is a unique political chance for the region," Erhard Busek, the special co-ordinator of the Stability Pact for South East Europe, said in Vienna on 15 July. [AFP]
The European Commission (EC) has started talks with the Southeast European (SEE) countries on a legally binding agreement regarding the creation of a common energy market in the region. A deal is expected to be reached by the end of 2004, paving the way for the opening of the SEE electricity and gas markets between 2005 and 2007 and the integration of the region's energy sector into the EU internal energy market.
"The proposed treaty is a unique political chance for the region," Erhard Busek, the special co-ordinator of the Stability Pact for South East Europe, said in Vienna on 15 July, as the first round of the negotiations kicked off.
Reaching an agreement "could consolidate reconciliation in the region and provide a powerful driver towards a more comprehensive economic and political integration of the whole of SEE into the EU", he added.
The talks build on the political commitments underlying the Athens memoranda of understanding signed in November 2002 and December 2003.
The memoranda called on SEE governments to adopt EU directives on energy and the environment, with the ultimate aim of integrating the regional energy sector into the EU internal energy market.
The specific measures envisioned include unbundling vertically integrated utilities; creating national transmission system operators and independent regulatory authorities; developing a system of regulated third party access to the transmission network; and phased opening of the national markets and development of transparent trading and market monitoring requirements.
Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia-Montenegro and Kosovo are expected to sign onto the initiative, which has become known as the Energy Community of South East Europe.
In addition, EU members Austria, Greece, Hungary, Italy and Slovenia are expected to join, while Moldova will have an observer status.
Germany is also likely to join as an observer at a future date.
According to a Stability Pact statement, SEE countries will also gain access to the EU's internal energy market, irrespective of the status of their membership negotiations, once the EU criteria are met.
A regional market underpinned by a legally binding treaty would make the sector much more attractive to international investors, Busek said, noting also that the regional approach provides for a significant reduction in investments needed for the modernisation of the sector.
It also provides for a better co-ordination of the technical and financial assistance provided by international financial institutions and bilateral donors.
The World Bank is among the institutions backing the regional energy market project.
Its contribution is in the form of policy support and investment finance.
According to the Bank, the project provides opportunities for increased residential gasification, but is also likely to affect the coal sector and could lead to a loss of jobs in the mining sector.
Investments totaling over 16 billion euros will be needed to support market liberalisation, the Bank estimates, adding that an additional 4 billion euros will be required to address environmental issues.
Amendments to the draft treaty will be considered during a meeting in Vienna, provisionally scheduled for 23 September.
Consequences still resonate three months after Gerdec blast
Although the people in Gerdec, Albania, have begun to rebuild their homes and move on, the March 15th blast in the town is still fresh in everyone's minds.
The explosion is still causing turmoil in Albanian politics.

Efforts to dismantle Albania's stockpiles of obsolete munitions took a catastrophic turn on March 15th, when a series of explosions occurred as crews were clearing out a storage depot in Gerdec, near Tirana.
The explosions lasted nearly 14 hours, resulted in 26 deaths, over 300 injuries, thousands of homeless and 16.6m euros worth of damage.
Investigations into the tragedy have focused on what caused the explosion and who is responsible.
The final report of US experts, who assisted the Albanian team to investigate the causes of the accident, says that the demolition process was carried out in unsafe working conditions -- the factory was very small and inappropriate for demilitarization of ammunition.
"According to estimates, the explosion was so strong that it could be compared to a nuclear explosion," said President Bamir Topi.
Gerdec looks now like a construction site with houses being re-built and a number of tents for shelter.
The exploded hill has started to show its first signs of life with sparse grass and plant regrowth.
Alongside the few newly reconstructed houses there are many others being rebuilt with funds from the government or by Gerdec inhabitants themselves.
Former Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu resigned days after the blast. [Getty Images]
"Some of the families managed to rebuild their houses very soon after the tragedy," said Gerdec resident Agim, who is working on his house with his family and friends.
"Relatives or children working abroad helped them financially.
I personally borrowed the money needed for the reconstruction; I could not live anymore in a tent.
As soon as I receive the financial compensation, I will repay it."
However, officials in the Vora municipality, the entity responsible for distributing compensation and other economic assistance to the damaged families, say that the funds for reconstruction have all be distributed.
As of June 10th, the finance ministry had delivered 90% of the 13m euros allocated by the government, according to the ministry's press office.
On June 12th, the Council of Ministers issued a final decision on compensation funds, adding an additional 7.5m euros for rebuilding the business sector and for the inhabitants of Manze and Marikaj, which were also damaged in the blasts.
However, despite the compensation, most of those affected by the tragedy are upset with the government's dealing with the situation.
At the beginning of June, people sheltered at the interior ministry employees' resort in Durres started protesting against the ministry's decision to relocate them to rental homes.
Many families in the area have refused to relocate, despite the contamination.
The UN group that visited Gerdec in late March estimated that the level of contamination near the exploded hill is high due to two missile radioactive elements.
Still, many residents have set up tents near the hill, and refuse relocation.
Accommodation is not the only problem that caused dissatisfaction among people damaged by Gerdec blast.
In mid May, claims regarding unfair assessment of damaged buildings caused an investigation for possible bribery cases.
After questioning the 15 working groups established for assessing public and private buildings, the state prosecution decided to start investigations of four individuals and their methods of assessing the damages.
The former workers at the Gerdec army depot have gone on hunger strike. They accuse the government of not properly handling the situation, and are asking for financial compensation for the wounded and the families that suffered as a result of the blast.

Five people have been arrested in connection with the blasts, and on Monday (June 16th), parliament lifted the immunity of former Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu based on the general prosecutor's allegation of abuse of power.
Mediu resigned days after the explosion.
The prosecution says that an investigation into the matter shows that Mediu's "actions and inactions" broke a series of laws and procedures on security standards. They say there were illegal orders appointing Gerdec as the place for the site of the munitions demolition, and other orders to the army to transport the munitions to Gerdec that could have been the result of bribery.
Mediu denies any wrongdoing and did not comment on the parliament's decision. "As a defense minister I respected the law considered disposing of excess ammunition a national priority," he told the parliamentary session.
Topi has also relieved Army Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Luan Hoxha from duty.
Presidential spokeswoman Mimoza Kociu said that the decision followed a recommendation from Prime Minister Sali Berisha.
Seven other defense ministry officials and managers of the private company disposing of the ammunition have been arrested on charges of negligence.
About 100,000 tons of excess ammunition, mostly Russian and Chinese artillery shells made in the 1960s or earlier, are stored in former army depots across Albania.
The country has pledged to dispose of the ammunition by 2010, and is receiving assistance from the US, Canada and other NATO countries.

Albania to Issue New EU-friendly Driving Licenses
Albanian authorities are replacing current driving licenses with new ones that meet EU standards.
This will help Albanian drivers travel move easily in foreign countries, including the members of the European bloc.

Albania is preparing to issue new driving licenses that will meet EU criteria, the country's transport and telecommunications ministry has announced.
Officials hope they will help Albanian drivers travel move easily in foreign countries, including the members of the European bloc.
The new documents will have 20 safety elements, including description of eye colour and blood type as well as fingerprint information.
The existing driving licenses will also be used until the process of replacing them is complete, according to ministry sources.
Citizens wishing to obtain the new ones can present the required documentation at their regional police departments.
Most will receive their licenses within five days.
A Hungarian company, Bull Hungary Ltd, was contracted by the Albanian government to implement the new licenses.
Hungarian Ambassador Sandor Szabo, who assisted in the signing of the contract earlier this year, said the initiative is a positive step for Albania and also for Hungarians seeking a greater investment role in the country.
For Albanians, one major benefit will be enhanced freedom of movement, as their licenses will be recognised by the EU member states.
At present, drivers are subject to onerous limits, such as being double-checked at borders.
The license initiative is seen as a major step towards having these restrictions lifted.
"BIRN will survive"
According to Igric, the quality of journalism in the region "is not great", but the forecast is not totally bleak.

Gordana Igric, head of BIRN, spoke to SETimes. [File]
The need for high quality, independent journalism in the region will assure the survival of the Balkans Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN), says the organisation's founder, Gordana Igric.
"Of course BIRN will survive," Igric told Southeast European Times.
"The global economic crisis has made things difficult but we survived worse times. In 2005 [when BIRN was formed] we had high operating costs, but not a lot of grant money, over a prolonged period.
We survived that and we will somehow survive this," she said.
Although the organisation has an arm that operates as a commercial business, the bulk of BIRN's work is done by its non-profit sector, which is bankrolled by close to a dozen philanthropic institutions -- including the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Balkan Trust for Democracy -- and European governments, The Netherlands and Norway.
Igric says Balkan-based NGOs do not get long term funding commitments from donors, so she and her colleagues are constantly searching for new benefactors and ways of making money.
BIRN hopes to derive revenue from subscriptions to the premium section of one of its websites (balkaninsight.com) and Igric is hopeful that BIRN Regional's cornucopia of experts can be engaged by private clients.
Pristina Insight, a bi-weekly newspaper, is 100% financed by donors, but the weekly Belgrade Insight is covering 60% of its production costs through advertising revenue.
Igric believes her Belgrade paper, "can survive on its own, once the economy recovers".
Independent journalism in the Balkans is still a work in progress.
According to Freedom House, an international organisation that "promotes free institutions", Slovenia is the only country in the region where a free press exists.
All other Balkan countries were rated "partly free".
Freedom House's 2009 annual report noted that journalists in the Balkans are frequently threatened with violence -- reporters in Bulgaria and Croatia were murdered in 2008 -- and media organs across the region routinely practice self-censorship.
"All significant numerical changes of press freedom in the Balkans were negative" in 2008, the organisation said.
Igric agrees that the quality of journalism "is not great". But all is not bleak, she insists.
"There are more serious players in the market.
Investors are coming from abroad and they are offering better pay," Igric says.

Sponsored by the US Embassy in Macedonia, the American Corner in Skopje brings a bit of the United States to Macedonians.
Through several types of media, members and visitors can access all types of information.
American Corner Skopje Co-ordinator Olivera Trajkova sat down with SETimes correspondent Goran Trajkov to discuss the centre, its mission and the future.
SETimes: What is the mission of the American Corner in Skopje?
Olivera Trajkova: The mission of the American Corner in Skopje is to make available all relevant information about the US to members and visitors via books, newspapers, magazines, DVDs and free internet access.
We are bringing American culture and way of life closer to Macedonian citizens.
This is very important, because the majority of the people in Macedonia have never visited the US.
All American Corners throughout the world are a partnership between the American embassy's public affairs office in a country and the host institution where the corner is located.
The American Corner in Skopje is situated in the "Brothers Miladinov" city library, with which we have excellent co-operation.
SETimes: How is the work of the American Corner organised?
Trajkova: We work every week day until 8pm and on Saturdays.
More than 3,500 corner members belong to different age and educational groups, but one of our aims is to fulfil all their needs, which is why we organise different programme activities.
The majority of our members and visitors are high school and university students.
About 20% are over 30 years of age and most are employed.
Membership is free of charge and to register one only needs valid ID.
The most important thing for us is to organise a variety of programmes that fit all -- students, young employees, mid-career professionals, children beginning to learn English, but also retired intellectuals who want to continue to learn.
SETimes: What kind of activities does the American Corner organise?
Trajkova: We organise different kinds of events including workshops, meetings, exhibits, poetry readings, video showings, speaker programmes.
Usually our members comprise the audience for these events, but they can bring along friends.
Anyone interested can attend.
Peace Corps volunteers have helped us prepare programmes.
They usually hold a conversation hour, which is very popular because it helps members learn English from a native speaker.
Some volunteers also participate in our outreach activities in different cities throughout Macedonia.
SETimes: Do the American Corners in Macedonia co-operate with corners in the region?
Trajkova: There are three American Corners in Macedonia -- in Skopje, Bitola and Tetovo.
We communicate and co-operate almost on a daily basis.
The concept of our programming is similar; sometimes we have different presentations or we exchange the same lecturers and presentations.
The goal is to reach the needs of our customers and members, and to address their queries about American culture and way of life.
We communicate with the American Corners in Kosovo, Serbia, Greece, Croatia, Slovenia and Hungary during training and seminars, which are held annually to improve our skills and exchange ideas; this is an extraordinary possibility to enrich the choice of activities.
We also keep in touch with our colleagues via a DVC -- digital video connection -- when we inform one another about our most important activities.
SETimes: What are the American Corner in Skopje's plans for the future?
Trajkova: Our idea is to organise a regional meeting of the American Corners in Macedonia.
We already have consulted the corners about it and their response was positive.
If everything goes well, sometime in the late spring next year we will host this regional conference.
Bulgarian Parliament Supports Constitutional Changes
In an unprecedented show of unanimity, Bulgaria's Parliament voted on first reading to approve the first changes to the country's constitution since its adoption in 1991.
The draft constitutional changes are aimed at reforming the judiciary.

The Bulgarian Parliament has approved draft constitutional changes aimed at reforming the country's judiciary. The amendments, adopted with an unprecedented unanimity on first reading Wednesday (3 September), are expected to improve the functioning of the judicial system and remove a major stumbling block on the country's path to joining the EU.
The changes will be the first in Bulgaria's Constitution since its adoption in 1991.
Lawmakers in the 240-seat assembly voted 222-0, with no abstentions, in support of the package of reforms dealing with magistrates' immunity, tenure and mandate.
Final adoption of the new legislation is to take place before the end of September.
In July, EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen warned Sofia that the required judiciary reform must be in place by then if the country wants to stay on track.
Bulgaria hopes to complete its EU accession talks by 2004 and is expected to join the Union in 2007 along with Romania.
The 3rd and final reading of the new legislation is expected to take place on 19 September or 23 September, senior parliamentarians said Wednesday.
Currently, magistrates enjoy immunity from prosecution, except for the gravest offences.
The proposed amendments limit that immunity to acts committed in the line of duty.
The required period of service before judges, prosecutors and investigating magistrates can be granted life tenure will be extended from three to five years.
Furthermore, judges and magistrates will lose their jobs in the event that they are sentenced to prison, "do not systematically perform their duties", or act in any way that "compromises the judiciary".
The mandate of magistrates in senior positions will be set at five years, with the right to a 2nd term.
The reforms, according to Bulgarian Justice Minister Anton Stankov, "marked only the beginning of irreversible steps to put in place an effective justice system".
Under Bulgarian law, constitutional changes must be supported by at least 180 of the deputies in parliament.
Between the three readings, MPs can propose new changes.
The right-wing opposition Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) backed the constitutional amendments, but describes them as insufficient.
Calling for a restructuring of the judiciary, the party suggested it would propose, prior to the second reading, stripping magistrates of immunity altogether.
The UDF has been insisting that the same measure be adopted for MPs.
The left-wing opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party also backed the reform package, but said the problems in the judiciary were created by those already in the system rather than the principles on which the system functions.

The Serbian government is withdrawing the operating license of the telcom Mobtel and placing its operations under the control of the state-run Telekom Serbija, on the grounds that it contracted a mobile operator to carry out services in Kosovo without a required permit.
The Austrian consortium of investors that owns a 51 per cent stake in Mobtel announced it will appeal the decision.
The firm is already mired in a conflict over ownership, with the state claiming it should own a 58 per cent stake instead of a minority 49 per cent share.
Turkey's Parliament adopted a state budget for next year, following two weeks of debates on the draft.
The law sets the annual inflation target at 5 per cent and projects a budget deficit of 8.7 billion euros in 2006.
The head of Bulgaria's new National Revenues Agency, Maria Murgina, announced a large reshuffle in the tax administration system.
Twelve district tax chiefs as well as two deputy directors of the central tax administration will be dismissed.
The remaining district tax administration heads will be appointed on a six-month probation term as of January 2006.
The move aims to improve tax administration, boost revenues collection and help eliminate tax evasion.
Seven companies submitted letters of intent in the privatisation tender for Macedonia's power distribution utility ESM Distribucija.
They were Austria's EVN, the Czech firm CEZ, France's EDF, the German companies RWE Energy and EnBW, Italy's Enel and the US firm AES.
The bidding procedure is expected to be finalised next spring.
Serbian authorities endorsed a bid by Merrill Lynch and Raiffeisen Investment to become adviser to the government in the privatisation of the state oil and gas company NIS.
For a fee of $900,000 and a 1.2 per cent commission, the consortium will propose various alternatives for the privatisation.
The Republika Srpska (RS) government and London-based Altima Partners LLP officially sealed the privatisation agreement for Banja Luka's Pivara brewery company.
Altima acquired a majority 53.81 per cent of the RS enterprise for the price of 12m euros and a commitment to invest an additional 4m euros over the next three years.
The Italian apparel maker Goldenlady is considering the launch of a production facility in Republika Srpska.
The proposed factory would be located in the Derventa region and employ at least 800 people.
Macedonia's Parliament approved the 2006 budget law, which sets the GDP growth target at 4 per cent and projects an annual inflation rate of 2 per cent next year.
A 28m-euro budget deficit is forecast.
The EU has endorsed a 25m-euro financial assistance package for Serbia-Montenegro, with 90 per cent of the funds transferred immediately after the approval.
The move was in recognition of Belgrade's completion of the 2005 economic goals agreed on with the EU.
Corruption Still High in SEE Countries
Romania, Macedonia, Serbia-Montenegro and Albania are among 60 countries where corruption is still rampant, according to Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index 2004.
Where do the other Southeast European countries stand?

Corruption is still rampant across the globe, Transparency International said Wednesday (20 October) as it released its latest survey on corruption perceptions.
"Corruption in large-scale public projects is a daunting obstacle to sustainable development, and results in a major loss of public funds needed for education, healthcare and poverty alleviation, both in developed and developing countries," Peter Eigen, the chairman of the Berlin-based anti-corruption watchdog, said at a press conference in London.
The group's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) 2004 shows that 106 out of the surveyed 146 countries score less than 5 out of a possible score of 10.
Sixty countries -- including Romania, Macedonia, Serbia-Montenegro and Albania -- score less than 3 out of 10, indicating rampant corruption, the group said in a press release.
Among those countries, Romania stands highest with a score of 2.9, which puts it in 87th place along with the Dominican Republic and Iran. With a score of 2.7 each, Macedonia and Serbia-Montenegro both rank 97th in the CPI along with Algeria, Lebanon and Nicaragua. Albania, at 2.5, shares the 108th position with Argentina, Libya and the Palestinian Authority.
"If we hope to reach the Millennium Development Goal of halving the number of people living in extreme poverty by 2015, governments need to seriously tackle corruption in public contracting," said Eigen.
His group estimates that at least $400 billion is lost worldwide every year due to bribery in government procurement.
Following the survey's release, Romanian Justice Minister Cristian Diaconescu said Bucharest viewed it as a signal that it must step up its efforts.
While scoring better, all other SEE countries -- except for Cyprus (5.4) -- are in the group of 106 with scores below 5.
With a score of 4.3, Greece ranks 49th, alongside Surinam.
Bulgaria's score of 4.1 puts it in 54th place, together with Mauritius and Namibia.
Bulgaria is listed among a group of countries, including Spain, Mexico, Colombia, that have made "significant changes for the better" in fighting corruption over the past eight years.
Croatia is in 67th position, with Peru, Poland, Sri Lanka; each received a score of 3.5. With a score of 3.2, Turkey is 77th, along with Benin, Egypt, Mali and Morocco.
Bosnia and Herzegovina got a score of 3.1 and 82nd position in the CPI, alongside Madagascar.
The CPI is a poll of polls, reflecting the perceptions of resident and non-resident business people and country analysts.
This year's index is based on 18 surveys conducted by 12 independent institutions between 2002 and 2004.
Ahtisaari plan no "magic wand"
As UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari prepares to unveil his blueprint for Kosovo, the mood there is cautiously optimistic.

UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari is due to present his report and recommendations for Kosovo on Friday (February 2nd).
Most Kosovo Albanians expect the plan to set the province on the road to independence, with strings attached.
For Pristina resident Njomza Pevqeli, it's no problem if Ahtisaari's plan calls for "monitored independence" -- what's important is that responsibilities are turned over to the province.
"It is very important to know that Kosovo will have a stronger economy … implementation of the standards, respect for the human rights," Pevqeli says.
Her boyfriend Agon, a political science student, agrees.
"I am looking for better life in Kosovo.
The name of the solution is not so important, even though we insist on independence." Kosovo, he thinks, is on the right track not only for Albanians, but also for other ethnic communities.
"I think that Kosovo will be a good place for all," he says.
Not everyone is so optimistic.
Another political science student, Sami Kastrati, worries that the international community risks creating a failed state by saddling Kosovo with unworkable conditions.
One of the problems, he says, is the so-called "double majority" of Serb representatives in the Kosovo Assembly.
"I think that in the near future, this right of the Serbs will create a non-functional state," he said.
Fellow student Betim Deva thinks the proposal is unlikely to satisfy either side completely.
However, he says, paving the way for a sovereign Kosovo is vital to preventing future problems in the Balkans.
Independence alone will not spur Kosovo's economic development, Deva believes. "Kosovars need motivation.
An independent Kosovo would be a good example if we want to see some progress in Balkan economies.
However we should not expect it to be 'magical' anytime soon," he said.
Journalist Shpend Cocaj doubts the plan will provide a definitive solution.
"Given the experiences we had in the past, I don't expect that Ahtisaari will wave a magic wand," he says. "It will be only the next step, for the beginning of another process."
However, Cocaj adds, the plan will be "a good fusion for the people of Kosovo -- to please both sides, Serbian and Albanian.
Maybe it is good that the international community again has brought Kosovo to their daily agenda."
International media are reporting that the UN envoy's plan provides for limited sovereignty for the province, and significant autonomy for the Serb minority.
Pristina would be able to seek admission in international organisations and run Kosovo under the supervision of an EU official.
In a speech last week to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) in Strasbourg, France, Ahtisaari described his proposal as "fair and balanced".
He stressed that its main goal was to ensure that all of the province's communities would live together in peace.
Croatia debates EU-inspired sugar quota
Croatia has agreed to a European Commission request to set an annual quota for duty-free exports.
The move has angered opposition parties, who say farmers and sugar producers will be hurt.
But the government defends its decision, saying the opposition is just trying to score political points.

In line with a Stabilisation and Association Agreement requirement, Croatia's parliament recently moved to end unlimited, duty-free sugar exports to the EU market.
The new duty-free export quota is 180,000 tonnes of sugar annually.
Any excess amount will be subject to taxation.
Opposition parties have objected to the quota, warning that three Croatian sugar factories will become bankrupt due to the government's compliance with the EU demands.
They estimate that the Croatian sugar industry faces billions of euros in losses, with farmers likely to be the worst hurt.
Prime Minister Ivo Sanader has come under fire personally for agreeing to the restriction.
Bozidar Pankretic, chairman of the Committee for Agriculture and Forestry, argues that the new export quota should not be less than the amount of sugar produced on 30,000 hectares of land.
"With the new sugar export limitation at 180,000 tonnes, Croatia will have one sugar factory out of business," Pankretic said, claiming that the quota will limit domestic production as well.
But Agriculture Minister Petar Cobankovic defends the government's decision.
Croatia already exports only 120,000 tonnes of sugar to the EU per year, he says, so the quota will cause no damage at all.
According to him, the new export quota will not jeopardise the domestic sugar production, as Croatia has established good negotiating relations with the European Commission.
Indeed, Cobankovic says, the agreement with the EU has not upset Croatian sugar producers, even though it has rattled opposition politicians.
"The agreement puts Croatia's agriculture in a better position in that it will not depend on exports anymore, but will enlarge its domestic market.
That is why Croatian producers are satisfied with the change," he says.
From young to old, second Greek bailout deal hurts almost everyone
Greece says the austerity programme will keep the country together, but others say it tears it apart.

When Stavros Karkaletsis looks at the deal Greece signed with international lenders to get a second bailout, he sees his country defenseless -- fighter jets parked because there's not enough fuel.
Thanassi Antoniou, nearing 83, sees himself back at the sewing desk where he worked as tailor for half a century because the government keeps pecking away at his shrinking pension.
From cutbacks for the elderly, to a minimum wage slashed to 22% -- 32% for those younger than 25 -- Greeks fear a cradle-to-grave decline in their standard of living, although the government said the bargain has saved the country for future generations.
Interim Prime Minister Lucas Papademos pushed the package to ratify a second bailout from the EU-IMF-ECB Troika -- this one for 130 billion euros to compliment an ongoing series of 109 billion in loans from a first -- through parliament, but with more of the same austerity measures that have pushed Greece into a deep recession.
Unemployment is near 21% -- 48% among the young – and more than 111,000 businesses have closed, with predictions it will get worse in the short term.
Parliament also voted to make 3.2 billion euros in cuts to this year's budget, with the main targets being pensions, wages, health care and pharmaceuticals, and defense spending -- which will be pruned by 400m euros.
Those were the conditions attached February 21st by Eurozone finance ministers, who said they are trying to keep the region's financial bloc safe while propping up Greece too, and help get a write-down in debt of 100 billion euros as part of a so-called Private Sector Involvement (PSI) deal with reluctant investors.
"Things are and will be difficult," Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos told the chamber before the vote. "Now we are gaining a safe framework with the decisions of February 21st, with private-sector involvement, recapitalization of banks but it needs work, work, work, unity, consensus, seriousness."
Karkaletsis, who runs the Athens defense analysis think tank Hellenic Center for European and International Analyses and is the a defense envoy to Cyprus for New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras, told SETimes, "We had to cut from everywhere except defense.
You can build a new economy, but if you lose Greek territory, even a small island, you can't get it back, " -- a nod to Cyprus, still split from a Turkish invasion 38 years ago, and who he feels will take advantage of the crisis to become more expansionist and aggressive.

Antoniou, who lives in a one-room apartment in a building where his daughter lives and helps him, said, "I feel insecurity although I have only myself to care for and there are people with families," he told SETimes.
He kept his old sewing machine, for nostalgic purposes, he said, but added: "Now I wonder what it would be like to be using it again, if I had to."
Papademos said it was a gut-wrenching decision to make the cuts to keep the money coming, but the alternative was chaos and financial collapse.
Venizelos, who has doubled income and property taxes and taken to taxing the poor, said the agreement opens the door to conclude the PSI agreement and will benefit the country in the long run.
"Any other proposal creates insecurity, uncertainty and can lead to tragic situations," he said.
Still, said Samaras, "With this new loan agreement, with this drastic cutting of the debt, we have averted the country's expulsion from the euro … we have saved social cohesion, at least for now."
Those arguments haven't worked with workers, those in the public sector who've seen their pay cut 30%.
Some private sector salaries have been cut up to 50% to keep pace with the fall in the minimum wage, and some workers could find themselves with take-home pay of less than 400 euros a month.
Pressure has already reached a boiling point.
A distraught unemployed worker stormed into a plastics factory in Komotini on Friday, shooting and wounding three people and taking several others hostage for hours before surrendering to police.
Pantelis Magalios, head of a labor centre in Komotini, told reporters that the gunman had run out of money.
"We condemn this incident, which should not have happened.
But the problem is that have to think about what put the gun in this man's hand.
What made him reach this point: unemployment, which is on the rise, and a cut in wages.
These are problems we will continue to be confronted with."
Aggelos Tsakanikas, an engineer who is Head of Research for the Athens-based Foundation for Economic and Industrial Research, said Greece is under a double-edged sword -- a sense of relief undercut by constant fear.
"It's a very harsh programme that will deepen the recession.
Instead of -3% of GDP, we estimate -4.5% because these measures affect the real income and wages," he told SETimes.
But, he added, "This was the deal to get the second loan, and especially the PSI, which will have a positive effect on debt."
Papademos said he believes the economy could rebound in 18 months, but only if new growth ideas work.
Pantelis Kammas, lecturer in economics at the University of Ioannina, said Greece has a long road to recovery.
"The problem with fiscal austerity is the recession, reduced tax revenues," he told SETimes, and consumer spending has dropped, leading to a 33m euros decline in revenues in January this year over 2011 figures.
"The only way to break this vicious cycle is promote reforms that have growth," he said, including ending the monopoly many Greek professions hold -- pharmacists, engineers, architects and lawyers -- which the government has been reluctant to do.
Alex Afouxenidis, a British-schooled Researcher at the Institute for Political Sociology, National Centre for Social Research in Athens, said the measures will fail and are taking a heavy human toll, especially on the young who see no future beyond reduced minimum wages and few prospects.
"It's a wasteland, the recovery will take years," he told SETimes. "It's a complete decomposition of whatever social welfare we have.
The whole country has been de-skilled … if you don't have resistance to this, you don't have hope."
Kostunica's party edges closer to Radicals
The chances for a pro-European government taking office in Serbia appeared to be drifting away Wednesday, when Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia announced its conditions for joining a governing coalition.

With talks on a new government coalition under way in Serbia, the ruling Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) unveiled on Wednesday (January 31st) a set of Kosovo-related conditions under which it would agree to join the country's next cabinet.
The platform, sent to the Serbian media by the DSS and its coalition partner in the January 21st parliamentary elections, the New Serbia (NS) party, insisted that the new government should make the preservation of the country's territorial integrity its "first constitutional obligation".
The DSS handed the document to President Boris Tadic on Tuesday during the ongoing consultations on formation of a governing coalition.
The DSS made its stand public two days before UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari's visit to Belgrade on Friday, when he will deliver his proposal for a solution to the Kosovo status issue.
While the details of Ahtisaari's plan have not been revealed, it is widely expected to set out a roadmap that will pave the way to Kosovo's eventual statehood.
The proposal, which is still subject to change, reportedly will allow individual countries to recognise Kosovo as a sovereign state, if they wish.
"Any country that decides to recognise independence (of Kosovo) must bear in mind that this will result in serious consequences to their relations with Serbia," Belgrade-based Beta news agency quoted the DSS-NS platform as reading.
Ahtisaari's proposal reportedly will also allow Kosovo to apply for membership in international organisations, such as the UN, EU, the World Bank and IMF.
"In the event that any country or international organisation decides to recognise the independence of Kosovo and Metohija, the Serbian government will inform the governments of all internationally recognised countries that it denounces such a decision as illegal, illegitimate and void," said the DSS-NS platform.
It also warned NATO member states that if any of them recognises Kosovo as an independent country, this would lead to "a serious deterioration of relations" between Serbia and the Alliance.
Observers saw the move by Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's DSS as diminishing the chances for the formation of a pro-European ruling coalition among the country's democratic forces.
The DSS-NS coalition finished third in Serbia's election, winning 47 seats.
Those results gave Kostunica a kingmaker role in formation of the new government.
His coalition could join forces either with the ultra nationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS), which won the largest number of votes, or Tadic's Democratic Party (DS), which finished second.
The conditions set by Kostunica's party bring its position on Kosovo closer to that of the SRS.
While the DS and former Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic's G17 Plus have also voiced opposition to Kosovo becoming independent, both have shown greater flexibility on the issue.
The only Serbian party to openly support independence for Kosovo is the Liberal Democratic Party of former Deputy Prime Minister Cedomir Jovanovic.
ICTY War Crimes Case Referred to BiH
The UN war crimes tribunal decided Tuesday to transfer the case against a former Bosnian Serb paramilitary to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It is the first time The Hague-based court has sent one of its indictments to a national jurisdiction.

For the first time since its inception in 1993, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has decided to refer one of its indictments to a national jurisdiction.
Under the decision a three-judge panel at the UN tribunal took Tuesday (17 May), the case against former Bosnian Serb paramilitary Radovan Stankovic will be sent to Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) recently established war crimes chamber.
With the ICTY due to wrap up all its activities in 2010, tribunal officials have indicated in recent months that some mid- and low-ranking cases would be referred to national courts in the Balkans in a bid to relieve the court of its caseload, so that it can focus on the major suspects. There are more than 50 war crimes indictees currently awaiting trial at The Hague and about a dozen others are still at large, including the ICTY's two most wanted indictees, wartime Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander, Ratko Mladic.
"Neither the level of responsibility of the accused nor the gravity of the crimes alleged in the indictment were factors that would make a referral to the national authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina inappropriate," the ICTY said in a statement on Tuesday.
Stankovic, 36, was initially indicted in 1996 along with seven others for war crimes he allegedly committed against Bosnian Muslims and Croats detained after Serb forces overtook Foca in April 1992. He was arrested by SFOR troops on 9 July 2002 and was transferred to The Hague the following day. In 2003, UN prosecutors filed a separate indictment against Stankovic, which was later amended.
It charges him with four counts of crimes against humanity for enslavement and rape and four counts of violations of the laws or customs of war for rape and outrages upon personal dignity.
According to UN prosecutors, at the beginning of the 1992-1995 conflict in BiH, Stankovic was serving as a soldier in the Miljevina Battalion of the Foca Tactical Brigade and was among a group temporarily quartered in the abandoned house of a Bosnian Muslim.
Between August 1992 and October the same year, he and several other soldiers were in charge of the house, using it to detain at least nine Muslim women and girls who were subjected to repeated rapes and sexual assaults, the indictment said.
"During the arrests, many civilians were killed, beaten or subjected to sexual assault," the AP quoted his indictment as reading. "Many of the detained women were subjected to humiliating and degrading conditions of life, to brutal beatings and to sexual assault, including rape."
Stankovic's participation in the alleged atrocities included assigning the women and girls to specific Serb soldiers to be raped and otherwise sexually assaulted and personally raping at least two women, one repeatedly over a three-month period.
The UN judges decided to grant the prosecutor's motion for referral of his case to the BiH authorities after considering several factors, including the compatibility of BiH's laws with the ICTY statute and the prospects for a fair trial.
According to the ICTY statement, the judges were also satisfied that "adequate measures are in place for the protection of witnesses" and "that the death penalty will not be imposed".
Under Tuesday's ruling, Stankovic is to be transferred to BiH in 30 days.
He and the prosecution have 15 days within which to appeal the referral decision.
According to Reuters, the UN prosecutors are seeking the transfer of several other war crimes cases to BiH.
Cost of Bulgarian Parliamentary Elections Grows to 7.5M Euros
The cost of the 25 June parliamentary elections in Bulgaria is expected to reach about 7.5m euros, exceeding by 2m euros the amount the Balkan country was initially planning to spend on the vote.

The bill for the 25 June parliamentary elections in Bulgaria will reach 7.5m euros, instead of the initially planned 5.5m euros, State Administration Minister Dimitar Kalchev said Friday (13 May). The difference will be covered with budget surplus money, he added.
According to Kalchev, the amount needed by the foreign ministry to organise the voting of Bulgarians living abroad has more than tripled.
That, he says, is one of the main reasons for the higher overall cost.
Instead of the approximately 450,000 euros initially set aside, the ministry is now expected to get about 1.5m euros to pay for the establishment of polling stations in Europe, the United States and other parts of the world.
Expatriate Bulgarians are showing a heightened interest in the June elections, said Kalchev, adding that their votes could have a significant impact on the final results.
At least 500,000 Bulgarians are believed to have left the country during the last 15 years alone.
The interior ministry will also get extra money as a result of recent election law changes, which entitle police officers to receive overtime pay for providing security on Election Day.
At the same time, another amendment is expected to help Bulgaria save 30 per cent to 40 per cent on its expenses for paper.
The names of parties, coalitions and independent candidates will now be listed on a single, integral ballot.
Its size will depend on the number of political forces and candidates registered for the vote.
The Central Electoral Commission (CEC) has thus far refused to register six parties and coalitions, including a communist party and the Bulgarian Revolutionary Youth Party.
Thus far, 20 parties and coalitions, including all those currently represented in parliament, have ensured their participation in next month's elections, while seven other formations are still awaiting the CEC's decision.
New polls again show the Bulgarian Socialist Party ahead, with 25 per cent voter support.
The ruling National Movement for Simeon II (NMS-II) trails with 15 per cent to nearly 19 per cent, according to the latest polls conducted by Alpha Research polling agency and the Risk Assessment Foundation.
The other parties likely to surpass the 4 per cent threshold for winning parliamentary seats include the right-wing Union of Democratic Forces and Democrats for Strong Bulgaria, as well as the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, the junior partner in the current NMS II-led government coalition.
According to the Alpha Research poll, nearly 22 per cent of the respondents were still undecided, while another 19 per cent said they would not vote, down 5 per cent compared to an April survey.
Meanwhile, the CEC ruled that no opinion poll results are to be announced on 24 June.
On election day, the disclosure of voting results will only be possible after 8 p.m.
Strategies for circumventing this rule -- such as releasing pop charts that rank the songs associated with specific parties -- will entail fines of anywhere from 250 to 2,500 euros.
Police Replace Army in Securing Macedonia’s North Border
Macedonia's border police have taken over securing the country's border with Serbia-Montenegro -- including Kosovo -- from the army.
The changeover is in line with European standards.

On 7 May and 8 May, responsibility for securing Macedonia's border with Serbia-Montenegro, including Kosovo, was officially handed over from the army to the border police.
The changeover, part of the Integrated Border Management Project, is in line with European standards, under which border security should be the task of police rather than military forces.
The border police now have responsibility for the country's northern, southern and eastern boundaries with, respectively, Serbia-Montenegro, Greece and Bulgaria.
In September, they will also assume control of the west border with Albania.
The 221km border with Serbia-Montenegro is Macedonia's longest, and includes six crossing points, as well as Petrovec Airport.
It is considered the most difficult to control, thanks to its high mountain ranges, and is often used as a corridor for smuggling drugs, cigarettes and weapons.
Securing it are 1,000 specially trained border police officers, 400 of whom are former army members.
To meet international standards, three to four border police officers should be deployed on each kilometre of the border.
For better co-ordination of control, the Macedonian police and KFOR -- which has responsibility for the Kosovo side of the border -- have established communication and will exchange liaison officers.
Authorities in Serbia-Montenegro have been formally informed about the change.
"I am expecting good co-operation with the local population and authorities to continue and improve [border control] in line with the expanded competences of municipalities through the decentralisation process," Macedonian Minister of Defence Jovan Manasijevski said. "Strengthening the confidence of the local population is a priority for successful fulfilment of border securing tasks."
The handover of border control took place without any problems, starting in the Tetovo area, then in Kumanovo and finally in Skopje.
Though areas along this border were involved in the 2001 interethnic conflict, the government -- with the help of international organisations and NGOs, has conducted a series of activities aimed at reconciliation, confidence-building and revitalisation.
Architectural War on Bucharest's Calea Victoriei
Projects aimed at conserving historic Bucharest have been plagued by lack of funds, while glitzy new buildings are leaving their mark on the "Paris of the Balkans".
Civic pride, though, may help preserve the capital's unique architectural heritage.
By Marian Tutui for Southeast European Times in Bucharest - 23/09/03
Romanians take pride in Calea Victoriei (Victory Road), a landmark in the country's history and architecture.
One of Bucharest's main streets, it was known as Podul Mogoshoaiei at the end of the 17th century, when it connected the Old Court in the city with the lakeside palace, located 18km away, of Constantin Brancoveanu, prince of Wallachia (1688-1714).
Paved with wood, and with beautiful buildings built along its sides, it was indeed a princely road.
In 1878, following the return of the victorious Romanian Army, the road was given its present name.
Now only 3km long, the road is not wide enough for modern-day traffic and has been a one-way avenue for the last 30 years.
Some of the major buildings which gave Bucharest the nickname of Petit Paris were constructed on Calea Victoriei.
These include the Romanian Atheneum (1888), the Central University Library (1895) and the CEC Palace (1900).
The famous road has survived two world wars, powerful earthquakes, and even the dictator Ceausescu's projects to redraw Bucharest along totalitarian lines, which had a negative impact on one third of the city's central area and led to the destruction of 20 churches.
The last ten years, however, have brought more changes than ever to Calea Victoriei.
New structures made of glass and concrete have been built, altering the atmosphere, while projects for restoring old buildings and churches are continually delayed for lack of funds.
On Henri Coanda Street, 100m away and parallel to Calea Victoriei, the two-story Macca House is in serious disrepair.
Yet it remains an exquisite building, prized for its exteriors and its stained glass windows, moldings, and furniture. It was built prior to 1906 and donated to the state in 1926 by Elena Macca for the purpose of housing the Institute of Archaeology and its collection of pre-historic, Greek and Roman sarcophaguses, statues, weapons and inscriptions.
A plan to restore the Macca House has been in the works for five years.
Architect Alexandru Beldiman's proposal would create an underground gallery with a partial glass roof, allowing the ancient artifacts to be exhibited in natural light.
The gallery would start from Calea Victoriei and Nichita Stanescu Park.
Though the plans have been widely praised, implementation continues to be delayed.
Projects to restore two churches on Calea Victoriei have met with more success.
The Kretzulescu Church (1722) was founded by a daughter of Constantin Brancoveanu and is noteworthy for its 19th century murals by Gheorge Tattarescu.
The small Stavropoleos Church (1722) is widely considered the most beautiful in Bucharest.
It preserves marvelous exterior decorations and wooden furniture, including an 18th-century chair belonging to Prince Nicolae Mavrocordat.
Restoration of the Stavropoleos Church has benefited from a donation by the US embassy.
Ceausescu became notorious for the damage he inflicted on Romania's historic capital.
Critics argue that some of the architects who encouraged him in his grandiose plans are still at work in the post-communist era, undermining the beauty of the city.
But just as a decisive civic reaction halted plans to erect Dracula Park near the medieval town of Sighisoara, residents of Bucharest can preserve their city's architectural heritage.

OHR to remain in BiH until government meets conditions
Finishing their two-day meeting in Sarajevo, the political directors of the Peace Implementation Council Steering Board stressed that only the complete fulfilment of agreed objectives and conditions can terminate the OHR's mandate in BiH.

Political directors of the Peace Implementation Council (PIC) Steering Board decided in Sarajevo this week that the Office of the High Representative (OHR) will remain in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) as long as the country fails to fulfil all five objectives and two conditions set at the PIC meeting on February 27th in Brussels.
Finishing their two-day session on Wednesday (June 25th) in Sarajevo, the political directors stressed that the signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) two weeks ago delivered the first of two conditions for the OHR's transition to the Office of the European Union's Special Representative (EUSR).
However, in a joint communiqué, they urged political leaders in BiH to fulfil the remaining criteria.
In this respect, the government must solve the problem of state property and military-owned real estate.
It still needs to legally define the status of the Brcko District to complete the Brcko Final Award.
With regard to fiscal sustainability, the establishment of the Fiscal Council is a must.
The government furthermore must adopt a national war crimes policy to entrench the rule of law.
The PIC Steering Board also reiterated the government's need to fulfil the second condition, obtaining a positive assessment by the PIC of the BiH situation, by fully obeying the Dayton Agreement and avoiding any inflammatory acts.
The Russian delegation refused to sign the communiqué because it insisted on a fixed date for terminating the OHR mandate.
"Other PIC members could not accept [the Russian] request as it would go against the entire philosophy, which is based upon results and not time," High Representative to BiH Miroslav Lajcak said afterward.
Some authorities, however, are demanding the immediate termination of the OHR.
BiH Prime Minister Nikola Spiric said at the PIC meeting that "those who call for the further existence of the OHR in BiH do not recognise the credibility of domestic institutions."
BiH presidency member Haris Silajdzic, leader of the Party for BiH, stressed that the majority of fellow party leaders attending the meeting opposed terminating the OHR at this time.
PIC members and the representatives of BiH institutions unanimously say constitutional reform is necessary and that such activities will commence after local elections in October.
"However, I do not favour the artificial connection of the OHR mandate with the new constitution," Lajcak stressed.
He said the next meeting of the PIC political directors will take place in Sarajevo in November.
Greece's Lack of Credit Control Results in Private Debt Proliferation
Greek households are being squeezed economically, while Greek banking institutions profit from a lack of credit control that has stretched the growth of private debt liabilities close to the limit.
By Vassilis Vassiliou for Southeast European Times in Athens – 20/09/05
Based on official national statistics, 60 per cent of Greeks spend all that they earn, and 30 per cent spend more than they earn -- a situation attributable to easily available loans and credit cards. [AFP]
Greek banks' incessant loan and credit card promotions continue, despite a rising number of unpaid balances.
The banks are simply unaware about whether or not their customers are in position to meet required payments.
Statements that overall personal borrowing in Greece is only a small percentage of the GDP reassure the public, but banks do not have a clear picture about the number of households on the brink of bankruptcy.
The private debt situation in Greece has reached crisis proportions.
The ratio of loans to savings has tripled since 2000.
Based on official national statistics, only 10 per cent of Greek households have savings; 60 per cent spend all that they earn; and the remaining 30 per cent consume more than they earn -- a situation attributable to easily available loans and credit cards.
Two out of ten credit card holders are over their credit limits, and make only the minimum required payments.
Balances accrue interest at a rate of approximately 15 per cent annually.
Collection companies are in their glory days.
Hired by the banks to compel payment of overdue debts, they call borrowers and pressure them to clear their debts immediately.
If such notifications fail to produce results, the law allows them to take measures, including garnishments, confiscations, even co-operation with bailiffs in cases of collusion.
There are now 21 such companies in operation, and the number is increasing.
The root of the problem lies in the banks' absence of knowledge regarding debtors' over-borrowing status.
Bankers use a common White and Black List system -- a database that should include all personal loan or credit card accounts, but by some estimates, only includes data on one in four.
The list fails to provide information on mortgages -- which can result in extensions of lines of credit to customers already burdened by large house payments.
The White List contains only new listings of consumer credits and credit cards debts.
Therefore, someone with older debts may, without much trouble, obtain a new loan from another bank.
In both cases, an over-borrowing status is not easily detected.
In theory, a Greek citizen may obtain a loan and a credit card from every bank in the country.
Credit control ranges from minimal to none, which leaves the average citizen facing the point where earnings fall short of increased debts.
Weekend Referenda Viewed as Turning Point for Cyprus
Whatever the outcome, Saturday's referendum in Cyprus will have a major effect on the island, Turkey, Greece and international politics.
By Mustafa Azizoglu for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 23/04/04

Described by strategists as "a carrier that never sinks" in the Mediterranean, Cyprus will experience its most critical day in 30 years on Saturday (24 April).
In twin referenda held simultaneously on both parts of the divided island, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots will vote on a UN-sponsored plan for peace and reunification, generally referred to as the "Annan Plan".
It aims to resolve one of the most important international problems and make it possible for a united Cyprus to join the EU on 1 May.
The Annan Plan is a 9,000-page document that is still under debate, even after multiple revisions.
Diplomats and international experts have not reached a consensus over what advantages it brings to each side.
Whether the EU will acquire the plan in legal terms is an unresolved issue.
For now, however, the only question is whether the referenda will result in approval or rejection.
The latest polls show that a no vote from the south and a yes vote from the north are the most likely possibilities.
A poll by the Centre of Public Research and Education Consultancy in northern Cyprus found that 62 per cent of Turkish Cypriots favour the plan.
Meanwhile, a poll by the Politis daily, taken from 14 April to 16 April, shows that opposition among Greek Cypriots has been decreasing day by day.
The no vote was 71 per cent on 14 April, 62 per cent on 15 April and 54 per cent on 16 April.
However, that trend does not mean that the yes votes have been increasing accordingly.
The poll found that the number of Greek Cypriots favouring the Annan plan amounted to 12 per cent on 14 April, 13 per cent on 15 April and 17 per cent on 16 April.
At the same time, the number of undecided voters has bounced. They totalled 17 per cent on 14 April, but rose to 29 per cent on 16 April.
The referenda will affect international politics regardless of the result.
The best result for the United States, the EU, Greece and Turkey is yes from both sides.
In that case, on 1 May, both communities of Cyprus will become EU members.
This will eliminate the obstacle Turkey currently faces in joining the EU.
If the result of the referendum confirm what polls show at the moment, the Greek Cypriot side will be seen as responsible for leaving the issue unresolved.
Such an outcome, analysts say, could bring about a lifting of the embargo on northern Cyprus, which only Turkey currently recognises as an independent state.
If both sides vote down the plan, it is expected that the referendum would be renewed, even after the southern part of Cyprus joins on 1 May.
For Turkey, the worst scenario would be approval of the plan by the Greek Cypriots side and rejection by the Turkish Cypriots.
That could lead to the isolation both of Turkey and northern Cyprus.
Croatian investors look towards 2008 market
Croatian investors have enjoyed seven years of growth in their relatively new market.
After stagnation at the end of last year, many are wary of what 2008 may bring.
By Ivo Scepanovic for Southeast European Times in Zagreb -- 03/03/08

Stock market and investment funds have become a popular vehicle for long-term investments in Croatia.
After a seventh straight year of continued growth, however, the market began to stagnate at the end of 2007.
Miroslav Jelicic Purko, who founded the Aureus Invest fund with Kristijan Floricic, spoke with Southeast European Times about his expectations regarding Croatia's investment future.
Southeast European Times: Has the morale of investors waned since the stagnation of Croatian investment funds at the end of 2007?
Miroslav Jelicic Purko: Morale does not apply to the world of investment.
There are only common sense and patience as characteristics essential to realize planned investment goals.
The stagnation of Croatian investment funds that you've mentioned was expected after seven years of growth in two-digit percentages on a yearly level.
Let's call it a normal situation at the market.
In Croatia, it smashes down the perception of non-experienced investors about a stock exchange as a panacea for fast and easy earning.
SE Times: What do you see as the main cause of the stagnation in growth of the market at the end of 2007?
Purko: When talking about the region, there are multiple reasons for stagnation: the Kosovo problem, a slow transition process, adapting to EU standards and a market that was not transparent enough.
One can also find a reason in the fast growth of papers of value that cause the realization of a profit.
The November 2007 elections were a contributing factor in the market downturn. [Getty Images]EU membership. [Getty Images]
SE Times: Were the November 2007 parliamentary elections in Croatia one of the factors attributing to the situation?
Purko: Parliamentary elections almost always cause instability because of certain political options that would create future developments.
Therefore, all the causes mentioned contributed to the stagnation and influenced the change of positive to negative sentiment.
It happened together with the stagnation of the world's largest economy, that of the United States.
SE Times: Do you think that, generally speaking, people in Croatia have more, less or equal knowledge of the stock market and investment funds industry in comparison with EU nations?
Purko: Every day, more and more people in Croatia recognize stock shares as a mode of long-term investment.
The syndrome of mass euphoria characterizes the behaviour of Croatian investors.
You can take that mass euphoria in positive or negative context, but in most cases, it ends with a stampede.
You can't say whether investors in Croatia know more or less than investors in EU, because the market is still very young.
There is no doubt that every new situation experienced in the market, especially in young markets like the Croatian one, educates investors and makes them prepared for future activities.
SE Times: Has the Croatian market launched preparations to enter the EU as planned in 2009?
How will that reflect on investment funds industry?
Purko: When observing the development of the market through levels of transparency, pension systems, the funds industry, and regulative activities, one can say that Croatia is getting closer to EU standards.
Over the past five years, the changes have been quality ones.
That makes me say that for sure Croatia would be positioned as an example for eastern European countries.
SE Times: What Croatian companies or industries do you think would profit from joining the EU?
Croatia's farming and agriculture sectors could reap benefits from EU membership. [Getty Images]
Purko: I would put the agriculture and energy sectors before the rest of the economic areas.
Croatian companies should orientate towards the EU because the food and energy sectors have problems there, as in the rest of the world.
Croatian resources are huge and the country would need to use then in that sense.
Of course, without quality reforms, it would not be possible to achieve the wanted results.
The future and the prosperity of the Croatian economy depend on executive authorities.
Their task has to be to create a system that would be a platform for development of Croatian companies and country's economy.
SE Times: Do you believe that Croatian investment funds will continue conquering the market of other former Yugoslav republics?
Purko: Croatian investment funds have allocated a big part of their portfolios to the region.
However, I think that Croatian funds were a bit late because Slovenian and Nordic funds recognized the region much earlier.
When talking about that market we need to say that the market risk should be calculated in a price.
SE Times: What was your experience with Aureus Invest in that market?
Purko: We faced problems of solvency, inadequate transparency and a big price volatility that led to increased caution when investing.
Aureus Invest will continue searching for opportunities in regional markets with increased caution, taking into consideration the above-mentioned facts.
Prices in the regional market should be backed by the faster development of corporate culture and adaptation to EU standards.
Croatia's war veterans' information appears online
A register of Croatian soldiers who fought in the 1990s Homeland War -- complete with classified combat data -- has found its way online for all to see.

A police investigation is under way to find out who is responsible for the biggest military scandal in Croatia in memory.
It involves the online leak of a secret document listing the names of 501,666 war veterans.
The register appeared April 6th on a website set up specifically to publicise the information.
The data included military history and privileged information such as specific combat units, the names of those in Special Forces and intelligence units, and duration of service during the 1991-1995 Homeland War.
Analysts warn that when sensitive information like this is made public it can lead to bias and possibly be used for retaliation and other hostile purposes.
Once the scandal broke, the website was visited so many times that it frequently crashed.
The site server is said to be US-based, with the person who paid for the domain currently unknown.
Marko Rakar, a Croatian blogger, web expert and former aide to Croatian President Ivo Josipovic, was questioned by police during the first 48 hours after the scandal broke but was not charged.
"I am completely innocent," Rakar told reporters after returning home from the police station.
He said he went to the police voluntarily after seeing on several internet forums that he was listed as a possible suspect.
"This is outrageous.
The data I found on the website, once I finally entered the domain, were wrong and does not correctly show where I was and where I served," War veteran Damir M told SETimes.
Damir said he has no need to hide his military past but does not want problems at border crossings with neighbouring countries.
Most of the public feels that the document has been kept secret to protect military personnel who served behind desks instead of on the battlefield.
Veteran status brings privileges such as higher pension, stakes in the Croatian Veterans' Fund and financial support in starting a business.
There are nine government ministers listed as war veterans.
Some public figures who never served during the war were shocked to find their names on the list.
The debate about whether the registry should be made public has dragged on for years in Croatia.
President Ivo Josipovic has favoured making it public but not under the current circumstances.
"Let the police do their work.
I still support the idea that the veterans' registry should be public but not without consent and proper regulation," he told Zagreb daily Jutarnji List.
Poll Suggests Lower Voter Turnout Will Benefit Smaller Bulgarian Parties
A new poll suggests that a voter turnout of 50 per cent in the 25 June parliamentary elections in Bulgaria will benefit several smaller parties, which are unlikely to enter parliament if more than 60 per cent of the voters choose to go to the polls.

Fifty per cent of eligible voters in Bulgaria definitely plan to participate in the 25 June parliamentary elections, the head of the Bulgarian MBMD polling agency said Sunday (5 June), announcing the results of a new survey.
Those figures, Mira Yanova said, would likely benefit smaller parties, particularly former Prime Minister Ivan Kostov's Democrats for Strong Bulgaria (DSB), which would likely be able to surpass the 4 per cent threshold for entry into parliament.
Should the voter turnout reach 60 per cent, however, the right-wing DSB would probably not pass the threshold, according to Yanova.
Nor would the nationalist, anti-Roma coalition Ataka, which has gained support recently.
The poll, conducted through direct door-to-door interviews with 1,213 eligible voters during the last five days of May, confirms that -- irrespective of the turnout -- none of the five parties and coalitions stands a chance to win a majority.
Previous surveys have also suggested a majority is out of reach.
According to the MBMD survey, in addition to the 50 per cent who say they will definitely participate in the elections, another 16 per cent indicate they will vote but have not decided for whom yet.
Thirteen per cent of the respondents said they were still uncertain whether they would vote, while 20 per cent do not plan to cast a ballot.
In the event of a 65 per cent voter turnout, and after a recalculation of the actual vote, the left-wing Coalition for Bulgaria, led by the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), would win 38.2 per cent of the vote, Yanova said.
The current ruling National Movement Simeon-II would follow with 23.1 per cent, the United Democratic Forces (UtDF) with 11.6 per cent, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) with 8.8 per cent and the Bulgarian People's Union (BPU) with 5.9 per cent.
Under this scenario, the DSB would only get 3.8 per cent of the vote and the Ataka coalition 2.7 per cent.
Based on these results, the MBMD predicts the following distribution of seats in Bulgaria's next 240-seat assembly: 103 or 104 for the Coalition for Bulgaria, 63 or 64 for the NMS-II, 32 for the UtDF, 24 for the MRF and 16 for the BPU.
The BSP have indicated that even if they were to win a majority they would still try to form a coalition government.
The MRF, which has participated in different coalition governments over the past 15 years, appears to be the most likely partner.
In other news, Boyko Borrisov, a leading figure on the NMS-II ticket and one of the country's most popular public figures, has announced he is suspending his candidacy.
While he did not give a reason, the decision comes a day after reports that authorities have foiled a plot against his life, reportedly involving Serbian underworld groups.
Croatia Officially Seeks EU Entry
The EU Council of Ministers is expected to discuss Croatia's membership application in April.
Croatia, which hopes to enter the EU in 2007, formally applied for membership.
(EUobserver.com - 24/02/03; The New York Times - 23/02/03; HINA, Reuters, BBC - 21/02/03)
On Friday (21 February), Croatia became the first Western Balkan country to formally apply for EU membership, which it hopes to gain in 2007 together with Bulgaria and Romania.
"Croatia is formalising its strategic goal of becoming an integral part of this new political entity," Croatian Prime Minister Ivica Racan said in Athens as he handed the one-page official application, co-signed by President Stipe Mesic, to his Greek counterpart Costas Simitis.
Greece currently holds the six-month rotating EU presidency, which will be taken over by Italy on 1 July.
"United Europe is an unprecedented challenge of the new era and Croatia has a right to participate in this magnificent process," Racan said.
He also acknowledged that, despite his country's strong progress in recent years, there was a lot more it had to do.
The application was accompanied by a multimedia CD entitled "RE: member Croatia", featuring speeches by Mesic and Racan, basic facts on Croatia, and photographs of its tourist and historical heritage and of its celebrated athletes Goran Ivanisevic and Janica Kostelic.
Commentators have noted that Croatia is more advanced economically than EU candidates Bulgaria and Romania, which are both more than halfway through their accession talks.
But it needs to make strong efforts to meet the Union's basic political criteria, demonstrating full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal and securing conditions allowing refugees to return to their homes.
"Croatia is fully aware of the principles on which the union is based - freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law... and we are determined to respect and promote them," Racan said.
An isolated country during the rule of former President Franjo Tudjman, Croatia has improved its ties with the EU since the reformist coalition, led by Racan, swept the nationalists out of power in 2000.
Simitis said the Greek presidency of the EU will forward the Croatian application to all members of the group in April.
If none of them voice any objections, the European Commission (EC) could start accession talks.
The EC is unlikely to announce its position on the request before mid-2004.
At a meeting in Paris on Monday, French President Jacques Chirac assured Mesic of his support for Croatia's EU bid.
A French government spokeswoman also praised Zagreb for its "courageous reforms" of the past three years.Croatian media, meanwhile, quoted a statement by Austrian Foreign Minister Benita Ferrero-Waldner saying that Austria would lobby for quick approval of the application and an accelerated accession procedure for Croatia.
She stressed Croatia's importance as a major trade partner with Austria.
Croatia seeks to become the second of the former Yugoslav republics to step firmly on the EU road.
Slovenia is among the ten East European countries invited to join the Union in 2004.
A possible EC decision to start accession negotiations with Croatia would send an encouraging signal to other countries in the region, which are also seeking EU integration.
Djindjic Escapes Alleged Assassination Attempt
A truck driver with local mafia connections and ties to a Milosevic-era secret police chief nearly crashed his vehicle into a car carrying Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.
Police are calling the incident an assassination attempt.
(The Guardian - 24/02/03; CNN, AP - 23/02/03; Radio B92 - 21/02/03)
Police in Belgrade are saying that a near-accident involving Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic was probably an assassination attempt.
A truck almost hit the car taking Djindjic to Belgrade airport on Friday (21 February) morning.The driver has a criminal record and alleged ties to a local mafia group, and is said to have received instructions over his mobile phone shortly before the accident.
"Our initial investigation shows that it was an obvious assassination attempt," AP quoted a police officer as saying.
Police sources said the truck made an abrupt swerve into the lane of the prime minister's speeding car, and only the quick reaction of Djindjic's driver prevented a crash.
Djindjic, who was on his way to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), proceeded to the airport.
The truck reportedly had Austrian license plates, and the driver has been identified as Dejan Milenkovic, nicknamed "Bugsy".
A police statement said he was arrested for driving the truck with "falsified documents" and that the investigation into the incident and his criminal activities would continue.
Initial investigation has shown that the Milenkovic, 33, received "a call on his mobile phone telling him that the prime minister's motorcade was approaching before he cut sharply across the highway," a police officer said. "Only a miracle saved the prime minister."
Commenting on the incident from Banja Luka Friday, Djindjic dismissed speculations that the near-accident was an assassination attempt, suggesting it was the act "of an irresponsible driver who was trying to learn to drive his truck on the highway".
However, after further police investigation, Djindjic concurred Sunday that the incident was an attempt on his life.
Serbian media drew parallels between Friday's incident and a similar one in 1999, in which four aides accompanying Vuk Draskovic, opposition leader at the time, were killed.
According to Belgrade media, Milenkovic had close links with former secret police chief Milorad Lukovic, known as Legija, whose name has come up repeatedly during Slobodan Milosevic's trial in The Hague.
UN prosecutors are trying to prove that the former Yugoslav president exercised direct command over Lukovic and his unit, which was reportedly involved in ethnic cleansing campaigns in Croatia, BiH and Kosovo during the 1990s.
Media reports have described the former secret police officer as one of the most powerful figures in Serbia's criminal world today.
Kosovo to boost privatisations
Kosovo hopes to accelerate the process with an overhaul of the regulations.
By Linda Karadaku for Southeast European Times in Pristina -- 21/09/11
The Ferronikel mine in Glogovac has been one of Kosovo's most significant privatisations. [Reuters]
Kosovo's privatisation process dates back to the UNMIK administration, during which the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) was formed.
It continued with the Kosovo Privatisation Agency (KPA), established by lawmakers in 2008.
So far, 295 state-owned enterprises have been privatiSed, including the Ferronikel mine in Glogovac and the Sharr Cement Plant, and 650 new enterprises were created.
"We believe that the privatisation process is the first step towards economic development, which means creation of stable work places," KPA spokesman Ylli Kaloshi told SETimes.
Trust funds administered by the KPA to handle the proceeds have collected 578m euros, with 537m of that amount coming fron the privatisation ofsocial and state-owned enterprises, he said.
The rest was from sale of assets by liquidation.
Workers receive a 20% share of the sale price after privatisation.
According to Kabashi, around 43.5m euros have been paid out to employees as a result -- 15m distributed by the former KTA over a six-year period, and 28m by the KPA.
The agency, however, acknowledges the privatisation process has not been a complete success.
Officials say one problem is Serbia's ownership of various SOEs and contracts signed during that era.
Another obstacle has been the slow pace of liquidations.
"The liquidation process has not achieved the desired progress," Kaloshi says. "The reason is the legislation in effect, which requires about three years for the liquidation of an enterprise.
There are about 600 enterprises to be liquidated, which means having this process continuing ... for 30 years."
"Therefore it has been considered necessary to make legal changes, a process that is being worked out," he said.
Substantial changes are included in the law on the Privatisation Agency, intended to drastically accelerate the process and replace outdated UNMIK regulations.
Parliament has approved the package in principle and its final approval is expected.
Kosovo analyst Ibrahim Rexhepi tells SETimes that the privatisation of social owned enterprises is in the final phase.
The two main challenges are Trepca komplex, which extracts and processes minerals, and the Brezovica tourist complex.
In the latter case, "the political problems and Serbia's pretentions for ownership are harshly reflected," he said.
Rexhepi believes the government should sell part of the assets of public enterprises, not so much to fill government coffers, bur rather to eliminate the state monopoly in certain segments.
But the sales should be done step by step to eliminate economic and social problems, he said.
Kosovo's Instutute for Advanced Studies, GAP, organised a debate on the privatisation process in April, which concluded that changing the legal basis for privatisation and drafting relevant new laws is an urgent issue.
Participants stressed, however, that the process should be transparent and not fast-tracked as were laws in the Ahtisaari Package.
The Law on the Kosovo Privatisation Agency was part of that package.

Turkey's state budget for 2003 will be the focus of discussions.
On 12 February, a number of Greek banks increased the interest rates on student credits.
The decision was motivated by unfavourable market conditions.
Foreign trade between Macedonia and Bulgaria has increased by 44 per cent year-on-year to $168m, Bulgaria's Ambassador to Macedonia Alexander Yordanov announced.

OMV's target is acquiring a 20 per cent market share in BiH.
Economic and legal experts attending a roundtable discussion in Banja Luka on 10 February agreed that the privatisation process in Republika Srpska needs to be updated, as it no longer responds to market realities.
Weak legislation was cited as one of the main problems facing foreign investors.
Romania's Ministry of Industry says 21 bidders -- including Exxon, Shell, OMV, Total Fina and Lukoil -- have shown interest in the privatisation of the oil and gas company Petrom.
The ministry has pledged to finalise the sale strategy for the country's largest company by 13 March.
Serbia's Privatisation Agency plans to offer for sale the Secerana sugar plant in Sabac, western Serbia.
The company suspended operations on 1995, due to large debts.
New Cuts on the Way for Greek Taxpayers
Greece's business community has welcomed government plans to overhaul the tax system.
By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 28/10/03
Two months ago, the government of Prime Minister Costas Simitis pledged to cut taxes, a move the opposition dismissed as making empty election promises.
However, an overhaul of the tax system is currently being presented to parliament and it does, in fact, feature generous tax cuts across the board.
The new system would be valid from 1 January 2005, when the fiscal year starts. It would introduce a simpler way of calculating taxes.
Rates would go down, income limits would go up, the Code of Bookkeeping would be simplified, and property values would be based on real prices.
The most important news is for businesses.
Tax rates currently at 35 per cent would drop to 30 per cent by 2008 under the Simitis proposal.
Natural entities would have a similar cut, from 40 per cent to 35 per cent.
In addition, businesses would be able to worry less about surprise visits from the taxman.
Currently, the tax inspector has the power to set heavy fines for minor irregularities.
Under the Simitis plan, however, inspectors would have to report any breaches of the Code of Bookkeeping and, depending on severity, the offending business would be penalised according to a point system.
The new system would reduce the taxman's authority and give the central government more control over violations, allowing it to maintain more complete records.
The business community has welcomed the proposed overhaul.
Spokespersons of the Chambers of Commerce from Athens, the Confederation of Greek Industries and other organisations related to local business communities have described the changes as a great step forward, arguing that they will help attract foreign investments.
Many of these lobbying groups have agreed to help implement the new system.
Simplifying the tax system would make things easier for citizens, too.
Real estate would be sold by means a simple solemn protestation made to a notary public.
The transfer tax would be paid on the spot, and the sale would not have to be mentioned in the Inland Revenue form.
For 2004, meanwhile, Simitis has made a commitment to raise incomes, reduce duties for fuel, cut the road tax, and introduce part-time jobs in the public sector.
This year alone, the government paid 950m euros in benefits.
Last year it paid 510m euros.
UN says progress in Cypriot reunification talks not lost
NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Progress made in talks to reunify the divided island will not be lost, UN envoy Alexander Downer said on Monday (May 3rd) after his first meeting with newly elected Turkish Cypriot leader Dervis Eroglu.
According to Downer, Eroglu, who won the April 18th elections in the north, promised to continue what predecessor Mehmet Ali Talat had started.
Greek Cypriots had feared hardliner Eroglu's election could put up serious roadblocks in the effort.
At his meeting with Downer, however, Eroglu said he would be happy to proceed based on what has been already agreed.
Talks are expected to resume later this month or in June.
Downer meets with Cypriot President Demetris Christofias on Tuesday. (Zaman - 04/05/10; AP, Hurriyet - 03/05/10)
Will Serbia's Amended Excise Law Threaten Foreign Investments?
While the Serbian government continues to seek out international capital, economists warn that proposed changes to the excise law could damage the investment climate.

Earlier this month, members of the Serbian Parliament began debate on proposed amendments to the existing excise law.
Among the most important amendments are planned increases in the excise tax on gasoline, cigarettes and coffee.
Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic says the public will not feel the effects of gasoline tax increase because the price difference of three dinars will be covered by the Gasoline Industry of Serbia (NIS) from its own reserves.
NIS director Zeljko Popovic backed Dinkic's statement, though he also stressed that the new costs will be felt in the wake of strong competition from Lukoil and other companies on the Serbian market.
Cigarette producers have not commented on the possibility of insulating their consumers by financing the increased excise tax on tobacco products from their own budgets.
Media in Serbia have reported that British American Tobacco (BAT) and Phillip Morris -- which became the owners of tobacco factories in Vranje and Nis last year -- are preparing a sharp response to the government's decision.
The contracts signed with these companies were conditional on the excise law that the previous Serbian government adopted last July with the support of the Democratic Party of Serbia and other parties.
Former Finance Minister Bozidar Djelic, who took part in the negotiations with BAT and Phillip Morris, said the current law stipulates gradual excise tax increases, resulting in synchronisation with EU and World Bank policies by 2010.
The first excise tax increase was planned for 2005.
"In this way, we provided a platform for predictable business conditions for those who planned to invest in our country.
When the president of Phillip Morris was attacked by some analysts for having paid a high price for Tobacco Industry Nis, he responded by saying that he did this because of business stability which was ensured by the excise law," Djelic said.
As for those proposed amendments, he said it would be "very detrimental for our country to adopt such decisions without consulting the three biggest investors in our country -- Philip Morris, BAT and Lukoil."
Djelic and other economists say the proposed amendments contradict the government's stated desire to attract foreign capital.
While there continues to be talk about wooing investors to Serbia, they say, the basis for attracting investment is being altered and possibly undermined.

Remains From Mass Grave in Macedonia Identified
The remains of three of the twelve Macedonians abducted during the 2001 crisis have been found in a mass grave near Trebos.

DNA analysis has identified the remains of three of the 12 ethnic Macedonians who were abducted during the 2001 crisis.
They are Dimitrie Dimovski, Simeon Jakimovski, both from Tetovo, and Krsto Gogoski from Neprosteno. Their remains were unearthed in November 2001, during the excavation of a mass grave near Trebos, a village in the Tetovo area where human bones and remains were found.
The Research Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology Research Centre performed the analysis, together with the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Art and an institute in Tuzla linked to the Sarajevo-based International Commission on Missing Persons.
The tests used blood samples from relatives of those abducted.
"Nine families gave blood for analysis," interior ministry spokeswoman Mirjana Kontevska said. "An effort was made to get in touch with the family of two brothers who were missing during the conflict so that samples of their blood could be taken and DNA analysis made."
The area near Trebos where the bodies and remains were found is still being searched, and additional tests are continuing.
"The data that comes from our centre is 99 per cent accurate and we are behind the results that helped identify the three people," said Geoffrey Binger, who heads the Macedonian office of the International Commission on Missing People.
Mihail Levinski, the government-appointed co-ordinator in charge of the missing persons issue, said there was no room for doubt.
"The procedure employed to solve this issue does not allow any improvisations," he said.
The results of the DNA testing have been submitted to the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague, which has taken over the case.
US supports Macedonia's NATO bid
The US wants to see NATO offer member ship to Macedonia next year, but emphasises that certain key reforms must take place beforehand.

US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice expressed support for Macedonia's NATO bid during a meeting last week in Washington with Macedonian Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki.
They also discussed the Kosovo situation, and Macedonia's military contributions to Iraq and Afghanistan, according to US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack.
"We have US support concerning the Adriatic Charter, and we expressed our confidence that together with the other partner countries, Macedonia has the capacity to meet the criteria and be a serious and well-prepared candidate for NATO membership, ready to accept an invitation at the Bucharest summit next year," Milososki said after the July 11th meeting.
In Washington, he met with Deputy Secretary of Defence Gordon R. England, National Security Council Director for Southeast Europe Burt Brown and US lawmakers and NGO representatives.
Although they vowed support for Macedonia's NATO bid, many officials underlined that key reforms must take place.
To become a member of NATO, Macedonia must strengthen judicial reforms, fight corruption and maintain its image of a multiethnic society and functional democracy.
Milososki said the government is prepared to give it's all and demonstrate results needed to convince all Alliance members.
Concerning Kosovo's status, Milososki said he was pleased that Macedonia's position corresponded to that of the United States.
"As a neighbouring country, we prefer a final status for Kosovo without intending to interfere, instead of maintaining the status quo, which is not a solution whatsoever," Milososki said.
The process for Kosovo's status should not circumvent Belgrade, however.
The EU should be encouraged to offer a clearer European perspective for the whole region, he said.
The visit also promoted the newly established Friendship Group in the US Congress.
The group will help strengthen ties and inform the US public and lawmakers regarding Macedonia-related issues.
"The United States needed 15 years after the independence of Macedonia to recognise Macedonia's constitutional name.
Today, it has been accepted by 170 UN member countries.
I hope the rest will do the same," Democrat Bill Pascrell said at the group promotion event during a Capitol Hill reception organised by the Macedonian embassy in Washington.
Turkish women struggle for better representation in parliament
Women activists in Turkey are calling for an increase of women in parliament.
They are expected to win only 30 seats in the 550-seat assembly in next week's elections.

Women activists in Turkey are disappointed with the electoral lists, which they say severely undermine prospects for better representation of women in the upcoming July 22nd parliamentary election.
The under-representation of women continues to be a major problem in Turkey, despite a growing interest and participation of women in politics.
Women candidates are expected to get around 30 seats in the 550-member parliament in next week's elections – compared to the 24 seats they currently hold.
Turkey ranks 127th in the world in terms of women in parliament.
In the past two months, women in Turkey participated in huge rallies in defence of secularism and against former Islamist Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul's presidential candidacy.
Women activists and NGOs constitute one of the most dynamic and influential segments of Turkish society.
Now, women activists say that under-representation of women in parliament is a major concern, hindering other efforts to overcome gender disparities.
Without ensuring better representation at the assembly, further progress cannot be achieved in putting an end to honour killings, violence against women and increasing participation and the role of women in all spheres of life.
The Association for the Education and Support of Women Candidates (Kader) launched a media campaign in March that asked, "Should we have a mustache to become part of the parliament?" The campaign received widespread support, and political parties promised to include more women candidates in their ranks.
"However, the finalised electoral lists are a big disappointment for us," said Hulya Gulbahar, a prominent women activist and the head of Kader. "The leaders of political parties, who had a final say on the lists are simply telling us nothing other than 'Yes, you should have a mustache to become a deputy' ".
Turkey's ruling Islamic-oriented Justice and Development Party (AKP) has included 62 women in its electorate lists, but only 12 are in positions for election.
The main opposition, the Republican People's Party (CHP), included 55 women candidates on its lists, but only 13 are expected to be elected, according to Kader.
The Democratic Party, the third party expected to pass the 10% threshold in the general elections, has 55 women candidates with just eight placed in the first three positions.
Gulbahar said that, although there were some women activists among these candidates, the majority are personal friends or wives of party leaders.
"The aim of putting these women on the lists is just for show.
Political parties have avoided including members of women NGOs and women activists on their lists.
Even if there would be 50 women deputies in the next parliament, their contribution to our efforts to eliminate gender disparities would still be limited," she said.
Gulbahar said the efforts will continue with a nationwide campaign to boost the inclusion of women in political party structures and local politics.
Russian suspension of arms treaty disappoints NATO
Russia's decision to suspend its participation in the 1990 Conventional Forces in Europe treaty is a "step in the wrong direction", NATO says.
(Euobserver, Independent - 16/07/07; AP, DPA, VOA, International Herald Tribune - 15/07/07; AFP, Reuters, DPA, BBC, RFE/RL, VOA, International Herald Tribune, OSCE - 14/07/07)
Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev says Russia's decision to suspend participation in a major European arms treaty is an "absolutely logical" move. [Getty Images]
NATO expressed its disappointment Saturday (July 14th) at Russia's decision to withdraw from a key European arms treaty regarded as an essential pillar of security and stability on the continent.
"NATO regrets this decision by the Russian Federation," said the 26-nation Alliance's spokesman James Appathurai. "It is a step in the wrong direction."
Earlier in the day, the Kremlin issued a statement saying President Vladimir Putin had signed a decree suspending Russia's participation in the 1990 Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty.
Russian media quoted the statement as citing "extraordinary circumstances ... which affect the security of the Russian Federation and require immediate measures" as the reason for the move, due in 150 days.
The treaty, concluded in November 1990 between NATO and the former Warsaw Pact states, set strict limits on the number of battle tanks, combat aircraft, attack helicopters and other heavy weapons the 30 signatory nations could deploy between the Atlantic Coast and the Ural Mountains. The pact, which entered into force in 1992, has contributed to a significant reduction in military hardware in the region.
The CFE treaty was revised in November 1999, several months after some of the former Warsaw Pact members joined NATO.
The amendments, reflecting also the changes following the disintegration of the Soviet Union, called on Russia to withdraw its forces from Georgia and Moldova.
The latest version of the agreement has so far been ratified by Russia and three other former Soviet republics.
NATO member states have refused to ratify it due to Russia's failure to fulfill its obligation to pull its troops out of Georgia and Moldova.
Moscow rejects any link between the CFE treaty and its troops in the two former Soviet republics.
In remarks following Putin's decree, former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who signed the original document, explained Moscow's move with the failure of NATO member states to ratify the amended version of the accord, as well as Washington's plans to build anti-missile bases in Poland the Czech Republic.
While Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov voiced hope that Saturday's move would persuade Alliance member nations to ratify the pact, a Russian military analyst was quoted as describing Putin's decision as "a deeply unfriendly act".
"The irony is that even though NATO countries haven't ratified the adapted agreement, they all observe its terms," Aleksandr Golts told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's Russian Service. "No one is going over the prescribed limit."
Russia's move is expected to put an end to mutual inspections, data exchange on arms deployments and other measures envisioned in the treaty. Russia could also boost its troops on its northern and southern flank regions.
Many European nations, including the Czech Republic, Romania and some Nordic countries, voiced disappointment Saturday at Moscow's decision.
Following a meeting of the 30 signatory states last month, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer urged Moscow not to abandon its commitment to the key pact.
"I strongly believe that there is no alternative to a good and healthy Russia-NATO relationship because NATO cannot do without its important partner Russia, and I think I can say that Russia cannot do without NATO," he said.
Rent cuts at Greek historical sites
Greek authorities published a "black list" of tax evaders in the country.
Also in business news: Croatia is expected to financially benefit from joining the EU.

Greek cultural officials announced plans last week to offer historical sites in the country for rent to the movie and fashion industry in an attempt to make up for a cut in public financing.
Although most of the sites have been available for rent previously, the new plan drops the rental fee by more than 60%.
All projects will have to be approved by the Greek archaeological council before given approval.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) said that the region will be more heavily affected by the Eurozone debt crisis than previously expected.
In its latest assessment of economies in Central and Eastern Europe that was released on Tuesday (January 24th), the bank now forecasts the seven Balkan economies will register economic growth of just 1% this year compared to the 1.6% that was estimated in October.

Southeast European (SEE) economies are experiencing the impact of the global financial crisis, experts from the Institute for International Economic Studies told Austria's Vienna-based Chamber of Commerce on Monday (March 2nd).
According to the experts, Croatia and Albania had the highest state debt by the end of 2008 with Croatia's reaching 54.5% and Albania's 53.5% of GDP.
The scientific director of the institute, Michael Landesmann, thinks the negative balance in Southeast Europe occurred after those countries lost access to the credits they used to finance excessive imports, as well as seeing a plunge in remittances from their diasporas and in Foreign Direct Investment.

BiH Refugees Returning to Work as Interpreters for US Army
Aida Basic and Selma Ramic were teenagers when they left Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) as refugees.
After studying in the United States and obtaining citizenship, they returned to BiH to work as interpreters for the US Army.
By Dusko Jovicic for Southeast European Times in Tuzla - 09/06/03
Many citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) left their homes during the conflicts in the country, fearing they would never be able to return.
In December 1992, Aida Basic, 24, was a 12-year-old girl in Sarajevo ready to leave for the United States.
"I had my luggage packed for one month already, but I couldn't leave without my mother.
A reporter was persistent and finally persuaded my mother to take me," she said.
In the United States, Basic faced challenges in high school because she did not speak any English at first.
" High school was tough for me.
I didn't feel comfortable with my English," she said.
Her mother decided to enroll the girl in a preparatory academy.
Basic began to excel in writing and enrolled in Lake Forest College in Chicago, Illinois.
She chose English as her major and hoped to become a journalist.
During her senior year in college, however, Basic was invited to work as an interpreter for a US Army BiH peacekeeping mission training exercise at Fort Polk, Louisiana.
That experience led to a job offer to work in BiH as an interpreter for Northrop Grumman, the defence contractor that provides linguist support services for the US Army in BiH.
"Everybody thought it was a good opportunity for me.
There are many jobs, but this opportunity to come back to BiH is one in which you learn a lot.
You're doing something good for the army and the people," she said.
Ramic, 26, faced similar challenges when she left BiH in 1992 at age 15.
"After one year in the United States, I felt comfortable speaking English, but I had difficulty with my vocabulary," she said.
Ramic adjusted well and graduated from York College in Pennsylvania with a degree in International Business.
"I consider myself an international person and wanted to work for an American company overseas.
Then I found out about the opportunity to work in BiH through a newspaper ad in New York City," she said.
"I feel great about being part of this mission.
I always wanted to come back to BiH and work as an adult."
Basic and Ramic are part of a growing trend of refugees who have returned to BiH to work as interpreters for the US Army.
Their success stories show that given the right opportunities, BiH refugees who left during the war are returning to build a better future.
Brezovica resort in Kosovo poised for privatisation
Kosovo Privatisation Agency's Board of Directors Chairman Dino Asanaj recently sat down with SETimes to discuss opening the country's premiere ski resort to investors.

Since the process to privatise Kosovo's Brezovica Ski Centre began in 2006, it has faced a slew of challenges.
"The Kosovo subsidiary of the Serbian Chamber of Commerce claims that the company is owned by Belgrade-based Inex-Interexport, and that Serbia has to do more in order to preserve the assets of its company in Kosovo," Tanjug news agency reported late last year.
According to UNMIK, the privatisation was launched by both the Kosovo Trust Agency and the Serbian Privatisation Agency.
"In order to reduce political tension and wait for the resolution of Kosovo status", the privatisation was postponed, according to the UNMIK sponsored TV show Danas & Sutra.
Kosovo Privatisation Agency's Board of Directors Chairman Dino Asanaj sat down with SETimes to discuss opening the country's premiere ski resort to investors.
SETimes: What are the Brezovica Tourist/Ski Centre privatisation procedures?
Dino Asanaj: The Privatisation Agency of Kosovo uses the spin-off method.
Essentially the assets of the state-owned enterprise (SOE) are transferred to a NewCO [new company].
This way it sets the assets free for immediate investments.
Old liabilities and claims are dealt with during the liquidation of the SOE [old company].
SETimes: Would you invite foreign investors to come, compete and invest in these facilities?
Asanaj: Up-to-date registered investors in the agencies' database are at about 8,482.
Out of these, 3,014 are pre-qualified, such as local and international investors.
Notably, over 30% of the total proceeds [sales] from privatisation are from foreign investors.
In this particular case, the 'target group' of potential investors will be those with expertise in the particular operation of this enterprise.
SETimes: How important is the privatisation for Kosovo?
Asanaj: SOE Brezovica Tourist/Ski Centre is located in the Shterpce/Strpce municipality in the southwestern corner of the Gjilan/Gnjilane region.
The neighbouring municipalities are Prizren, Suhareke/Suva Reka, Ferizaj/Urosevac and Kacanik.
The SOE Brezovica Tourist/Ski Centre is the only winter tourism centre in Kosovo having exceptional natural conditions for skiing.
The enterprise currently employs 225 people who are mainly working in hotel facilities.
Due to the fact that similar facilities do not exist in Kosovo, there are no significant local winter tourism competitors, especially as far as skiing is concerned.
The facility has all the prerequisites to become the best recreation/ski resort in this part of the Balkans.
It provides attractive views from the Sharr Mountain range and offers excellent climatic conditions enabling skiing from November to May.
Marketing efforts are very limited, as the main activity consists of direct personal contact with customers.
The resort currently needs a marketing plan, and extensive promotion, in order to capitalise on available development opportunities.
Russian KFOR Troops Leave Kosovo
Russian and NATO troops worked together to end bloodshed in Kosovo, the commander of the Russian contingent said at a ceremony marking the end of his country's four-year participation in the peacekeeping mission there.
By Seremb Gjergji for Southeastern European Times in Pristina, Kosovo - 05/08/03
The last Russian servicemen left Kosovo in late July, bringing to an end the country's four-year participation in the international peacekeeping mission there.
As the 10th and final unit of troops and equipment left, the commander of the Russian contingent said his forces had made a great contribution to strengthening security and establishing normality in the troubled Serbian province.
Russian troops had seized three kilos of drugs, more than 800 firearms and a large quantity of ammunition, Maj Gen Nikolai Kriventsov said.
They searched 92,000 vehicles, apprehended more than 1,100 suspected criminals for illegal weapons possessions and other crimes, disarmed 12,000 explosive devices, extinguished some 80 fires, and cleaned more than 150 wells.
The contingent marked its departure earlier in July in a ceremony held at the military airport near Pristina, which the 650 Russian troops used as their main base since arriving in Kosovo on 11 June 1999.
An exchange of medals and flags and a military parade commemorated a mission that had begun on a note of dispute but ended with an affirmation of unity.
Russian and NATO troops had worked together to end the bloodshed in the province, Kriventsov said at the ceremony.
"Together we wanted to have peace and tolerance in the region and we wish to all the people of Kosovo peace and progress."
Also present at the ceremony were Adm Gregory Johnson, the commander of the south wing of the Alliance; KFOR Commander Gen Fabio Mini; Russia's representative to NATO, Konstantin Tocki; and Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi.
When the mission started in 1999, Johnson said, "soldiers started out not knowing each other and perhaps not fully trusting one another.
But in four years we have built trust, shared responsibility and accomplishments, which carried us towards peace and prosperity."
A spokesman for Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova, meanwhile, said the Russian withdrawal and the restructuring of the KFOR presence should be seen in the light of the progress that has been made.
"We have our institutions up and running now, ready to take on more responsibilities for the running of our affairs.
I certainly see the withdrawal of Russian troops from Kosovo in this positive perspective," spokesman Muhamet Hamiti, said.
Russian President Vladimir Putin made the decision in May to withdraw Russian forces from Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Kosovo by 1 August.
Russian troops pulled out of BiH in June.
Defense officials in Moscow have cited financial considerations as among the reasons for the move, while insisting that Russia remains committed to the region.
Romanian court ends election squabble
Romania's Constitutional Court validated the results of the December 6th presidential runoff, paving the way for an end to the three-month political crisis.

The Constitutional Court validated Traian Basescu for a new term on Wednesday (December 16th).
Prime Minister-Designate Liviu Negoita also announced he has stepped down from the post to allow political parties in the country to discuss forming a majority government.
"Yesterday [Tuesday] I gave up my mandate ...
I consider that [political] consultations should take place without any impediment tied to me," he said.
The validation comes after judges in Romania's highest court Monday unanimously rejected the Social Democrat Party's (PSD) complaint concerning alleged fraud committed during the December 6th presidential runoff.
The dismissal of the minority government led by Prime Minister Emil Boc almost 60 days ago has left the administration incapable of passing laws and making crucial decisions.
All efforts to form a new stable government have been blocked by the PSD appeal.
The party contends that their candidate, Mircea Geoana, lost by less than 1% to incumbent Traian Basescu.
The complaint asked the court to nullify the second round of elections.
"The court turned down the application for the annulment of the runoff … filed by the [PSD] and the Conservative Party (PC)," the ruling read.
The court called the complaint by the two parties "inadmissible".
"The court validates Traian Basescu's election as the president of Romania after getting most of the valid votes," the court statement said.
The announcement followed a recount of just over 2,000 votes that were previously deemed invalid.
It didn't change the results however, -- the Liberal Democratic Party (PDL) candidate Basescu beat Geoana by 0.74%.
Basescu will be sworn in for a second five-year term on December 21st.
Geoana conceded defeat after the court's verdict.
"As a citizen of a democratic Romania, I accept the decision of the court and bid Mr. Basescu good luck in his new term."
"The battle for Romania's presidency ends here, but the battle for finding out the truth concerning the elections goes on," Geoana said, adding he will ask for the establishment of a parliamentary commission to further investigate alleged fraud.
The PDL has started negotiations with the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania and the minority and independent MPs to form a parliamentary majority needed to back the new administration.
The new political alliance is just two votes short of passing the necessary threshold needed to approve a new government.
But unrest in the PSD, sparked by the unfavourable decision of the constitutional court, may help Basescu's efforts.
There is also pressure from the IMF, currently with a mission on site, which insists that the new government adopt the 2010 budget before the holidays.
Turkey's Alevi festival
Anatolia's religious Alevi festival draws crowds to the pilgrimage site.

Alevis differ in their rituals and worship, such as in the Alevi ritualistic dance, while still following the Qur'an.
Music and dance at the festival takes on a form of prayer and worship.
The whirling dervish, with hands high up toward the sky, symbolises the moving of the universe.

Can football override interethnic divisions?
With Serbia in the 2010 World Cup, some Bosniak and Croat fans say they are ready to cheer the team on.

Visiting Sarajevo last week, Serbian President Boris Tadic urged Southeast European countries to cheer for the Serbian national team at the World Cup.
Heeding his call won't be a problem in Republika Srpksa (RS), where most view the Serbian team as their own.
But what about the rest of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH)?
"Considering that BiH didn't qualify, in South Africa I'll support Serbia.
We are close neighbours, which binds a similar mentality and customs," said Avdo, a Bosniak fan.
Zvonko, in Mostar, will also cheer for Serbia -- not, he says, because his wife is Serbian, but because attacker Marko Pantelic is his favourite.
Football has often been coloured by the national and interethnic quarrels that cost so much bloodshed in the former Yugoslavia.
Clashes in stadiums are hardly uncommon.
In late April, for instance, 40 people were injured during riots between fans of Sarajevo and Siroki Brijeg.
Their fans also clashed in October 2009, and one person was killed.
Muslims make up the majority of Sarajevo supporters, while Siroki Brijeg fans are predominantly Croats.
"The fans were the ones who channelled official policy and nationalism in the early 1990s in the former Yugoslavia," psychologist Srdjan Puhalo told SETimes.
In the international context, though, fans may be ready to put aside differences in the name of regional solidarity.
"I do not believe that the relations between the three peoples in BiH have dramatically [changed], but the alternative is simply missing," Puhalo said. "Who will you support -- France, Italy, England or Serbia?"
"Perhaps we are now at the beginning of a new process ... both in politics and in sports and in life in general.
Your neighbour is closer than someone who is far away, and you're also related to him," he said.
RS Vice-President Adil Osmanovic, a Bosniak, has already accepted Tadic's suggestion and said that he will support Serbia at the World Cup.
"I love football, and mostly, I love Brazilian soccer.
Now I'll definitely cheer for the national team of Serbia, because this is the only country from the former Yugoslavia that is participating in the World Cup," Osmanovic told SETimes.
Unease over Turkey's Iran stance
Ankara's "no" vote at the UN Security Council indicates a rift over how to deal with the nuclear threat posed by Tehran.
By Erol Izmirli for Southeast European Times -- 11/06/10

Turkey joined Brazil on Wednesday (June 9th) in opposing Security Council Resolution 1929, which imposes new sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme.
The two countries recently brokered a nuclear swap deal with the regime in Tehran, and appeared to be trying to keep their diplomatic initiative on track.
"We have supported the idea of solving the Iranian issue by diplomacy since the beginning [of the nuclear row], and as such, voted against at the Security Council on Wednesday, " Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday.
Twelve of the other Security Council members voted for the sanctions, while one -- Lebanon -- abstained.
Erdogan spoke by phone with US President Barack Obama hours before the vote took place, informing him of Ankara's decision to oppose the resolution.
He has also decided to send a high-level delegation to Washington on June 14th.
"Turkey's 'no' vote does not target the United States," the daily Hurriyet quoted Mehmet Yegin, of the Ankara-based International Studies Research Organisation, as saying. "Turkey had to stand behind the deal it brokered as a requirement of pursuing a consistent policy."
However, he added, the decision "certainly will have a price".
"I won't conceal the fact that we're disappointed with the vote that took place today," US Undersecretary for Political Affairs Bill Burns said at a press briefing Wednesday, summing up the mood in Washington.
Obama, during his visit to Ankara in April 2009, described ties between his country and Turkey as a model partnership.
But the two nations have been at odds over how to deal with the Iranian nuclear threat.
Washington -- along with fellow Vienna Group members France and Russia -- say the swap deal negotiated by Turkey and Brazil does not go far enough to allay concerns.
Turkey, which shares a border with Iran, has sizeable economic interests in that country.
Around 15% of Turkish natural gas is supplied by Iran and the trade volume between the two countries has reached $10 billion.
Ankara says sanctions are putting the brakes on trade, and thus impacting the Turkish economy.
"Turkey and Iran's trade volume … can rise to $30 billion if sanctions are lifted," Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu said in an interview with Kanal24 late Wednesday.
Despite this, diplomatic sources in Turkey say the country will implement UN Security Council resolutions, especially given its current status as a non-permanent member of the Council.
The latest sanctions add 40 companies and one individual to a list of those subject to an asset freeze, including 15 controlled or acting on behalf of Iran's Revolutionary Guard.
It urges countries to co-operate in inspections of vessels suspected of carrying prohibited cargo, and calls on them to block financial transactions if there are reasonable grounds to believe activities could contribute to Iranian nuclear activities.
Macedonian election winners seek to build coalition
With 44 parliamentary seats, VMRO-DPMNE must put together a coalition in order to take power in Macedonia.
According to a party spokesman, a preliminary deal has been reached.

The winners of last week's parliamentary elections in Macedonia -- VMRO-DPMNE and its partners in the For a Better Macedonia coalition -- have begun the process of assembling a coalition.
The party scored a decisive victory over the incumbent Social Democrat-led coalition, which garnered only 32 seats to the opposition's 44.
According to a spokesman, VMRO-DPMNE already has reached a preliminary deal that would give it 61 votes in the 120-member parliament. Talks are continuing.
So far, the proposed coalition consists of VMRO-DPMNE, the Democratic Renewal of Macedonia, the New Social Democratic Party, the Democratic Development of Albania party and possibly the Party for a European Future, according to the spokesman, Aleksander Bicikliski.
He said his party is still considering the possibility of co-operation with the Democratic Union for Integration, which was a member of the outgoing government led by Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski.
The election, Macedonia's fifth since independence, has been judged as fair and democratic by international representatives, who reported only isolated irregularities.
"The day of the elections was peaceful.
However, there were a few isolated serious incidents," said Audrey Glover, head of the ODIHR monitoring mission.
The United States and the EU also praised the conduct of the vote.
"These elections are a major step forward in Macedonia accomplishing its goal for integration in the Euro-Atlantic structures.
As such, this was a real victory for Macedonia and its citizens," a press release from the US Embassy said.
The embassy also urged relevant state bodies to examine serious election irregularities without any delay.
EU Special Representative for Macedonia Erwan Fouere congratulated the country.
"Well done!
You have conducted peaceful elections, and it is a major accomplishment for the country in relation to violent conflicts that occurred in the election campaign," he said.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn also congratulated the fair elections and said the new government is expected to continue with the European agenda.
Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski sent a letter to NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.
"The way the parliamentary elections were organised and conducted has confirmed once again the Macedonian citizens' strong commitment to continue their efforts for democratic reform and the Euro-Atlantic integration of the country," the letter says.
Constitution of the new parliament is scheduled for 26 July.
After that, the president has ten days to give the mandate to the majority party or parties, who must then submit a draft list of ministers and a working programme within 20 days.
Meanwhile, the State Election Commission announced on Sunday that it has rejected all 47 appeals submitted by parties in relation to the 5 July vote, due to lack of sufficient evidence.
By law, SEC decisions can be contested within 48 hours before the Supreme Court, whose ruling is final.
Rumsfeld: United States to Continue Support of Macedonia on Road to NATO
US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld visited Skopje earlier this week, vowing continued support for Macedonia's quest to join NATO.
But he noted the outcome would depend on the country's success in implementing all aspects of the Ohrid Framework Agreement.

During a visit to Macedonia on Monday (11 October) US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said Washington would continue to assist the country in its efforts to join NATO.
Rumsfeld met with Prime Minister Hari Kostov, President Branko Crvenkovski, Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski and Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva.
"The success in becoming a NATO member will largely depend on the success in implementing the Framework Agreement, which includes stronger and more effective local self-government units," Rumsfeld said. "The legislation passed this August will certainly help democracy strengthen in the grassroots.
The Macedonian people are facing a choice of a future with NATO and the EU where stability and economic growth can thrive, or a return to the past."
Buckovski and Rumsfeld signed an agreement on bilateral co-operation regarding the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
Rumsfeld said it "opens the way for our two nations in further fighting against this challenge".
"I think this visit is a confirmation of a new coalition," Buckovski said. "Macedonia is a part of the anti-terrorism coalition on the side of the progressive world.
As a result, I believe it will fulfil its strategic goals and become a member of NATO and the EU.
Clearly, we can make it faster and simpler with US support."
Kostov briefed Rumsfeld on an appeal sent to the EU's Proxima police mission, asking that its mandate be extended for another year.
Rumsfeld was also informed that the required 20 per cent threshold for employing members of the ethnic Albanian community in the interior ministry has been reached.
"[Rumsfeld] confirmed the progress our country has made in five years, in particular in implementing the Framework Agreement," read a press release from Kostov's office.
Crvenkovski said Macedonia would continue to be a sincere and reliable US partner as part of the global anti-terror coalition.
During his meeting with Rumsfeld, he raised the issue of three Macedonian nationals who went missing in Iraq.
Rumsfeld said the United States would "engage completely and do everything in its power to discover what happened to the three", according to a statement from the president's press office.
During his visit, Rumsfeld awarded honours to four Macedonian soldiers -- Stojance Patarovski, Marjanco Misackovski, Gorgi Stankovski and Stavre Cicevski.
As members of the Macedonian Army Special Task Force in Iraq, they took part in an operation to rescue US soldiers.

Less than two weeks before key parliamentary elections in Kosovo, a campaign kicked off Tuesday (12 October), encouraging voters to go to the polls. The 23 October vote, the fourth since 1999, is viewed as a major test for the international community's efforts to build multiethnic democracy in the province.
A pool of international organisations and NGOs launched the "Get Out the Vote" campaign amid indications of low voter interest in the upcoming poll and calls for a Kosovo Serb boycott of the vote.
Quoting one of the organisers, Kreshnik Berisha, the AP reported that 2,800 volunteers are taking part in the initiative, which includes television spots, posters, leaflets, T-shirts and a door-to-door effort.
A survey conducted by the Kosovo Institute for Ethnic Relations has indicated that about 25 per cent of the province's registered voters, mostly Albanians, may stay away from the polls due to continuing economic problems and disappointment with political parties.
Citing security fears, Kosovo Serbs have threatened to boycott the election.
Such a move, the British daily Financial Times(FT) reported Tuesday, could undermine the credibility of multiethnic democracy in Kosovo months before the international community is expected to decide whether talks on determining the province's final status should begin.
The ethnic Albanian majority is pushing for independence, while Kosovo Serbs are intent on seeing the province remain part of Serbia-Montenegro.
Many local leaders want the five years of international efforts to be seen as successful.
In response to the boycott threat, some leading politicians have sought to downplay the Kosovo Serbs' security concerns.
Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova, meanwhile, has accused Belgrade officials who encourage the boycott of using "aggressive, fearful rhetoric".
He also attributed the rise in tensions to the expected approach of status negotiations.
Serbian leaders are split in their positions on the boycott issue.
Serbian President Boris Tadic recently called on the Kosovo Serbs to take part in the vote, while adding that the international community must do more "to secure a normal life" for the community.
"But will the boycott save the lives of our people in Kosovo, will it improve their daily life, encourage the return of the displaced, and rebuild destroyed houses and churches?" Tadic asked.
Days after the president's televised address, the Serb List for Kosovo apparently submitted a list of candidates for the 23 October vote to the Central Election Commission.
UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen reportedly has approved the list.

The Supreme Court of Serbia confirmed on Monday (December 29th) the sentences for nine of the 12 convicted participants in the 2003 assassination of late Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.
It reduced the sentences given to the three other members of the group.
The court upheld the 40-year sentences given by the Belgrade Special Court for Organised Crime in May 2007 to Milorad "Legija" Ulemek and Zvezdan Jovanovic, the main suspects in the murder of Serbia's first democratically elected prime minister.
The judges had found Ulemek, a former commander of the notorious special police unit known as the Red Berets, guilty of orchestrating the attack on Djindjic, who died in a hail of bullets outside the main government building in Belgrade in March 12th 2003.
They also found Jovanovic, who served as his deputy in the Red Berets, guilty of pulling the trigger.
The Supreme Court additionally confirmed the 35-year sentences for Aleksandar Simovic, Ninoslav Konstantinovic and Vladimir Milisavljevic, all members of a criminal group called the Zemun clan.
It upheld the 30-year prison terms handed to two other members of the same gang, Milos Simovic and Milan Jurisic, and to former Security Information Agency officer Branislav Bezarevic, as well as the eight-year sentence for former Red Berets member Sasa Pejakovic.
The high court, though, meted out some clemency, cutting the 35-year sentence for Sretko Kalinic of the Zemun clan to 30 years, finding the shorter term to be appropriate punishment for his role in the assassination.
Taking into account Dusan Krsmanovic's confession, judges cut ten years off his original 30-year sentence.
Former Red Beret Zeljko "Zmigi" Tojaga saw his 30-year sentence halved, since the court ruled that he had participated in only one part of the plot to kill Djindjic, namely, an attempt on February 21st 2003 to stage a car accident in Belgrade.
The aim of the conspirators was to bring former President Slobodan Milosevic's allies back to power, halt pro-Western reforms and preclude any further extraditions of war crimes suspects to the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague, according to the verdict.
According to the Belgrade-based Beta news agency, the Supreme Court's ruling on Monday categorised the crimes committed by Ulemek as conspiracy for the purposes of anti-constitutional acts.
Court spokeswoman Vesna Dabic observed that Ulemek and Jovanovic, who received maximum sentences, now face a 15-day deadline to file appeals, if they wish to do so, and the Supreme Court will then meet to decide on the case.
Serbian government split over gas deal
Despite being hailed as the deal of the century for Serbia, the energy agreement with Russia and the sale of Petroleum Industry of Serbia (NIS) to Russia's Gazprom are causing huge controversy in Belgrade and serious cracks in the Serbian government.

After months of negotiations and controversy, the Russian gas company Gazprom purchased Petroleum Industry of Serbia (NIS) for 400m euros on December 24th, pledging to invest at least 500m more in the Serbian company.
The same day, Serbian President Boris Tadic and Russian counterpart Dmitry Medvedev signed political agreements on the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline through Serbia and the reconstruction of the Serbian gas storage depot of Banatski Dvor.
Despite being presented as the deal of the century for Serbia, the energy agreement with Russia has divided members of the Serbian government, because some parties see the deal as damaging to their country.
Deputy Prime Minister and G17 Plus party leader Mladjan Dinkic said Gazprom snapped up the oil company for much less than its real value, contending the country could have gotten up to 800m euros from the sale.
Dinkic, who says Serbia has not received firm guarantees the gas pipeline would traverse its territory, also hinted at the possibility of his party withdrawing from the government over disagreements with ruling coalition partners.
However, Tadic said that the decline in the global price of oil had conspicuously reduced the value of oil companies, including that of NIS.
Tadic also believes the document he signed with his Russian counterpart was guarantee enough that the Russians will build a gas pipeline that could completely change Serbia's economy.
The South Stream gas pipeline "is extremely important for the two countries, as well as for the entire Balkans, and will turn Serbia into a strategic destination for foreign investment and a central point for regional gas supplies", Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic noted.
However, according to the agreements, whether the gas pipeline will stretch through Serbia will not be known until September 2009.
Because of the global economic crisis, some analysts doubt the Russians can afford to build the South Stream at all.
"The passage of the gas pipeline is a very positive thing for Serbia. … It strengthens the country's geostrategic position and it will bring annual revenues … If Serbia gets the pipeline, then it is worth the sacrifice regarding the oil industry," French Ambassador to Belgrade Jean-Francois Terral said.
Serbia also expects natural gas prices to fall if Russia indeed builds the South Stream pipeline.
Belgrade is now paying substantial amounts for natural gas deliveries via Hungary.
If the new pipeline runs through Serbia, it also stands to earn money from gas distribution.
Households, businesses suffer as Albania faces severe electricity crisis
Many Albanians are now going most of the day without electricity, due to a crippling electricity shortage.
The country's communist-era hydroelectric plants cannot keep up with demand, and supplies from abroad do not bridge the gap.

Electricity restrictions deepened on Sunday (6 November) as the Albanian Electro-energetic Corporation (KESH) extended a mandatory blackout for both urban and rural areas.
The supply of electricity in urban areas is being cut off from 7:30 am to 4:00 pm.
In rural areas, the cutoff starts an hour earlier, at 6:30 am.
Electricity outages are alternated every two hours after 4:00 pm.
In some places, Albanians could face as many as 18 hours daily without electricity.
"Albania is obliged to adopt such a measure as a serious drought has affected hydroelectric power stations," KESH said in a statement.
In addition, the energy crisis reflects the poor condition of hydroelectric power plants -- the country's only electricity source -- and the lack of foreign investment in the sector over the past 16 years.
Built during the communist regime, the hyrdoelectric plants were never adapted to handle increased consumption.
Rising prices and the fact that some 30 per cent of consumers do not pay their bills have added to the problems.
Albania imports almost 5m kW of electricity a year from Macedonia and Greece, but the amount is nowhere near sufficient.
The country is negotiating with other countries, including Ukraine.
"We are continuing the negotiations, as our requests were unplanned and surprising for the Ukrainian authorities.
They are considering offering us electricity for the period November-December.
The electricity from Ukraine would pass through Romania and Serbia, so we are also negotiating with these countries to transmit the electricity," said Economy Minister Genc Ruli, appealing to the public to conserve.
"I can understand people's frustration, passing the main part of the day without electricity.
But we have to understand that we are in a national difficult situation and we are working to solve it," the minister said.
The rationing is further exacerbating the problems at Albania's water pumping stations, which were already in such bad shape that households could only receive water for about three hours a day.
The toll on Albanian businesses could be devastating.
"We are facing problems producing the bread.
As a businessman I cannot afford the high costs of using generators, as energy is lacking through most of the day.
What are we going to do and for how long will this last?" said one Tirana bakery shop proprietor.
"Our lives are mixed up now; my wife cannot cook the food," said one retiree.
Army, government deadlock ends in Turkey
An impasse over promotions to key military posts has raised accusations of judicial manipulation.

Turkey's government exploited the judicial process to win victory in a recent spat with the military over promotions, observers have claimed.
Following a weeklong deadlock in which the two sides failed to agree on appointments to top army positions, a deal was announced on Monday (August 9th) in which a compromise candidate will take up the key role of Head of Land Forces.
General Erdal Ceylanoglu was named to the post, traditionally seen as heir apparent to the top position of Chief of Staff.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan had objected to the army’s preferred choice of General Hasan Igsiz after he was called to provide evidence in an ongoing probe into an alleged plot to undermine Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) government by initiating and disseminating Internet propaganda.
Ending the impasse paved the way for General Isik Kosaner to succeed the current Chief of Staff, General Ilker Basbug, who retires on August 30th.
Most observers agreed that the outcome marked a significant victory for the AKP, which has roots in political Islam, in its power struggle with the military.
The latter sees itself as the guardian of Turkey's secular constitution and has often intervened in politics, including by ousting governments.
Veteran journalist Hasan Cemal said the events of the past week were of "historical importance". "
It could be described as a step towards the normalisation of Turkey," he told NTV News on Monday.
"In democracies, the last word -- even on military affairs -- belongs to the civilian authority."
But others claimed the government had exploited the judicial process to block the appointment of candidates of which it disapproved.
A week before the meeting, a court handling the ongoing investigation into a purported 2003 coup plot against the government -- codenamed Sledgehammer -- ordered the arrest of 102 military personnel, including 11 top officers up for promotion.
Under military guidelines, no officer who is the subject to a warrant can be promoted.
Finally, on the night the deadlock was resolved, a second court rescinded the arrest warrants against the 102 officers -- a move interpreted by many observers as a deal-making compromise offered by the government.
"These are manipulations," said Yusuf Kanli, a prominent political commentator.
Speaking to SETimes, he noted "Is it normal for a court to issue an arrest warrant for 102 people -- ten days before a military meeting -- and then rescind the same decision one day before the crisis is resolved?"
"To me, this is a clear violation of the independence of the judiciary and totally unacceptable," he said.
But Orhan Kemal Cengiz, a leading human rights lawyer, told SETimes that the meeting marked a victory for the rule of law.
"It sends a message to all the military officials that it's impossible, from now on; that if they are implicated in these kinds of plots there will be a price.
It's very important not to appoint the accused," he said.
Cengiz said he did not believe issuing the arrest warrants against officers ahead of the meeting was politically motivated.
But cancelling them probably was, he added.
