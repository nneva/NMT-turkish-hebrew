However, the education ministry says the education ministry will be implemented.
Education Minister Sulejman Rusiti told reporters that the conditions will be improved.
Many problems on the schools have been resolved in the last ten months, and the process will continue to continue.
The country's education authorities have completed new population, and new technics.

Romania and Bulgaria are expected to join the European Union on 1 January 2007.
Another candidate country, Croatia's accession process, is recognised.
Meanwhile, some EU members have been concerned with the Union's enlargement process, but the Balkan countries remain progress to join accession.
I hope that the countries will be progress in the same time; the economic economy, institutional and political negotiations in the region, in order to continue the EU.
I believe that the participation is a total for economic policy.
Meanwhile, "a competitive market economy" and the EU must be expected to discuss the capacity of a global economic capacity of the capacity of neighbours, such as the EU as well as the economic competition.
According to the European club, the traditional policy must be implemented by a country.
For example, for experience in the EU, a significant problem of the free capacity (centre) has been acceptable.
Meanwhile, new members will be in the situation of the new members or the region.
A competitive economy will be completed in this market, which will be used by a joint partnership.
In the EU countries, the financial financial financial sector, an independent central bank of property rights, and a special sector, such as a special sector, protected judicial system and implementation of institutions, such as protection of
The capacity of fight against corruption and organised crimes is one of the most important conditions.
It is stable.
Meanwhile, inflation must be working for the control of control of budgetary statements and control of the budgetary statements.
Economic stability, the budgetary restrictions and good administrations, have been discussed in both the public sector and private sector.
The major budget, according to the pension system, has been discussed with the property system.
Public institutions are one of the most important issues.
These institutions do not be a major transition to privatisation.
Some public institutions will be better to be published as public. It is not to improve a solution, as well as a solution.
The countries who have been completed, and the citizens' citizens should not have to provide high prices for the regional services.
Economic stability is one of the most important problems that many candidate countries. [EU]
However, we will need for some implementations that have been accused.
Meanwhile, the economic policy is expected to establish trade businesses.
A small annual inflation rate of 2-3 per cent has been a major goal for economies, including the EU requirement, which has been been discussed by 5-10 per cent.
The major growth growth economies have been confirmed with conflict.
The increase of local services' prices could be continued by the Balassa-Samuell.
The Balkan economies, Central and Eastern European countries, included a growth of 5% growth in the last years.
However, the growth should invest more experience, and more stable people.
The major budget deficits can be considered by the two elections.
The first can be considered by public services, such as business, infrastructure, education, education and health services, but the problem of the regional economic problems has been a serious and serious problem in the region.
The second will help new members to improve public decision in the framework of the new members from joining the EU.
It is the possible for the control of budget deficits.
The ruling general economic stability, according to the progress on tax progress (progress) and that the pension system does not continue to reform the reform in the state.
Meanwhile, the growth economies are not an important situation in the same time.
The economic growth in Central and East European economies, economic growth has been more great to EU membership, and the banks have been increasing private sector.
In the framework of the experience, the framework of the number of investors is also considering serious risks that does not support the direct investment.

In Bulgaria, the IMF is not expected to expect the budget budget from Bulgaria. In the last time, the country's current confidence of 12 per cent of the GDP, and the party does not provide the
We have recognised the competition of competitiveness.
The region's economies could be serious in the region, because they can be higher inflation differences, as well as higher inflations of high inflations.
Meanwhile, the competition and employment.
Meanwhile, unemployment, such as Western Balkan countries, will be more great in economies.
China and other Asia countries do not solve a solution to implementation of small values in the importance of implementing European markets.
The country's telecommunication proposed the importance of competitiveness in Europe.
Despite the protection of the long-term cabinet, the new development and communications technologies must be invested in the new development of new development, and to be serious investments.
The most important issues have been some important conflicts, but the problems could be considered by the problems.
The parties who working abroads about abroad, can create a 25-40 per cent of trade debt (Romania and Bulgaria) for millions of euros in millions of euros (Romania and Bulgaria).
Meanwhile, however, the financial forces have been received and many of the people.
Meanwhile, economies, such as Western Balkan countries, does not say that the unemployment of the unemployment rate is very higher crime.
As a result of results in the Western Balkan countries, the profession of economic demonstrations in the past years, they should not be pragmatic and the EU's new members of both and the former members of the EU.
