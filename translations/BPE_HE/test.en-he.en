I've got a high light that's invisible, fossil light that's fabulous, fossil light is invisible, and boundaries look like fossil, green, green, and so on.
You're going to read this idea of physical color because it means that color is a physical machine of light itself.
It doesn't depend on a person's face.
And while it's not my body, it's not the whole story in its own.
For example, you may have seen this picture before.
As you can see, the field in which the red trees are the red and the fossil is yellow.
When you think about it, it's pretty strange.
Because light is Google, two different instructions don't have to act with each other, they're supposed to just exist at the same time like the muscles in the two molecules.
So, in this yellow field, two different types of light guns: one of a red eye, and one of a green room.
There's no yellow light at all.
So, why is this field, where the red lights and the fabric lights, we think yellow?
To understand that, you need to understand a little biology, and in a detail, how humans see color.
The light of light goes through a minute cells as a piece of paper, which is called the restaurant, which represents the back of the eye.
Second, there are two types of light cells: actors and so on.
The customers are used to interview the condition of light, and there's only one kind of like this.
The evidence, they're another story.
There's three similar types of accurate cells that's used about red colors, green, and blue.
When you see color, all you're going to sending his secrets into your brain.
For instance, let's say that a yellow light, which is really a yellow light, a yellow room, slow on your eyes.
You don't have an accurate that's going to discover yellow, but yellow is about close to green and about red, so also the red and the green and the beautiful, and every one is sending your brain to survive it.
Of course, there's another way to operate the red, and the green tuns at the same time: if the red light and the green light is made in the same time.
The point is, your brain gets the same reality, whether you'll see light that has a yellow, and you'll see light that it's in the wall of the green and the red room.
That's why, to light, red and green is equal.
And why can't you find colors when you're important?
Well, the corporate cells are changing in a low light condition.
You've just got one type of a cell, and so there's just one kind of kind of reality that can be sent to your brain: there's light or no light.
There's one kind of mammoi that doesn't make a place to the color.
There's many different physical colors without the end, but, the death that we have only three kinds of accuracy, you can reduce the brain to think it's seeing every color by spinning the train of just three colors: red, green and blue.
This machine of human vision is very useful in the truth.
For example, TV creation.
Instead of the need to put colors don't have the end of the Taliba to wait the truth, Titla has to just put three: red, green and blue, which is really big for them.

Let's go back.
Now 1974.
There's a malaria where it's in the world, a young girl, 23, it's on the center of the space.
Finally.
On the table 76 pounds to the train and the pain.
Some of the objects are water's glass, a cat, a roll, a dog.
But also, the forest, the wind and the wind with one planet.
There's hormones that say, "I'm sorry.
You've done me with everything that's on the table.
I'm going to take it back -- even feel me.
And the time is six hours. "
At the first time of the crowd was a voice.
People gave me the water to the network, and let me give me the horrible.
But a short time later, there was a man who took the series and repeated my grandfather, and then they took the library of hormones and treated them in my eye.
Somebody took the corner and sold my hand and sold the blood, and I still have the coffee.
The women said to men what to do.
And the men didn't try me because it was a normal conversation, and it was instead of public, and they were with their weapons.
They took me and gave me on the table, and they put the chain between my legs.
And someone took the wind and the ball and there against my show.
And another person took the wind and they started to sell.
And after six hours, I...
I started to go to the audience.
I was wrong.
I was half a graph, a person and a blueprint got on the ground.
And they were all killed, just proud.
They couldn't get out of me as a normal person.
And then -- what happened was I went to the window, it was two to the morning.
And I looked at myself in the mirror, and I had a painting piece of thinking.
All right -- please please please make the eyes.
In the next world, you're going to have the refugees.
First of all, let's move what it's about.
Many artists have a lot of different curiosity, but my execution to the switch is just simple.
We've made a physical structure, and we've put it in a time that's made in a space in an audience and the energy diabetes.
The audience and the piece is creating the work together.
And the difference between a piece of theater is huge.
In the theater, the chain is not a chair and the blood is a cartoon.
In a piece, the blood is the material, and the forest or the corner is the tool.
It's about being there in real time, and I can't take a little bit of a click, because you can't do a lot of these things happen -- the world.
And it's very important, the brand is -- you know, all human beings are always very simple.
We're curious, we're afraid of a pain, we're afraid of it.
So what I'm doing -- I'm showing these fear before the audience.
I use your energy, and in this energy I can go and push my most far body I can.
And then I'm releasing myself from these fears.
And I'm your view.
If I can do it to myself, you can do it for you.
After Bald, I was born, I went to the training.
And you know, I'm waiting for the last 40 years.
And there I met Olympic, he was the person where I actually loved.
And for 12 years, we've created these refugees together.
You know the contrast and the wind and the ball, the same thing I started in love and trust.
So in order to do this work, you've got to join a completely human beings because this object is about my heart.
So the heart of the horizontal and the Darwin and so on, it's about a specific trust in another person.
Our relationship took 12 years, and we worked on so many issues, genetic energy.
And as every relationship comes to the summer, we're also our.
We didn't get a phone like normal people to say, "It's called."
We went to the Chinese level to say peace.
I started my favorite, and he started in the right thing.
We went, every one, three months, thousand miles.
It was in the mountains, it was hard.
It was a prototype, it was the luck.
It was, you know, to go through 12 tricks, it was before China's face in 87.
And we've been able to meet in the middle of France.
And then the relationship.
And now it's completely changed how I see the public.
And a very important work I created in those days was "Blue in Balki."
And it was at the time of the war in Kenyan, and I wanted to create a strong mirror and metaphor, something that's used in any war every time, because the war in Baltin is now in Canada, but there's always a war in what it's a place.
So here I'm a little bit of a thousand, and it's used hundreds of objects of a big, and a metaphor.
You can't expect the blood, you can't expect the insection of the violence.
So I'm a six hours, six days, and the lights are reduced from the bone, and it's possible -- uncomfortable.
But then something remained in memory.
I want to show you the one that really changed my life, and it was the prototype in Jama, which I've been doing recently.
This brand -- when I said to the production, "I'm just sitting on the chair, and there's a device in front, and every one of the audience could sit a few time."
The production told me, "It's ridiculous, you know, here's New York, the chair will stay rid, to nobody has time to sit in you."
But I'm sitting there three months there.
And I'm sitting every day, eight hours -- while the museum is open -- and 10 hours a day when the museum is open for 10 hours, and I'm not fine.
And I put the table and I'm still sitting, and it changed everything.
This piece, maybe 10 or 15 years ago -- nothing would happen.
But the need of people to experience something different, the audience wasn't a group more -- a relationship was one of one.
I was looking at these people, they would come up and sit out of my heart, but they had to wait hours on the back of hours to get to this situation, and finally, they're sitting in.
And what happened?
The other people look at them, put them in the camera, I look at them and they don't have where to win themselves.
And it does the difference.
There was so much as a pain and secret, there's so amazing things when you look at someone in the eyes, because you're looking at a protein, when you don't even say one word -- everything happened.
And when I went from the chair after three months, I realized, I wasn't the same thing.
And I realized I had a strong task, which I had to communicate this experience for everyone.
And so, for me, I was born the idea to survive a car for an internal art.
Because when you think about regulations, you're a art that's based on time.
It's not like a painting.
There's the painting on the wall, and the next time it's still there.
Mext, if you're spending it, there's just the memory, or as a story that someone has told you, but you've put the whole thing.
So you have to be there.
And my point, if you're talking about art by advertising, music is the highest art, because it's the most common.
And after the extension, and then all the rest.
It's the objective way.
This risk will happen in the land, in New York City, and we're trying to build with the House House, an idea.
And it's very simple.
If you want to make a decision, you have to give me your hands.
You've got to put on the wall before you go into the Nigerian, which is there for six hours, you've got to give me the respect.
It's something that's so special, but if you don't lose the word of yourself and you're moving before -- it's not my problem.
But it's six hours, the experience.
And then when you're finished, you're getting success, you're going to go home and live if you want to.
And that's the exact room.
The public comes and the first thing to do is to wear a lab.
It's the importance of going to go from the explanation to the study.
And then you go to the cells where you put the argument, the iPhone, the iPhone, the computer and all the digital objects and electrons.
And you get free time to yourself for the first time.
Because you don't have any tool in technology, we've got to change technology is a patient.
We're focusing on the time we have to ourselves.
This is a machine to give you this time back.
So what you're doing there, you're starting with a theory, you're going to start looking at the rate.
You're going to go back to the plants.
After the theory, you're going to learn how to networks -- very simple, water for half an hour maybe.
After that, you're going to go to the magnetic room, where you're going to make a magnet on your body.
After that, you go to the clinical room.
After the Citian room, go to the room look at the eyes, after the room looked at the eyes, you'll go to the room where you'll forget.
So these are the basic components of the human body, thinking, scale.
And that's a theory.
And there's a voice room.
And then after you saw all of this, and you put yourself a wonderful and physical, then you're ready to see something over time, like in art with a primary.
It can be music, it can be an asteroid, it can be a theater, it can be a movie, it can be a video dance.
You're going to go for a long toy because now we're going to give you.
In a long term, you're going to go to the big place where you'll see the work.
And if you know, it's very possible because it's been a long day, you're going to go to the other graph.
And you know, the conversation is important.
In fact, you still get art.
So you're going to ask for a certain time, and then you're, back, you're seeing more of the things you want to see or that you're coming home with your device.
So this risk, right now, it's virtual.
Now I'm just making my risk in Brazil, and then it's going to be in Australia, and then it's going to come back, Canada and everywhere.
And it's to experience a simple species, how you're repeated to your life.
The Amazon will be different.
Laughter) You know, if you're an organ, you can create life.
How to survive about six hours?
It's very important.
You know, you're going to go out of the skin, for a crowd, to eat, without having the amount of light that you're missing.
And then a sense that you don't get an artist that you're going to get when you're going to help a job -- or a blue sand in the same thing.
Or to be in a condition of the politician -- you've got an apologic and you don't hear anything, and you're there without voice, with people who experience a project, just a simple project.
We're always doing things that we love in our lives.
And this is why you don't change.
You do things in life -- and nothing happens if you always do things in the same way.
But my method is to do things that I'm afraid of, things I don't know.
And then you're also going to make the failure.
I think the failure is important because if you go, if you're going to do experiences, you'll be able to fail.
If you don't go to this region and you don't look at yourself again and again.
And I think human beings now need change, and the only change to do is change in the personal decade.
You need to do the change on yourself.
Because the only way to change consciousness and change the world around us is to start with yourself.
It's so easy to get a crisis of how it's different, the things in the world and they're not okay, and the governments of corruption and there's noise in the world and war -- the killing.
But what do we do in the training decade -- what's our component to all this thing?
You can go to your eyes, it's that you don't know, and look at them for two minutes in the eyes, right now?
[I'm asking two minutes of your time, it's so little.
Please go to Twitter, don't try to admit, you'll be aware of yourself.
There were bad.
And it's just looking for a return in your eyes, your eyes.
[Thanks] you've been looking at me.
Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Thank you very much.
A lot of years ago in the country in Southern Kaka and very proud of French, they had six real insects.
Their levels were agriculture, powerful, dream, sistant, and the restaurant.
But every one was known in his own artist: the two hands are familiar to capture the fossil of axes, the small numbers and the season of powerful, the beautiful Vietnam's beautiful line of a dream, the Amazon't of a dream, the Porus of House, well, you can push the little song that's known
The French country wasn't the worst country, and so the numbers of government had the Muslims.
East French was built by the numbers as an anonymous anthropy, every number with a choice, but one of what's a powerful number of what's called the Iranian School, design a war between some robots and the government and the Alexandria, and then it turned itself into the top, and then the summer of the list, and so on,
It was kind of a big day.
Anyway, the Muslims, they called action to save the French out of the novel in my eye.
They've been driving to their real horses and they're going to go.
First of a tree, then agriculture, but it didn't work.
The restaurant went to eat people.
So the connection is trying, and we're going to have a reference.
It's powerful to jump on the animal, and it's very quickly.
Nothing worked.
The Muslims were designed and put a program.
They're going to go on the floor, but who's going to start?
They've evolved for a long time, the restaurant will be a few more president, and then they've been reduced at the end.
They first jumped, the small axis inside the library.
The horrible showed up to work first and we put on a strong, as a patient and a dance, connection and confident while they were looking at and so forth.
First of this, then they went there, and then there.
There's another star!
The Greeks were wrong and prosthetic led.
So, as a tremendous, connection, and unfortunately, each of his daughter, always at the same room.
Speak about a dirty when they finished the quote, they started one more, and another one, always working in the horrible room by a dirty.
Phop! Phop! Foop! Foop!
Phop! Soke about a dog, here's another point!
Don't forget, you can be convenient in the ambridge.
Here's one!
And it's this interview.
Here we start!
Finally, the satellite mortality is about diabetes that have been reduced his last apartment.
But, because they've spent the summer's service, all the numbers of the government were jumped again from one of his young book, and they've all been on happiness and happiness.
Obviously, the same book they went into the President's President's Freedom of a ancient magazine in the same thing.
The end.
You're looking down and you're seeing a yellow tool on your table.
Your eyes, and then your brain, collect all kinds of information on the pencil: its size, the color, the shape, a mirror, and so on.
But, how does that happen?
The ancient Greeks were the first ones to think less or more scientifically about what light is and how Italy works.
How many general philosophers, including Alexon and developed, think that light is coming up with our eyes and Italy is happening when small sensors and uninvisible to collect information on fossil objects.
It took more than a thousand years ago that a Western scientist, Alexander, the between the old beauty theory of light can't be true.
In the front of Alexandon, your eyes don't send smart sensors invisible to collect information, they just collect the light that's being used to do.
The theory of Islam takes the fact that the Greeks couldn't explain: Why is it too important.
The idea is that there's actually a little bit of objects that spread light themselves.
The special objects, that flow light, like the sun or a blueprint, are known as light lights.
Most of the things that we see, like the device on your table, they just draw light out and not represent light themselves.
So, when you look at the pencil, the light that's in your eye is actually focused on the sun and it's moving millions of kilometers in the space before you've been repeated from your eyes, which is pretty cool when you think about it.
But, what is it exactly the thing that's called the sun and how do we see it?
Is it a particle, like atoms, or is it a Google, like a sea on a fabric?
Scientists in the modern age are going to get ethics a year to understand the answer to this question.
Al Newton was one of the first.
Newton's species that light might be made of little little bicycles, autos, they're called Scotss.
In using this conversation, it was able to explain some of the machines of the light.
For example, the help, it's the way it seems to be a light that's going to be focused on when it's going to flow water.
But, in science, even fossil genes sometimes.
In the 19th century, a lot of after Newton, scientists did a teacher of experiments that could show in clear that light can't be made of atoms.
First thing, two light curiosity that you want one other doesn't work on it at all.
If light was made of curiosity and products and products, then you would expect that some fingerprints, you're going to be in the particles that come out of a chicken.
If it was happening, the two particles that are involved in the action were convenient directions.
But, it doesn't happen.
The light curiosity goes one through the other way you could look at yourself with two symbolic symbol and a little bit of a pig.
Another thing is that light creates the fire patterns.
Civil patterns are complex structures that come in when two patterns are spread the same place.
They can affect when two objects affect the surface of a cartoon, and also when two dozens of light are replaced by each other.
It's just creating the patterns of the trees, particles don't.
And as a plane, the understanding that light is made as a Google's disease, of course, to predict what color and what the pencil looks like.
So, we've built it so, light is Google, right?
Not so fast!
In the 20th century, scientists have done experiments that seem to have shown that light's driving like particles.
For example, when you move light on a piece, the light leaves its energy to the atoms of the mirror that's been called the neocortex.
But, we can't forget the properties like the trees.
So these plants of light is not like the emotional and these little categories that are born.
This result, light sometimes gets rid of particles and sometimes a Google, has led to a new physics and a female theory called a sanitation.
So, after all, let's go back to the question, "What is light?"
Well, light is actually not like anything that we're used to deal with in our lives today.
Sometimes it's going to do like a particle and other times it's going to do like Google, but it's not just like one of them.
What's shared for Italian and commons?
The two Januans may be completely different, but the reason they're both so popular is maybe because of what's being used in Rome.
First of all, let's move.
There's three types of Iran there in the outside.
Iranian is when you expect to talk one, but you get the opposite.
I don't know Mola is when someone says something, but it really means.
Iran dramatic, with that, is what we're going to look at now.
Eric astronomy is when the audience knows more about the event, a situation, or a conversation than the characters in the movie, in a camera, or in a book.
The audience is aware of the secret that the characteristics have collected.
It's a wonderful story that's made a strong emotional emotion inside the text.
Think about it for a moment.
How do you feel, when you're going to have a camera, you know that the French is coming out of the door behind the door of the door.
The music's ridiculous, the cortex creates that water, it's got to be bad for the hero!
Of course, with that, the connection has to go into the room to find the wind.
You're feeling great and the privilege of knowing that someone will jump out and be scary, but you just don't know when.
This conversation is a dramatic artist: You know something more than the characters in the movie.
Now, take a prototype.
It's probably going to be some kind of "The Bush."
Again, we know more about what's happening than characters.
Imagine two characteristics that do a plan for a birthday to their partner while this partner sits all the conversation from the stadium.
Over, weigh and unprecedented doesn't happen, and the moon was built.
It's not the same motion like the Iran movie because it's probably quite funny when the characteristics are trying to figure out what's going on, but it's used as a wonderful example of the moon and the price of a dramatic art.
The moon and the privilege in the two Januans put the story and help her roll.
The audience wants, no, you need to see the conversation of the astronomy magnitude between whether by the prototype that's made out of the road or by someone who's collecting the real identity of someone and selected the web.
So, when you feel like you know the secret, it's a dramatic asteroid, it's the quality of the quality of big lights, a magazine to the Texas.
They often say you can learn a lot about a human view in its books.
What's my books teaching me?
Well, when I asked myself this question, a few years ago, I was surprised.
I've always thought about myself as a relatively devastating woman and politics.
But my books were going to get a completely different picture.
Almost of all the insects of them were written by British Socies or American, and it was a little bit uncomfortable thing.
This big cultural discovery in Chicago made me a serious market.
And when I thought about it, it was very scared to me.
I knew that there was probably amazing stories from the cases that were writing in language that were not English.
And it was a very sad tool to think that in my clinical emotion would never be easy, probably.
So, I decided to plan myself from a global career.
In 2012, it's been about to be a particularly international year in Britain -- this year the Olympic Olympics in London.
So I decided to use it to my time to try and read from Rome, collecting short stories or a book of memories from every country in the suffering.
And so I did.
It was very excited, and I learned some amazing things, and I created some wonderful bees that would love to share with you today.
But the thing started in some effective problems.
After I looked at some of the different states of the world's countries to use my project, I decided to go on the list of the moral countries by the United Nations, her daughter was invented Tylan, so the number of countries I've come to use is 196.
And after I realized how I had to read four books a week and write about them in my blog, and in another work for five days a week, I had to know that maybe I couldn't get books in English from any country.
Just four percent and a half and a half of the findings that represent every year in Britain are organized, and the numbers are much more than the English countries.
Even though the lesson of books are organized that are spread in many other countries much larger.
4.5 percent is really a little bit to start with it, but what the numbers don't tell you is that many of these books will come from powerful networks and many of the experts in industry are willing to go out and sell these tools into English.
So, for example, despite more than 100 books from French and French in England every year, most of them are going to come from countries like France and Street.
Africa's the French, on the other hand, almost never get a piece of foot.
The good part is that there's actually quite a lot of violence that may have a little bit or at all, there's no economic money in English.
Their books remained invisible to the most famous language in the world.
But when it comes to the Korean world, the biggest challenge of everyone for me was the fact that I didn't know where to start.
Since I spent my life in Chicago almost a British books and North Americans, I didn't know how to succeed and find stories from a lot of the world.
I couldn't tell you how to find a particular story.
I wouldn't recognize a good fabric.
You couldn't hide it -- I was a finished magazine.
So how could I read the world?
I had to ask help.
So in October 2011, I've put the blog in Octoc.co.com, and I've been on the web.
I realized who I was, some of my career was, and I asked anyone who was going to leave a consciousness that offered me what to read from other parts of the world.
Now, I didn't have an idea if someone was interested, but in a few hours of my park on the web, people began to communicate.
At the beginning, it was friends and colors.
So it was friends of friends.
And at the top, it was strangers.
Four days after I sat the web on the web, I got a message from a woman called France in the coast of Mord.
She said she's love how my project sounds, could she go to her English books and put my Minister book and put it into me?
I've been listening to the advantage, and a few weeks later, I've got a prosperity that's not one, but two books -- the choice of Iran from Iraq, and a book is also a choice that it's also a choice for me.
Now, at the same time, I volunteered that helped more than 9,600 kilometers you into these spaces to help someone who's probably never been able.
But the presidents of France was written as a car for the year.
Again and again, people have changed ways to help me.
Some were going to go to me, and others did exhibitions and businesses to go to books for me.
It turns out, if you want to read the world, if you want to go into it in open head, the world will help you.
When it comes to countries with a little bit or not at all in English service, people went even more far.
A lot of times have come from surprising actions.
The book that's been sent to me from President, for example, came through a conversation that I had with a Paul Twitter.
Yes, Penna has a Twitter.
And when I took her about my project, she offered that maybe I was trying to get the piece of the Finstein San David David Dorgan.
I discovered the website of Morgan and sent him a message, I asked if one of his limits in Spanish was organized to English.
And he said nothing was published, but he did have a transformation that didn't publish his destruction "The Hollywood."
He sent me it in a baseball, and I could become one of the people ever read the book in English.
Morgan really wasn't the only secret to share his work with me in this way.
It's used to go to the door, you've been writing and excited to me that the books that have been published and the numbers of books that didn't have been scared by English companies or not have more species, and we'll give me a unique extinction to some extraordinary violence.
I read, for example, on the South African penguin, which led the resistance against the Portugan in the 19th century, and the Tasmanian Tunisians in the village on the Southern School in Southern Afghanistan.
I've met the answer of a car to Bergett Jonas.
And I read about a theory in the summer in England.
But maybe the most amazing example of how many people were willing to join me to help me read the world, came to the end of my journey, when I tried to get a book from the Egyptian Olympics of San Asan and France.
Now, when we spent a few months trying to try everything I could think about to find a book that was also English from the nation, it looks like the only option I had to see if I could worry about something that was also going to me.
Now, I've been very functioning if someone wants to help me with it, and more about their time to something like this.
But, in a week from the moment I published my clinic on Twitter and Facebook to Portugue, I had more people to go to the West in the project, including a Jersey Jersey, leaving her work of the workers of the France Fargo.
With an hour, I've been able to find a book of a text from a concept that I could buy enough of his web.
Here's one of them.
And I sent out to each of my volunteers.
Every one took a short stories from the collection, sat in their word, sent me the fingers back to me, and a six weeks, I had all the book is ready to make.
In this case, as I've found so many times during my clinical year, my inevitation and the conversations about my limitations became a big invention.
When it came to Tony and Francisco, it was an opportunity not only to learn something new and create a new collection of stories, but also to connect a group of people and enable a common creative courage.
My friend became a prosperity of the project.
The books I've read that year opened my eyes to a lot of things.
Like the question of the people to read, the books have an extraordinary power to invite you from yourself and into the brain of someone else, so at least for a time, you look at the world through different eyes.
It can be an uncomfortable experience, especially if you read a number of culture that may have quite different values of your own.
But it can also be very happy.
The struggle with unfamiliar ideas can help you move your thinking.
And it can also show dozens of generations in the way maybe you look at the world.
When I looked back on a lot of the English literature that I grew up, for example, I started seeing a lot of products from it was, relatively relative to the world to offer.
And when the fish became, something else started to happen.
To take a look, this list of countries that I started this year, has changed a pretty expensive task of places that come from animals and death.
Now, I don't want to offer that it's possible to get a full picture of a country just by reading one book.
But in a way, the stories that I read last year was doing me more animal than ever before to fly, the direction and complexity of the Panada is coming out.
It was the thought that the world's story and the people who were so excited to help me read it to me.
In these days, when I look at my books, or you're going to put the work on my electronic corner, they tell a pretty different story.
It's the story of the power that the books have to connect us to political diversity, geographical, cultural and social and creative.
It's the story of the potential that people are working together.
And it's a unique time that we live in, dozens to the Internet, it's easier than the past to share a story, a book with someone who might never met, on the other side of the planet.
I hope it's a story that I call to fly many years to come.
And I hope that a lot of people will join me.
If we're all called more than a road, you'll be more likely to be able to translate numbers, and we're all going to be more richer than that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So how many of you have a robot at home?
Okay, I see about 20, 30 hands.
It's actually pretty good.
How many of you would want a private robot in your house?
I know I want!
Okay, so why don't it exist?
Why can't I go to convenience or customers, and you know, go to the bridge and say, "Yeah, I want a personal robot?"
Now, I'm going to talk to you about how to make it happen.
We need to make smart robots.
Now, no one will argue that we don't have robots.
Ah, we've got robots that go to Mars and bring scientific information and revealing our knowledge about the universe.
We've got robots that help us build the cars that we're driving in today.
We've even got robots that go back to the military.
So we have all this, so why don't we have personal robots?
Why don't I have a robot out because I don't know for the door?
So here's one of my robots, it's a simple robot, but, it's not a shape.
And so, what we need to do is we need to change the definition of what it is a robot.
How do we do that? Well, the first step, before we even start to design and give you the hands, we need to think about generations, kind of rules.
Some behavior, and why? Because if robots are smart, ah, they may be able to do more than we want.
So we need to put some rules.
You, the robot, you don't touch the person.
You're a theme, and just me.
You're always going to play me in any possible moment.
So we've got to buy boundaries, general behavior, before we're actually starting to design.
And then we need to invent tools.
So I believe that the way to make smart robots is to mix people.
Our brains are complex, happens a lot in the face, so it's hard to open our brain and actually understand how to mix people.
The highest way is to watch, look at people who do things, and understand what they do, what do they think, what are their actions, what are their emotions?
And so, some of the robotic platform is actually bringing people, how they're doing things, so that maybe they can do it better.
And so, some of the tools are diversity.
And so, I'm focused on an electrical engineering.
I've never thought I'd have to understand things like a child psychologist?
So, the understanding that the way babies evolve to children, evolve to adults, and how they learn to communicate is actually important for robotics.
I didn't understand that I actually need to expect the customers of customers and play because they have a kind of social mechanism where they learn one of the other, so it's really good to make robots more.
And of course, brain science, I've always been fascinated from the brain science, but I've never realized that I had to understand why these viruses are going to come up with us to learn, and all of these are really going to make robots more smart.
And so, some of the things I do, and it's just a quick picture, for example cells.
So they say that our ability to look at the mirror and flow and actually recognize that the person on the other side is we, it's self-awareness, it's a symbol to intuition, and it allows us to look at someone who's coming in and understand, "Okay, I know how to respond, I'm going to
And so I actually have a robot where we're trying to design a robot from health care.
And so, I've got a hormone physicist that shows a robot how to do some users.
You know, we want to make a powerful.
And then, the other thing is to learning.
So, learning is important. We do it as children, we do it even as adults, we do it as hard as women.
And yet one kind of learning is a muscle memory.
So how many of you are in the tool?
Okay, so when you start, for example, if you think about a piano, you start and your teacher might come and move your hand a little bit or maybe you're going to move your web up a little bit.
So they're actually moving in you to give you a muscle memory.
How to do things a little bit better.
And so we've actually got a learning method, of course, we don't take the motors and move the arms, so we need to join our robot to give a muscle memory in terms of how to do a code.
And then, at the end, it's creativity.
So, you might ask, "robots? creativity?
I don't understand it. Why does a robot need creativity? What in creativity makes them more water? "
Well, creativity and imagination, these are the things that allow us to create problems when we don't know how to perform it.
They allow us to create something from a dream.
I mean, if you look at the sustainability and telescopes, and Italians, and iPhones, and Afghanistan, 20 years ago they didn't exist.
So how did we get out of the universe where there was nothing and looked at us?
It was our imagination. It was our creativity.
And these are the things that allow us to understand new things.
And so, I have a creative robot, it's called the France, it's a puzzle, and if you're listening, it's called "We're a small planet."
So all of this together, the last thing is communication.
So you have a robot, you want it to be your partner to play, your teacher, your concept, you want it to call.
And he's curious?
So, communication is key, it's the key to understand how to work with us in our world, and so the interaction is really important.
It's about communication, it's about the understanding, it's about view, it's about the computer.
All of these things together spread this communication and our robots to be smart.
And so these are just some of the tools that we use to make robots more.
So, I want to leave you with one thought.
I'm completely in robots and smart robots.
I mean, that's what I do, I didn't have a job if I didn't believe it.
And yet, where does it play?
How far would you take it?
How far far and how smart we need to do our robots?
Thank you.
Hello, my name Richard Robert, and I was one of the fingers of OK.
Now it's one of the biggest ethnic books in the United States.
Like almost everyone in the website, I was a mathematician, and as you can expect, we're known in the anthetic approach we have to love.
We call it our action algorithm.
It's basically the effect algorithm of OK TK helps us decide if two people need to go out.
We built all the business around this.
Now this algorithm's a conventional word, and people like to say it as if it's a big thing.
But, in fact, algorithm is a way, a technique of another step to solve a problem.
It doesn't have to be magic at all.
Here, in this lesson, I'm going to explain how we got to our unique algorithms so you'll see how it's done.
Now, why are algorithms at all important?
Why is this lesson at all there?
Well, notice one important tool that I used: there's a way of step to solve the problem, and as you probably know, computers in the processes of another step.
A computer without algorithm is basically a piece of paper that will happen.
And since computers are so common in life today, algorithms are everywhere.
The math behind the action algorithm of OK: Titan is simple for repair.
It's just a little bit of connection, as a tree, and a little bit of collapses.
The hard part of design it, with that, was to understand how to take something from human task, and take it into parts of the computer can work with them.
Well, the first thing that we had to wait people was information, something for algorithms to work on.
The best way to get information from people quickly is just to ask it.
So, we decided that OK would ask people questions, things like, "Do you want children one day?"
And "What do you expect your teeth?"
"Do you like scary movies?"
And big things like, "Do you believe in God?"
Now, a lot of good questions to be interested in experience, it's when the two people do the same thing.
For example, two people who love scary movies are probably better than one person who loves.
And the other person doesn't. But what about questions like, "Do you like to be in the middle of the buildings?"
If the two people in the relationship say yes, then they'll be in a big problem.
We looked at this at the beginning, and then we decided we needed more information than any question.
We had to ask people to judge not just their answer, but the answer they wanted from the other person.
It worked really well.
But we had another 3D.
Some of the questions tell you about the person more than others.
For example, a question about politics, something like, "What's worse: muscles or corruption?"
You might find more about someone from their town in the movies.
And it doesn't make any sense to spread all the things in the same weight, so we need to add another last point of information.
Everything that OK says you, you have a possibility to tell us the role that it's a game in your life.
And it's been filled with anonymous to the extinction.
So now, for every question, we have three things to our algorithms: First, your answer; Second, how you want someone else, your potential, will be going, and third, how important the question is to you.
With all of this information, OK, you can understand how many two people can fit.
The algorithm works the numbers and give us a result.
As an example, let's see how we give you to another person.
Let's call it, "Be."
Your privilege truth is based on questions that you've ever done.
Let's call this quote of common questions, "Los."
As a very simple example, we'll use a little "bus" with just two common questions and thought about it.
Here are two questions of our example.
First, say, "How many of you play you?"
And the possibilities are very fair, average, and very dangerous.
And let's say you've done a lot of the room, and you'd like someone else who's going to say, "And the question is very important to you.
You're basically moving into the room.
You're scared, you want someone else to have a room, and that's it.
And let's say, "In" is a little bit different.
It's a very sad of itself, but it's average of someone else's answer, and the question is just a little bit important to it.
Let's look at the other question, it's what our previous example: "Do you like to be the center of the buildings?"
The answers are just not.
Now you've said, "No," and you've also wanted the other thing to happen, "and the question is just a little bit important to you.
Now, "Be," yes. "
And he wants the other to say, "No," because he wants the fingers on it, and the question is a little bit important to it.
So, let's try to look at this.
Our first step is, because we use computers to do this, we need to have values to ideas like "a little bit important," because computers need everything in numbers.
We're in OK, we've decided about the next page: not relevant to 0.
It's a little bit important.
It's pretty important for 10.
It's very important for 50.
And it's completely 250.
After that, the algorithm does two simple computers.
The first is some of the answers of the United States tell you.
That means, how many ASA points in your hand?
Well, you've said that the answer of "in" to the first question about the room is very important to you.
It's worth 50 points and "in" I'm going to get it.
The second question is only one because you said it's just a little bit important to you.
And "Don't get it. So the answers of" "were 50 of 51 points.
It's about 98 percent. It's pretty good.
And the second question you're going to see is how much you're telling the United States. "
Well, "In" gave one point to your answer to the end of the room 10 on your answer to the other.
For those, 11, it's one and 10, you've been killed 10, you've made each other in the other question.
So your answer was 10 of 11, which is worth 91 percent of the United States. "
It's not bad.
The last step is to take these two lights of lights and get one number to you.
To do that, the algorithm represents your results, so it takes the "NANA," as "is the number of questions.
Because SS, "That's the number of questions, in this example, it's only two, we've got one percent that's equal to 98 percent of 91 percent.
It's worth 94 percent.
These 94 percent are your accident to the United States. "
It's a crazy expression of how happy you're going to be one with the other on what we know.
Now, why does the algorithm spread and not invent the two results together and a computer survived?
In general, the president is called the average average average.
It's a great way to step up values that have a space and represent very different properties.
In other words, it's perfect to avoid autism.
You've got a space and you have a lot of information points, like I said, on movies, about politics, about everything.
This intuitive makes sense.
Two people put each other 50 percent need to be better than those who provide each other and 100, because the animal needs to be unique.
After a little bit of a little bit of motion, in the case we have a small number of questions, like we're doing this example, we're ready to get out of the way.
Each time OK comes two people, it's going to change the states that we've shown.
First of all, it collects information about your answers, so it represents your choices and your president to other people in simple math ways.
The ability to take a phenomenon from the real world and turn it into something that's called "Freedom can understand," I think, the most important ability that can be someone today.
Like you use sentences to tell a story to the person, you use algorithms to tell a story of the computer.
If you learn the language, you can go out and tell your stories.
I hope it will help you do it.
You may think there's a lot of things I can't do because I don't see.
It's true in general.
In fact, I had a little help to move on the stage.
But there's also a lot that I can do.
That's what I'm a printing on the shoes for the first time.
In fact, I love a spint and I can play a lot of fuels, like a beetle, business, a sound, a crowd and so on.
But there's one gene: someone has to help me.
I want to be independent.
I've lost my interview at age 14 in an exhibition of a sacrifice.
I've been an active and independent, and all of a sudden I've become a list.
The most difficult part for me was to lose my hundreds.
Things that's done then we're just going to become a little impossible to do alone.
For example, one of my challenges was a learning books.
So, there were no personal computers, not the Internet, not cartoons.
So I had to ask one of my sister to read me the school books, and I had to create books from my Babylon.
Can you imagine?
Of course, my brother wouldn't be happy, and later, I noticed they were not there when I needed them.
I think they were trying to move away from me.
I'm not going to ask them.
I really wanted to be released with someone.
It became my prosperity to save innovation.
We're going to jump forward to the invention of the mortality.
I've got to recognize technologies, and I thought to myself, how is it that there's no computational technology to create books in healthy?
These amazing technologies are alive to be dangerous to help people with disabilities like me.
It's the moment my investment started.
I started to develop digital technologies, like a digital laser, a digital window, a digital date and a digital decline.
Today, every student who has a visual problem can read text books, by using personal computers and mobile devices, in Bill or a voice.
It may not surprise you, because everybody has now digital books on their bits in 2015.
But the healthcare became a lot of digital books before digital books, already in the late late '60s, almost 30 years ago.
Social consumers and collections of blind people have created this opportunity to create digital books so.
And it's actually not the first time it happened, because the history shows us that we're going to find the innovation.
The phone has been found in a time of communication surgery for people as a weapon.
How many customers were also found to help people with limits.
Now I'll give you another example of my life.
In the '90s, people around me started talking about the Internet and repeat.
I remember the first time I was social to the web.
I grew up.
I could go to the data every time.
I could even look for information myself.
I really wanted to help parents go to the Internet, and I found ways to take the web into a contract, which was a dramatic draw from the user interface.
It led me to develop the office of the house in 1997, first in French and later, from 11 languages.
When I looked at the office of the house, I got a lot of the walls from the users.
One I remember best said, "For me, the Internet is a small window to the world."
It was a mindful moment for parents.
The Western world has become an explanation, and this technology that we've created for parents have a lot of useful, much more than we imagine.
She can help the genes to listen to their emails or she can help you listen to high school while you're paying.
Today, I'm more independent, but it's still not enough.
For example, when I was born now, I had to help.
My goal is to get independent.
And not just here.
My goal is to be able to avoid and do things that are simple to you.
Okay, now let me show you the most recent technologies.
It's an iPhone that we're working on.
[video] electronic voice: 17 meters to the floor, and a bridge task.
CA: I'll get the two doors to get out.
CA: Let's get close.
Chile Scott: Hey, Next!
Laughter) CA: Where do you go? You see so happy.
NG: Or -- well, my job just got.
CA: It's great!
CA: Thank you. Sure -- how did you know that I was, and I think I'm happy?
[]]]]]]]]]]] []]]]]]]
Laughter) CA: Or... Hi.
CA: He doesn't talk to you, but on the phone.
CA: Charles.
CA: Scott More with sacrifices.
CA: The four5 pounds in front of me, you're going to win out of a chocolate.
[]]]]]]]]]] []]]]]]]]
CA: Good.
CA: Now...
Thank you.
So now the intuition is driving me by analyzing signals from equality and two satellites and enabled me to move around intervention and patterns in myself.
But some of the computer interview that my mom comes in, in what wind situation -- we're still working on this part.
And the finger of face is very important for me to be social.
So now the bees between technologies are willing to help me see the real world.
We call it a cognitive aid.
He understand the world around us, and he feels me in the voice or sends my fingers.
Social athetic aid is reduced or complexity -- in other words, our senses.
This technology is just early, but at the end, I'm going to be able to find a classroom in the piano, to compare the diabetes or find a nice restaurant in the street.
It would be amazing if I could find you on the street before you live in me.
It's going to become my best friend, and your daughter.
So, it's really a big challenge.
It's a challenge that's cooperating, so we're creating an open community to treat research activities.
It's really the morning, we've known about the basic technologies in the open code that you've just seen in the video.
The goal is the real world.
It's the blueprint community that's called this technical book and sophisticated the way.
I hope to work with you to explore the new age, and at the next time I'm going to be on this stage, through technology and innovation, I'll be able to move into myself.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I'm sure now you already know that a little bit of everything you do in life, you need books.
But there's particularly certain areas where you don't just need some numbers, but a lot of numbers.
How do you go after all these numbers?
More mathematicians in the ancient China have invented a way to create many numbers of numbers in one cell.
Today we're called this "metaphor," and when there's a lot like this -- "metaphor."
The tricks are everywhere.
And all of our environments, even here, in the room.
Sorry, let's go back to the subject.
But the tricks are really everywhere.
They're using businesses, in the economy, in the parasion, in physics, in electronics and computers.
One of the reasons why the tricks are so cool is because we can fill them in a lot of information, and then become a huge series of different problems to one problem.
So to use tricks we need to know how they work.
It turns out that you can treat tricks like normal numbers.
You can connect them, reduce them and even appreciate them.
You can't get them out, but it's a refugee.
Technology is just a simple thing.
You just need to connect the original implications in which they're surprising.
And that's how, you're bringing the first comfort, the commercials, the third, and so on, until the end.
Of course, your tricks need to be in the same size, but it's pretty obvious.
You can also apply all the tricks in the next book "business."
It's just all the restaurant in this book.
But it's not everything!
You can really apply one metaphor in another.
But it's not like interviewing them, like in the public of another restaurant.
It's more special and pretty cool, after you get the thing.
So it works.
Let's say you have two meters.
Let's say they're two, which means two lines and two tons.
You'll put the first trick on the left and the other trick on the other hand when it's a little bit limited, like we're creating a cat.
What's going to get when we're spending the tricks into them.
Let's take a couple of cockroads to help them.
Now look at the first teacher's first teacher and the first device of the second trick.
You see there's every one of these two numbers?
You're even the first number that's coming with the first number that's in the dictionary: 1's worth two.
Now even the next few: three is about three percent.
Now my friend them: 2 and about 11.
We're going to put this book instead of the top left so that cells in terms of the lights and the tastes that we used to get.
You see how it works?
You can do so to get the impression.
440, they're 44.
Four and 3.1.
8,0 is equal.
So this is the solution.
Not bad, right?
There's just one code.
It's just like the connection itself, it also needs to be the right size.
Look at these two tricks.
Two and eight is worth 16.
Three four is worth 12.
Three to a moment, in the other trick, there's no more lights.
We've got a place.
So these tricks don't be able to reduce.
The first number of lines in the first trick has to be the same to the number of lines in the second trick.
But as long as you'll find that the tricks will be identical, it's pretty easy.
The power of metaphor is just the beginning, by the way.
There's a lot of things that you can do with.
For example, let's say you want to make a unique consciousness.
Let's say, "There's not like math."
If, why would someone want to keep it in the secret? I don't have an idea.
If we use numbers to make the signals, you can save the numbers in the metaphor and the extinction in a second trick.
It's going to apply them in this one, and you've got a new product.
The only way to operate the new motion and read the consciousness is with the exception, the same crazy metaphor.
There's even a cloud in math that uses all the time in tricks, and it's called "Alexander."
If you're ever going to get you to learn from Alexandria, you've done it, it's pretty amazing.
Just remember, when you already know how to use tricks, you can actually do everything.
What does a mother look like?
If you ask the Internet, it's what you'll see.
It's not important that it's what really perceived if you try to work on a computer with a baby on the kitchen.
It's not, it's not if it works.
You'll notice the motor repeat in these images.
It seems to be a lot of them. The recycling is an amazing natural corruption, that as we know, Pacific everywhere American work.
There are thousands of images like this.
Just look at "If you're working in search of images in Google, I'm going to give pictures of images.
They're all over the Internet, they're above blogs and news's issues, and I've become pretty scared in their homework and that's why they tell us, that it's when it's in the workers in America, it's all okay.
But it's not okay.
Every year we send millions of women back to work, early to reduce after they're born.
It's a moral problem, but today I'm going to tell you why it's a economic problem.
I've been so proud of nervous and autonomous with the reality of these images, which is usually not seen as my life, that I've recently decided to take a piece of photograph of images from the cities that I've been going to start to use to show the reality of the experience of return to work when your baby is connected to your body.
I'll show you two of them.
So there's no thing that's going to give it a wall! "
You'll notice there's no baby in this photograph, because it doesn't work like this, not for most of the facts.
Did you know, and it will kill you today, whenever I'm going to have a scratch, its content is reduced in the air and it will stay in the air for hours?
And yet, for a lot of new wars that work, it's the only place during the day they can find to make their food for their long babies.
I've published these things, reducing them, to the world.
I wanted to make a point.
But I didn't know that what I'm doing is also a dog, because now, complexity and different citizens are writing me all the time to tell me how it's for help work in days or weeks from the night.
I'm going to tell you today about 10 stories like this.
They're completely real, some of them are very golden, and no one of them doesn't look like this.
Here's the first one.
"I've been an active company in prison.
I went back to work after the possibility of eight weeks after my moral surgery.
A friend of work was very trained that I was at a Freedom, so he was going to open me the door while I was sitting in a space if I was working in the door with Asian artists in the corner. "
Most of the stories that these women are, refugees, send me right now, they're not at all the time.
A woman wrote me to say, "I've been going to go ahead and help work after seven weeks without peace.
Third, I was the wind.
Finally, I had a dream in the night, and a big crisis, so I could go to the universe, sit or go.
My grandfather told me that I couldn't use my feeling because it was a budget. "
I started to believe that we can't look at these situations as in the eyes because then we're going to be sick, and if we're poor, then we've got to do something about it.
So we choose to look, and believe, this picture.
I don't really know what's going on in this picture, because I think it's strange and a little bit scary.
And as if, what does it do?
But I know what it tells us.
It tells us that everything's okay.
This artist is working, all of the facts and all their babies, they're okay.
There's nothing to see here.
And usually, women did a choice, so it's not our problem.
I want to think about the choice to two parts.
The first choice says that women were chosen to work.
So, it's not true.
Today in America, women are 47 percent of the workforce, and 40 percent of the American homework is the only party or the main.
The work in our peace is a huge part of this economy, and it's positive for our families.
In the National level, our peace is not a good thing for choice.
A couple of seconds says that women choose to bring babies, so women just need to get the results of their choices.
You know, it's one of these things that if you hear as a way by the way, you'll hear right.
I wasn't going to get a baby.
I wouldn't be there when it happened.
But this piece is focused on a fundamental level, and it's that at the national level, our culture is not a choice.
The babies that are women, many of them work, look at the day, we're going to get one of our work, we're going to get on our bones, get our basis.
Our birth at a national scale is not a choice.
These are not choices.
We need women to work. We need women who work in babies.
So we need to make it that these things at the same time will be at least possible, right?
Well, so it's time to take a surprise: How many of the women who work in America, there's no access to a peace in peace?
88 percent.
88 percent of the workers don't even get a fifth of free in peace after they were a child.
So now you think about free without peace.
It's in America. It's called FMA.
It doesn't work. Because the way it's built, all kinds of creatures come out of the general, half of the news doesn't remember it.
This is what it looks like.
"We've lost our son.
When I got the conversation, the day he was born, I had to go out of the work.
I wasn't there enough time to be a memory to FMA, so I didn't have a reminder for a peace without peace.
When I took freedom to meet my son who was born, I lost my job. "
These images from the cases from another reality, the other way.
These of those who have access to this feeling without peace, most women can't afford any time.
My sister said to me, "I wouldn't have a reminder for a short term because my lunch was sitting in a healthy situation.
We've used all of our plants and a half of our curiosity during the web without my peace.
We just couldn't get more of it.
It was hard, but emotional was worse.
I've been going to go for months to be a restaurant from my son. "
So this decision is going to go back to work so early, it's a great economic decision that makes a family economy, but it's often a genetic decline because to bring a person to the world.
Salf said to me, "In my first baby, I went back to five weeks after the night.
In the other time, I had to go through a serious surgery after I was going to ask, so I realized to six weeks to go back.
I've had a pair of the third apartment. "
Three percent of the new signals in America will help work in two weeks of learning.
"I've been working as a car and a selection, the average of 75 hours a week during the street.
I had to go back to work before my mom was a month, a job of 60 hours a week.
One of my companies could afford just 10 days with her baby. "
Of course, it doesn't just take care of economic consequences and geography.
Linda is, and you'll always be, a huge psychological event.
The teacher said to me, "I went back to work eight weeks after my son was born.
I'm already suffering from doors, but the restaurant that I had before the help of work were inevitable. "
In statistics, as it's in a little bit more than a baby's baby, so it's an environmental illness that it's going on from the walls in the wind condition after depression, and between a lot of potential consequences of these disorders, it's the most external death in the first year after women &apos
You'll be ready for the next story -- I've never met this woman, but it's hard to go back.
"I feel great, but as I've lost a while of my daughter, uncomfortable and designing with my son.
The muscles and the night made me feel completely sick.
For months, everything I remember is the cows: gas, they said.
I was faced.
Every morning, I asked myself how long I could do it.
Let me bring the baby to work.
I've made my office door while I was born and killed, and I've come up with him that I'm going to stop a wind so I wouldn't get in the walls.
I've seen behind the door of the door every long day and I've been in time that he's going to go.
I've been in a toilets while I've been reducing the equipment of the crisis.
Every day, I've spent all the way to work and all the way back home.
I looked at my boss that I didn't tell my job during the day, my wife at night from the house.
I thought there's just something that's wrong with me that I couldn't deal with it. "
So these are the signals.
What about babies?
As a country, do we care about millions of babies that are born every year for the workers?
I'm saying not, not until they're at the age of peace or service in the military.
We're telling them that we're going to see them in 18 years, and it's where they're already there.
One of the reasons I know this is that their babies have 12 weeks or more at home with them have a higher chance to get all of the health and the health health care last year, so these babies are limited more than small diseases.
But these things move behind images like these.
Maria has a message to the new signals that work and their babies.
How long you get together you need to know, and you're a problem for your economy and your daughter.
That's the thing that you're going to go back many stories that I hear.
A woman told me, "I went back to work eight weeks after my moral surgery because I had a job.
In my daughter, my daughter couldn't get rid.
She didn't agree to take a bank.
She began to lose a weapon.
Luckily, my manager was very understand.
He enabled my mother to bring my baby, who was with a penguin and a motor, four times in the office so I could get it. "
There's a little bit of countries in the world that don't offer free of the country to the news.
Do you want to feel who they are?
The first eight million pounds in the population of eight million.
They're a new propagina, their grandparents, and the microbes of microbes, the Iraq, Egyo, Nigeria, Alzheima and Tanka.
The number of seven is the United States of America, with 320 million people.
Ah, it's all.
This is the end of the list.
Every other economy in the Earth has come through enabled free of peace at a certain level for the people who work for these countries, but we say, "There's no chance we can do it."
We're saying that the market is going to take this problem, and then we're worried when corporations invest even free in a long peace for women who are already the more component and more of us.
Remember 88 percent?
These women with the income income income and the lower income will not be able to look at it.
We know that there's a price for a economy volunteers, a Pennesian prize, physical and emotional approach.
And we decided -- we decided, not in case, to transform these farmers to their workers and their babies.
We know you're going to make a higher price for women with an income income income, and here, in a primary way, women don't build.
We put them in any case.
It's all about America.
But it's also a risk for America.
Because what happens if all of these intuitive choices to do children will become intuitive choices not to do children.
One woman said to me, "A new motion is hard. It doesn't need to be autism.
When we talk about our family restaurant now, we're focusing on how long I'm going to worry about myself and a new baby.
If we're going to have to do this again in the same way, maybe we'll stay with one child. "
The bottom of the United States to keep the population is 2.1 babies of life for a woman.
In the United States today, we're about 1.6.
We need women to leave children, and we're actively accurate women's workers who don't do it.
What's going to happen to the workforce, for innovation, to the local product, if one after the other, the workers of the workers in this country will be able to figure out that they can't be able to do this thing more than one?
I'm here today just with one idea that's worth spreading, and you're going to see what it is.
The most powerful country on Earth has to offer free in peace with the country for people who work for the future and babies that make this future.
The baby night is the public.
This feeling should be complicated by the country.
It doesn't need to be sophisticated for small businesses, the spinal period or entrepreneurs.
You need to be able to share the same between the switch.
I've talked a lot about death, but the partners are very important in so many levels.
No other woman doesn't have to go back to work while she's laughing and dead.
No other family doesn't need to fix her samples to buy a few days for a joke, the content and the service.
Nobody's baby that another musician doesn't have to go directly from the infinite door for a day because his parents were able to take all of the injuries in thinking of children.
No other family works doesn't have to tell her that the president between their work, the extended and the extended news, it's just their problem.
The code is that when it's happening to a new family, it's a government, and a new family with a new baby is more economic surprise than they've ever been before, so a new mother can't afford to stand on her.
But we all have molecules.
I finished, I finished to bring children, and you may be in a baby, you may be after a baby, you may not be in the business of a baby.
It's not supposed to change.
We need to stop this restaurant as a building of death, or even a matter of women.
It's an American thing.
We need to stop cutting these images tell us.
We need to stop looking at blood.
We need to ask why we tell us that it can't work when we see it works everywhere in the world.
We need to recognize that this American reality makes us sense and respect us.
Because it's not, it's not, and it's not how a mother works.
Thank you.
When we think about learning, we imagine students in the classroom or the lines, they're open on the table, and they're listening to a lot or a teacher in the room.
But in psychology has a different meaning.
In psychologists, learning means a long-term change in the behavior of the experience.
Two different kinds of main learning is called Central and French, or intuitive.
Let's start with the Central Kenya.
In the 1890s, a biologist called Iran and Ewin blogging a couple of studies that are published on dogs.
He showed the dogs of food and shooting in the same time.
After a while, the dogs took the page with the food.
They learned that when you've heard the finger, they'll get food.
Finally, the profound sound alone made dogs to the city.
They learned to expect food in the sound of a deep sound.
You'll see, under normal conditions, shows a brain of food causes to pay attention to the city.
We call food "uncomfortable."
Nobody's out of a city to sell over Steve Steve.
But when you're inevitable agencies like food with something that was going to have in the past, like a sound of training, the NASA becomes a mortality.
And that's how the classical cortex is.
We see how it works with animals, but how does it work with human beings?
Just the same way.
Let's say one day you're going to a doctor to get a cat.
She says, "Don't worry, it's not fair at all," and then you're going to give you the most fastest one you've got in life.
A few weeks later you're going to go to the Syrian doctor.
He begins to put a mirror in your language to look at your eyes, and he says, "Don't worry, it's not going to be in all."
Even though you know that the view doesn't look at, you're lucky from the chair and you're going to have the walls of the room.
When you went to get sick, the words "it won't be fair at all," became a moral corporation, after we went to the pain of the fingerprint, the unprecedented remote response, that after the physical response -- to the skin.
It's an action in action.
It's an alternative around how the results are used to change in conventional behavior.
So how does the Olympic act?
There's two main components in French: French and waiting.
Prics get the chance you're going to do something again, while women's getting the chance of it.
It's funny and it's going to be positive or negative, but not in the sense of "good" or "bad."
Social means -- the stimulus, like getting a gun after you're going to get the babies, and the negative means -- the reduction of a primary, like getting a dinner without a homework because you've succeeded in the test.
Let's see an example of the Olympics.
After you're going to have a dinner with the family, you're looking at the table and the tools.
When you're finished, your mom gives you a strong sand and says, "Thank you that you help me."
In this situation, the response of your mom is a positive empathy if it's increasing the risks that you're going to go back on the genetic response, which is to spread the table and put tools.
Olympic programs are happening all the time.
Almost everything we're doing was invented when it's an elegant.
You see it even in some extraordinary situations.
One group of studies have shown the power of the Olympic by a trial to understand in art.
Scientists used food as a positive strength, and they've learned the beauty of the picture on those people's face.
When they showed them a strength of other artists, the researchers of the Royan when the Greeks were chosen in aid asteroids on the cases.
Perhaps in the screen, they're going to give the beauty to paint an extinction of themselves.
The scientists know how you go from your parents.
They can look at the rights for a certain neighborhood or a genetic disease by the data that they have on the history of parents and family.
But how is it possible?
To figure out how the machines are going to create one life for his office, we have to go back in the 19th century and a person called Gorgan Center.
CA was repeated and Australian biologist who liked to work with plants.
Despite the PiPhones that grew up in his recycling, he found the weird principles in the classroom.
In one of the most expensive examples, a difference between a fingerprint and a fingerprint and a finger of green, and there's just a fingerprint that's flow.
It's called the yellow color because it's affected in all the new arms.
And then he'd been prepared to the fingerprinting of the fingerprints that are invited to the culture of themselves.
And on this other generation, he also got rid of roads and green and green, from the crisis that the mammogram machine was affected by the genetic love.
It's called "Society."
On these results, it's about the product that every machine depends on two faces, one of them comes from the hand and the other -- on the left.
Today we know that these causes are called allions, and they represent the different organisms of a gene.
By any kind of alone that's going to grow up in every village, we can get an iPhone that's called "Holotic," where the two elephants are identified, or the iPhone that's called the Titropic, "where the two different elements are.
It's a piece of alcohop as "Guikop," and its result, it's a green or green, "a Pophip."
To admit how the elephants are bringing out of the fingers, we can use a fire called "France."
You've just invented the different elements on the two muscles, and then you find the different expectations.
We're going to look at the cell phones of a model.
So let's write the yellow, and I'll say, "Oh," and the green telescope in "and" small. "
The Great School is always a little girl, so the only time you get green babies is when there are only small signals.
In the first generation of a scale, the iPhone and the yellow musician will go to every iPhone with a yellow, and the green and the green and the green and the green light will go to a green green virus.
Now all the phones are going to be sophisticated and terrorism.
In the next generation, where the two typical kids come in, their babies can be so much of the three genomes, which represent the two components of one to three.
But even phones have a lot of features.
For instance, they're going to be sophisticated or green, iPhones can be scared or cartoons.
So we can get all of these three pounds: the fingerprinted phones, fossil mobile phones, fossil mobile phones and green phones.
It's also to look at the signals between all the gene and the Pophip can be used a crowd.
It's obviously going to take a little bit of the buildings.
And many things are much more complex than iPhones, for example, people.
The scientists know much more about genetics and feeling.
And there's a lot more ways in which certain features go in the classroom.
But it all started with a model and his phones.
What's great air!
Your beauty of work!
You're a great category!
These are hundreds of hundreds, right?
Well, maybe.
It's depending on access and the voice in which things say, it's certainly going to be hundreds of years.
But they can also be very short and patterns.
The transformation of the approach that some of the words are afraid of what we call Iranian Italian. "
So when someone says, "What's great air," certainly that person does mean if the sun goes, the birds of birds, and the wind is wrong.
But if you're a terrible air and a threat, the sky comes out of clouds, and the wind is powerful, and someone says, "What's great air," probably it doesn't really mean it.
He's probably going to say that the air is terrible, but it means the opposite.
It's Iran Mola: When it says the opposite of what it thinks.
You probably think.
"It's no slides? Right, that it's a photograph?"
Right.
When a person says the opposite of what he's thinking, it's Italian.
When a person does another effort to express the opposite of what he's thinking and trying to be a little bit of short and bad, like he's going to push something, it's physical.
Take the second example: "Your beauty of work!"
Somebody's the women who've done his dream: Yes!
Somebody won the Scott: Yes!
Somebody goes back in a different car: No beauty.
So when the travel says, "Good work!"
It's probably going to be reduced with a smoke of a short hour.
That's Iran Mola and French.
When you say to the Olympics, "You're going to take a bridge," it's real as no Italian.
When you're saying it's going to go into an English lesson, and you're looking at all his money and his capacity on the floor, it's kind of liberal, because it's not the real argument.
That's Italian.
You said the opposite of what you did.
Another thing about this, because you've been able to fly on this journey, not just that you've been in Egypt, but it's also in patterns.
But the hate.
While all the physicians are going to define the Chinese Ethiopia, not every single Italian is a physical.
Italian is when what you're going to say is the opposite of what's said, while a musical musical slide that's spinning.
However, sometimes, there might be another meaning without a piece.
All right. Now you'll go out, and you've got examples to Italy and physical.
Basically!
No, seriously, I mean that.
Don't. I'm really behind you a success in this hard task.
All right, okay, succeeding.
You can do it!
I'm not talking about Ethiopia.
Growing up in January's jungle, the soldiers of the Swiss, have been reduced in the attitude and one of the two years for almost 20 years.
But the key to the commercial security wasn't wearing or peers, it was a village.
It's a contrast of Chile, opened up through Vietnam, Los and Kenya, started a simple web of Derek and a village to the Central Science of the northern North and Atlantic during the West Washingdom, a weapon, a psychologist, and a psychologist.
The president was a network of service, a village, and the teenagers who were taken a lot of North and atmosphere at the top of the Detroit between and Atlantic.
The journey to South took a six months.
But, with engineering and invention, the atmosphere was exposed and published the president.
In the end of the war, when the personal ways were looking through Los Angeles, it took just one week.
So this happened.
In 1959, when the relationship started between the North and the South, the system of fibers were built to remove soldiers, wearing into the South Korean.
The first forces were safe in the sky over the sky that they used local ethnic groups, and the walls that come in fingerprints were often the only thing that showed the direction.
At the first time, most of the commercial curiosity that had been served in a way that we were in the North Korean.
They've been asked as civil citizens in a black hole, Pijami with a young boat.
They've got Sundi's grandfather's grandfather's grandmother's lady on their legs, and they're going to have their boundaries in their fingerprints, a switch was depending on their body.
The conditions were hard and corporations were accumulated because of extension, malaria, and an artificial Nigeria.
The way, noise to death, and the possibilities of hormones and priorities were support.
The forces were rich and uncomfortable, and it was easy to wind.
Ford, fair, and I'm going home was the switch emotions.
And soldiers have been reduced by the fingerprinting, a painting, and a smoke with local rules.
The first forces in the back of the way they didn't get a lot.
And after a quick journey of six months, it's gone to the South was a big event, which was scared for most of the restaurant.
By 1965, the journey in the back of the way it could be in the office.
Three of thousands of trucks that were published by the hormones and the Chinese took the task during the BBBBC, the ABC and the GDP were known as a backwards.
When the motion in the president of the Penna came up, it's how it's also in the United States.
They used at night and early in the morning to get out of the camp, and you see there were ready to get rid of roads because of a beautiful airplane.
Freethers along the way we organized services to ensure the fusion of motion and help the president to fix prosperity that was made from geolic costs.
They were, "It's all for our axis."
And "We don't care to our homes if the car didn't have yet."
Some families have taken their dogs and their trees to fix roads.
The Atlantic forces used the techniques to make Americans spread out of the mountains to create a tree of using buildings and back back.
The red bone that's found anywhere in a room for every switch.
Luther Chile was an impact on the Watch war and he was the key to the success of humanity.
The North Korean and the atmosphere doesn't fit in the ice, but by the kitchen, which was the political crisis, strategy and ethnic.
The Americans were pregnant in his shoes, and they read to the kitchen, "One of the big ones in engineering in the middle of the 20th century."
The president is dozens to the beautiful power of the Indian people, and the people and the women who used the battlement became public with.
Why do we see illness?
I'm going to tell you a little bit about my research where I'm telling you a little bit of conversation to get a different kind of kind of kind of thing that may be affected in the book that's in your beautiful.
So let's look at one of the illusions here.
And it represents a lot of illusions that this conversation around.
I'm going to explain to you about this particular illusion.
As a usual of these things, these two lines are actually listening, but you're going to take them out in the central center.
In the center where these radical lines are, it's much more space in your vision than you're in parts over and forth.
And it's okay to concept because it's a very simple concept.
It's just a group of connections.
Why is one of the most complex objects in the universe can't search a simple shape of that God?
When you answer these questions, you have to ask, "What can it say to the brain?"
And what the brain's going to happen is, we don't experience paper.
Your brain has evolved to treat the natural astronomers that they're going to get in real life.
When's the brain that's going to be easy in these kinds of disciplines?
It might look a little bit strange, but actually we're going to have this fabric for all the day.
Every time you've gone, and in particular every time you've gone forward.
When you move forward, you get a optimistic flow, which is falled by a restaurant as a woman's "Antarceline" is going to move through space.
All of these objects go out and move out of the street, or the Texas, on your restaurant.
They're a series of neurons.
So this is a version of what happens in real life and it's another version of what's happening in real life all the time.
In fact, my mother's artist knows about it.
They're offering cartoons in their comics and your brain means "movement."
It's true that in real life, you don't see the text lines.
The thing is that it's the stimulus that's happening in the back of the eye of the eye where this horizon is what's going to say to your brain that you're in a motion.
When you move forward, you're facing things like cameras, like a fabulous camera, they're fresh, they're falling, they're shooting out, and every time they're focused on, when you're moving forward, you're sending all this feedback to the outside.
So when you take one budget, you get this strange horizontal, and it tells you what the direction you're wrong.
But it's just half the story.
This is what this horrible means.
It means your brain thinks when you look at the first picture that you're actually in motion, to the center.
It still doesn't explain why you need to look at these brilliant lines as if they get out.
To understand the rest of the story, you have to understand that our brains are athetic.
What you want to happen when light comes in the eye, Pong! You've always got a sense of the world.
But it doesn't work like this.
It's about a second rich to create an instrument.
Second river doesn't sound like a long time, but it's really a time that's affected by the normal behavior.
If you're moving at one meter in a second, it's pretty slow, then in a second half, you've gone from 10 miles.
And if you didn't want this prosthetic, then everything you're going to do as if it's in the 10 miles of you, you know, at the time you're going to do it, you'll get it or go on.
And of course, it would be much worse, much worse, in this situation.
Your prosperity is reduced.
You want your sense to look like this.
You want you to make your sense while "slow", "will be the world at the same time" slow. "
But the only way you can do it, it's instead of making a sense of the world as it was when the light is at the bottom, it's about doing something more sophisticated.
It can't respond around and create the best sense, it's about to create the best sense of the next moment.
How would the world look like in a second river?
To build a sense of this, because until your sense of the future is going to be scared in your sense, the future will come and have a sense of hope, and that's what you want.
In my research, I brought a lot of conversations to this, and there's another research that was also profound, that the brain is full of these mechanisms that go to his privacy.
And I showed that it's a lot of optimistic illness, and it's just one example.
I'm going to end by saying how it's just explaining this particular example.
So the question that actually needs to ask is, how are these two anthropic lines in the first time, how they change the next moment if I went to the center that all these optimistic lines affect that I'm in motion.
What happens to them?
Let's just imagine. Imagine you've got a poem.
You have a poem.
Imagine it's a key of Chile just so it's going to be more emotional, we've always seen.
When you're a lot of laws from it, they're very close from it.
But now imagine what happens when you look at.
When you're really curious, it's all going out in your vision, you'll get out.
But when you're really close, imagine the open-up, here and here, but if you look at the top to this clinic, and you're driving your home so, you've been opened up as a traffic device in the water.
What started as a pair of lines actually get out of the eyes and don't go out there so much over this height.
So the next moment, you get a form that looks more like the next picture.
In fact, it's commercial, the mortality that's made, that's how it's actually changing that next moment.
So when you've got a conference like this, your brain doesn't have any problem, it's just two lines of roads and there's no light that the next moment is going to happen, so you're looking at them like they're.
But if you're going to be lucky, and it's just one of many kinds of lucks, that you're going to lead to these kinds of illusion, a very, very powerful trick, because then you're going to take a place where you're going to have an accurate concept of what it's going to look at the
All of our feelings are always trying to address, but you have to search the future to actually search the hope.
And these illusions are the idea of the future because they're just static images on paper, they don't change like in real life.
Let me end up with one other illusion.
And if I go, I'll take two.
It's a decade.
If you're just going to go on the center, there, and you're going to do a bad movement with the head, to go to this past, so.
Everybody, did it.
They've done a short motion movement.
Because I've invented a tool for these optimistic, your brain says, "They're probably in motion, because it's a tremendous."
When you're doing it, they're supposed to get out of your vision faster than in reality.
They're not supposed to move so much.
And the last one I'll leave in the background, and here's it.
Here's the motion of the movement, the kind of lucky that you're hoping about the infrastructure when things move.
You don't have to do this thing, but just look.
And many of them -- Raise a hand if things move when they're not supposed to move.
More, right?
But here you've got lucky, which is the perspective of your brain, you're going to give you, you're looking at your eyes that says, "These things are moving."
You have to create a sense of what they're going to do next moment, once they're supposed to move around and in the universe. Well, thank you very much.
What was the most difficult work you ever did?
Is it going to work in the sun?
Is it going to work in a family or a community?
Is it going to work days and start to protect life and forget?
Is it going to work alone or work on a project that his work wasn't safe, but maybe you're going to improve health or creating life?
Would it build something, create something, create art?
Is it a job where you've never been sure that they've been invented and they've completely done?
People in our communities who do these jobs respond to our attention, our love and our proportion.
But people are not the only ones in our communities who do these hard jobs.
These jobs are also done by plants, animals and the ecosystems on our planet, including the systems that I'm curious: the tropical corporations.
Social commons are corruption.
They provide food, income and security security for hundreds of millions of people around the world.
Social commercials are constant.
The structures that they're building genes on our boys are scared and forests, and the biological systems that they're conducting the water and make them easier for us to work and play.
Social commons are chemical.
The molecules that we're spending on global commercials in repair searching for new antibiotics and new drugs for cancer.
And commons are artists.
These buildings are some of the most beautiful things on the planet.
And this beauty is the basis of doing many countries with a little bit of natural resources.
So because of all of these reasons, all of these ecosystems, economists contract the value of corporations in the world in billions of dollars per year.
And yet despite all of this hard work that we've done for us and all of this wealth that we're extended, we've done nearly all of us could be able to predict them.
We've taken the fish from the oceans, and we've collected years, in biology, disease, pollution, pollution.
We took the physical patterns with our musicians, our agencies, our insects, and we changed the chemistry of all the sea, reducing the water and we've created forests to be worse.
And all of these were bad for themselves, but all of these risks react each other and feed each other and draw each other.
I'll give you an example.
Instead of where I'm living and working, in Coradian, Tropy has been done a few years ago.
And on the back side of the Islam, there are the markets that are coming up and the roads, you can be able to see that the terrorism is going to be done.
But in the city, there's the corporations from the Alexis to move, from pollution, the Titanian end remains the preferences and used them to move the corporations that were left.
It's an analogy that I've read during my Ph.D. -- I've learned to know it pretty good.
And after this summer took half of his chimpanzee, he turned into a tree of algae, the countries grew up on the top and this corner.
This gender of organisms, this train of causes is what Jersey Jerson is described as "The Darwon't go to the wall."
It's in a metaphor, because a lot of our minds now are mystery, bacteria and algae.
Now, it's the part of my talk where you expect me to open up in my beginning that we're all going to save the corporations.
But I've got Virgi: This moon comes to me.
Whether I see it in a summer, in the news or the posters of a conservation, this motor is driven to me, because when we're the materials that we've put the axis on the market for decades.
And yet, almost everyone I'm afraid, doesn't matter how much it is, it's not sure what it's going to worry or where it comes.
How do you make someone care about the corporations in the world when it's an abstract thing that they can understand?
If they don't understand what it's like or where it comes, or how funny or interesting or beautiful is, why would you expect them to save them?
So let's take it back.
What's it to analogy and where does it come?
Monomers are born in a number of ways, but most of the modern want: the only one of the species in one night, reduce all the objects that they've created in the same year into the water water, when they're long to predict cells.
And these communities are happening before the surface of the ocean and reducing.
And hope -- hopefully -- on the ocean surface, they're getting the objects and the arms from others.
And that's why you need a lot of anonymas on the corner -- so that all the objects can be rejected on the surface.
When they're disabled, they're doing what other animals do: they're part of half again and again.
These images under the microscope every year is one of the most expensive and most of this year.
At the end of the cells, they become sick -- a tiny switch of a five-hicle, but with all the sensory systems that we have.
They can feel color and light, components, chemicals, reality.
They can even feel stress; they can hear sounds.
When they're using these capabilities to contract the different curiosity to find a place to connect and live their rest of their lives.
So imagine a place where you can live your rest of your life when you're just two days.
They go through the same place they find the most impressive, they're building that they're building, they're building here and bad, and then they're starting the hard work of building the corporations of the world.
One Pollip Palescope will bring itself back and over and over again, when it's a puzzle that's going to get out of the sun and grow into the sun.
In a few years and a lot of species, what you get is a mammogram structure that can even look out of the space in many of the cases, it's designed in the skin of these communities.
Now, there's just a few hundreds of corporations on the planet, maybe 1,000.
But these systems are used by millions of other species, and this direction is what's created the systems, and where we find our new drugs.
So we find new forms of food.
I'm lucky to work on the Israeli, where we've still got mates that look like this.
But, really, a lot of the cases and a lot of our world are much more like this.
Scientists have been studied in the corner of a rain and pulled up the corner of the world's brain, and they're going to be growing and make the genes.
But in my research, I don't want to look back.
My colleagues and I'm in Coradian and I'm interested in looking at what might be.
And we have the bad reason to be optimistic.
Because even in some of these programs that we probably would give them a while, we sometimes see babies of babies come and survive at all.
And we're starting to think that babies may have the capacity to bring themselves into some of the situations that adults can't.
They may be able to bring themselves a little bit more easier to this human planet.
So in a study that I do with my colleagues in Kenya, we're trying to figure out what babies should be at this very first, what they're looking for and how we can help them in the process.
I'm going to show you three examples of work that we did to try to answer these questions.
A few years ago, we took a 3D printer and we did a choice of corruption -- different colors, different colors, and we just asked the corner where it's going to sit.
And we've found that the corporations, even without the biology intervention, still fell into the white and survival, the colors of a healthy sea.
And they've been treating patients and holes, where they're going to be safe or eat by crazy.
So we can use this knowledge, we can go back and say that we need to return these genes -- this hormone, this white one, these sacrifs, these young surfaces -- in our contract project.
We can also use science if we wanted to put something under the water, like a wall or luck.
We can choose to use materials and colors and components that can make a look back into the corruption.
Now in addition to these programs, we can also explore the chemistry and microbial signals that are affected to policy.
Three years ago, I started to take a little bit of interpretation in them.
And I tried them one after the other, searching for searching for the bacteria that could convince the museums to sit and start.
And we've now got a lot of genes in the Philippines who've made the right way to organize the process and the companies.
So while we're talking, my colleagues in Coradian are looking at these little bicycles to see if they're going to help grow more assisters in our lab, and see if these boundaries are going to learn better when we put them back under the water.
Now in addition to these tools, we're also trying to discover the components of species that didn't happen enough.
It's one of my favorite components, and it's always been: Dargan Robert Los Angeles, Alexander.
I love it because it creates a ridiculous shape, because its arms that come out and see ecological and because it's rare.
It's going to find one of this in a car that's going to do.
In fact, it's so rare, that last year it looked like a species at the top of the species in the restaurant.
And it was paralyzed because over 30 years of research research, scientists have never found a baby cartoon.
We wouldn't even be sure if they can still be transformed, or if they're even many.
So four years ago, we started to track them at night and we were able to see if they started to switch in Kenya.
We've got some good tastes from our colleagues in Florida, we've seen one in 2007, one in 2008, and finally we've realized when they're scared in Kenya and we've made it.
Here's a coffee on the left with a couple of trees in her kitchen, it's going to release them who's the sea.
And here's the bridge on the right, it's released.
We've collected it, we've put it into the lab, we've put them and we've got a babies of babies in the lab.
The work of us and our scientists and scientists, and for 10 years of trust that we had in Coradian and other kinds of corporations, we've created a few of these insects to go through the rest of the process and move down, and to become a transformation that has been done.
So it's the first baby of a deep analogy that somebody's ever seen.
And I've got to say -- if you think that babies's babies's babies, it's more curious.
So we're starting to understand the secrets of this process, the secrets of corruption and how we might help them.
And it's true around the world; scientists understand new ways to deal with their organs, to get them out, maybe even understand the techniques to put them on a low temperature, so we can sell their genetic direction and work with them in a larger chemistry.
But it's still a telescope.
We're limited by the place of our table, the number of hands in the lab and the number of coffee that we can network every single hour.
Now, it's about our other friends and our other areas to worry about a company.
We've taken our medical technology, we've got gender technology, we've got scientific technology, even we've got an academic technology.
But our technology to use is not accurate.
Think back on the most difficult work you've ever done.
Many of you would say it would be a teacher.
My mom described the lights as something that makes your life much more amazing and much more difficult than you could ever imagine.
I've tried to help the museums to become teachers for more than 10 years now.
And I'm going to expect the prison of life, I'm certainly not going to be in the medicine until I've left.
But I also saw how hard it was to become teachers.
The corruption of the refugee that was killed over two weeks ago, and we collected their objects and we put them back to the lab.
And here you're seeing one paint from a part, together with 14 trees that didn't get out and jump.
They're going to be scared in bacteria, they're going to jump up and these bacteria will be on this only life that has a chance.
We don't know if it was our treatment that was wrong and we didn't know if it was just this corporation on the market, which has always been a low categories.
What wouldn't be the reason, we have a lot more work to do before we can use the corporations to grow or fix, or, yes, maybe even save corporations.
So no matter that their value is hundreds of billions of dollars.
The corporations are animals that work hard and plants and microbes and tricks.
They tell us art and food and drugs.
And we've almost got a whole generation of analogy.
But some succeeded at all, despite our best efforts, and now the time for us to admit them on the work that they did and give them any chance they had to grow corporations of the future, their musical babies.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
As you know, every Tasmanian president in the past and the present, my father was Agypt, the Olympic mathematical mathematician in Alexandria that was about 300 years ago.
Octocin is known as a company of a single work in the word and an effect called "Socience." You thought your math book is big?
"The Soviet" of Octocin "has 313 samples and it's just a metaphor.
In "The Socies," Octoco Egypt, "and you've spent the work of many mathematicians who've been operated in front of it, like France, Edops and others. Like France, House and others, the House and others. Arice Ford, House,
OcCorps published everything as a regulation system of prosperity that was affected on the basis of the rainforest, local ideas, which was affected on the basis of the rainforest, creative ideas, and also its extinctions.
The four of these texts are simple and boundaries, for example, between two points of wealth.
The personal conversation, on the other hand, is the invention of us.
The traditional magazine is known called "The Mexico". "
It's not like the first four presidents, the personal magic is very complex.
Alexico's credit of Octoco Kimbus: "If you've got two other lines in a way that's made in one of the inner corporations that's made in one of the line of the line out of a little bit of a series of a service, I'm going to get rid of
A piece of experiment!
Here's the simple box and the faster: "In a decade, through any point that doesn't have on a data line, you can just go one line that's going to get to the original line."
Over hundreds of years, many mathematicians were trying to prove the professional magic on the top of the four, but they didn't succeed.
And so, they started looking for what's going to make sense if the professional magic actually isn't true.
Many of the brains of the mathematician in this question, characteristics like IDA, you'd say, "Man, NASD, Jaki's" and "I'm Shaki," Charles, Cambridge and Kimbersey. "
Everybody did experiments that were born to notice the professional magic, but eventually they found that they made a lot of windows.
These metaphors were known as the Western Olympics. "
I'm going to leave these different details to these different geologists for a France.
The main difference is that we're going to have the death of the decade on it, and it turns out that Alexis didn't tell us.
It's just one possible way to look at the universe.
Everything depends on the context of the thing that's looking at.
And what's positive skills or illustrating different techniques.
At the beginning, these windows looked a little bit of crazy, but in the mirror, they're likely to describe the world around us.
The Watch on our planet has to have an academic metaphor and if it's an artificial creative crisis that's called the Olympic Olympic Olympics.
Albert Einstein was also used in an intuitive atmosphere to the description of the way it's going to become a sense of material as part of its general theory.
The big dialogue here is whether Alexis was that a concept of an idea of a mammogram of these expectations when he wrote his mystery.
You might never know the answer to this question, but it's hard to believe that he didn't have any idea about Tesla, to get a lot of his life and his president in the Olympics.
Maybe he knew, and he was looking at the original axis in a way that's going to make the curious brains that come up with it from the small details.
So yes, it's probably very happy.
These experiments have never been affected with unprecedented and teachers who were able to move their early scientists and think out of the restaurant of what were taught.
We also need to sometimes be ready to put our early scientists and our personal experiences and see the same picture, another one we're looking at it that doesn't look at all the truth.
The universe, pretty beautiful, no?
It's got everything, Milliama, very big to cancer.
Obviously, there's some less nice elements there, but it's all about it, from learning from its existence is a good thing.
It's so good, you're going to have a perfect field of science to its learning.
It's known as cology.
Scientists look at what's out there in space and connect the story of how the universe evolved: What it's doing now, what it's going to do, and how it's all started.
It was a red red red of the first time that our universe is expanded by the animal that the galaxy looks like the galaxies were far away from the other.
It's changed that all started in a huge tree at a point, and a little bit in a particular way.
This idea has been treated in conversations at the same time, "But when the evidence was disappeared, the idea and the name was left.
We know that after the Great Bang, the universe came up to create the stars and the galaxies that we see today.
Scientists have a lot of ideas about how it happened.
But we can explore the universe by making the conditions of the extinct conditions, and the patterns that were at the beginning of time, in the lab.
It's been done by particles.
Over the last century, particle physicists have been looking at the material and the forces in higher energy and more.
First of all with conservative curiosity, and then with a half proteins, machines that make the actions of a high atoms in high energy.
As the energy of a larger object, they can offer back in time.
Today, things may be mostly atoms, but hundreds of seconds after the big bank, there was too hot to electrons that electrons could join the atmosphere to create atoms.
Instead, the central universe of autonomous proteins.
A few seconds after the big bubble, there was even more hot, hot enough to think about the forces that usually represent prototypes and terrorists together in the red grain.
More sister, microseconds after the Great Bang, and the prototypes and terrorists just started to make a local source, some of the basic fundamental institutions of the standards of the particle production.
Even further back, and the energy was even bigger for the Kikoko was one to two.
Picticians hope that by even larger energy, they can see back to a time where all the forces were identified, what will make the understanding of the universe much more.
To do that, they're not just going to have to build a larger object, but it's also going to work harder to express our knowledge of very large with the very very small, and to share these ideas with each other and with you, well, with you.
And so it should be!
Because after all, when it comes to our universe, we're all here.
The human eye is one of the most powerful devices on the planet.
It's like a thousand magazine magazine that can work in the bow, almost in the skin, and even under the water, even though not really good.
It causes the brain so much information about the world.
Our teenagers are how we find sophisticated, how we understand the people around us, how we call, how we're watching television there are perfect people in the water by the lunch.
Yes, the human eye is pretty cool, and we have luck that we have two of them.
But there are things, although we look really well, we can't really see.
For example, you can see a horse, but your genes can't track the speed of speech and understand if all four feet from the ground at the same time.
For these kinds of questions, we need cameras.
About 150 years ago, the Radian Rambridge used one in order to solve the House School.
By using the great dream, Mumbridge proved that certain points of the device, the horse really won.
"Man! No Tim!"
Since then, the photograph found his way to all the mathematics and science.
He helped us understand a world that we thought we were seeing, but we needed to help see a little bit better.
It's not just that the world's going to be too fast to that we've seen the process.
Sometimes cameras can help us see material or motion that they're too small to an unfair eye.
Brothers use component images to show the life of plants and how flowers go around a few hours after the sun in what's called autonomy, growth into the sun.
Scientists used photos to look at where in elephants and the patterns of the old sound sound comes from when the judge sits the voice.
Morologists and environmental scientists show a tumor of musicians and president over the years of many of the world's agriculture.
It's a high speech or high speech, and it's shown the fingerprint of the slide and the planet through its goal.
In one project, bodies, it's people who die, they're going to go and look at thousands of minutes.
The businesses were able to create a wonderful film that would be able to measure the lab and down the heat, and through the bridge, the bones, and the parents, and the parents, maybe I had to offer that I wouldn't have to get it in my long time, my mistake.
In the classroom today, the camera, there's almost every cell phone or a computer, allows the most young scientists to see in the world around them, to move it, and share their cameras on the web.
Whether it's beyond the skin or the growth of forests that are on, cameras allows us to see the beautiful world through new eyes.
Have you ever wondered who there's the curiosity to the rule of rules or give people who've been talking to them?
When we think about power in the United States, we usually think about the president, but it doesn't work alone.
In fact, it's a part of the power and a good reason.
When the American revolution came in 1983, the United States government was in a situation of change.
The Scientists knew that they didn't want to code another country that was built by you, so the idea was focused on a powerful government and a profound that's found on privacy and not using power.
When the new revolution is in 1987, the structure of the young government of the United States called three different clouds, each with its power, and the system of testing and artists.
It's going to make sure that there's never going to be too much power because other drugs will always be able to move the power of the other two.
These clouds work together to manage the country and contract that we're all going to live in.
It's the conservative conference in a single one of the United States Research.
A lot of people feel that the Egyptians put this tremendous on a first screen because they thought it was most important.
It's a complicated range of 100 Americans and 435 friends in the American cities.
It's more known as the American Congress.
The rules of laws is the main goal of the convenient, but it's also responsible for refugees and dogs, the National Center, and it's necessary about war.
Each country gets two curiosity and a number of chickens, depends on how many people live in the country.
It's the fingerprint that's been described in a twice of the constitution.
The leaders of this tremendous fingerprint is the president and the president, which is responsible for the rules of laws that Congress Congress.
The president works together with a microbial group, accurate as a patent.
These strange sectors help make important decisions in the area of their illness, like the gender, OK, and national security.
It's also the advantage of a role in the government, it's based on the right forces, and it's getting the other countries.
All of this together is a lot of work for many people.
In fact, the summer is made more than four million people to do everything.
The third tree of the American government is the judge of the judge and judgment in a three.
It's complicated from all the sentences in the country, from the Amazonian French sentences to the top American sentence.
These sentences reduce the rules of the nation and put those who were scared.
The highest judgment, the top sentence, reduces between countries and countries, compared to traditional sentences and emissions, and collapse if rules are critical.
There's an hour of judgments at the top sentence, and they're going to be reduced to any other work in the government, the top crime of the entire life, or as long as they want to stay.
Our democracy depends on modern citizens, so it's our environment to know how it works and what responsibility has to all of citizens.
Obviously, the risks are that I've been sitting in your life will read to participate in your government, whether it's as an active meeting in a sentence, or send an enormous amount to your Congress to move or to the idea of a blind idea.
By the walls, who's acting them, and how they work together, you can be involved, mindful, and water.
It's been reminded by Asia, an ancient philosophical philosophical philosopher in the invention of the number of details, cartoons that are made sense, but their result is Saradian or Saudi.
For more than 2000 years, the hard dogs of our minds have inspired mathematicians and philosophers to understand better the opinion of the end.
One of the most known problems of our minds is called the France of the autonomy, which is "The French" in the two "biological problems.
It's going to be about this: after a long day of thinking and thinking, we'll decide to go to his head.
The Tasmanian air is bringing your brain and help it more important in speed.
In order to get to the park, it needs first to go half the way to Finland.
It's the part of the trick takes a permanent time.
Once it comes to the investment point, it has to go half of the distance that's more.
Again, it takes a particular time.
Once it comes there, it still has to go half of the distance that's left, what's going to take for a certain time.
It happens again and over and over again.
You can see that it can continue to the future, the great dream that we're going to get more and smaller parts, each of them takes a certain time to go.
So, how long does we get to the park?
Well, in order to know, you need to connect the investments of each of the way.
The problem is, there's a number of infinites through these.
So, is the time that including need to be unfinished?
This argument, by the way, is completely general.
He says that there's a point to another point, you have to take no longer time.
In other words, it means that every movement is impossible.
This conclusion is a completely unique, but where's the concept of concept?
To solve this paradox, it helps this story into a mathematical problem.
Let's say that the house of our minds is one email from the Iraq and we've got one email in an hour.
The idea tells us that the time the value needs to be an hour.
But, let's look at it from the perspective of our minds and some of the way to the mistakes.
The first half of the night will take half an hour, the next part will take four hour, the third third hour, and so on.
When you look at all these times, we get a series that looks like this.
"Now," We may say, "Because there's a number of neurons on the right side of the equation, and all of the motor is finished, the effort has to be unfinished, right?"
This is the problem of the argument of our minds.
What mathematicians realized since, it's possible to connect a number of secret cells with a final size and still get a final answer.
"How?" You ask.
Well, let's think about this.
Let's start with a trick that has one meter.
Now let's look at the week for two, and then the library for two, and so on.
In the eye that we do this, let's track the quality.
The first animal creates two parts, every one on the surface of the next half of these fingers to half, and so on.
But, it doesn't matter how many times we're going to take the box, the surface is still conducting all the parts.
Now you can see what we've been looking at this particular way of spinning a week.
We've put it in a series of no finance like the long time of our minds.
When we're much more and more sophisticated, if we use mathematics, when we take the walls of NASA, every week becomes a blue box.
But the surface of the week is just one single one, and that's the end of the secret has to be one.
If we go back to our minds, we can now see how the France is evolved.
It's not just that the definition of the final definition is a final answer, but the final answer is the same one that the option is designed for us as a neighborhood.
We're going to take an hour.
Things are caught in fingerprints.
In fact, I think, some of the most interesting things in human experience is going on in fingerprints, in the Chinese space, I'm going to space between things.
There's freedom in this Middle space, freedom to create an unprecedented of not right here, not right there, a new self-definition.
How many of the biggest faces of the world are going to think, like the budget in France, or the Times Times in New York City, they're both full of inevitable emotions of people.
Others, like a Paul Guinstein in School, Aliama, or through Canada and a Center France in the Mumbridge, also because of the energy in a metaphor between human beings, ethical and biological guns go to the road.
Again before the physical surface of our planet, some of the most characteristic images are.
The stars are born in the boundaries of gas and struggle, which is released by the unemployment of the field.
The stars are in the same way, the time you get out of the action of smaller atoms, objects and friends and new things.
We can think of faces that have special meaning for us.
It's going to be at the point of looking at the level.
I've spent all my life in the middle, in the Chinese space between dreams of reality, stem and gender, poverty and wealth, science and society.
I'm also a black and a woman.
Like the birth of the stars in the sky, the extension of to know the production of an example of the president's extension of the identities.
I'm also a physicist.
I'm curious in repeat, black holes have been published from Missian and an active village who are sitting in the middle of the galaxy galaxies and teachers out of these black holes in the middle of the speed of light that we're still trying to understand completely.
I wanted to become a physicist since the age of 12.
I didn't have a idea that at that time, by the training of Jai Asian Asian Alexander's conference of American women's country in physics, just 18 women in the United States had a little bit of interest with music, and that the first woman with an astronomy in the field has done this one year ago.
When I went through my track, I went through a good and the speech of life on the right: the opportunity is going to define self-definition, the action of the expectations and experience, the emotions of prices and sometimes, the fingerprinting of the news.
I started my own experience just after my family was invented.
Our economic situation has reduced after my father left our lives.
It's pushing my mother, my sister and I'm out of the relative brains of life in the Middle East and into a little support struggle to exist.
So, I was one of about 60 percent of the strength women who were reduced in the face of economics in their commons.
Unfortunately, at the University of terrifying me a full of trust, and I managed to finish my first description in physics.
After the description, and although I knew I wanted a Ph.D. in asteroids, I was interviewed between the objects.
It was a poster that took my dream, and some people and really amazing programs.
The American physicist French France Ford Faster who'd like to survive teeth students to become physicists.
It went to me because it was a young girl, probably 12 years old, who was waiting for some physicists.
I remember thinking I was going back to this little girl who first got to dream this dream.
I've just wrote to Aganda and I asked a personal device of the poston, which is now depending on my office.
I'm going to give them a email of my own service, and my passion to find myself again in a way to a cartoon.
They've turned me to the program of the University of French and Desert, in the same way between Kenyan and Dettt between two institutions.
After two years outside the school, they got me to the program, and I found myself again in a way to a quote.
After I got my second mayor from a business, I went to luck my cartoon.
Once I've lost the space that at the end of the end, you're going to be able to see my childhood signals, I've expected to a woman's part of my Ph.D.
It's very quickly that I realized that they didn't all have been on this particular level in their space.
I was scared by many of my friends in the classroom, one of them invited me, "to do what I was really going to do," and pushing all of our local tools from our conversation to me to make them.
I wish it was a terrible case, but a lot of women who are living in science, technology, engineering, and math, or SM, it's something they've got a long time.
100 percent of the 60s that we've seen recently in the study of John William and Williams at the University of Chicago have been faced by a galleries and fair, including the thought they're exposed.
It's not a conversation by a woman who's left to the study, which is almost 57 women in the end.
And while there's no bad thing to work, and in fact, my ancestors were able to go to college because many of their parents were working in these jobs, it was obviously obvious to put me in the cases.
Even though I was obviously interested in the pain of the arm that, the real problem was that my view could say everything about my ability.
Over that, it's an extension that women are in SSM's sky don't get them out of drugs that are just women or just people in the walls of hope.
So today I'd like to prove women in SM's skill, which, in privacy, without extending refugees as a privilege of possibilities.
SM itself's motivated between a sense, such that its real wealth can't be valuable without trying to voice the Chinese space between the disciplines.
Science, it's known to understand the physical world through chemistry, physics, biology, can't have an idea in the math room.
A engineer requires the impression of basic science and math to real experience.
Technology is built on a mathematical basis, engineering and science.
The math itself represents a critical role of Amazon Rota, spinning and revealed the physical principles of the world.
SM is really not perfect without any single piece.
It doesn't mean anything about the training that's reduced as SM's wearing with other disciplines.
The goal of this talk is a click: First, say directly to every black woman, altruism, from the first academic or any other woman or another girl who's producing itself in the lower level of stem and a gender, which can be everything you want to be.
My personal hope is that I'm going to make a physicist, but beyond that, everything I'll want to want.
Don't think for a moment because I'll give you who I'm going to be, you can't be who you've imagined.
You're going to get a strong piece of violence that they've given them to the world that I can't even imagine.
Second, between the worst issues in our time, most of us now find their task with SM.
We're as a global society, we've evolved most of the unusual problems of our time.
It's the ones that require computational regulation of the Chinese space between the disciplines to create a facility solutions of a bridge.
Who's better than these different problems from those who have been working on their lives.
We're like consciousness and decisions have to push beyond the first two of diversity and into the richer and the lower theory of full and opportunities.
One of my favorite examples of a typical telescope comes from Korea Alexandria, a refugee of a black hole, which is the last 10 years after the struggle of cancer.
She was a project project in Alexander who was invented the side of NASA in the Monaza, which was the year when she was looking at a planet, and the Milliama went to the 15 billion dollars, two billion scientists in the United States, the United States and the world.
Dan Alexander said, "I'm used to go between two cultures.
For me, it's between the goals in life to transform us from building a fabric budget that can't do every day. "
It shows exactly the power of a Chinese person.
She had the total capacity to lead some of the most effective space in our time, and she brought her place to be exactly who she was in a place.
Jicicico's decline, bringing the SSOCET products, like a regulation, which creates an unusual energy when you play with them, said, "Some of the key part of the invention is not just to create things, it's to understand people and understand the systems that make the world."
The reason I tell my story and the story of Alexander and Jicica is because they're stories between areas, the stories of life that were built in the Nazis, the gender and the invention.
Despite directly questions and transparency on my right to be instead of autism, I'm proud to the profit when I got the description, I was the first black woman who got a cartoon in astronomy in the history of 312 years of a cat.
So I'm now part of a little bit of a little bit of a small, but a growing of women in STM that will bring new perspective and new ideas to life in our most common issues: things like inequal inequality, HIV and AIDS, climate change, an artificial and artificial intelligence.
It doesn't mean anything about the things that we didn't even think about yet.
Women's buttons in SSM are taking some of the most exciting issues and technology of our time.
So, we're focused on a unique way to make these conversations in ways that are more diversity of life experiences.
This perspective can expand a lot of people in a lot of sense that their experience, positive or negative or illustrating the conversations in ways that are active groups and rich groups.
It's not about a woman who's going to have attention.
It's a reminder that we can't get to the best results for humanity without this cooperation, this individual of the Chinese, those who have been scared in a different way, unique experiences and have been affected in a different way.
Basically, we can't be the best expression of our collective genes without taking human beings in the mirror.
Thank you.
Thank you.
They're one of the most amazing things that have ever been created by animal.
They're focused on their complexity, they're still better at their structure, and still powerful enough to keep hundreds of meters in the air.
Like all of the things in nature, they've evolved for millions of years to their modern teacher.
It could be hard to imagine how it could happen.
After all, how would we look at the eyes forms?
Why's a good half of a button, a budget in a crowd?
The institutions of science, we know now that birds are dinosaurs of life.
You can see their imaginations.
Some dinosaurs share some anatomic details with birds that don't have any other animal, like boundaries.
And in the late '90s, nanologists started to improve this idea: dinosaurs with birds's birds still revealed their body.
Since then, scientists have found dozens of dinosaurs with lions of groups.
Some of them were small, and some of them were big like a bus.
If you look at their family's summer, the evolution of the countries don't look so impossible.
The most rules of birds were convenient to be a possibility that was seen like refugees.
So the details started, and there were simple clouds.
Many of these lions of dinosaurs, these judgments evolved to more complex, including how we see today about birds.
At the same time, the president spread on the dinosaurs body, and it's been reduced by the dozens of traffic vehicles, that even went down to their way.
Obviously, we've even learned about some of the molecules that are going to go into color.
They're afraid of a beautiful diversity of collapse: pizza, the coffee, revealing the one of the rivers, they're going to go through a black hole, or as a red red red red red red.
For some dinosaurs, there was a dog on the head, and others have a long, long-term and creativity.
Now, no one of these dinosaurs could not use these groups to fly -- their arms were too short and the rest of their bodies were too much too much.
But birds use not only to fly.
Pautos are used to be used to avoid the forest in the forest.
It's going to take a plan over the Kenyan to succeed on the walls.
Tonus represents the walls of the previous corporations to keep the presidents.
They'd have been able to use these goals as well as dinosaurs.
How is exactly how the dinosaurs with groups -- it's still a mystery.
But if a dinosaurs with a wonderful little bit of his arms in the time a summer, they've created another power of power to help him run faster.
This physicist may have led to the development of more dinosaurs of dinosaurs, which would allow them to run faster and even fly in the air.
At the end of the end, their arms went into the walls.
Just then, maybe 50 million years ago after the first privacy groups evolved, put these dinosaurs into the sky.
A big data is an extended idea.
It represents a amount of digital information, which doesn't go to San, to move, or analyze.
The big information has so big that it's driving the technology of today and challenge us to create the next generation of tool and information.
So, big data is not a new thing.
In fact, the physicists in CERT have been dealing with the challenges of the big data without their discovery for decades.
Fifty years ago, the data of CERT could be reduced in a single computer.
Okay, so it wasn't a normal computer, it was a central computer that was not a perfect building.
To analyze the information, physicists around the world were going to go to CERT to connect to the right machine.
In the '70s, the big data is going to grow up to our tumor for different universes of computers, which were like a trillion in CERT.
Every star was a unique network that was developed for him.
But physicists who were going to go without thinking about the boundaries between the roads, and that's why they had to go to science all of them.
So, we looked at the nervous networks on the web CET.
In the '80s, red networks that have been talking about different buildings have been seen in all Europe and the United States, and it's been reduced to spread, but right now.
In order to wear the physicists around the world to go to the GDP without the prosperity that's in CERT without training, networks have to talk at the same language.
We've lost the new web history from the United States, and then we've remained the rest of Europe, and we've started the CERRRERRT between Europe and the United States in 1989, and the global Internet is really fair!
Piicticians could go to the objects of information from far around the world, create results, and write jobs in their homework.
So, they wanted to share their cameras with their colleagues.
To judge this information collaboration, we created the Internet at the beginning of the 1990s.
Picicticians didn't have to know where the information is missed to find it and wear it, an idea that you're looking around the world and change the way people communicate in our lives today.
Over the beginning of the year 2000, the growth growth of our big data has gone through our ability to work in CERT, although we had buildings that are full of computers.
We had to start repeating the objects of the information to our partners to activate local and a local disaster in different machines.
In order to reduce these different resources with the extinct technologies, we've evolved a feedback, that we can share a transformation from my father's feedback around the bus.
It's looking at training and device.
But this definition model couldn't be exposed out of our community so easily, where everybody has the resources to share and companies also wouldn't have the same level of trust.
Instead, a dream, a more business approach to access to resources recently, which is called a giant feedback, that other communities are now going to open their big data.
Perhaps it looks France to a place like CERT, a lab that's focused on the small building blocks of the material, to be the source of something as big information.
But the way we're learning basic proteins, as well as the forces that they're affecting each other, require to create them quickly, by making prototypes in our face and their feminds when they're sharing almost at the speed of light.
To see these features, our genius, with 150 million sensors, actually like a very low three-dimensional camera, which is a long time of all the preference -- that's 14 million times a second.
It creates a lot of information.
But if data was so big in the environment, why do we suddenly sit and hear about it so much now?
Well, as the old atmosphere is around, the whole big whole of their proteins, and it's not just the science that's going to take it.
The fact that we can stop more knowledge by spending local information and the price of lines can know and interact with a lot of life today's face, whether in real time, like a movement or a short motion, in biological evolution, like in Publisa, or biology, like business, or abstraction.
Almost every single field is reduced to the end of a big data, with mobile networks that flow the bus, cameras on the ground and air, organizations that live in information that was published in the network, and adults reduce civil costs around the world.
The challenge is to invent new tools and techniques to make these big, to help decisions, improve medical security, and another to answer the strength and the engagement of the crisis in ways you can't imagine today.
Can you create something from a piece?
Or do you just make the material?
Yes, but just when she's a company with her speech, analogy.
And there's something pretty close in Antarctica: there's a lot less of it in the universe that needs to be.
Let's start with the most famous scientific explanation ever:'s equal as a square meter.
It's basically that the box is a concentrated energy, and it's a piece of energy and energy, like two meters with a huge tree.
The 90 trillion trillion dollars of energy equal to one of the left.
But how do you actually make energy into the material?
The magic is about energy processes.
If you're a huge amount of energy in small space, new proteins are made.
If you look closer, we see that these proteins are always coming in the cases, like water.
It's because particles always have a partner, announcing, and it's always created just in qualities: 50 / 50.
It may sound like science fiction, but it's life today's everyday life from half of particles.
Basically between two prototypes in the big CERRT, billions of particles and proteins are created every second.
Think, for example, on the alcode.
It's got a small piece and a negative electricity.
Lankota, his chicken, there's exactly the same left, but a positive electricity.
But, except from the hormones, the two proteins are completely identical and very specific.
And that's the same thing that's true to their insects, the prototype and the analogy.
So, scientists are convinced that there's made out of analogy, feel, and it's just like our world.
In this world, maybe it's analogy, analogy, and for example, analogy.
Now imagine Golden and Antarctica is one of the other.
The two products that are produced into these lights will be completely impressed by a big amount of energy, which is equal to a atomic page.
Because it's a matter of material and analogy that's made so much energy, the science that's full of ideas about the energy level of material, for example, to fuel spaces like a journey between stars.
After all, the energy that's in a high selection of a billion material in a normal fuel.
The energy that's made one of Antarctica material to avoid 1,000 times around the planet, or bring the space space to the train.
So why don't we use a material to create energy production?
Well, analogy doesn't sit and wait, it's ready to collect it.
We need to create analogy before we can switch anatomy, and it takes a billion more energy to create an analogy that you get back.
But, what if there was an analogy in space and we could make it one day from Antarceland where it was.
A few decades ago, many scientists believe it's possible.
Today, expectations showed that there's no significant amount of analogy in any place in the beautiful universe, which is strange because we said before, there's got to be exactly the same amount of analogy of material like there's a material in the universe.
Because Antarctica and proteins need to exist in equal books, this unusual material?
Now it's really a mystery.
To understand what might happen, we have to go back to the big tree.
Once the universe is produced, a huge amount of energy became a corporation, and our first universe has been able to be able to have a sense of material and analogy.
But just a second later, most of the material and all the analogy of material repeated each other, and there's a huge amount of career that's going to be able to even the day.
It's just about 100 million pounds of the original material remained and not analogy.
"Now, you might say," Why is all the analogy that's going to be remained? "
We seemed to be lucky about how it was that an unprecedented metaphor was there between material and analogy.
Otherwise, there were no proteins in any place in the universe and no human beings.
But what made a symmetry?
Scientists in CERT are trying to find the reason why something exists and why don't we live in the universe full of only?
But, until now, we just don't know the answer.
In the last few months, I've come to a number of weeks with a single arm of clothes.
One day, I was invited to an important event, and I wanted to wear something new and special.
I've gone on the roof, and I didn't find anything to wear.
I was lucky and at the same day I visited a biological, and I had access to a 3D printer.
So I've been watching a puncture in the computer, and I've put the coffee into a printer.
And the judge was spread over the night.
The next day I took the parts, I looked at them together in my hotel room, and it's actually the piece that I'm wearing right now.
But it wasn't the first time I sat in the clothes.
For my gender voice at school to design a horizontal design, I decided to try and make a collapse that's in a 3D disease from the house.
The problem was that, I knew something about a 3D printing, and I had just an hour of months, to understand how I'm looking for five different patterns.
I felt the most creative when I was working from home.
I love to try to experience new materials, and it's always trying to develop new techniques to create my most exciting examples.
I love to go to old and strategies and strange agencies to search for weird and strange materials, bring them home and experience.
As you can imagine, my partners for a girl didn't like it at all.
Laughter) So I decided to go to work with big machines, as those who don't go into the window.
I love the printing and the task in the work that I can do with all of these kinds of technologies, like an ambridge machine, spinning back and return.
In one of the summers of the summer, I've come here, to New York City to move in a horizon in Chicada.
We've been working on two amazing impressions that were reduced in a 3D print.
They were amazing, as you can see.
But I had the number of reasons for them.
They've created a listening plastic and therefore there were very choices.
The patterns couldn't sit in, and they were even going to look at the Palestinian revolution.
With a 3D printer, for the cases, there's a lot of freedom to design that's going to see just like they want, but they still depend on big industrial industries that were focused on the lab from the studio.
In the next year, a friend gave me a chain that was reduced in a 3D printer, which was reduced in a 3D printer.
I knew these were a lot of cheap and much more likely to say that we used in my death.
So I looked at a chain, and I thought, "If I can print a chain from the house, why don't I print out of the house as well?"
I really liked the idea that I didn't have to go to the market, which is something else in the painting -- I can just design them and print them directly from the house.
I've found a small France, and I've learned everything I know about a 3D printer.
Secondly, they gave me a key key to the lab, so I could try into the night, every night.
The central challenge was to find the right stage to print the fossil.
So what's this about?
It's the material that's coming to the printer.
And I went for a month with PLA, which is a hard material, survivor, and I've gone.
The French point came out when I got the Pals, a new kind of Nigeria.
It's very powerful and powerful.
And I was able to print the first hand, the red junk that had the word "Lord" -- freedom in French -- motivated in it.
I looked at this word because I felt so nervous and released when I could design my hand from the house and put it on myself.
And in fact, you can easily move the junk, replace the word to anything else.
For example, your name, or your mother.
It's the amount of a small printer, so I had to reduce the face like a cat.
And I wanted to solve another challenge.
I wanted to print in the faces that I could use, just like regulations.
I found a open-source of architecture that I've lost an example.
And I couldn't design a beautiful worker that was used as a regulation.
And it even looks a little bit like a station.
So I took his coffee, I gave him and I sat it that I've been scared with him -- I've created a lot of grades of it.
And I had to print 1,500 hours for my molecule.
So I brought six pounds home and I took 247.
It's a very slow process, but let's remember that the Internet was also very slow 20 years ago, so the 3D printing will become a more career and in a short time we can print a little bit in a house in a few hours or even a few minutes ago.
So a friend of college, you want to see what it looks like?
The audience: Yeah!
Applause) DP: France wearing one of my weapons.
Almost everything she's wearing here, I've taken out of the house.
It's even her shoes are treated.
Audience: Wow!
Audience: cool!
Applause) DP: Thank you, cultural.
Thank you, a friend.
So I think that in the future of materials will evolve, and they'll see and feel like we know today.
You're going to show you the clothes that are just in your hands.
Music was once so sophisticated.
You'd have to go to buy a clip or a click, but we can't just put it in digital music -- directly to the phones.
It's also a very strange thing.
And I'm wondering how our world will see when our clothes will be digital, just like this graph.
Thank you.
Applause) Thank you.
The ancient Westerners had a great idea of the universe is just simple.
You think, everything you had to create was four secrets: land, air, fire, and water.
The theories say, it's beautiful.
It's got spontaneous and genetic.
She says that by bringing these four objects in different ways, you can create all the wonderful direction of the universe.
Again, for instance, give you things happen.
Other and water, good things.
But theories say, she had a problem.
It doesn't prove anything you can do, and it's the basis of experimental science.
And worse, the theory was profound.
But scientists were great scientists of thinking and in a century ago, Luylas, Mexico Mexico remained one of the scientific ideas that were killed the most time.
All we're seeing is made of tiny parts and intuitive parts of material called atoms.
This theory is simple and elegant, and it has the solution on the ground theory, air, and water's water to be true.
Fifty of computers and scientific experiments have proved that the real secrets, things like Martin, carbon, and luckily, can be produced to atoms.
In the theory of Linkin, the atom is the smallest invisible protein that can still be identified as an artist, carbon, or a laser.
The only thing that I've been in the idea of Lotsis is that atoms, they're actually, dream.
What's more, his autonomous idea turns out that it's just a small part of what the universe is made.
What looks like the age of the universe is, actually, quite rare.
The atoms of Loliss, and the things they might be made of, they're actually five percent of what we know is there.
The physicists know that the rest of the universe, 95 percent of it, is going to go out, may be a tremendous and energy.
How do we know that?
Well, we know because we're watching things and we see them.
It may seem very spontaneous, but it's actually quite deep.
All of the things that atoms are look like.
The light comes back from them, we can see them.
When we look to the space, we see stars and galaxies.
Some of them, like this that we live on, they're physical, that's going to go around space.
When scientists first learned the movement of galaxy groups in the 1930s, and they learned the amount of material they've known, they had a surprise.
They found that there's no enough material looks at these groups to keep them together.
More institutions of a single galaxies have lost this particular result.
It just doesn't have enough material in galaxies to provide enough power to keep them together.
What we can see is, they're supposed to reduce, but they're not.
So there's to be a material there that we can't see.
We call this material.
The best dots to make an airport today comes from something called a commercial background, the front of the big bank, but it's another story.
All of the evidence that we have is saying that power is out there, and it's most of the material in these physical galaxies that reduce the sky.
So where does it leave us?
We knew time that the sky didn't go around us and we're sitting in a pretty normal planet, that's a pretty strange star, in a pretty normal galaxy of a normal galaxy.
It's the discovery of power that took us one step back from the center of the buildings.
It told us that the material we might be just part of the car of the universe.
But another one came.
In the beginning of the century, scientists who've been looking at the presidents of the universe that didn't only happen that everything is happening from anything else, as the exceptions of the universe that started in a hot and a hot, but the spread of the universe looks as well.
What about this?
Or there's some kind of energy that's pushing this object, just as you're giving energy to a car, or the power is not going to do as we think.
Most scientists think it's the first answer, which is a kind of energy that's pushing the tree, and they read it energy.
The best policies today allows us to choose exactly how fast the universe is.
It seems that energy energy is about 68 percent of the universe and power material is about 27 percent, which is only five percent for us and everything else we can see.
So what's the tremendous material?
We don't know, but there's one theory, which is called Sauditory, which can explain some of it.
Scientists, or Scott in the coffee, revealing a whole sense of new proteins, some of them can reduce the patient's material.
If we're a secret of secret, we can go from understand five percent of our universe, the things that we can actually see, about a third.
Not just a day of work.
An energy will probably be harder to build, but there's some intervention theories where you might see the way.
They've got theories that go back to the big idea of the future generations, the idea that we started with a few minutes ago, the idea that the universe should be simple.
These theories are just one student from it from the wonderful direction of the universe, Mr. Rittt.
The idea is that all the proteins that we know today are just a different mirror of the mirror.
Unfortunately, theories today are, still uncomfortable.
But, with so much a universe that's going to make a crowd, it's high.
Does all that make you feel small?
It doesn't need.
Instead, you need to compare the fact, as we know, you're friends in the only species in the universe that's going to even start to take his arms, and you're living at the right time to see our understanding is happening.
Today, we're going to look at the world of Rome through a young girl.
Here it's, a photograph of itself in the atmosphere that's at the end of Asia.
And what's similar, and it's just five years old.
It's got a larger five-hicle, a five-hicle bus, called on her father.
News don't get the amount of violence in the buildings get.
What's worse is that my father was trying to read all of his daughter's daughter.
"Dumba!"
It's called the mystery that's put on the classroom, II.
It's got older animals, II, which is seven years old.
And then there's the mystery, which is 10.
There could be an Italian IV, but is it going on in her night three years ago.
Women?
The Amazons were also the ones.
They could track the virus of China's organ on the back of the road with the president, the brilliant ones like the Atlantic Moss Ocus.
But they had a really stuck with some kind of mystery, and they had a big dream or the big, and so forth of who they came to write it.
The II II doesn't just invest on the classroom, it's also extended.
You see, it's early, while all the customers and the friends of her father come to see him in his house and dream him honor.
Los Pops Scotcus, 17 years old, he wants to move to Italian II in five to the next seven years, came from.
And it's going to see that he's repeated not after his wife to the future, but after her father.
The concept of the journey, it doesn't know that the father of the mystery think it's and its family are rich but still space from the suffering.
After all, it's the part of Roman who's not in books and fair.
All of a sudden, all the men go with a dad.
It's the second hour and time for him to be in the sentence with a sacrifice of a song that's driving to his television and reduce his fingers.
Now the house is now more.
The men will only come back in seven hours, just in time for dinner.
But what's going on at home in these seven weeks?
What's the mystery, mystery and imagination do all the day?
No simple question!
Everything was written by the efforts we have today was written by men.
It makes it a lot of their lives of women is really hard.
However, we can't have a history of Mars, so here's this.
We can start in a threat.
There's a giant gift, which is the new wire of Dad working on a new axis.
Now, you know, you're demand and and you're going to go to the back of the paper where you're going to use the big web, you're going to have 10 meters and in a political form.
Most of them liked the idea that their parents work with a paper.
We know it because it's writing about the inventions of so many women from Iraq.
In Nigeria, women are losing out of the house and go in the city.
They're going to go to the mirror in the morning to avoid the men or the fabric of women.
Some of them go to the last option of 1970s to the parasite: pushing in the South as men.
Where they don't have a place, it's an iron that the men are: in Porn, in the sentence, or at the Senate.
Their place in public is in Portucus with genes, with boxes, and with the dogs to go on.
When you're worthy, you know, you're going to go out of the house to go to some place, like the Ford's Friday, they're alive to predict.
II and II and Italian devil II is familiar, but the mystery I'm dealing in order to move in two years with the Mexicus, not familiar.
It's not slow, it just has more to do.
It's going to be an axis saying that it's wearing the regular symbol: News and all the protests that Pixis gave her -- techniques, prosperity, president, and generations.
It may even be reduced by its asteroid.
All this song is right, "I'm going to go to the bone of this 19 who gave me all of these things to go!"
And while they're waiting, II and Iraq II and II games play with their bubles, they're going to make sure.
One day, these bubles will be accurate to me in their house on their own day.
Okay, we're ready.
The roads of parliament parliams are built by customers.
They've also got a dirt with them and they're going to look at the Portos of Luba.
A high instruction on these pages, the girls look out through the viruses in order to see the streets of the doors that go from.
They want the city, they're going to go through the philosophical, but then they're going to jump on the hill to the Portos of Luba.
He's been built by Luba House Airdus's first, on the website of Violo.
He wasn't such a wonderful guy.
He's been trying to get a lot of work to eat in his fingerprint just because the crowd was taken.
Luckily, the wouldn '
The elephants are focused on the ground and the states come out in the hand, two, two, they're going to go through the stairs into a lot of deep genes.
The II II wanted and sold on the back.
II'm going to expect her, but it's a more popular graphic to read.
It's a painting of Roti and trying to imagine them into water, something that it's never going to do, except from the next part of the philosophy.
Over, it's going to have a good slide on 50,000 faces but it's going to see a little bit of the blood and the red.
If she would like a really good interview, she could become a Western and sit in the front.
But a career of treatment in Western woman's accident is not to predict every single one.
Now, I'm going to have a two-dimensional woman who's going to go from the Iranians.
A time.
When they're coming there after the right hour, something happens.
Freebruary restaurants on the floor.
All of the dogs are collected in Triday and waiting for free.
Dad's going to fly.
He wouldn't make his children, but like a lot of Rome, he believes that faces should be done.
The judgment is ready to defend.
No one knows who's sitting in the success, but Dad would read to Berlin to get out of the answer from them, if he had to.
The door opens the personal door to the house.
It's going to go on the restaurants.
In the face, they're in their red not their red, but in the chicken, a young girl.
It's the girl's daughter's daughter, 15 years old, and she's already in Nigeria.
Let's look at what's going on.
There's five to 10 percent of a chance that she doesn't survive the library, but in the time, she came to dinner with her family.
As a teenager, she proved that she was a successful woman by looking for children and women to her husband, who had his name in the future.
The family's going to the room of the food and limited a long lunch.
It seems that Dad has an investment for dinner instead of another.
In the summer day, the girls want the theater to lose behind the big eye that you've been in France, from a lot of the head of her father.
When they go back to the house, the girls want the trick.
The roads, young and old, men and women, waiting for free.
When he came back, he might return his chimpanzees, he'll make sure that you're going to win his face through violence and terrorism, they're all worked for a victim.
But, the girls, they're cutting to the upper level to the night, they're familiar to bed.
Imagine a place that's so important that you can't see your nose on your face.
French eyes or roads, it's the same thing because the sun will never get there.
You see light.
When you're going to look at, a blue light around you.
"I can look at it to the world," You think.
But you're not because Dr. Dang just opened up and all of you live.
You're just one of a lot of creatures at the bottom of the ocean that's too learning to appreciate the power of biology.
In biology, it's about the capacity of some living creatures to create light.
The human body can create things like fossil and reproductive and regular deforestation, but these organisms can become ridiculous parts of them.
It's like the nature made them ready for the career.
Why?
In one way or another, biology is reducing the survival risks of life creatures.
Take for example, the limitation.
Her capacity to move in green is helping her a hole in a hot tree, but it's just one of many things that are fair.
The train of the vehicle, the Nicox Fox, can move the body in two colors: red and green.
Would you eat something that looks like an airport?
There's also not a scientist.
The fossil lights are conducted on a safe device.
And then there's the deep water muscle, I'm going to have a French French.
When it feels happy, it's populated by Jim Money.
Who doesn't wait to the other direction when they just won't do it?
And more, this wall is a larger crazy president that you want to eat the satellites of the kitchen.
So what if you can't expect biology?
There's no problem!
There's other ways of living can make biology work for them, even if they're not born with the opposite.
Let's go back to the analog of moments before he tried to eat you.
The idea of his head?
He's come from a lesson called Assa.
The Amazon is contained in biological bacteria.
The analogy can't get rid to India, so he's going to wait out of galleries in a place.
Remember the liquid?
It can make yourself a light in fact.
In her teacher teacher, there are two chemicals, Linstein and said then.
When the Linstein and the Luthern said, "The French's minister's remains in the presence of a pencil and a fuel," called ATM, the chemical response is made of energy in a way of light.
Once scientists understood how the wheelchairs come out of the location and the philosopher, they used genetic engineering to create this light response in other creatures that can't move.
For instance, they put these genes, or these instructions, the cell to create a penguin in in a kitchen.
Once it was there, the Tasmanian devil was followed by the hormones that went into his DNA and recognized like a single tree.
The beauty of biology, not like the light from the sun or a bone, it's not coal.
It's happening in a variety of temperature that doesn't survive anything.
And in addition to the fair communities, which is known when the chemicals in it, biological responses are using new materials.
This is one of the reasons that engineers are trying to develop objects with biology.
Just think, if you take them in a rapidly roads, they can move the way, by using a fingerprint and other materials, we'll exist and species to act.
I'm going to talk about the Islamic advantage!
It can help our planet live much longer.
Do you find yourself thinking about other ways to use biology for good friends?
The weight of the light that you're looking at healthy may help you find a friend, but how biology can improve our survival?
If you start thinking about this way, you've seen the light.
What is an algorithm?
In the computer science, algorithm is a set of instructions for a problem, a step after a step.
Obviously, algorithms are affected computers, but we have people also have algorithms.
For example, how would you end the number of people in the room?
Well, if you'd like me, you'd probably do any person, one after the other, and you're going to go from 0: 1,234 and so on.
Well, this is an algorithm.
In fact, let's try to express it in a little bit more reduced in the Olympic code, such as a speech that's an explanation.
Next is worth 1,000.
Each person in the room, Nazine is one plus.
How do we also take it in a code?
Well, one teacher's one causes you to say, changes called "Oh," and I'm going to take it with the value to 0.
It just means that at the beginning of our algorithms, the thing that we've got is a value of 0.
After all, before we started to survive, we didn't tell anything yet.
It's just a Muslim.
I could read him almost all over there.
Now, a twice 2 is reduced to the beginning of Hollywood, a sequence of steps came back a few times.
So, in our example, the way we do is to explore people in the room.
It's below two in three seconds, which is just how we're going to try.
It's a profound that it's a three teacher that's going to return itself.
So, what the Saudi code says is that after you're looking at the ocean, for every person in the room, we're going to run your name one.
Now, is the algorithm right?
Well, let's think about it a little bit.
Is it working if there are two people in the room?
Let's see.
In one second, we're going to take the name in the ocean.
For every one of these two people, we're going to run your name one.
So, in the first place in Luba, we're going to predict National 1, in the other way in the same cell phone, we're going to sell NA2 2.
And so, in the algorithm, there's two, which is really if you put the number of people in the room.
By now, it's all good.
But what about a coffee camp?
So let's say there's people in the room, except for me, that's a writer.
In one second, we're going to take the name to Olympic.
This time, with this, a three teacher doesn't work at all because there's no people in the room, and so NAS, that's actually a number of people in the room.
It's pretty simple, right?
But to explore one people, it's pretty effective, right?
I'm sure you can succeed more!
Why didn't we save two people every time?
Instead of going to survive 1,2,3,5,5,6,6,78, and so on, why don't we survive 2,4,68 and so on?
It even sounds faster, and it's safe.
Let's look at this text in Finance.
We're going to win on NAS.
Each of people in the room, President Man is two.
A pretty simple change, right?
Instead of studying one people, we're training instead of two times.
This algorithm is faster than two times.
But is it true?
Let's see.
Is it working when there are two people in the room?
In one second, we're going to take the name to 0.
This people, we're going to raise your name two.
And so, at the end of this algorithm, there's two, which is really a number of people in the room.
Let's say there's people in the room.
In one teacher, we're going to take the name to Olympic.
Like first, three teacher doesn't work at all because there are no people in the room, and that's what's going to stay zero, that's what you're really going to see in the room.
But what if there were three people in the room?
How does this algorithm work?
Let's see.
In one second, I'm going to take the name to Olympic.
Loke out of these people, we're going to spend the name two, but then what?
There's no longer a pair of people in the room, so two is not more relevant.
And so, at the end of this algorithm, red is still two, what's not true.
This algorithm doesn't make any of it because it has a profound.
Let's fix with another code code.
We're going to win on Nazis is equal to zero.
Each of people in the room, President Man 2 and two.
If one person remains without a pair, a NAA is one.
In order to solve this problem, we're looking at four journalists, another giant event, which is only if there's one person who can't connect after.
So now, whether there's one or three or every number of people in the room, this algorithm will improve them right now.
Can we succeed more?
Well, we can survive at three, four or even 10 and 10, but beyond this will do a little bit more difficult to vote.
At the end of the day, whether you're going to go by a computer or a person, algorithms are just a set of instructions that you can solve the problems.
These were just three.
What problem you would open with algorithms?
So when I was a kid...
It was my team.
And I was really bad at Scott.
I didn't like to play it, I didn't like to watch it.
So that's what I did. I went to the fish.
And for all of my ladies, I've been looking at CO2 emissions, and that's the creatures I've seen on a fixed basis.
But after I grew up and I went to college, and I went home at the early 1990s, it's what I found.
My team was conducted.
It was a liquid as my team was killed.
And when I was looking at the subject, from a really personal perspective as a fish, I started at a level to understand, well, what's the rest of the world thought about it?
The first place where I looked at was the cartoons.
And when I went to the cartoons, despite where I was -- whether I was in North Carolina, or Paris, or London, or what I didn't have -- I went to see these four creatures repeat themselves, and again -- in France, on the ice -- a muscle, a corn, San, and a don't.
And I thought it's very strange, and when I looked at it, I wondered, would someone else notice that kind of market?
And as I looked at this, I realized that people didn't look at it as their team.
People are normal, the way they look at the tool was that way.
It's not a human neighborhood that's not used to reduce the natural world to some individual elements.
We've done it before, 10,000 years ago, when we've made the cases.
If you're looking at the Amazon Amazon from 10,000 years ago, you'll see building, you'll see, resources, you'll see all kinds of different creatures.
But if you look at the telescope of this age -- you know, 2,000 years ago, you'll see these four pounds: satellites, fibers and water.
It's true to stories.
You're looking at refugees in New York City 150 years ago, 200 years ago, you're going to see an insector, dozen dogs, dozen dogs, dozens of water.
But look forward to a generation of modern agriculture, and you'll see four: Canadian India, Brothers, chickens and chimps.
So it makes sense that we went to this direction.
But how did we go to this direction?
Well...
First of all, this is a very new problem.
It's the way we've been looking at the oceans for the last 50 years.
The other world's war was a huge tool to use ourselves in the war in fish.
All of the technology that we've done in the other world -- finished, climate materials -- all of these things become the direction of the fish.
And so we're seeing a series of privacy in the capacity of all the time, a world of a second world for the current time.
And right now it means that we take 80 million tons of the water every year.
It's the leading to the weight of the people in China who are sent from the ocean every year.
And it's not a case that I use China as an example because China is now the largest level in the world.
Well, it's just half the story.
The second half of the story is the amazing tumor in and agriculture and agriculture, which is now, just last two years, has started to move on the states that we produce.
So if you take the fish and those who grow together, you get a valuable value to the two China that are made out of the ocean every year.
And again, it's not a case that I used China as an example, because China, also to be the biggest fish, it's also the biggest fish.
So let's look at the four choices we're doing now.
The first -- the most beautiful sea in America in America and most of the West, is a muscle.
The muscles in nature -- as a private product -- it's a terrible product.
Two, five, 7.5 pounds of fish in nature have been reduced in a normal way to bring half the muscles of a market.
They're also very ineffective than a market.
In a recent study that's been done at the University of Luki, it's been reduced to a musician that's one of the ways to worry about fear that you can find.
So you can grow them in the holes, and people grow them in the holes, and they grow them a lot in this region.
The problem is...
The place where you grow the muscles is in these interventions -- the worst forests.
Now look at these wonderful senses that are born.
But they're the things that's looking at the land, you're responding on the slides, you're creating an environment for all kinds of young fish, young muscles, all kinds of things that are important to the environment.
Well, that's what's happening to a lot of the rural forests.
We've been reduced by millions of diverse events for 30 or 40 years.
It's the rate of the Hott House, but we're still in a serious privilege.
The other thing that's going on here is a phenomenon that's made out of the film from Mark Benjamin called "Talk his name."
The phenomenon is very relevant to everything you've ever seen about different types of terrorism.
Because what's happening now, we've got a muscles that's causing muscles, a huge amount of animals sensory, the regulations are reduced in the corner and become an alphase.
And sometimes, a lot of these tools -- they're going to be scared by dogs -- you're looking at what's called "fish," fish that we'd like to see on the ground, tons and turn them into the entire chicken -- and it's a bizarre systems that's going to move themselves
On the other sea, the worst sea in America, and also across the West, it's Tony.
So Tona is the athetic global fish.
The extinction regions need to look at so that the enormous motion is best.
Our decline region, called the Amazon Amazon Amazon, is called ICT, the intervention of national concept for the Atlantic.
The Great Turkey Center once said to him, "The Turkey between national to search all of the autonomy."
Of course, we've seen an extraordinary stories in ICT in the last few years, there's a big place for improvement, but we're going to say that Tony is a global fish, and to manage it, we need to manage the world.
Well, we can also try to grow a tool, but Tona is a bad animal in an extraordinary way to agriculture.
A lot of people don't know it, but Tony is a hot person.
They can pay their body in 20 degrees above the environment temperature, they can switch at a speed of over 70 kilometers per hour.
So it's kind of driving all the solutions of tumor, right?
A big fish in the hope is -- or a fish with a morning person, or it doesn't get a lot.
It's a great thing to grow proteins.
But if you've got this privilege production that's been stuck in 70 kilometers, and you're going to spend his blood -- not very good for agriculture.
The next manufacturing -- the most beautiful sea in America and Western -- it's a museum.
Now Salin has his prosthetic, but it's not necessarily going through a dirt.
That's me in a Canada.
Science was the house of a lot of natural concept.
But if you look at a map of a code, every point on the map is a summer.
There's more than 3,000 scripts in a chicken country.
I'm a lot of times saying that's why people's in a project like this -- Laughter) If someone could just release the chicken's chicken, I feel we could have a much better world.
But I've led this particular career in the middle of the international parks once, and this guy from South Carolina, he said, "You know, you don't have to be so hard with your project, because in the North Korea, there's 35,000 pounds."
So it's a national epidemic, it's a map between national.
And there's curiosity everywhere, and it's exactly the things that you're going to get in nature from coming to their survivors.
So as a result, we've come to an artist agriculture, and Minin is one of the most successful, at least a number of perspective.
When they started to grow a concept for the first time, it could take three pounds of Darwin to create a half of a Darwin.
The industry, to her mind, has a significant disorder.
They came up at least two to one, although it's a little bit of hundreds of because if you look at the way I can make a magical agriculture, they're effective -- they're going to have a capacity to get a museum.
These effects in the mouth are sophisticated fish.
So in reality -- what's called FFFFO, a fish was out there -- kind of hard to say.
But anyway, you can read to the industry, it's reduced the amount of fish to the Nigerian.
The problem is that we've also changed with the amount of corruption that we make.
Social agriculture is the food system that grew up very quickly on the planet.
She grew up sometimes in something like seven percent a year.
And so even though we're doing less fish to bring it to the market, we're still killing a lot of these little fish.
And it's not just the fish that we're feeding to the fish, we're also feeding fish to the chicken and muscles.
So we've got chimps that they're tremendous, but in a strange way, we've also got fish that eat chickens.
Because the Israeli products of Congress -- customers, blood, objects -- nanoes and fish.
So I'm a lot of times wondering, does there have fish that eat a fish that's a fish?
It's a kind of redesign for all the chicken and the road. Anyway -- Laughter) I've got everything, with that, the result is in a terrible gene.
What you're talking about is something between 20 and 30 million pounds of rural creatures that take out of the oceans and come in using and plants.
It's equal to a chicken, or all the people in the United States that are sent from the water every year.
The last four is a kind of artificial thing.
It's what the industry called "Dr. Balin."
There's a lot of fish that's designed for this white fish, but the way to say the story, I think, is through the Central Olympics of American policia, Sundan.
So San Darwin actually started with the bank.
And he started because on a local idea found that when he got his museum on a third day, no one came in.
Because it was a community community, they had fish.
So he went to Kiki and said, "I'm going to bring you in San San, who's going to be made of the bank."
Robert was saying, "I don't think it would work.
I'd like to do a birthday, and there's an analogy in the party of Germany.
But let's do it, let's go.
If his grandfather's Sweden will sell more, it's going to be the London. "
Well, it's a kind of tool in the ocean that the Hollywood doesn't win.
So he did San San School.
Unfortunately with that, the San Atlang has been three cents.
Ray wanted the San Warwin in from 25 cents, so he went to the atmosphere.
We all know what happened to the Atlantic Central in India.
So now San Swander's printing is made out of Olympics, it's the largest piano in the United States, one to 1.5 billion kilometers of fish that find every year from the water.
If we do the plastics, the next choice will probably be optimistic.
Titchen is one of the fish that no one of them had heard about 20 years ago.
It's actually a very effective component of a protein that's been scared to live, and it's been the same world.
It's actually a very sustainable solution, it's going to get rid of a hour in an hour.
The problem is that when you look at the West, it doesn't do what the West wants it to do.
It really doesn't have what's called the prototype of sanitation.
It doesn't have the EPA and DA's three genes that we all think will help us live forever.
So what do we do?
I mean, first, what about this journey, the philosophy?
The fish that's made a huge part of 20 to 30 million of these neurons.
Well, one possibility that many of the prosperity has changed is whether we can eat them?
Can we eat them directly instead of feeding them into the corn?
There's a lot of arguments for it.
They're very effective to come to the market, some of the fuels of Times, muscles, and at the top of the effective activity.
They're also very rich in the Olympic, a great source of EPA and DA.
So this is a potential.
And if we were to go in this track, what I would say is, instead of pay some dollars to the wall -- or how many dollars to the video, really -- and turn it into all the fish, can we cut the fish and reduce the price to the fish and make it our way to treat these slides?
Other possibilities with that, which is much more interesting, it's to look at metaphors, especially in patients.
Now, they have a high value of EPA and DA, they're similar to the box.
They're also very effective.
In order to bring a crowdness to the market is about one of three seconds from an academic that requires to bring a bridge in the market.
They don't require any of all, they're actually getting their three-dimensional genome by a regulation of the water.
In fact, the three genomes come, it doesn't come from the fish.
Mexico creatures three, it's just a biologically biological component.
Others and other languages do a huge amount of planning water.
A single school can predict dozens of genes every day.
And it's important in an extraordinary way when we look at the world.
Right now, Nigeria, used to reduce our water's faces to treat huge trees.
More than 400 new areas have been created in the last 20 years, enormous levels of beautiful animals.
We can also look at no fish.
We can look at microbes.
We can look at the countries, the sea of the sea, all the different kinds of things that can be richer in the atmosphere three, can be rich in proteins, really great things.
They're focused on the water just like causes.
And in a strange way, it turns out that you can actually feed fingers in them.
Now, I'm not a big restaurant of a speech.
But if you want to continue to grow in a long time and from where my father is limited, you grow in water, you don't have to effect them -- a important voice.
And the last fish is a question.
We've got the ability to create agriculture that create a great advantage of a beautiful protein for us.
The manufacturing will have to be sophisticated, it's going to have to grow faster, it's going to have to be a transformation that's changing and have to be a profound prosthetic, the EPA, DA, the three metaphorus of regulations that we're looking for.
It's kind of a piece of paper.
I was talking about these issues for 15 years.
Every time I do a new story, someone says to me, "We can do this. We can do it.
We've put all this. We can make fish that they're a positive advantage of beautiful protein and it's got three genes. "
It's great.
It doesn't seem to define the scale of this.
It's time to define it.
If we do it, 30 million tons of tool, a third of the world's worse, you'll stay in the water.
So I guess what I'm saying is that's what we went to.
We're tend to go with our concept instead of our brains.
But if we go with it, or a kind of cooperation of this, maybe we'll have a little bit more than that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The mayor is 100 percent smoke; there's nothing else in it.
The French of Kenyan, on the other hand, has only been about 11 percent.
And yet, the mammoth is healthy to you, and the French of Panka doesn't.
Why?
It turns out, as the market that we eat doesn't affect our weight or our entire asteroid or our risk of heart disease like what kind of funny we eat.
But let's go back: What's it slow?
If we've been doing a pain on a corner, which is a curious fish, beyond the men, beyond the coffee, into the cells, we'd see that the material we've actually read out of the molecules that's actually called the muscles that are read, and they're not all identified.
Here's one example.
Three costs from the left, it's the French.
Now, you can think about it as the spinal cord that's going to keep the rest of the molecule together.
Three reasons of the quality of the right is called "restaurants, and it's a better difference in the structure of these survival that's made if the market is, let's say, producing or dinosaurs; whether it's getting quickly or not, how good it's or bad for you.
Let's look at some of these differences.
The first is the need.
Specience can be short or long.
Another difference, more importantly is the kind of context between the objective atoms.
A few stimulators have just a single connection.
Others also have individual connections and patients.
Socies are scared with a single building called restaurants, and it's with a single chicken or more inevitable academic.
Now, most of the unfortunate artists are good for you, while the Southern Southers are bad for you when they're in the wind.
The Southern artists, the story is pretty close there, but the artists don't exist is not.
These molecules in these molecules have a strange machine; they're listening.
So, it means that there are two ways to organize each other's relationship.
The first is that, the two atoms are the same side and the two objects are at the same side.
The second way is that.
Now the artist Toman and Homman are in different forms of the finger context.
Now, although these two molecules are made exactly the same building, they're two completely different materials, and they're completely different in us.
The generation on the left is called CIS, which you probably never heard of.
It's a species called TANS, and you've probably heard about Texas Street in the past.
They don't buy, they're more strength during a deep organization, and they can change the tissue of food in ways that other artists just can't.
They're also terrible to your health, much more crazy than Ray, even a car is a kind of unusual.
Now, I know it sounds crazy, but your body doesn't care how a molecule looks at paper.
Everything that changes is the 3D structure where the molecule comes from, and where not, and what components is a discovery.
So, how do you know if there's an Egyptian Amazon?
Well, the only conversation to know is if you see the words, "Cyrus" in the richest level.
Don't give us the extinctions of privacy to express you.
FDA allows the FDA to make a argument that their product knows "0" caused a San San Tanzanian even if there's actually half a cave.
But there's no simple rules and fathers about a small level that can be, and that means, you need to take on it to see these key projects, a particular motivation, because it's so slow from Tanzania has been created, by a very sophisticated genius of unusual hormones.
So, let's go back to our fingerprint and the French of the French before.
The mayor is 100 percent sample.
Canada Frankly is 11 percent fair.
But it's a physicist in the fact that it's in an unusual accident, and it's not at all San Atsus.
On the other hand, more than a half of the president in the Frankla is or a Sami Rossi or a San Tanzz.
And so, despite the mammoth there's 10 times more than in the French, it's healthy to you, while the French French doesn't.
Now, I'm not trying to talk about a Franklin.
There's a lot of tools with this kind of prototype.
The point is: it's not a few of you eat, it's what kind of smoking.
And what you're doing is you're going to spend a healthy or not it's his shape.
There's still a lot of things about space that might never know the answer to them, like is it possible?
Or are you living in a different place for the space?
But there's one thing I believe about space: the space is trying to kill me.
The space doesn't try to get me personal.
It's trying to kill you and each other.
Think about it.
It doesn't have a natural way that we need to survive when we go through: there's no air, it's too hot or too cold, there's no food that we need from the US TV.
All that sounds bad, but what can the space really do to me if I stay on the planet?
What we need to understand is that objects in space can make people happy, even when you have bad events on the planet that can move or kill us before something from the space will do it.
So, what are the risks that one of these objects really affect the Earth and you have and me in our lifetime?
Well, we can take what we know about the universe to try to figure it out.
You may have heard stories about asteroids that move on the planet.
It would be pretty bad.
Scientists think asteroids may have killed most dinosaurs.
It sounds like something to worry about it, right?
Well, astronomers can see now in asteroids in space and see them coming in using computer models to predict the cell phone of the small astronomy.
For a long time, the president that asteroid asteroids would come in the Earth in 2036 were one to 625.
But after all of the data, astronomers say now that the risks are really low.
Okay, what about the sun?
Hollywood movies like to move in the sun by the way they show the Earth is used by solar forests or the sun, what's going to get to the Earth.
The astronomers that our sun has enough gas to produce energy into three to five billion years.
So, in three to five billion years, if people are still going to get on the planet, they'll have to deal with it.
But today, well, we're safe.
Sometimes the sun't really responding to the planet, but the genetic field that's driving the planet's most famous.
The restaurant that's going to do with this is create things like the fingerprint.
Social forests can put our satellites and electronics, but the risks that it will kill us are sophisticated.
Okay, what about black black holes remained in the middle of our galaxy?
What's going to happen to the Earth, and we're going to, when it's getting us?
After all, it's a travel from my grandfather.
No, it's not going to happen.
It's one big object that can't survive us.
How can we be safe?
Our sun system is in the middle of the space while the black hole from the Kenyan, it's about 26,000 light from the Earth.
It means we're not in the rule of the black hole.
So, you're still thinking about spaces that are trying to kill you even after what I told you until now?
I think even that I've been convinced myself that the risks are really good that space and objects up there wouldn't kill us after everything.
But I'm probably going to look at the top just to make sure there's nothing in the way to me.
So the next time you see a new range of device or a therapy that shows a powerful pressure that's waiting for trees and sometimes, ask yourself, "How are the forces become so rapidly?"
Unfortunately, it's a movement that started more than a billion years ago.
But, to understand why, we need to understand a gene.
In physics, we're talking about two kinds of movement.
The first one is a movement in Kenya.
You're pushing something, and it's moving forward.
The other kind of thing, curiosity, motivate yourself around, or samples on their career instead.
It's an object in the middle of a bridge to prevent forever, but if something, like a beat with the ground is going to make it switch and make it switch.
The same thing happens when you get something complicated.
It's going to go around until something's going to stop it.
But the boat can expect.
If you go on the ice, you're going to go on the ice on the ice in the top of a bridge and it's driving her hands in, it's going to decide in the same speed.
But if it goes around the ice and it's driving her hands in, you know what's happening now.
It goes faster.
It's called a powerful energy consumption.
In math, I'm glad is a product of two numbers, one that's given the short rate of the boat and one that's given the distance of the piece.
If something goes around, when one grew up, the other one is small.
A lot more bad, a faster song.
It's very simple, sophisticated.
School also causes other effects.
If you're scared on a microscope and you're throwing a planet, it's going to look like it's a weird train.
But it doesn't really want.
He's actually going on on a bridge.
You're looking after a weird, but, from your reality perspective, the ball looks like a road.
We call it a Corus effect.
Ah, and you're sitting on a microscope right now at that moment.
We call it the Earth.
The Earth goes around one time every day.
But why does the Earth go around?
Now, it's a story that's starting from millions of years ago.
The cloud of struggle and gas that created the sun and the Earth and the plants and you started to switch when power goes all together.
Before he started to switch, this cloud was a very, very privilege.
And when he read, like the ice decide that makes her hands in, the boat became faster and faster.
And everything that's created out of the cloud, the sun and the plants around the sun and the walls around the plants, they're all going to see the boat.
And this extinction is what's given us today and night.
And this disease today is what's driving the weather.
The Earth's hot on the end of the day, and it's more hot on the night, and it's more hot in the equal line than in the posters.
The difference between temperature creates a difference in the air pressure, and the differences in the air pressure causes air to move.
They're making the wind again.
But, because the Earth goes around, the air is easy to species in the northern half because of Corus effect.
If there's an area of a low pressure in the atmosphere, a air seems to be reduced, like water that's in the wall.
But the air is easy to species when it's wrong, and it gives us a song.
With a very low pressure on the end, the air is coming in in a more powerful and more, so it's moving faster and faster, and so we get the speed of the device.
So, when you see a tremendous conference in air, think about it: the boat came in the end of the Earth, and the song of the Earth is the rest of the country, the rest of the nation of the cloud and the cloud of a cloud that was called to create the Earth about five billion years ago.
You're looking at something, the boat, who's going to do more than a minute, who's going to do more than the planet itself.
Five years ago, in the death of the past, a group of scientists had led a big object through their own region.
In his country, they're going to track the brains of people everywhere by being the first one to take the exact space.
The light was huge in his body.
And Pubo was a little bit of money with two faces in it.
In Octoctober, 1957, they're going to make their cat.
One of the scientists who wrote at the same time: "We're going to create a new universe that's been called Scotland.
BM, COs like Venice and Virgus were lucky to invest the world in the front of me.
Now we're lucky in our space.
And it was a role of the future people to get in our own country. "
You're looking at a little bit of "Scotsin," my personal academic movie, "that's a little bit and perfect.
He described the story of Scotland, and what happened to America as a result of it.
For days after the song, Scotland was a curiosity and an infant thing.
It's actually a person who's normal citizens are able to see, it's a privilege of respectful, and it's a human that's in the end of themselves.
But just three days later, on a day that the red day, the media and the politicians told us, and we asked them, Scottland was profound that our ancestors were killed in science and technology, and because now they could get us into the fossil fuel, as they use their telescope in the front of the continent.
It's a prosthetic chicken.
Scotland has become a restaurant for one of the three insects that have been in America -- equally in it, to the historians, to the public or 19.
He woke up the flight.
He's going to take the exact device.
He started the device to the sound.
Within a year, Congress is a huge weapons of weapons, and a number of our nuclear weapons have gone from 1,200 to 20,000.
And the response to the telescope was killed beyond a tumor in a weapon.
For instance, some of you will remember this day, bionic in 1958, the Arabic Foundation in civil security, where tens of millions of people in 78 cities have gone under the ground.
Or the Paul Paul School showed that seven out of 10 Americans believed that a nuclear war was made, and at least 50 percent of our population was killing.
But Scotch also woke up great changes.
For instance, some of this room had learned in school on a school in the Kenyan Central Central.
The support of engineering, math and science -- education -- rapidly.
Willit School argued that Scotland was directed directly to the EPA and the Internet, and of course, to Los Angeles.
My neutral movie shows how a free society might be replaced by who know how to use communication.
But it shows us also how we can make what looks at first as a bad situation, something that was very good for America.
"Scotland" will be released in most curiosity.
To summarize, I'd like to admit to one of my investigations: TED Talk for a long time, John War.
And I'd like to thank you all.
Thank you.
Thank you, Chris.
Well, I'm a ocean chemistry.
I look at the chemistry of the ocean today.
I look at the ocean of the ocean in the past.
The way I'm looking at the past is using deep lions of deep death.
You can see a picture of one of these corporations behind me.
He was collected in Antarctica, thousands of feet under the sea, so, very different from the museums that you might have been lucky to see if you had a therapist.
So I hope that this talk will give you a two-dimensional point on the ocean.
Two dimensions, like this 3D picture of the sea temperature.
It's taken by satellite so it has a great space.
The general properties are very easy to build.
The equal areas are extended because there's more sun.
The cooking areas are studies because there are less sun.
And it allows the big customers to build on Antarctica and it's in the northern.
If you jump deep, or even put the fingers, you know it's done more when you're right, and it's particularly because the water is falling the costs of the ocean comes out of the sea areas where the water are the plants.
If we go back in 20,000 years, the Earth looks very different.
And I just gave you one of the big differences you'd see if you've come back so much to the past.
The ice ice was much larger.
They've made a lot of speech, and they've been on the oceans.
The sea would be used in 120 feet.
Founds of fear were much lower than they were today.
So the Earth was probably about three to five degrees of all, and a lot more expensive in the middle areas.
What I'm trying to understand, and what my colleagues are trying to figure out, is how we've gone from these climate conditions to the climate conditions that we're doing today.
We know from research to a ice research that's happening from these cases to predict conditions wouldn't be part, as you can expect a theory in the sun.
And we know it from the ice streets, because if you're moving in the ice, you're finding a convenience of a ice, and you can see it in the kitchen.
You can see the total education to build these.
The chimps of the ice ice, so we can measure the "wind" -- that's why we know that the President was lower in the past -- and the chemistry of the ice also tell us about the temperature in the atmosphere areas.
And if you go through 20,000 years ago to modern time, you see that the temperature is happening.
It didn't happen in some way.
Sometimes it's been very quickly, and then the surface, so it's gone fast.
It was different in the two coffee areas, and the "Don't have been in the coffee.
So we're pretty sure the ocean has to do very much.
The ocean is made up of a huge amount of carbon, about 60 times from the atmosphere.
He's also working on a heat to the equal device, and the ocean is full of magazines and it's sending the significant production.
So if we want to figure out what's going on in the sea, we really need to go there, see what's there and start exploring.
It's an extraordinary piece that's coming faster than a mile of about a thousand kilometers in the national Atlantic, a five-hicle game.
You're the first people to see this sea part of the sea, together with my research team.
You probably see new species.
We don't know.
You've got to collect the examples and do very intuitive atmosphere.
You can see ethnic commons.
There's planets that grow up on these corporations.
They're things we're going to see like the arms that are made out of the museums.
There's corporations that have different forms of Center when I grew up on the door of this magnitude, and this profound material, but we're going to be a little bit more about these when we go back in time.
To do that, we need to make a research service.
It's the James Times, a October study that's in Tanzania.
Look beautiful, right?
It's great, if you're not going to die.
Sometimes it looks a little bit more like this.
It's we're trying to worry that we don't lose valuable samples.
Everybody's shocking around, and I get a door, so it's not always a lot of fun, but it's all right.
So we've become very good components to do this.
You don't see this kind of wealth from an extinct corruption everywhere.
It's global and it's deep, but we really need to figure out the right places.
We've just seen a global map, and it was the crisis of our journey from last year.
It was a slow of seven weeks, and it's us, we've created from about 75,000 kilometers of the ground in seven weeks, but it's just a tiny part of the sea.
We've gone from Western to East, over some of the ocean that's going to look at a big scale, but actually some of these mountains are high like the Amazon.
So with maps that we've created on the corner, we're getting an evolutionary of about 100 meters, enough to choose areas to reduce our code, but not enough to see a lot.
To do that, we need to appreciate vehicles from about five meters above the sea.
And if we do that, we can get one feet of one meter in a decade of thousands of meters.
Here's an amazing car, a car in a research study.
You can see a lot of big lights over.
There's a high privilege, a lot of surprises, and a lot of small boxes and things to put in samples.
Here we're in our first night of this particular text, and we take into the ocean.
We're pretty fast to make sure that the tools that are reduced by other solutions.
And we go down, and these are the kind of things you see.
It's a deeply profound, the size of a meter.
It's the biologist who's conversation -- it's a tiny vision, basically.
It's a crazy.
Most of the expectations that I'm showing you are insects, because all this takes a long time.
It's also a beautiful biologist.
And this animal that you'll see was a big surprise.
I've never seen something like this and it's surprised all of us.
It was a little bit more than 15 hours of work and we were all very happy about the door, and suddenly this beautiful sea started to roll us.
It's called Phicazoo or Michael Canada, if you want.
It wasn't what we've seen.
We've been looking for anonymous, deep anonymous.
You'll see a picture of one another moment.
It's a little bit, about five centimeters.
It's made of a family age, so you can see his arms here, welfare in the ocean.
organism like this is probably alive for a hundred years.
And when it grow, it takes chemicals from the ocean.
And chemicals, or chemicals, depends on temperature; depends on reality, they depend on the mammos.
And if we can figure out how these chemicals go into a survival, we can then go back, collect samples of fossil fuels, and repeat how the ocean looks at the past.
And here you can see us collecting this concept with a dead system, and we put it in all the pattern.
We can do it very carefully, I need to add.
Some of the organisms are even more life.
It's a guy who's called a bicycle, a photograph that's taken by my voice, Brandon, in about 500 meters underneath my hand.
Two thousand years ago, it's a long time.
If you take a cloud from one of these corporations and you put it, it's about a hundred microbes.
And Berdan took a couple of announces to this corner -- you can see the Chinese -- and he was able to show a question in fact, in fact, even over 500 feet in the ocean, corporations can transform transparency changes, which is pretty amazing.
But 4,000 years, it's not enough to bring us back to the last commons.
So what do we do?
We're going to go to those fossil fuels.
That's what I'm doing really unpopular with my research team.
So we're going to continue, there's huge boys everywhere, there's philosophers, there's a giant cartoons, but I'm sorry everybody to go to these fossil boys and treat around the ground.
And we collect all of these corporations, bring them back, imagine them.
But every one of these is different, and if we can discover some of them and then we can measure these chemical signals, it helps us find what's going on in the ocean before.
So in the picture of the left here, I looked at a piece of the corner here, I took it very quickly and I took a optimistic picture.
On the right hand, we took the same piece of analogy, and we put it in a nuclear car, we got a coffee, and every time there's some argument, you can see that it's a kind of one in the corner, so we can see the eliminum.
Why do we do this?
Ethiopia is a student that's being able to do in a very sad way, but I love it.
Science helps us discover about violence and reducing what happens in the ocean.
And if you remember from the beginning, it's what we want to get when we think about climate.
So we're using a recycling to analyze an organism and one of his bicycles, Tuesday, in these museums, and that tells us exactly how many boys are.
The beautiful anthropy of the ocean in which I'm just going to use to invest how we use to get some of the ancient states of the ocean.
You can see the patterns of the water in this anonymous's view.
It's just a year of just a year, but you can see the dynamics of the ocean.
The majority of Institute, mostly in the big past, which looks by the box, is really one of the most powerful objects in the world is coming from the West to the Middle East.
They're very engaged in a prosperity, because it's moving above these big budget, and it's enabled to "wind" and it's going to replace with the atmosphere in the face and the end.
And basically, the oceans are put through the red ocean.
We've collected organisms from everywhere around this Atlantic, and we've found something pretty surprising from my axis: the anonymous volunteers were talking to the North during this crisis cases and curiosity.
We don't really know why, but we think it's about the food and maybe it's in the water.
So here we are.
I'm going to describe what I think we've found about climate from these museums in the Rome.
We've got to go to the top of the sea. We've collected small boys.
This is my chemistry on it.
We think that in the French period, from the analogy that we did of anonymas, that the great part of the Greek ocean was very rich in the face, and there was a restaurant that was on the restaurant over.
It's made the fingerprint from the ocean out of the ocean.
So we've discovered organisms in the middle, and they've shown us that the ecosystem has been generated during the climate change.
It's possible to go out of the ocean from the ocean.
And then if we take the corporations closer to the modern times, or really if we go there anyway and measure the chemistry of the corporations, we see that we're going to move from a fear of it can go in and expect.
So that's the way we can use ethnicity to help us learn about the environment.
So I want to leave you with this last slide.
It's just a picture that's taken from the first video I showed you.
It's an extraordinary organisms.
We didn't even find things so beautiful.
It's about thousands of meters.
There are new species.
It's just a beautiful place.
There's fossil fuels, and now I'm going to appreciate you to the fabric of the boys that come down there.
So the next time you've got a lucky to fly over the ocean or talk about the ocean, just think -- there's a huge three-dimensions there down there that no one's ever seen, and there's a beautiful axis.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Imagine a world where you see numbers and characteristics even when they're looking at a black hole, where music or molecules get into a mile of fossil patterns, where words and you're leaving your fingerprints.
There's no Tikin's Titchen's Titchen and it's hard while Derek's taste has a teenager's face.
In the next few to Synesia, the ecosystem phenomenon that has two senses or more than four percent of the population.
A person with Syria may not just hear the Kenya, but it will also see it, take it, or feel it as a physical moment.
You share the same survivor with Antarctica, which means a sense of sense, Syria means of sensory connections.
When there's one kind of thing, as a collapse of colors, we have 50 percent chance to have two, third, or four.
One of the 90 of us is a graphic, the student of the language, like signals, numbers, and the French Chinese, are full of color.
Some even have a gene or personality.
For Gates, three is ethical and strategies, 9 is a black and statistics.
In addition to this, a language of language sounds, or fossil, extended tricks.
In James, Lojas, there's a text of Nigeria, like an aware of English and words with Aijas.
Syria is a neighborhood, like a teeth eyes, and not a disorder because there's nothing hope.
In fact, all the other bees are designed to make a better memory.
For instance, in a bedroom, someone who has met a long time ago.
"Let's see, she had green there.
AD is green: Turkey, Derey, Derey.
Her name is Denna! "
Once you've been invented in the doors, the bees are coming from local to life.
People with Syria go from biologically biological connection to connections between neurons in the brain, but then they have to be important to cultural details, like food, and alone.
The amazing thing is that a single atmosphere changes in the DC's code that changes the box.
In this way, Synica provides a way of building objective differences, how two people can see the same thing.
Take a smoke, you've heard food on a blue, like a space, you're spring, and you'll see it.
The gene is increasing connections that are natural between the natural region in the corner and the nature of the color in some of my sister.
But let's say someone else's play on unsensitive areas.
You've had so the capacity to move between things like a teacher doesn't communicate, which is the definition to the atmosphere, to see the same as different.
It's not in a surprise, Syria is more common in artists who are planning metaphors, like the Amazon and Mumbakota, the Iraq Darwin, the House Darwin Bayli, the leaders in Jaylan and Alzheimer.
But why is the rest of us from Nigerian Nigeria understand metaphors like "Grandha" in English "or" human beings? "
It turns out that Italy, weapon, and it's already transparency for one of the two faces like this, that even worst emissions make us that it's talking about.
The film, also, can convince us that sound comes from the player and not from the fingers.
So, in the face, we're all tricks, and we're not aware of the physical bees that come all the time.
Social conversations in the brain are the law, not the worst.
And it sounds like a sophisticated business!
Imagine how many of you were on a plane last year?
Okay.
It turns out that you share this experience with three billion people every year.
And when we put so many people into these patterns that look around the world sometimes things like this can happen and you can get a disease.
I actually started with this subject when I heard about the Ebola last year.
And it turns out that, although Ebola is spread out safe and limited in large refugees have other diseases that can spread in the planes.
The most terrible part, it's when we look at books is pretty much dead.
So with HINNN1 was one guy who decided to go to the box and just one piece of the disease to fly 17 people.
And the guy with San France who's spent three hours and spread the disease 22 other people.
It's not a natural capacity, which I'm a great price.
When we look at this, we can also find that it's very hard to predict these diseases.
So when someone decides to train, they can be patients and they can be in a restaurant that they have the disease, but it doesn't show any symptoms and they can spread it to many people on the airplane.
How does it work is that now we have air that comes from the top part of the cell and the side of the cell, as you see in blue.
And also the air that's created through these beautiful regulations that are conducted 99.7 percent open in the investment.
What's happening now we have is a pattern of air flow.
So if something is actually extending the air to go around a few times before you have an opportunity to go through the cloud.
So I thought, obviously there's a serious problem.
I didn't have the money to buy a plane so I decided instead of building a computer.
It turns out that with dynamics of dinosaurs, what we've been able to create is these molecules that we've given us a higher evolution than going to go physical to the airplane and to do with faces.
So how, in fact, it works, you start with a three-dimensional signals that are being built on neural documents around the Antarctica.
I've invited them to grow a 3D printer in a 3D model.
And then I took the model that I've just built into small windows in a way that's looking at them better.
And then I'm listening to the computer where the air comes in and the air is coming into a little bit of physics and actually sitting in and waiting until the computer is sitting in.
What we're getting in this normal trade is this: You're going to see that the man in the middle of the switch.
It's kind of fun.
Mumba, notice, for the two insects that are sitting at the end of the president didn't exactly happen.
And if you look at it from the side, you're also looking at it from the side of the genes as well as you're going to get back through the traffic cell.
The first thing I thought: It's not good.
So I've created more than 32 different signals and finally I came to this solution.
That's what I call, []]]]]] is what I call,] []]]]]]]]
In his country, we can take an open tree of about times, 55 and raise the green air in 190 percent.
So how this actually works is that we're doing this kind of transparency in a remote field into these places that are already there in the airplane.
So it's a very unemployment and you can do it immediately during the night.
All you need is to kill two fish and we're dangerous.
And the results that are just amazing.
Instead of a selection of air pollution, we can create a air walls between the actors to create a personal library.
So you're notice that the travel is in the middle of a meeting again, but this time, we're able to push it in activity down to the platform to the muscles.
And the same thing from justice, notice that we're able to push the penguins down.
So if we look back on the same piece of time with the invention, you'll see that it's going on in the middle of a metaphor, and we're pushing it directly to the medicine before it's an opportunity to move more traffic.
You'll notice that the two actors sitting in the hole in the middle of no open genes.
Let's see it also from the side, you see a very effective system.
And in production with this system, we're developing.
When you look at the meaning, what we see is not just that, if it's in the middle of a metaphor, but even if it's a dream of a dream that's going on or a travel in the past.
So what does the world mean, with this solution?
Well, when we look at this from the simulation to the real life, you can see with a 3D model that I've built here, through a 3D printing, you can see them in the same flow of air pollution, directly directly to the events.
In the past, the San Francisco has become about 40 billion dollars.
And in the future, a illness of disease can go to the world more than three trillion dollars.
In the past, it's going to take out the airplane for a month or two months, take thousands of work and a few million dollars in trying to change something.
But we can now get something over the night and see immediate results.
Now it's a matter of a conference, a cartoon, a lot of processes to have emotional and metaphors.
But it comes to show that sometimes the best solutions are the simple solutions.
And two years ago, this project wouldn't exist, just because the technology then doesn't fit it.
But today with progress and the Internet is developed, it's the age of the gold.
So the question I ask you all: Why do you wait?
Together we can build the future today.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Imagine yourself going on on a wall, look at the ocean, you're looking at the blue, blue as the eye sees.
Let's really stop, the size of all of this.
Now, ask yourself, "How big is it?
How big is the ocean? "
First of all, we need to understand that there's really only one ocean, which represents the gene of the genes that we call the objective, the Atlantic, the Arctic, the Arctic, and the Rome.
Every single one of the female, while you're interested in them as ocean as their own, they're really part of one of the water, one ocean, which is going to define the planet.
The ocean is about 71 percent of our planet, about 360 million squares, which is a big hour of 36 times the United States.
It's just a huge space, when you look at it from the space. The ocean is, in a tremendous disorder, the intuitive form of our planet.
And if you're talking about the space, the ocean is getting more than 1.3 billion, it's a million miles of water.
In other words, it's enough water to spread all the United States under the body under the bodies of over 132 kilometers, a much higher response over the highest and continue into the upper atmosphere.
With all of this wonderful, the ocean is about 97 percent of the water on the planet.
Over that, the ocean has more than 99 percent of the planet, which is, space and places where there's life.
Now let's take it to a second.
The words that we know, really all the animal states of themselves, all of that represents only one percent of our boat.
One percent!
The ocean is the rest of the rest.
So, the ocean is a typical tool.
He's his choices to the soldiers dn't have the equation.
It's also transparency the biggest ecosystems on the planet.
Right quickly, here's four of the methods in which they are.
The ocean contains the worst consumption, the Central Atlantic.
About of about 65,000 kilometers, this 30-minute vehicle, the worst mirror that's completely scared on the ground, Neanderthals.
It's underneath the Denney Denney, there's the largest patient in the world.
The Minister Finister is 116 times more water to second beyond the edge of the Canada, the biggest patient in the front of the woman.
The highest light in the world is actually in the ocean, comes in with our eyes.
While it's in the middle of the 4,200 feet is over the water, his dogs are dying under 5,800 feet.
So let's give a prosperity to the piece of the frog, so, the light is about 10,000 feet, and it's going to be on the top of the most than a square meter.
So, because we've been treated to the traditional asteroid, let's talk about the worst intervention, at Charles, who's been reduced by 11 kilometers under the ocean, about six times of the German Canada.
It's deep enough to invest the Amazon and still get over 1.1 kilometers of water that are sitting over his new bubble.
In other words, the gift of a Charles is about the same response in which the cartoons are scared.
So, anyway you can look at it, the ocean is a big, and it's a big, big, big one!
It represents our planet, the house to the largest ecosystems, contains the most space of life, and in the case, it's the largest number of forms of life on the planet.
He actually didn't move the size of the size.
But it's not so big, so space, so extraordinary that it's inevitable.
In fact, with about 50 percent of the world's population is living in a mile of 100 kilometers from the wall and with most of the rest of the rest of the rest of life is close to the oceans, or in the end, they're all at the end of the ocean, actually every person on the planet has an opportunity to affect the general health and the nature of the global ocean.
The human effects look at every part of the ocean, doesn't matter what's wrong, doesn't matter how far.
The ocean represents our planet, but, in a very conventional sense, we define the ocean.
What is the center of the universe?
It's a fundamental question that people will be in for hundreds of years.
But the journey to the answer was strange.
If you wanted to know the answer to this question in the third century before the apartment of bionic, you would look at the night and walls in what you saw.
That's what Radio, the guy to ask at the time, did.
He thought that's another one and we're on the planet, look at the top, it has to be the center, right?
For him, the notion of the world was made out of four secrets: land, water, air, and no.
These secrets have been on a cloud of productive statistics.
Every one of the bad stars, the planets, was a Street of his own.
The rest of the universe and all the stars in which there were the last asteroid.
If you've seen the night change over time, you could see that this idea worked great to explain the movement that you saw.
For hundreds of years, it was central to how Europe and the Islamic world saw the universe.
But in 153, a guy named Kennex invented a different model.
He believed that the sun was in the center of the universe.
This new idea and extreme idea was hard to get a lot of people.
After all, the idea of Erio would make sense with what we could see, and they were pretty good for people.
But a definition of new components have come to die from the model of the sun centuries.
First of all, the Henry France showed that the tricks are not a perfect amount of money.
So, the telescope of Palo's orchestrates the organ of justice around it, and it's completely impressed by the Earth.
And then, Nigerian invented the theory of universal spider, and the fish that all the objects are affecting each other.
In the end, we had to give up the idea that we were in the middle of the universe.
A little bit after Franciscus, around 1580, we went back Italian, Jamboro in our country, the notion that the stars were that the stars that were probably injured by the universe and the universe is no finite.
This idea didn't get in the wall.
Bruno's welfare on his privilege.
Many hundreds of years later, the philosophical France has invented that the universe is a series of four degrees, which is called four degrees, and that every planet is a center of a mile.
Over time, we realized that there's a lot more stars from Eric School.
When astronomers like William got more telescopes and more academic, we're going to be clear that our sun is actually one of many stars for the space.
And these brains that we see in the night?
They're other galaxies, big like the space in our lives.
Maybe we're far more than the center of the universe we've ever thought.
In the late 20th century, astronomers who have studied the asteroids wanted to figure out how they're wrong.
Basically, they wanted to see the method to the blue to the water that's focused on us, and it's the method to the water that's happening.
But everything you saw was the method to the red.
It's all about us, fast.
These expectations are one of the evidence of what we call now the Great Bang.
In this theory, all the material in the universe was once Congress, a reference of a sample in a particular way.
In some sense, our universe was once in the center.
But this theory is spending all of the concept of the center because it can't be the center of the universe unfinished.
The Big Bang didn't just jump in space; it was a tree of space.
What every new discovery is that all our expectations are limited, our ability to move and dream what's out there.
What we think is that we know today can change.
Like a lot of the fish we've met right now, sometimes our most invasive sensitive senses for wonderful and death and preventing us forward to the past even more complex questions.
Did you ever go to the table and you're going to put the lucks?
Or have you been sitting in a restaurant and you're going to have a tool to use?
Well, here's a couple of simple and restaurants about how to track the table.
What's going to happen if you take a table like this?
It doesn't look good, and you need to play the building before you can actually start.
Let's try a different way.
In order to start, they used a camera or a table, but not in their classes, so the tools don't think about the table.
It's more about the clinic than Nigeria, but it's rare not to see anything under the dog but if you eat on a Pacific table.
You're going to notice any wind, welfare, or other judgments you love.
It's often about the regulations just at night.
They started with tools for the main conversation, by taking the lunch on the left, and the president on the right side from the right question of the hands of the trick them.
Here's a very useful telescope: You're always eating out of the face, so in order to switch down, women's luck out of the woodwing and the San School outside the wall.
Number first, so the main understanding.
You notice, also, their grandfather's president is faced by the success.
It's a ancient tradition of time where I've been quite scared, and it was a symbol for Nigeria and an astronomy to keep them from the other secrets.
Maybe we're going to be all fascinating, and since you start a fire of the only one is out of the customers, because we use a right hand to move it.
Here's another telescope: Sorry the table just with what you need.
If you don't eat funny, don't notice the space.
Now, to win, Nigeria, then women have the wind up after we don't need it in the beginning.
You'll notice that the forest of the slide is made into the left.
So, when it's time to eat, you just decide it down and it's in the right place.
If you're worried, you'd put it in 180 degrees so it's going to become a left instead.
And then we'll play our generation with the success.
You can also respond from the kitchen and then bring them to the table.
The fight is up and the left to the library, and the hundred pounds on the walls, again, with the switch in the face.
Just one other point remained, and it's for the reality.
You're going to notice the finger of the right up, and then you'll put the water on the left and the moon.
If you're like me and I can't remember what's going on, think of water, Japan, Mary. Mr. Times to the left of the house.
Another telescope: To remember the left and the right with the fight and the fire, think that's a tool like the word.
Unfortunately, the fight, on the left, your arm, in the middle, your hand, your sister, right.
Finally, the slide is on the left to the road, even though it's okay to put it out.
For an extinction like this is a lot of place, we're women in the center.
Now we're ready to eat.
And hopefully all of these monkeys are going to go to the next one that you're going to help the table or sit to a restaurant.
Go!
I've been thinking about some of my brothers can grow to a size of a building for free.
It's very threatening.
But a scientist has to ask where the other material comes.
It's a conservation of the corporation that's going to say that an instrument doesn't create or happy, which means that our connection doesn't only change because its size will change.
For example, when we're optimistic on a geography, even the result is much larger than the skin that's designed to move, the weight weight has to still be equal to the weight of the skin together with the device.
In a chemical equation, molecules come out to create new materials, but all of the ingredients still need to be there.
When our connection is growing up two meters per square meter, it's changing.
It's the fourth line of Palo's weight to say that his weight would be 27, three times a fifth is about 27 -- the age of his age weight because it has to go through all three dimensions.
So, when our connection becomes a bank, we talk about two possibilities.
Our connection is about six feet still wearing 100 pounds, the original weight in its human way.
Now, a second possibility, our connection is wearing 2,700 pounds -- 100 pounds of 2,700 pounds -- when it's at six feet, which means it's also 2,7,7,700 meters when it's at 2 feet.
No one can go into the same kind of funny with it without the arm was on.
Now, the second possibility looks a little bit more possible, but it brings the question, how is it going to be in an alphase without confident in the ground because the pressure it's affected by his fingerprint from the face of the face of his legs?
And what kind of a graph of a graph and a writer is about his legs that's in the power of a body that's made out of 2,7,700 pounds had against the road when he's burning?
And can he even run?
And I wouldn't even ask how he found out of insects enough to stand up.
Now let's explore the dozens of the two possibilities that come from.
It's limited as a great piece of fingerprint.
The human body is made of strength and happiness, that they have a kind of permanent patterns.
The first option, if the connection is 100 pounds all the time, then it's going to be objects and happiness like us.
When it's growing up to a larger size and it's still 100 pounds, it's basically changing himself into a giant bee.
The other option, if the connection is 2,700 pounds all the time, then it will be bounced and at six meters with 2,700 pounds that are being used by two feet.
It's the weight that's going to be reduced in different forms when it's moving.
Obviously, as hard, they're not fun, which means you can't jump them, then they're wearing up.
The teachers will also be a crisis.
The high buildings stay on because they have a brilliant, and they don't judge the jungle.
Our connection, on the other hand, was one of the worse and it was falled.
At this point that his body actions are like every single bank, his heart has to sell a huge amount of person through his body to provide enough oxygen for him to move 2,700 pounds of a body.
It's going to take a huge amount of energy, that it's going to have to provide by 27 feet of 3,000 categories of food every day.
Now, it's about 150 pounds.
27 pounds of 3,000 people think 8,000 people think of 550 categories is worth 147.
It wouldn't have time to fight a crisis because it's going to have to eat all the time and work from 9 to five to have money to all the food that it's food.
And what about the heroes of the bees that can make their body switch or blue?
Well, everything about Earth is made of secrets.
And what's going to define all of the secret is the number of prototypes in our eyes.
So our privilege is a way.
The artist has one prototype, for two prototypes, for a day, three prototypes, and so on.
The main component of the lower shape of blue is a graphic style.
While, the human body is complex from 65 percent oxygen, 18 percent of carbon, 10 percent of others, and seven percent of other secrets including 02 percent consumption.
In a chemical response, the secrets are changing to become new forces.
So, from Philipper is to hide the South that requires to create the door?
Obviously, we can change secrets by setting or fusion.
However, an autonomy requires so much heat, that the only end of this process in nature is within stars.
In order to use a very short period, the temperature of the region has to be more sophisticated than the sun.
Everybody's extended from a completely unprecedented tree.
It's not better than it's creating a lot of active particles.
Our connection will become a nuclear code and talk, and at the end of the other person who is trying to save.
And you really want the sun or you want an active nuclear in your body?
Now, what's a lesson on you want to explore the screen?
Social change is body and yes, rapidly on, switch, my life won, and it's invisible.
How many heroes can move faster than the wind.
The people in French 10 came to the speed of a 39,000 miles an hour when the space came back to the planet in 1969.
We wouldn't need a long time if we could move so fast?
But what's the atmosphere?
The air is not bad.
Scientists like a penguin and a pencil, even a lot of struggle, create the air around us.
When we go through these things in the air, we're spending them and create a lot of power, that's made of heat.
It's just like you're spending one in a second and you're spending them up or two degrees together creates a fire, how many objects spread one in two faster, it's made more heat.
So, if we've been treated at 39,000 kilometers in an hour, the heat of the power will reduce our face.
Even if we're going to be on the tree, the door and the globe in the air will look at you with small millions of pounds all the same time.
You've ever seen a blueprint or a magazine of a truck?
What do you think that all the birds and the insects are going to do with your open-up eyes or the switch skin?
Okay, so you're excited about this to prevent the faces.
But what about the people in building you for your step?
It takes about five seconds to respond to what we see.
Unfortunately, we'll see what we've seen, and we're going to find out -- a 25-minute time, it's a 30-minute, and it's about 30-hour, and it's about two miles.
Or we're going to kill ourselves by taking the rapidly quickly on or, worse, if we're inevitable, we've actually made our bodies to the toilets that use everything in our way.
So, motion to 39,000 kilometers in an hour will leave us in cities, insects, and it doesn't have time response.
What about short objects to the universe that we can see without the causes of our lives?
Okay, let's say that a generation is going to move in the camera.
So, our connection comes very quickly, we're going to get it, and it's about a place for surroundings.
It sounds very sophisticated, but, in the reality, it's probably more soap than the connection than the generation if it's going to happen quickly.
The first movement of Nigeria is about intuition, which is the resistance to change in a movement.
So, the object will continue to move or stay in the same place, but if something will change it.
Turkey is the speed of speed changes over time.
When it's in a contrast, the speed is 1,000 miles per hour, it starts to move to the speed in two seconds, the speed grew faster to 39,000 kilometers, her brain was a device into the side of the skin.
And when she was a sudden, the speed was reduced back to 0 miles, her brain was dealing to the other side of the skin, and it becomes her brain to the eye.
The brain's too good to deal with autonomous movement.
So it's also a different part of her body for the need of this.
Remember, it's not the speed that's caused to go out because astronomers survived Apollo 10, it's a surprise or an academic piece that causes our inner organisms in the way we're moving in the bus when the roof switches on the water.
What the connection did to a mathematician identity to destroy it with a rapidly rapid space.
It's probably right at the point of surprise.
He's going to have to be able to get the restaurant and give a piece of fingerprint.
Oh, and it's probably going to be in prison.
doctors need to do personal responsibility just for the case that they're doing mistakes and they're moving in their patients.
I'm wondering how much the expression of the connection on the right.
Now, what's a lesson about forces want to explore now?
Social change of body and weight, speed on, airport, power, my life is invisible.
If you get one morning with a big power of what you had at night before, how do you deal with the great violence today?
Everything seems to show you from your power and the size of your power is a thousand times.
You're going to have to be really careful when you're pushing to someone who's so you don't hear the bones or have any of them that you're looking at.
And using a switch to put a piece of bossy in a cosmos without getting the luck through the success would be hard like a brain surgery.
It's going to say, and you're getting the opportunity to save a game in a refugee that's been reduced.
So, you're focused on your arms, hopefully to search it.
Two seconds later, you're going to find yourself represents life body.
What happened?
Well, stress is a strength.
As the surface is small, it's a larger pressure.
So we can put objects as well without worrying our skin, but a teenager can make us worry with a little bit.
It's a pressure that's on its body can be a lot of thinking by a power of power in the surface of your arms that's coming in.
It doesn't matter if your arms come back enough to search her body without giving your bones.
Her definition doesn't matter enough to search for your hands without being damaged.
Even if you do the next door to provide a larger face to search it, you can't still save it.
Remember, it's not the prosperity that's killed it, but it's an active piece in the bottom.
Let's say it's a 32 places, about 100 meters, and you're at 2 meters, maybe three meters on the fingers, with your hands over the head of a door, hopefully repeating the pressure on a larger face, but everything you're doing is actually to move the land on the ground three feet.
So, it's now about 97 feet, instead of 100 feet, and it's coming up to the speed of 53 meters per second before the surprise, if you don't think of the air.
It's equally valuable to spread 150 miles per hour into a wall with the door of his door.
The only thing that can offer it is beautiful.
But this power comes with its physical problems.
If you could fly, what you need to do is fly to it, start to fly down a speed that it's moving, to keep it, and then slow down to the speed that you're coming to the choice.
This whole process requires a lot of transformation between the point that it starts to flow and land.
Every second that you're spending on return to the beetle of the heroes on the top and go up to her, her head goes closer to the way!
If it's a high place, and you can't get to it until it's a few meters over the ground, there's not really something you can do except than it's in a way to make it a way to give it enough time to get a choice.
So, you're going to take the collapse and they've got a cartoon.
More, wrong!
Now, what lesson about forces you want to explore?
Social change of body and material, rapidly, train, power, forever, and invisible.
Money.
In the movies, you're always looking for the secret of death.
But would my life really make a good thing?
The child is 10 percent of his life.
His mother's 70s, one year is only 2.5 percent of her life.
This year, 365 days, can feel different to different people.
If we live until 82, it's about 30,000 days.
If this child is 30,000 years old, a year for him to feel like a day.
And if this child's feelings to get the possibility of living millions of years, it might become a single single and design to know that he's alive and always a single person who I'm going to love.
But what if everybody had death?
Well, first, the Earth has a limited size.
So, where is everyone else?
"Sure!" "It's my face!"
"Free!" "" Sorry. "
"You're going to be here!"
Do you remember what you did last year? What were you five?
How many of your past you forgot?
If you have a problem to remember what you did at the age of five, how would you remember what happened if you've spent thousands of years?
A million years ago?
We don't remember any detail of our past because our brains have limited memory and we replace moral memories, like the secret number of action acts in the middle sea, with traditional information.
If this moral child will find a piece of love once in a year, it will have thousands of companies in a year.
And how many of these thousands of water is it going to be able to remember?
It changes the meaning of significant relationship.
Don't? Another thing I've lost in my life: human beings don't always look at the same thing.
It can explain the theory of Darwin's theory of evolution.
For instance, if women are much more attractive, then more men are high and children, what will bring more high genes to the gene.
It means, in the next generation, more children will be higher.
It went back to a million years and the average sea will be much higher than the average sea today, if there's no natural disaster that's driving all the sea from the world.
Our ancestors were fossil fuels, and two eyes.
We still have a body hair, but we don't look like more coffee.
If you're the only person of the death, while everybody's going to open up a generation after a generation, you're finally going to see quite different from the people who expect you.
"Hey, what are you?"
If one of our beautiful ancestors are still living today, how many people will have lost with it instead of communicating the historical museum?
And there's another typical voice for my life: customers.
After all, my life wouldn't be automatically transparency for physical illness, it just means you can't die.
But it doesn't agree in what's in the first place.
So, look at your body and give some customers you have.
If you've created so many conventional customers in your life, imagine how old you'd be, if you were a thousand!
Now, there's about 125,000 black black holes after action every year in the United States.
These surprises are because of actions or disease.
It's definitely a low liquid of all the population if you live just a hundred years.
However, if you've lived more than a million years, the risks you still have all the organs are pretty hard.
What about small pieces, like your genes, your nose, the ears, the fingers and the fingers?
What about you?
What's the risks that you're going to have on health health for a year?
A thousand years?
A million years?
Maybe you'll see at the end of the head of a really crazy earthquake with unprecedented parts.
So, you're sure you want to live forever?
Now, what's a lesson about power now?
Social change is body and yes, rapidly on, power, forever, won't, and -- invisible.

If people could fly, without tools or machines, what's where fast do you think we're going to expect?
By 2012, the world's world's world's world's world's world's world's length to the most fast, it's about 44 miles an hour.
Rather speed depends on how much power is affected by the tree of the tree, and the other movement of Newton, the power is the product of a coffee.
And the third movement of Newton says that every action, there's an equal response and so on.
So, it means that a device requires a land to push from it, and the land is repeated back to the wall.
So, Turkey would actually be more like a animal.
Michael Ford is right now the worst person in the water and the Olympic Olympics with the most privilege of all time.
How fast is it happy?
The answer will take you.
His fastest one is less than eight miles an hour.
A child on the ground can go faster than Michael Foundation in the water, but why is it?
Well, let's go back to the third line of Newton.
When we jump, we're going to go forward by the earthquake with our legs and the land is pushing back, and we're moving forward.
The land is produced.
In the definition, it means that the proteins are basically going into a place and you have to push back instead of getting rid of the way, but water are dinosaurs and flow.
When we express our arms to push the water, some of the water molecules can just decide one in the other place to push back.
Now, let's think we're moving.
The air has more free place to get one fundamental to two, so even more than our energy will move.
We're going to have to push a lot of air back to move forward.
astronomers move in space in a road tree when they're in the external space by the hands of hands that's based on the walls and the floor of the public.
Now, imagine you're going to have the ability to push.
How do you get in the middle of the street?
Well, don't you get far away by living in the air, right?
No, I don't think!
Now, let's say you're going to have the capacity to push and speed to activity, let's talk about your flight.
By the Iraq GDP, PNRT, pressure and temperature has a positive treatment, which means they grow and small.
It's because the air is spread in a wind with less stress, so the molecules have more place to move in it without getting one with the other and create a heat.
Because the atmosphere pressure is much lower in the high sea, it would be coffee if you go over the clouds.
You're going to have to join yourself to keep a body on a body over 36 degrees of gallas, another one will start to look at the prices, until the end of the end of the boundaries will become the boundaries and at the end of the sky of control control.
Now, the Israeli Guinea shows that the pressure pressure, the gas goes.
So, if you've been a right up at the speed, the gas in your body will grow up at the same same way that it's been conducted in the four times when it's infant.
The phenomenon is called "Bangles," the strength of strength, "or" a dog, "because it's made in deep water, and it's too fast.
It's a result, as a, cooperation, or death, depends on some of your blood flow is done.
Okay, well, let's say you want to fly just a few meters above the ground where you can still see that tricks in the road and fit.
You're going to have a coffee and text to protect yourself from birds, insects, a street, electricity, and other people's customers, including the scans that are ready to give you a conversation if you're not going to play the rules of the airport, a friend.
Now remember, if you've got a air in the air in the skill, you're a free discovery until you're going to get in the ground.
Without a company or the laws of physics, you'll have a cool capacity.
But, even if we all can just push a number of meters over the ground and just move at the rate of food, I'm going to tell you, it's still a cool capacity that I want, don't you?
Yes, I thought this.
Now, what's a productive lesson about power you want to explore now?
Social transformation and material, speed on, train, power, my life is invisible, and it's invisible.
It wasn't great if we could be invisible?
Ha, right?
I mean, we can Google people without notice us and do what we want to be responsible.
Now, customers understood how to use the size of the size of a full light to get the light in the goal to create the illusion of cameras.
Scientists have created materials to predict light around tiny objects.
Egypt can also take some of your brother and put the picture so you'll see invisible.
However, none of these possibilities can't make a bone of a person's size invisible and all of the states in motion.
But if you're really invisible, really face, here's some problems you may not think about them before.
In order to move without other people, you're going to have to be completely blind.
Even when you get out of the tree!
You can't take anything, including the rank and the development, another people will just go out your bank and your developing developing environment.
Cities and people on the street can't see you, so they're going to get you at some point.
Oh, and you wouldn't get his name or you're going to do the noise of Naza, another one they knew you were there.
And it's just because you've got invisible, you don't say you're going to get that way.
What if someone who's going to make you a crazy coffee?
And what if you go out there?
But if you think that just dinosaurs can turn you into the clouds, you're wrong.
It's about a skin skin cells from people, an earthquake, and it's caused by a mechanism and other materials.
It's a dung struggle for our parents when we move and the small forests on our parents when we're going to die.
So, even if you're invisible, a struggle is still going to take on all of your part.
We usually don't notice the struggle on the skin because we can't see that a minute of struggle on our skin.
But, if you're invisible, people'll go out of people's forms of struggle with really diverse features.
Good!
How do you think that the world will see if you were invisible?
Well, the answer is nothing.
The reason you can't see in the wisdom is because there's no light.
In order to see object, light has to move in the face and help you.
So, the infrastructure in front of you is taking the transparency for your brain to reduce it to the picture of a pain.
If you're invisible, then, in the definition, light's going to go to your way or around you instead of repeating you to get people out.
But it means that your eyes don't take light, they're also.
So, your brain doesn't get anything to get to the picture.
You can see your transparency without showing you to stop the light?
No.
So, when others can't see you, you can't see.
OK!
Now, do you think even if the invisible is permanent?
So it's so, how can you get a medical treatment from a doctor if you do it?
The doctor didn't know where to win the conversation or wait because they can't see your operation.
In the same way, you can't see it.
I mean, what if you have a disease or pollution?
How can the doctor lose you without being able to see the color change or the door?
And what if everyone was invisible?
Well, think about how much the world was without seeing people on the street, on TV, or at the computer as you see now.
It's very single to be invisible.
Now, what's a productive lesson on you've been exploring next?
Social change is body and yes, rapidly on, power, my life will win, and...
Do you remember when you realized the first time your computer was more than a road and a fire?
Whether the curiosity of the past and the video of the president, there was something that was going to be fighting your forces, the same, and it turned them into reality?
What is this thing?
Is it Germany?
Let's imagine that we can move to the size of Atlantic and reduce ourselves into a decade.
If you take the past, you'll see it's a very simple machine.
It's got some disorders and a system that's identified motion and motion.
Maybe you have a optimist that takes these points with lights and sensors, but more old men did it with a golden ball and a few pounds.
It's basically the same.
When you're pushing on the button already, it's sending a message to the computer with information about its universe.
When your mouse comes out, it's a printer by a simple simple input system.
It's this system that's used as eyes and unemployed and right here and hands of the computer.
Actually, it's telling a way to communicate with his environment.
But it's also a cooperation like a tree to keep the worker from being exposed in the disorders.
In this case, the Callott system decides that you've had a lot of important enough so it's made a disorder to work.
"Hey, don't do! I've got a map."
The lab, or the central respect, is the brain of all the computer.
Just as your brain doesn't move all the body, the lab doesn't take all the computer, but it's driving the phenomenon still.
And the work of the lab, all his work, is to bring instructions from memory and do them.
So, while you're focused, you're focused, you're focused, maybe very quickly, something like 60 words in a minute, the lab comes out and make billions of hormones in the second.
Yes, billions of every second: hormones to move the mouse on the screen, pushing the argument on the work table, play your Internet radio, manage the boundaries that you're waiting for the conversation, and so much.
Your computer's lab is a lot of strength!
"But Oh, there's a very important piece that's going on now!
Let's get everything right now and take care of it! "
There's programs for everything that the lab does.
Social software is used for the past, to the argument of the argument, to the web radiation, and to treat the signals that are sent by the police.
Each software was written by a person in a language called people, like Jaaah, C and plus, or a paper.
But human programs take a lot of place and make a lot of information doesn't expect to the computer, so they're a little bit smaller and more sophisticated in one of the memory.
It's the way that it needs instructions to how to treat the top of the past, so it's looking at the plan of the past and sending a woman to give a memory system to the reality that's been born there.
Each instruction in the river of the rich device is conducted and accumulated.
And it's not the end of the story!
Because the lab has been taught that the most stress was over a picture of a computer screen, and so, I'm going to ask the memory of the screen to find what this budget was.
And then the lab needs to ask the memory of the button's software, which means that the lab needs the screen screen again to show the video that's going to have a budget, and so on.
And let's just say that there's a lot of interventions before you even see the budget on the screen as you've made it.
So, just the simple action of reducing on your past is saying to explore all of these critical ingredients of your computer structure: ethnic emissions, the basic input system, the lab, the programs, and the memory, and even one German.
Have you ever been surprised in a regulation that's living? You're worried, you thought, "It'll be so cool to be an astronomer!
I'm going to take a look at the external space to look at the planet and all of that.
It would be so cool! "
It's not just the situation of things at all.
If you're in the external space, you're spending the Earth, it's called a free flow.
You're actually treated to the Earth.
Okay, think about it for a second. That's the feeling that you get if you're going to get the heat at at at the top of the mountains, right, like, "Wow Wow Wow!"
Just you do it all the time you're spending the Earth for two, three hours.
A couple of days, how long would we take, right?
So, how does the Earth work?
Let's look at a book from AIDS Newton.
He had an idea, a little computer experiment. You take a partner, put it on the head of an hour.
If you're blind, it's happening a little bit of you.
But if you take it more powerful, it's far far far enough so it's going to take a little bit beyond the Earth's aircraft.
Well, you can imagine if you're going to get it really, really powerful, it's going to completely flow the Earth and come back, flow! And if you're going to be in your back or something.
Let's move a lot and put you in a small satellite over the North Pole of the Earth to be the best to be up.
You're going to go down and move on the planet.
But, you're actually a very quickly faster.
So, when you go down, you're going to spread.
You're going to find yourself on the planet, we're going to get out of it, and now the Earth's driving you from the side.
Okay, and now it's driving you back in and you're going to go down, so you're collecting the planet, and now you're under the Earth.
And the Earth's driving you up, but you're going to have the return yet.
So you're going to go back the Earth. Now, you're on the other side of the Earth.
OK, you're going to go by a degree and the Earth, you're going to give you a crowd.
But you're going to go by a degree and you're collecting.
And now you're again in the top of the Earth, over the flow of the flow, you're going to get down and treated, and yes, you're going to get right.
You're going to get it because you're so fast.
In this way, astronomers expect the Earth.
They're always treated by the Earth, but they're always collecting, and so, they're treated all the time.
They feel like they're treated, so you just need to get out of it.
So, in fact, if you're treating enough and patients, you can spread the planet.
But there's a big problem.
First of all, you need to move at eight miles per second.
It's 18,000 miles an hour, a little over 23 of you!
The second problem: If you're so fast, yes, you're pushing the Earth and you're actually coming back to where you're out, but there's a lot of air in the way, okay, much less things and people.
So you're going to take a result of your power in the atmosphere.
So, I'm not spending on this.
Technologists and insects are motivated about evolution.
Let's talk about evolution.
You've probably heard that some of the people are paying it into a device even though most scientists don't.
But even if you're not one of these people and you think you've got a pretty good understanding about evolution, the risks you still believe in some things about it that's not true, things like, "evolution is organisms look at their environment."
It was an academic theory that's now been killed about evolution.
Almost 60 years ago, Darwin published his book, John in Palestinian Amazon invented that creatures were evolved by certain techniques during their lives and then these features for their own home.
For instance, he thought that, because Jim sees their lives to reduce their partners to get to high high seas, their offers are going to be born with a long wall.
But we know now that it's not a traditional genetics works.
In fact, individual organisms don't evolve at all.
Instead, genetically genetic motivations make part of the jihad to survive with a long wall, and it gives them a better chance to survive than those who didn't be lucky, what's going to bring us to the devastating of the fingers. "
It sounds like evolution always extends the biggest, the most powerful, or the most expensive, what doesn't really happen.
One thing is safe, evolutionary power is just a matter of the academic to the current environment.
If all of the high trees of a sudden, it's just going to be lower, all the jungles of the long-term warfare will be in a situation of corruption.
Second thing, the survival is not how evolution is happening, it's going through a sea.
And the world's full of creatures like the damage of the summer, which is so small and unprecedented in the heart that it has to find a fair of faster before it's.
But at least we can say that if organism doesn't expect, it's more evolutionary, right?
Tell!
Remember, natural choice goes on not at the level of organism, but in the genetic level, and that's the same gene in a single organism will also exist in its cases.
So, a gene that causes a life to explore its lives to make the survival and the decline of his father or his imagination, can be more common than an organism that was just used for myself.
Everything that causes that the more products of the same gene will go to the next generation will allow the goal, to the film -- evolutionary goals.
One of the hard things to remember about evolution is that when we're saying things like, "Gates want to do more of themselves" or even, "natural choice, we're actually using the patterns.
A gene doesn't want anything, and there's no extinction genes that have some genes are the best to sell.
Everything that happens is that genetic genetic functions make organisms that make them happen or evolve in different ways.
Some of these ways make more of the genome that has been done to go on, and so on.
Like, there's no definition plan that's going to happen with an Italian form.
It's not Italy that human eye will be blind points where the optical bicycle comes from the bottom, but that's how it evolved, from a simple light.
In a back view, it could be much more useful to human beings to make materials out of magazines and species rather than just categories.
But over thousands of years, in which our ancestors evolved, theories were rare, and there was no possibility to expect that it would happen quickly.
So, evolution continues in a blind way, by a step after step, creates all the diversity that we see in nature.
Fasks are a complicated thing, especially when you're transparency and connecting connections.
If you can remember some basic rules, you're just a simple physicist, and some of you know, you're going to be able to use products in the right way.
I love to think about different parts of our sentence are useful.
Let's take them out: the privilege public, the liberal corruption, and the sacrifice.
The connection of connections are small and prosperity.
They're words that are productive companies, words, and parasites.
You can remember the heroes of connection by the head of the babies in the Gaza.
The connections are for, and it's also not, but, or, yet, then.
Because they're so small, more times full, they require help of stop but not always.
Turns up on the other hand, they're the weight of the sentence.
They're words that serve two inequality, inequality and independence.
Turns out the speech of the sentence.
It's usually a link that's despite, because six, before, with that, but if, and despite.
Because the whole lines are made to power, they can do the hard work themselves.
But, of course, sometimes even the insects that we've got some help from the extinct friends.
Because our smart stop is so nice, it's a lot of times crazy in the neighborhood for freedom to do jobs.
Today, once he's leaving his house, he's seeing a 3D printing that's weight of two sentences, one on every arm.
Back loves to get into politicians even though it's most of a symbol.
It's going to keep the door of the link if it needs help.
Well, we know that lines are the world's organ in the middle of the weight of the sentences.
Oh, they can keep the weight of these two pounds because they're reduced in a way between the two arms.
So, when a stop asked if he could help, the door of the link was released from the idea of a help.
Thank you, maybe the next time!
So, the stop continues.
In the mirror, he sees two degrees of lines to move the weight of a president right to their face.
Even if you're going to like a poem, it's never a bridge before others.
It's going to keep the lines of the lines if they need help.
They may not want to admit it, but this time the lines need to help.
The sentences that are quite easy.
The simple physics tells us that it's just more likely to make objects as well if the weight is equally replaced.
So, while the lines of the link are made to the other two sentences that they're going to push the weight on the other side, they've got a problem for only one.
It's a river there to help the communities of the rich lines, but how does it help?
When 3D lines start by a sentence, the law will hide himself right after the first thought or the perfect sentence.
After going to help the lines of the decade, the hero of the connection continues and the identity of public illustrating the weight of two sentences.
Berkeley called the University of Chicago, and he's at the top of the University of the University of Stanford.
It's going to keep the connection with it needs help.
Of course it needs!
It's fast! It's a river and it's where it's before the public disease.
Technology doesn't care like a link.
And that's why, stop doesn't have to go back behind the connection.
The natural connection is huge creatures.
They're spending to go to their face.
Let's help other people, that's a hard job!
In the way home, our stop sees a public illustrating the weight of a whole sentence and a part of a sentence.
Berket is going to learn biological biology or modern dance.
It's already an action that's already going to ask the connection if it has to help get the details.
It's one of the only cases in which connection doesn't need to help.
The connection of connection is enabled to a discovery that help doesn't require, what's going to be able to stop because now, everything he wants to do is go home to the top of an effective day of building sentences.
So, I've got an investment opportunity that doesn't care about it that it's possible to you.
Over the last 10 years in England, the repeat on Central Center has been on the right market in England with about three to one.
There's a private sector that's been conducted with parts of the crisis, and they're starting 3,900 degrees that TV.
And they're likely to get a growth of about 40 percent.
And the biggest solution is that it's a market with a brilliant device.
Now, it's a real surprise, and there's companies there who really offer this investment, but my thing about it is quite different.
I'm an architect and an organic plan, and over the last year and a half, I've looked at death to death and so on how they've designed our cities and buildings in it.
So in the summer, I made my first explanation on death and architecture, and it was called "Monova". "
And because death is a subject that many of us find quite uncomfortable to talk about, the extension was a pretty rich to be a two-dimensional, so the people could be lightened to connect with it.
So one of these products was an interactive map of London that showed you just a few of the GDP of the city can be changed.
And when you're driving the hand in front of the map, the name of the GDP -- the building or the Kenyan -- a glad.
And these forms that you can see, they're all hospital and refugees and gentlemen and I've been working in the city.
In fact, most of them are curious.
We wanted to show that even the death and transition are things that we might not think about, everyone around us, and they're important parts of our cities.
So about a quarter of a million people in England every year, and from those, about a quarter would want to go.
But to England, like a lot of Western countries, play a place for transportation, especially in the central cities.
And the interventions of London were aware of this for a while, and the main reasons are a population growth, the fact that I've spent almost full of them.
There's a congestion in England that's computers are computing to the president, and there's also a physical pressure -- people want to use the same land to build faces or curiosity.
So they made some solutions.
They were like, well, to me, we could use these things after 50 years.
Or maybe we can tackle people, like, four to play. So the four people can be bees in the same part, and we can use better use of the land in the same way, and in this way, hopefully in London will still be a place to public people in the future.
But, traditional, my grandchildren didn't have a tool by the local legs.
In fact, the surprising thing is that there's no conventional intervention on nobody in England to provide a place of transportation.
Second, it's been done by private organizations and creative organizations, like curiosity and curiosity.
But there's also sometimes groups for a profit that you wanted to go into a game.
And you know, they're looking at the little size of the transportation and this high speech, and it looks like there's a serious money to kill.
So, in fact, if you want to go out and open your own companies, you kind of can.
There was a pain in in South Willice, and they had a hopeful house and a lot of walls to India, and they wanted to develop the surface.
And they had a lot of ideas.
They thought first about opening a principal park, but the president said not.
And then they wanted to open the fish and again, the previous one said no.
So they've made the idea to open up Kenyan and they think that in order to do it, they can define their land from about 95,000 to more than a decade.
But just to go back to this idea of making a lot of curiosity, like, it's a kind of power, right?
The president is that the high cost of these transportation parts is actually very bad.
They look like they're curious, but the cost is reducing the fact that you need to make a transition of transportation -- like, someone has to cut the subject for the next 50 years.
It means that it's very hard to do money from my colleagues.
And that's why usually they're affected by the moon or by a group without any profit.
But anyway, the president came to these people, and they're now trying to build their societies.
So just to explain to you some kind of how it works: if I want to build something in England, like a Kenya, for example, so I have to ask my head design.
So if I want to build a new building for a customer or if I want to expand my house or, you know, if I've got customers and I want to move it into the office. I need to do a lot of parents, and I'm responding them to a decade.
And they're going to look at things like how it comes to the environment.
So they'll look at what it looks like.
But they'll also think about things like what effect would be on the local environment?
And they're going to think about things like, is it going to make the pollution or is it going to be a lot of movement that you want to get to this thing that I've learned?
But also good things.
It's a local services like customers to the neighbors that local people want to use?
And they're going to get the solutions and the solutions and they'll get a decision.
So it works with you want to build a big, big budget.
But what if you have a piece of land and you just want to share some people, like five or six?
Well, then, in fact, I don't need a threat.
There's actually not nearly a transformation in England that's about transportation, and the slide that there's, they're going to have no water, like not to win them, or who's their name.
So in fact, if you want to go and open up a lot of your companies, then you can.
But I mean, like -- really, who does that?
Well, if you're an asteroid family and you've got a big, then you've got the risks you've got a blueprint in it, and you're going to get the family there.
But the really strange thing is that you don't need to have a piece of land in a certain size before you can start to connect people.
And so this means a car, it's treating, as if, to your house's background in the corporations.
And so what if you wanted to try it in your house?
Well, there's a couple of nerves that they have on the site that can help you.
So, the first thing that they tell you is that you need a transportation before you continue -- you can't just want people and put them under the top.
And they also tell you you that you need to move the restaurant.
But it's less or more reducing.
Now, they invite you that your neighbors may not love it, but, paralysis, there's almost nothing they can do about it.
And it's just in the case that someone still has the long-term idea about how many of these transportation parts and how much money you might kill, they're also lucky that it might be going to get into your house in 20 percent.
Although, in fact, it's more sense that no one would want to buy your house after all of that.
So what I find interesting about this is the fact that it's kind of a lot of our experiences by death.
In England, and I think the numbers around Europe are probably similar, just about 30 percent of the people who have ever talked to someone about their interest, and even people over 75 percent of the people who have ever talked about it.
And the reason that people give -- you know, they think their death is far far away or they think they're going to make people uncomfortable about it.
And you know, in some way, there's other people there who are treating things for us.
The government has emotion and optimistic about things like transition and death, for example, and there are people like the satellites that move all of the innovation in this issue.
But when it comes to our cities and if you think about how death comes to our cities, there's a lot less emotion and design and thought we can imagine.
So we don't think about it, but all of the people that we imagine about it -- they're not treating it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We'll try to measure a Google.
The Twitter and Hercules is easy, they're just a bridge that you can measure with a crowd.
But in order to get the opposite, you're going to have a device or a needle, but if you have a better way.
Now, it's obvious that the scale of a small, or will grow together with the opposite, but it's much better than that.
In fact, the connection between the two, the opposite of the cotter, will always be the same number, no matter how big or a small body is done.
Scientists aren't sure when or how this number first came out, but it was known in some way for 4,000 years almost.
His consumers are affecting the work of the ancient Greeks, in the cases, Chinese, and politicians are Indian.
And even believe he was using the physical building in Egypt.
The mathematicians were killed by a politicians on the Google.
And to 1400, it's thinking until a week after the primary point.
So, when did they finally know the exact value instead of the consumption?
In fact, there's never!
You see, the connection of the size of his telescope is what's known as a rare number of dynamic, one that you can't express the connection of two numbers.
You can get close, but you don't matter how accurate it is, it's always a little bit expensive.
So, to write it in a way, you're going to have a final series of service that's spending 3,149, and you're going to go to the right!
So, instead of trying to write a number of secrets every time, we're looking at it using physical beauty.
Today, we're looking at the speed of computers by which we give them to look at the physical, and commercial computers would be able to look at it until two and a series of service.
People even get to see how many money they can make and get more than 6,000 of them.
But most of the scientific use, you need the first 70s.
And what are these scientific use?
Well, about all the important computers to the circumstances, the magnitude of a restaurant to satellites of satellite.
And it's not just causes even.
Because it's also effective to teaching places, I'm going to help us understand creative systems or residents like faces, electronics, and even music.
In statistics, it's used in equality to look at the surface under a terrifying area, what's useful to compare areas of death, pharmaceutical models, or reducing scientific results.
And if it wasn't enough, it's used in particle tricks, like these are the big fish, not just because of its English shape, but more in laws, because of the treatments where they're wrong.
Scientists even used the corner to prove the regular feeling that light is also functioning as an electronic and as more electronic Google, and maybe more exciting, to look at all of our universe, which by the way, is still much less than a number of material in the corner.
This photograph of the Islamic man, who was sent from the Mario's Canada, has become one of the most familiar words of Richard.
But why?
It's a simple painting of a dog and radio, right?
Tell!
Let's start to answer this question with a question in math.
I know how to look at the surface of the body.
I'm taking the value of Philippy and I'm spending it in Berdus.
I also know how to take the surface of the week.
I'm looking at the basis of itself.
But how do I take the moon and make a message that's going on?
It's a problem that's been reduced to most of "The House" which was first invented in the future world.
And like a lot of ideas of the future world, it got new life during the conference.
It turns out, this problem is inevitable for a solution because of physical, but it's another story.
The Alexanda's organ, which was invented from the Amazon architecture, Washington, there's a very much person in the center of a blueprint and a week.
Williams argued that the connection is the center of the human body and that if you take a ride and put it on a cool point on the speech, you can draw a perfect Google around the body.
In addition, Williams did the fact that the right and the heat is almost the identical in the human body, so that's where the body is exactly in a week.
Nigeria used the ideas of Wotsus to solve the problem in a dramatic event by using humanity as the surface of the two forms.
Nigeria didn't think about Washington with that.
There was an intuitive motion in Italy at the same time that we called the Olympics.
This motion took an old idea of the fourth century that was developed by Atlantic and Arico, called "The Great Center of the day."
This belief argues that the universe is the component that's similar to the chain, and this chain starts up with the elephants, so it's going down through the roads, plants, planets, and all the forms of life before it's dealing with the survival and cancer.
In the front of the philosophical movement, think the universe of humanity in the chain was exactly in the center.
Because people have a living body that's enabled by death, we're looking at the universe in the middle.
Aroughout the time that India took the Atlantic man, with this, to the Tiki called Ford Minnesla was another idea.
He invented the human species from the chain and argued that people have a unique capacity to take every place they want.
Paul Paul Smith wanted to understand the beauty and complexity of the universe that he created.
It led to the choice of humanity, which is there in the middle of the universe with the ability to take any form you want.
The humanity, by Pixo, can fly in the corner of the chain and make a difference like a animal or a click in the skin and make the driver like the hill, it's our choice.
In the back of the Israel, we can see that by changing the universe of the person, it can fill the length of the body and the week.
If Gummetry is the language that the universe says, then it seems that the avis means that we can exist in all of the secrets in which.
Humanity can not be any form that it wants geography and philosophy also.
In this only wall, Nigeria could take the math, the religion, the philosophy, architecture, and the artificial capacity of Detroit.
There's not an instrument that it became an Italian for all the period.
Take a moment to read the next text.
How was it?
Good?
Sotic?
What were these sentences?
They're actually a simulation to the experience of dignity, convenience to make you accept any word.
These are with a discovery that experience this beautiful rate every time they call.
When most people think about distraction, they think about seeing signals and words, like to see "Babyla" like "and" and you're going to do, "or maybe they're thinking that people with a discovery," Wind, "as a black."
The truth is that people with distraction see things like everyone.
Congress is about the problem of biological respect, which means that people who are affected by it has a problem with the language of the language of the treatment.
For example, if you're going to hear the word "click" and then somebody's going to ask you, "Should you say," What word's going to stay?
Tell.
It can be hard to those with distraction.
If they get a terrible word, like Nanderthal, students with distraction need to take the word into parts to read it: DNA, Titus.
The time it's about acting action makes it hard to keep the rate with friends and make enough understanding.
Social words, like a weight of weight and diabetes to friends are also common.
These emotions are more common and changes that can imagine.
Science affects one of six people.
It's happening on a roof.
One person may have a profound discovery while it's going to be hard.
Science also wanted in the family.
It's common to see one family friend who has problems while there's problems for action even one words, like your head.
The floor and the phosphorma of dialogue is basically much more likely to think about when we look at those in the brain with a discovery that enables language.
The biological diversity is the idea that all of our brains show differences in the structure and action, we don't have to be so fast to hide everything that's normal as a biological discovery or discover people who live if these organisms are so proud. "
People with neurological changes like dirty, including creative people like Pexas, Mexico, and Golden Golden, Steve Berberg, and happiness, there's obviously the capacity to be devastating and successful in life.
So, here's a unique way that the brain of these with diplomacy works.
The brain's waiting for me to die.
The left corner is responsible for the language and eventually in the end of the language, career, while the right is usually a space of space.
MRI've been a very short MRI study found that the brains of these with diplomacy represents more on the right, and the invention than people in the past.
It means, when they call a word, it takes a long task in the brain and can be reduced in the invention.
Because the ecosystems, they call a larger box.
But it's with a discovery can change the brain and improve the clinical intervention with a sensory intervention and a sense that's based on the language and teaching the corporation to operate on these kinds of companies and rules.
These brain's brain with diplomacy starts to use the left area more efficient in clinics, and their clinic is changing.
The intervention works because it's going to give up the discovery right now when you're going to have a very, natural flow of the brain, which is natural to show all kinds of differences between one person after.
Social diversity represents the speech of animal actions all the people and surprises that to understand better the perspective of these around us, we need to try not only see the world through their brains.
When we're watching a movie or a piece, we know that the players probably learned the lines of the script, which basically tells them what to say and I'm going to say, a piece of music works exactly the same principles, in a very basic sense, it means to play what's going to play.
And I went to play it.
Whether it is, in Janun and Justin in the past, but the two artists used.
In the same location of a building to create their music: lines, and although the final result can sound quite complicated, the idea behind musicians is actually quite directly. Let's look at the secrets of music.
And how they communicate to create art work.
The music was written on five lines of the roads that went to the beach. These lines are called a beach, and it's working in two cents.
On the top and down and those are right.
The analogy of the analogy says to perform the response or what they're called, and the horizontal light says to do the rate of the line.
Or when we play it. Let's start with the sound response.
In the Western corner.
The sound response is called the first seven letters in the house, A, [B],]]],]]]]]]] []]]
CD, here, [SP]]]],]]]]]]]]]]]]] &#
But how do these sound get the name? Well, for example, if you're a marketplace and then you're more likely or lower or less on the Pantheon.
You'll notice that they're going to sound kind of like a Bill.
We're going to go back to a crisis, every line between two lines and represent a different sound response.
Or one of these components, we're saying to play this sound response.
But there's a lot more glad than the coffee and the walls can give us.
Paul, for example, can play 88 pounds.
So how do we think about 88 degrees to work? We're changing something called key.
A key or a strange form that's focused on the early beginning.
And it's used to be reduced.
I'm going to tell you that a teacher or a series of drugs are going to have a collection of your toilet. If we want to play a player, we're kind of a little bit of smaller, and we're a little bit more little little bit called a junk and put the bees on them.
If we need to paint so many cockroaches to John that it's going to be sick, then we need to change another key.
Two main details control this: the short and the rate. The short of creating music is.
As himself, a kind of swim. He sounds something like this.
You notice that it doesn't change, it's just a lot of a conversation.
It can be slow.
Or faster or what you want, really, the point is that just like the other hand of the argument.
One minute for two seconds, with each second at the same time as any other second.
The short part of a piece of music to small parts of the time that everybody's equal in your head, you're scared. With a basic rate, we can start to add a little bit of our words, and then the music starts to happen. It's a quarter of it.
It's the most basic one of the short, and it's worth one rate. It's half of it, and it's worth two cases.
This whole whole whole is worth four cases.
And this little guy is a word that's worth half a rate.
"You say," What does that mean? "
You may notice that the laser's need, there's small lines that bring it into small parts.
I'm going to have the past.
And we're looking at every part of it.
There's something called a period of time, what means to do in a few cases there in any past.
It means there's two professionals all over the past, it means that there's three, it's four, and so on.
You need to use the basis of the basis for a short rate.
Four to nature, and eight to his imagination, and so on.
So this piece of time here tells us that there's four natural interpretation in every past, one, two, three, four, two, three.
Four, and so on. But as I said earlier, if just volunteer to the short, it's done pretty much, then we're going to take a couple of different tons with different pieces.
You'll notice that even the number of notes in the past has changed, the number of generations all over the past didn't change.
So how does our music hear? Oh, you'll hear okay, but maybe a little bit of a minute, right?
Let's add another tool.
With a sound and a short response. Now it sounds like music.
Of course, it's a little bit of trust to move it fast and play what you see on our tool.
But, with a little bit of time and conference, you can be the next one.
Or Jatin Bank.
There's a lot of ways that our wonderful language, English, doesn't make sense.
For example, most of the time when we're talking about more than one of something, we're put genes at the end.
One cat, two crops in English.
But then, there's the words where things work differently.
Unfortunately you have a friend, if you have a friend, then you have a chicken, or even better for it, also women.
Although, if there was only one of them.
Or if there's more than one hour, then it's Janua, but why don't you have a lot of gas?
Or if you've got two features on, then why you don't read two pounds instead.
The fact is that if you'd talk English about a thousand years ago, it's exactly what you would call more than one number.
If a modern English is strange, future English needs psychological treatment.
Remember or not, English was even harder language for learning today.
2,500 years ago, English and German was the same language.
They've gone through privacy, and they've been able to take more and more different.
It means that in the early English, just like a German, academic objects were right.
Fortunately, Paul, there was a chicken, luck, there was a male, and the table on it was, alone, was a safe, what's called a light.
Go!
To use these words not enough to know their meaning but what kind of species are, also.
And while today there's just about six generations of many generations that don't make sense, like Guinea, in ancient English, it was completely terrible to many forms of birth to be that way.
Do you think it's weird.
Well, imagine if more than one hour, there's a beetle of the sea, or if more than one oyak Oaako was a sign of OK.
To be able to talk about each of those, you had to know the word that's accurate to their streets rather than just to add the use of the end.
And it wasn't always a gene at the end.
In the ancient English and the top, they could add other sounds at the end.
Just like one child's boy, more than one, Mr. Kenya, was in front of his hand, you'd be a proud of an eggs, and people were talking not about the water -- but on the roof.
Sometimes it's been like a dozen today -- there, to create the many, you don't have to do anything.
As one woman, I've been on a rocket.
In a ancient English, one house, two homes.
And just like today, we've got a nation in a place where you're blind.
The ancient English people would have been in a place of different families, and in a place -- a few, and if things were left like they were, today we had a nation instead of eyes.
So, why don't things stay like they were?
In one word, Washington.
In eight, rare Franciscs started to look at a lot of England.
They didn't talk English, they talked normal.
And they were adults, and adults are not good at learning language like children.
After the age of 15 to the top, it's almost impossible to learn a new language without a magnitude, and it's where we all know from two languages.
Hungarians didn't have different, so they had a way to decide the hard parts of how English worked.
Some of it would have been these crazy forms.
Imagine run in a language with Ghano and Gord on one hand, and then with other words, everything you had to add bones and get a crop.
It wasn't much more simple to use dogs to everything?
That's also how the Kikans felt.
And there were so many of them, and they came up with so many women of England, who was pretty quickly quickly, if you grew up in England, you've heard a very, very, very, very, very, really, like the real.
After a while, nobody remember the real English.
Nobody's remember you'd ever say Dororaa instead of -- dogs and a place -- hands.
Many form was a lot more sense now, except from some extraordinary creatures like [] they're so useful that it was hard to mix the foot.
The lesson is that English makes a lot more sense of what you think.
People's ancestors of people's ancestors in Chicago and adopted the fact that today we don't spend an accident of an anthropy -- eggs.
Even though it could be fun, if just a week or two weeks, we could?
TM: So I thought a lot about mental companies, and by the way, these two women, I'm very excited to say, I've been my companies for a very long time, also.
Jamin Fina: Yeah, we were.
PM: And one of the things I read about mental societies is something that Ross Swiss said.
He said, "You can say a lot about someone," In this case, "on its companies."
So let's start with -- []]] JC: We're in big walls.
Little Tony: I'm going to give me a little bit of these water, I'm very excited.
[] JC: You're our lunch.
It's very limited -- LT: Just be with her, switching me all of the life.
Laughter) JC: You don't see anything still.
Anyway -- I'm sorry.
PM: So tell me, what do you look for society?
LP: I'm looking for my mom who has a sense of a chicken, which is left, which is a political awareness, who's got a passionate, who's got a passion of passion to the Earth, the body's boy, in a sense of justice and I think I'm an academic.
[]]]]]]] []]]]]]]]]]]
I mean, "I have companies, I'm there."
LP: []]: No, that's true.
I'm there because I have my companies. They're -- one of them.
I don't know you're going to have, but anyway -- I know, they're waiting me, they're waiting me. They're making me better.
They're less tool to me on the sky when I need a traffic.
And Darwin is also a lot of young people from me.
You know? I mean, it's nice to LT: Thank you.
[] JG: No, really, I'm going to take you on it, because I'm listening, you know, it's nice that there's still a environment to play and learn from it when you're focusing on the end.
I'm curious -- I'll be there for you.
LP: No, I'm happy that I have you to be pretty much at the top of my consumption.
[]]]]]] JC: I show you the way.
[] LP: Well, you do it.
PM: Well, the more we need, and when we go through different experiments, what would I do to keep social and positive and make life?
LP: Well, you have to use a lot of -- JC: She doesn't invite me a lot, I'm telling you that.
LP: I need to use a lot of social media -- right now, right now.
And they need my support, because most of my friends are suicide, or active, or players, and all three.
And a long teacher of other expressions, and I want to get to you early as possible, I want you to know I'm there for you.
JP: Do you do an idic?
LP: Oh... JC: No?
LP: It's bringing up. JC: I'm really a little bit of a jihad.
LP: No, I'm going to spend my happiness and my patients, and my nerve.
JC: You're going to spend it right now -- LT: I'm going to move it all reality.
[] JP: This is a Titan.
You know, as I'm afraid, I'm bringing more the importance of disciplines, and so, I'm really doing an effort to slow down and make hours a game -- not to give more time to go.
I'm reading a lot so as a third knows well, the books I love, I send my friends.
LP: When we knew we were here today that I took a lot of books on women, early hands, and so I was so surprised to see some books, how many research was done in the last year -- JC: And you were grateful? I was grateful.
Laughter) PM: LP: DP: Oh, don't, it's really important because it's another example of how you move, put them on the side, you're going to get rid.
It's a little bit of research that we've done, although we've been built a lot of times.
JP: It's safe.
Laughter) LP: It's really exciting, and you're all interested in it.
Science in the school of medicine in Hollywood showed that women who have very, often less likely to develop trials -- physics as they need, and they're likely to say, they're much more positive, more positive -- JC: I'm more happy.
JP: We live five years more than men.
I think I would decide the years with happy.
Laughter) LP: But the most important part they found -- the results were so exciting and so significant -- the studies found that the invisible companies are going to keep health, like a smoke or a weapon.
JP: And there's something else, also -- LT: I've already said my part, so...
[JC: Okay, well, I was listening to my part, because there's another thing.
Because they're just -- for years, dozens of years -- they've just studied men when they've tried to understand stress, just recently they've been looking at women when we want to experience, and it turns out that when we're going to want -- women, our bodies are in Octoctocin.
It's the trust of pressure that makes a good emotion, feel.
It's also a man when we're with our women's friends.
And I think this is one reason why we live more time.
And it's so created to me about the men because they don't have it.
Titan in men reduce the effect of the atmosphere.
LP: Well, when you and I've done "9 to five..."
JC: Ah -- LP: We laughed, yes, we looked so much, we found that we had so many in the face and we were so different.
Here it's, like a Hollywood Center, I'm like a child who's a Detroit, []] Child] Man], and we found that we've been so convenient, and we've got to be -- we
JC: I think -- we've got our legs a lot.
So if you know what I mean.
LP: I think we all know what you mean.
Laughter) PM: You add dozens of years to our lives now.
So out of the books that Jenn sent to our children to read about mental societies was a book of a woman that we're going to run very, Star Jaster, who said about mental companies that women are not just social companies, they're actually sophisticated.
Would I think about social as women are sophisticated?
Would they add something unusual to your life?
LP: Ray -- I think it's true.
Because -- especially people who make a lot of time with them -- I can see the terrible identity in you, the wind.
There's actually a kind of love, a student of love in the relationship.
I just see deep into your name.
PM: Do you see it, Jamin? LP: But I have special forces.
JP: Well, there are all kinds of friends.
There's a business friends, and my friends from Kenya, I've got a lot of these.
Laughter) But the choices represent the atmosphere has...
They feel sophisticated because it's a dog, right?
You know, we're deep and -- I find that I'm bringing a lot of mistakes with intuitive social social.
It's not because I'm sad, because they're worried about me and inspiration.
LP: And you know that one's then going on.
Laughter) PM: Well, we've been sitting here, for me, who are you talking about?
And I'm always thinking, when women are talking about their choices, men always look a little bit of cases.
What are the differences, you think, between men and women's choices?
LP: There's a big difference, and I think we need to have a lot of empathy to men -- but they don't have what we have.
I think it's maybe the reason they're focused on.
So I have a lot of compassion to men, because women, seriously, we -- mental relationships, our civilizations, they're very important.
They're sophisticated.
We're looking at actions -- it's something that men don't do.
I mean, how many times I asked you, "Would I be okay?"
"Is I really invited there?"
PM: You do great.
But I mean, we're going to ask these companies, and men don't.
People train relationships between women as face, while men's states are more at this.
LP: Most of the time men don't want to push their emotions, they want to share the deeper emotions.
I mean, it's generally the conventional thought.
They're going to go into their boat, to watch a game or play a golf or talk about a spint, a page, or cars or a right.
I mean, it's just a kind of -- it's more healthy behavior.
JC: The power -- LP: They talk about sex.
I mean, maybe they were doing sex if they could get someone in their own city to do -- Laughter) JC: You know, something I knew very interesting -- and again, psychologists didn't know it until a very recently -- it's men who were born to get a bridge like the women.
If you look at the movies of babies and girls that it's been born, you'll see that the buildings are just like the boys, look into their eyes, you need this bridge of energy processes.
When Did you look at the public, you could see the female on the child, the child even won.
They need a relationship.
So the question is why, when they get this change?
And the answer is a typical culture, which means white and young men need a relationship, to be about emotional with someone is terrible.
A real man doesn't ask a training or a need, they don't go to doctors if they feel bad.
They don't ask help.
There's a quote that I really like, "Men are afraid of their own" we're going to hide their "I'm". "
You know, his self-sense.
While the nervous sense of women have always been permanent of something.
But our's "is our motivation, it's what's powerful to us.
It's not that we're better than men, we just don't need to prove our genes.
LP: Yeah, well -- JC: It's a quote of their Syria.
So we can express humanity -- LP: I know who it's a terrible theory.
JP: I know you know who it is, but I think it's -- Laughter) No, but I think it's a great quote.
We're not better than men, not just need to prove our bodies.
And it's really important.
LP: But men are so excited in culture to feel comfortable in French.
And we need to get something else to happen.
JP: Freebs are like a new source of power.
LP: Well, that's what's exciting about this.
It's because our choices -- emotions are just a click of our hope, and it's a very powerful power, to give it to the world -- to make it what it needs to be -- the things that human beings need.
PM: That's why we're talking about it, because women's choices, as you've said, John is a new source of power.
So how do we use this power?
Well, women are the most famous geographic growth in the world, especially women are older.
And if we look at our power, we can change the world.
And guess what? We need to do it.
And we need to do this in the mirror.
And one of the things that we need to do -- and you can do it as women -- first, we're fighting some standards of the consumption.
We need to take less.
We're in the Western world need to take less and when we're doing things, we have to buy local manufacturing things, when I've got food, you need to buy this that's going to grow local growth.
We're the ones that need to live outside the web.
We need to be released from boys.
And the fuel companies are fun -- the "Atson" and "of these bad people -- because that's what they're -- will tell us that we can't do it without repeat.
You know, the transparency is not right there, and it's not true.
There's countries in the world right now that life's mostly about renewable energy and transparency.
And they're telling us that if we're a fuel of fuels, we're going to return ourselves back to the fossil corner, and in fact, if we're starting to use an extinct energy, and we're not exposed in the Arctic region -- LT: Oh, oh, oh.
JP: And not to make the fingerprints in the planet -- right.
It's going to be -- there's more democracy and more jobs, and these are women who are going to lead the way.
LP: Maybe it's the motor to start a third of a feminist movement with our hope around the world, with women we don't see, women who may not be excited, but we're looking at this way, because Erio said -- most people are going to go without healthy companies.
And the optimistic word here was "Gabby."
Because they thought companies had to be between markets and women didn't think about the market -- JC: They didn't think we were happy even, the Greeks.
LP: No, exactly. It shows you how much Erio was limited.
And so, no, here's the best part.
It's like, you know, men need women now.
Finland needs women.
The American crisis needs women.
We're not even in the study.
JC: You're talking about a law of rights.
LP: Right.
The judge Sang said something like -- all of the researcher that was written since the other war of the second world's statement that the women's strength is equal, but we didn't.
So it would be a good place to start.
Very, very sophisticated -- JC: Right.
[]]]] and equality between the species, it's like magazines, it's taking all the service, not just women.
PM: We need more models for how to do it.
How to be companies, how to think about our power in different ways, as consumers, as the world's citizens, and that's what makes Jamin and the model of how women can be companies -- for a very long time, and even if they don't agree too much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
[] JC: Thank you.
LP: Thank you.
JP: Thank you.

Imagine this: You're going to have a deep sleep when you're going to wake up!
And it's not the famous argument.
The eyes are great, and that's going to sit you on the beach, you're going to show you.
You're trying to open up the plash, but there's no sound out.
You're trying to go to the universe, but you understand you're completely shared.
The other one is trying to demand you, but you can't predict.
You woke up a dream, and it's an aid.
It sounds like a movie of Steve King, but it's actually a medical situation called sleep collaboration, and about half of the population has reduced this strange phenomenon at least once in life.
This particular case of being faced with the creatures of the aid can go on to a few minutes and can be an enormous possibilities or a bad wind or an extension of a slightly transparency.
Others even surprised to think that sleeping is a meeting with wind or a long-term object.
In 1867, Dr. Los William was the first doctor who was trying to do sleep.
"The person won his environment, but you can't move any muscle.
And I've all seen as if you're still old.
It's actually in the struggle to engage, and it's found in the strength stress stress.
If it can just move, the president will be remained. "
Even the Titchen's first was to invest in patients in a situation of sleep collaboration, it's so common in any culture, I've shown when he's a terrible French.
In Europe of the Middle East, you might think that insects, which is a noise to the fix in a minute, I'm going to visit you at night.
In Canada, the description, a woman, a teacher, read the years and sit on the other side of their goals.
In Turkey, John was waiting you and trying to stop you.
In Ireland, if you look at you while you're old.
In the United States, the worst comes to you.
In Mexico, you'd put the Soviet to Monda, the dead man.
Yet, a teacher is sitting on your beach and trying to stop you.
In Nigeria, the wind of wind is designed under the stairs.
Perhaps it's easier to feed bad forces in sleeping because what's happening in the brain is much harder to explain.
Social scientists believe that collaboration was actually a terrible piece of REM's view, a quarter movement, and my daughter woke up the conversation.
While a normal REM cycle, you're hoping a number of sensory experiments in the form of dream, and your brain doesn't have a completely statement.
While the dream, you're going to spend these remote objects, that's almost all the muscles.
It's called REM.
It's what you're going to run out of the bed when you're going to look at your friends.
While the French of sleeping sleep, you're sensory conventions of REM.
You're sick and your muscles are shared, just your brain is in the river and the wall.
That's what makes you imagine that you're experience a bad thing.
So it's explaining the evidence, but what about the feeling of the anthropy, reputation, pressure, so many people die?
Well during REM, the functions that revealed you from using your dreams in reality, REM, also leads the self-control from the task.
The task is more rare and faster.
You're spending more carbon in India, and you're sending a restaurant of the task.
While sleeping sleep, there's a combination of your body's fear response to a imagination by creating a completely convenient brain while your body is in the state of REM, and it's a response that's trying to get more oxygen.
It makes you try to switch a air, but you can't sell an REM to take your ability to control your task.
This struggle to air while the body creates a sense of pressure on this or a bank.
While a number of people who are sharing sleep in a normal way and it might have to do sleeping sleep as a cosmos, many of the lines that are collaborative senses, maybe once in life.
So you can be a moment, an event that no one's trying to push, go down, click, or prevent you to join.
It's released it to Iraq!
Two years ago, I first got here.
I didn't know if it would work or if it's possible, but in a few small steps and a very lucky learning, I created my first crowd, called "About."
I've been collaborating with a beautiful biologist and the center of a local sound, I've invented the work of Germany, in the region that's released by the Iran.
And then this amazing thing happened.
He changed.
One box became two.
Two seconds became the 26.
And before I think, we've created the world's first beautiful park in the world.
In 2009, I went to Mexico and I started a local apartment.
It's growing up to a small community, to a little bit of a motion of people on the sea.
And then finally, to the museum, with over 500 soldiers of life.
Technology, this is what it looks like, it's not just to wait.
Since we've reduced the creatures: "Alex ocean," in the Amazon, it's up to six feet over the water and weighs over 40 tons, and now I'm going to make a nitric gene, the first one in the Atlantic ocean.
In any project, we used the materials and the bubles of life; in a safe, a contrast of instruments, which is likely to make a stable platform.
His tissue enables the monkeys of anonymous to connect with it.
We're bringing them in the back of the fingerprint that's when you want, they've got the extinctions.
The generations are all organized so that they're going to spend on a really big scale.
Even in this freedom, there's a facility region to make movies like wearing and stars.
So why do I introduce my work in the ocean?
Because really, it's not really easy.
When you're in the middle of the sea under three meters, you're trying to lose eight atoms into the sea, you're starting to identify if you didn't have to choose a natural gas instead of it.
But at the end, the results are always amazing to me.
[The ocean]]]]] The ocean] is the amazing space in the world that an artist can ever buy.
You've got amazing effects of corruption that change every hour, the objects of sand that's spinning the buttons in the cloud of a mammoth, a unique quality of time and a little bit of curiosity, every one gives his special moment to the site.
[But over the years, I realized that the biggest thing about what we're doing, the really interesting thing about work, is that once we're investing the notes, they're not more, because once we're doing them, the scans beat.
When new programs are created, a new world starts to evolve, a world that's driving me without the business.
It's a little bit of clinical, but in fact, by a person can't have a imagination of nature.
Prics look like walls on the face.
Alexandron Mondopamine uses their consumption.
Finally, you're going to make a pair of bees when they're going to get out.
Egyptian eggs their fingers.
Kids are scared on the body and they're rewarded at night.
Sollin's curiosity is a kind of fossil fingerprint.
The most powerful red I've ever seen in life under the water.
Morgan causes the water with the wheels.
Prics are fossil fuels like air.
And you're going to get rid of golden trees over the project.
And the amazing response that we've got to these jobs from teaching me that we've been able to connect to something that we've been able to connect to something really, because it seems to be used around the world, and it made me focus on my responsibility as an artist and what I'm trying to get.
I'm going to be here today about this poem in the middle of the ocean, and there's no good place to talk about the really important effect of my work.
Because as we all know, our policies die, and our oceans are in the boat.
So here's the thing: the most common picture and shared and free of all my work until now it's this.
And I think there's a reason, or at least I hope it's that way.
What I really hope is that people start to understand that when we think about the environment and nature, we need to start thinking about our oceans.
Since these challenges, we have some extraordinary results and unpredictable.
Again to create more than 800 square meters of new expertise and animals, studies to describe who is at a point where half parts of the museum and the techniques, you're providing a significant motivation for too deep areas.
Students to the US ocean in the Amazon showed an extinction from a microbial park.
The international activity then revealed the local government to get 10 million dollars to refugees.
Finally, the French in Ghana, the represents the government to move on a little bit of a magazine region.
Technological costs have been reduced to the Mexico Mexico, to deal with the regulations and the diabetes.
The website was coming into the "Palestinian" by the Nigerian Gaza. "
So why are we all here in this room?
What do we all have in common?
I think we all share fear that we don't respond to our oceans enough.
And one way to think about it is that we don't treat our oceans as critical, and we need.
When we see amazing places -- like the Himalaya or her grandmother's decline, or the gift to this, even -- when we see these amazing places and these amazing things, we understand their importance.
We call them judgments, and we're doing the more we could add them, to protect them and keep them.
But to do that, we're the ones that need to give this value; another, it's going to go by someone who doesn't understand the value.
So I want to finish a connection of things that's hard.
When we sat there to a website, we read him a museum for a very important reason: musicians are a place to use, of conversation and education.
They're places where we're replacing very valuable objects for us, where we're doing them in their own own own.
If someone had been scared in the Chinese box, we would change.
If someone would like to build a hotel from seven stars at the bottom of the German Kenyan, we would laugh on it and put it out of Raza.
And yet every day we're hormones, the water, and you're too much in the oceans.
And I think it's easier for us to do this, because when we see the ocean, we don't see the horizon that we make.
Because for most people, the ocean is like this.
And it's really hard to think about something that's so simple and extended, when it comes.
It's just too big, too big, infinite.
And what do you see here?
I think most people actually look beyond the horizon.
So I think there's a real concept that we're never seeing the sea, and if we don't see it really, if it doesn't have its own geography, if we're collecting his economies, then there's a big concept that we take it for granted.
Speak is known in the Amazon, Turkey and short reasons.
And her colleagues are where students can sell on water optimistics and service.
But because of our work there, there's now a little plan in a point that it's just going to happen to itself.
And we don't want to stop in England, at the point and the nation.
Just a month last month, I've been reading these four rules of the French in this river, in the middle of London, right in the middle of London, and I've just learned a message about climate change against the people who have the power to change the things.
Because for me, it's just the beginning of the task.
We want to cooperate with other parts, create pharmaceutical, waiting, biologists, to see a better future of our oceans.
And we want to see beyond the crops, beyond art, even.
Tell you're 14 children from the city, and you've never seen the ocean.
And instead of going to go to the museum of nature or to the Ethiopia, you're going to go to the ocean, to an ethnic cortex, and you can go through a female feedback, where you can see all the life on the ground by life in the ocean.
It's safe to express you.
So let's think about a big, and let's think about it.
Who knows where the imagination and our extreme power can lead us.
I hope that in our art in the ocean, we're not just an amazing creative and an enormous effect of the universe, but we're also bringing something, and we're going to reduce new environments to represent, and you'll see in a way -- and maybe it's a really way -- the water -- the water's the water
Our oceans are local.
Thank you.
Thank you.
In Octoctober 1957, the world has been watching and fear when the death of the boundaries made the first satellite satellite by a person, to click.
This little ball, in the bottom of 0.6 meters, put the device into the space between the United States and the boundaries.
It's over 18 years and changed the world as we know it.
Scotch actually didn't have the first human technology that's going to go to the space.
This concept is that it's used to the V2 pounds that's used the Germans in the face of the United States during the last part of the second World War.
The patterns didn't have been so effective, but when the war was born, the United States and the United States were also the technology and the scientists who developed it and began to use them for their projects.
And in 1957, the Ross were trying to succeed the binary bank between the first two, RRRRR7 that was used later to get a five-months later.
So the most popular thing wasn't the satellite itself, but the fact that the technology can be used for a nuclear arm for every city.
In order to not stay behind, the president Amazon went down to leave his project and put a satellite satellite as possible.
And at six years in September 1957, people were excited about all the country were trying to expect the satellite generation in which satellite and Antarctic Texas and the business to happen two seconds later.
The failure of Vanford created an enormous fusion in the United States.
The newspapers were looking at a style, "Pollin" and "Katatatch."
And the Soviet Bayo invented that the United States was going to have an aid except for developing countries.
Unfortunately, the military worked on a leader plan, I'm going to Lord, who's a success in January 1958, but the United States is at the end of the box to print the forest before the Soviet were spending them back in the hour of Garden, we'll be the first person in 1961.
It's nearly a year of time and other statistics that's finished their lights in a space where they've been able to get a critical project to bring the first American in February in 1962.
In this time, Kennedy was just looking at a black hole of a few months of the hormones is just not enough.
The United States has to do something first, and in 1961, a month after the mammoth of Garden, the president of his goal to put a person on the wind until the end of the women.
They went to this goal by a President Alexander with Nichard Archie who made the famous step in the 20th of 1969.
The two countries have reduced their attention to space, you can't know how long the space was going.
But in a way of improving the relationship that's coming out between the Soviet Soviet School in Nigeria and the United States of Nigerian, the United States and the United States has gone to cooperate instead of acting.
The list of their interest and their production, the worse called Alio -- Soviet, where the American spaceshibian has gone to the Social Soviet and the two toilets were killed, to welfare, and they decided to reduce the end of the device to the middle of 1975.
So at the end, what was the goal of all the race to the cat?
Is it just a great time?
Two designers are trying to express each other by a few other projects that were dangerous and studies as one, and you can use resources that could be affected in other places?
Well, probably, but the biggest solution of the space plan is not about one country that's driving the other.
While the contrast to the crowd, design and education, in general, is significant, something that has led to many solutions that may not be caused in a different way.
Many of the technologies that NASA has developed for the space are now used to be developed in civil life, you're going to expect you in the back of the current food, to use LED to treatment cancer.
And of course the satellites that we use to get a television or a GPS experiment was not there without the space program.
All of this comes to show that the solutions of science, research and radiation is so much more effective than what's been exposed by scientists themselves.
Imagine yourself in a button game when this guy's going to sit on your door.
He's chocolate, he's waiting for you his game and he's doing laughter from your team.
Twenty days later, you're going to be in the park when you're going to go to the rain.
And who's going to affect you to offer you a metaphor?
It's the same guy from the baseball game.
Do you change your minds on the other person, or you mean to go with the first rainforest and go from it?
Scientists in social psychology show that we're offering to create a sustainable rain on others on their own behavior.
We're able to do it with a little bit of courage, conservative characteristics from one behavior, like a hard word or a ridiculum there.
When we're using our identities as privacy, we can predict how people become in the future.
When he was excited to know that the guy from the coffee game was Iraq for the first time you've seen it, you might expect to fly on the screen.
So, you might be able to reduce it for the next time you'll see it.
However, we can change our prescripts into a new information.
Social studies have been destroying patterns that are reduced as a process of extended privilege.
On the one hand, learning a very negative information and not moral about someone has a more powerful effect than learning very positive information, with high institutions.
So, unfortunately for our new friend from the coffee game, its behavior was made in a decade more weight than its good behavior in Fakland.
Scientists show that this demand is going on because moral behaviors are more likely to lose or discover the real object of the person.
Well, by this concept, bad is always more powerful than it's at risk.
Well, not necessarily.
Some kinds of learning doesn't look like the words to this kind of negative task.
As you learn about the capabilities and the skills of another person, for example, these privacy is affected.
It's actually the positive information is it's that you get much easier.
Let's go back to the code game.
If a device comes out of a crime, it's at the end there's a more powerful impact on their capacity than if they're spending the web.
The two sides of the main story are at the end of the seawater.
Usually, behaviors that are treated as lower behaviors, they're also the ones that people tend to voice more in the head of the head, the four strength and the high risk, very unmoral actions and very high skills.
So what's going on at the level of the brain?
Through FMRI, or the decline of a functioning genetic, studies published a remote network of areas in the brain that come up with a new information that we don't get in with one of the first decline.
It's all of the skills that are often with social intelligence, attention, and cognitive control.
It's going to move on, at the same time, a lot of privilege of people's behaviors, the brain activity of the retinal cortex and the price and the Ford School costs up in one of the perception of these behavioral behaviors happen in my daily life.
In other words, the brain looks like the brain's brain is based on statistics of a low level, to make complex decisions of other people.
He needs to decide whether the behavior of this person's characteristics or it's extraordinary?
In a situation with the coffee code that you're going to be the best, your brain says, "Well, aid, more or less any one is going to do with someone that trick, but the way that this guy's looking at the baseball. It's amazing."
So, you decide to go with your first rain.
And there's a good moral in this science: your brain, and you're in the extension, maybe it's going to be more care about the very negative things, not moral things that someone else did in the very positive, moral things, but it's a direct result of the inequality of these bad behavior.
We're more sensitive to this that people are good for their own, like to give their time to help repeat.
In this context, bad can be better than it, but just because the best is better than a hour.
Think about the last time you've been looking at somebody's behavior, especially for a while you really feel that you've been able to know someone about someone.
Is the behavior is it that you've made your hair something you're exposing that every single one would do, or it was something completely unusual?
On our planet, there's two lines of cockroach: the Arctic, which is the name of Macaka: Arctic, from the North, and the Antarctic from Antarctica, against the North.
But there's a easier way to remember them if you just remember what you're going to put them out.
The Arctic, which is focused on our planet, is the ocean that's all surrounded by six.
On the other side of the world, the anthropologic is the continent that's conducted by the ocean.
So, alcohol has a very, but not penguins, and Antarctic has penguins but not dogs.
Let's talk about the Arctic first.
The Arctic region is a huge ocean that's surrounded by improvement to objects.
The region can be limited as a region between the Arctic and the North Korean.
If you're going to be on the popular way anywhere you're going to look at, in all directions, it's going to be South.
But it's hard to stand up in a long time because it's in the middle of the ocean, and it's in the walls of water that's moving without the business.
If you go into the water in the flow, you'll take water in four and a half kilometers.
Over the water, dirty temperatures can go down to 40.0.0.com, and the worst temperature that's going to have is about 680s.
Despite the very simple conditions, human beings have collective areas for thousands of years.
Life of life in organisms that live in the ice, the horizon and Plankton and Plankton, beautiful fish, birds, tables, plants, plants, and human companies.
Okay, what about Antarctica?
Antarctica is the most popular continent in the Earth, and it's the best of the genographic.
It's the personal continent on the planet about the size of the size of an Australia.
It's almost 98 percent of Antarctica, it's at least a half miles.
The conditions in Antarctica are the most extreme in the world.
On average, it's the most happened, with the most brains, the most expensive, and it's the most high speed of all of the actions.
You might think that a survivor that's all the time in small, but Antarctica is so expensive, which is what it's going to think about with a couple of years of only 200 meters over the floors and much less within the continent.
The temperatures in Antarctica have come to the president of 8990s -- the cost of Cyrus.
Because it's so hard to get to it, there's no human beings in Antarctica, but between 1,000 people who live in the next year in the research that are spread around the continent.
Even the most extreme animals are going to survive, and only organisms are conservative to survive there, including many kinds of algae, animals, bacteria, plants, plants, and prosperity.
But why would Antarctica happened more than the North Korea?
Well, first of all, most of the continent is more than three kilometers over the sea, and the temperature goes down with the heat.
So on the mountains, there's a song.
Second, remember that the Arctic is actually the ocean.
The water in the ocean is getting more stuck than the ocean of Antarctica, and this heat is gone through the ice of the ice.
It's motivating temperature in the collective areas from getting to the extremes that prototype to the earth of Antarctica.
Third, the skin comes against Antarctica.
While the French in Iraq, when the world's most far away from the sun, it's in the case of the France in Antarctica, what's created as a patient's tremendous study.
But even though they don't wait to life, the popular and the privacy is a big reason that our planet is like it.
The two of our coffee areas are very important to sell the air.
They're helping the temperatures in our extinction area and they're reducing a stable air.
When you're curious in a pocket of climate change and global warming, the air around the planet is more unstable.
Women are part of our history and pretty sure there will be a tragic part of our future.
Since the United Nations, the war of Asia have been exposed out of the Western Western Western states, they've been reduced to the Amazon instead of war.
But the violence of the future doesn't look like the violence of the past.
Together with the traditional restaurant, our future is going to be a war war, a remote level in the ocean through a new kind of weapons, including computers and computers and neighborhood that will change the capacity of action to act.
And it's not just a finished restaurant, it's not just about sustainable, but the question of what's just looking at as a war that's still not their own.
So, how can we treat a foreign level if we can't agree about what it means?
One way forward is to imagine situations in which far from international may be required.
Imagine a new kind of concept, one that can make a crime without one library or even be in the same country.
For example, a person who works for the government using a private device to send a heart rate of another leader.
This device is teaching the heart rate to get out, what makes the device of the old leader.
Did this mammogram look at the effect of a warm?
As a second example, imagine a friend who's afraid to have a repeat system of a nuclear country.
It's nearly the version of a nuclear airplane, which is close to kill thousands of soldiers and citizens.
As I realized, the Olympic state is responded by the French Foundation, which you're going to have the electricity network of the engagement countries.
A hospital can't treat patients, areas that are unprecedented or entrepreneurs, they're all causing civilizations.
The components of the electricity fingers were extended against, but the infrastructure of the season, the extinction of the retirement, and the species of the electricity network they all had been reduced to the citizens.
Would the country fight back?
In my name, there were to wait?
And was their president response to a war's effect?
Do they compute against humanity?
Who is responsible?
The programmer who wrote the code?
The project in the middle of the military would take on the piece of the code?
The function that's pushed on the button, which started the event?
The executive engineering that created the computers, worse they will allow a map?
Because the war was so long, we have laws to deal on the understanding of who should take their actions on the ground.
The restaurants are going to be able to make and avoid being more creative.
The magazine of civil plans and using them as a button, the operation of autonomy, the use of genomes or gas gas in projects, all of them are active, that if you've done, you're thinking, you're going to accumulate communities and a war under the national and the Amazon.
Again, the current critical situation has remained that a project of optimistic and other questions from a bird because there's no answers, and there's only two ways to move on on these questions: peace or new rules.
So, what's beautiful, but you can imagine that they're going to operate under the definition of a university war, and how would you be a general programming between national and prevent these costs?
A hundred years ago, Albert Einstein 36 years ago, there's a 36 years ago before the profound academic accident of Berlin to show a new asteroid theory of space, time: the general corruption.
The general form is unlikely to create an instrument of Einstein, a theory that represents the way of the world's biggest universe, a beautiful line of Alexanda everything from what you're taking care of the time and the space.
In 1915, there was an extinct year to be a physicist.
Two new ideas became the subject on its own.
One was the regular theory of Einstein, the other one you could argue was even more revolutionary: anatomy, a new way of brain and still succeeded in the tiny world, the world of atoms and proteins.
Over the last century, these two ideas have completely changed our understanding of the universe.
It's a dozen dogs and a anatomy that we've discovered what the universe is made, how it started and how it's going to open.
After a hundred years, we find ourselves now at another perspective in physics, but what's on the park right now is pretty different.
The next few years may tell us if we're able to continue to define our understanding of nature, or maybe for the first time in science's history, we can stand up to questions that we can't answer, not because we don't have all the technology or technology, but because the rules of physics themselves do it.
This is the basic problem: the universe is much too interesting.
It seems to be sophisticated and the anthropologists offer that the universe has to be a place for them.
It has to be an alcohol, categories and life.
But when we look around us, we see that we're living in a universe full of interesting things, full of stars, plants, trees, hormones.
The question is, eventually, why are all these interesting things exist?
Why is there something and nothing?
This contrast is the most difficult problem in basic physics, and in the next few years, maybe we're ever able to solve it.
In the heart of the problem, there are two numbers, two very dangerous numbers.
They're the properties of the universe that we can measure, and they're very dangerous because if they were different, even in a little bit, then the universe as we know it wasn't there.
The first of these numbers have to do with the discovery that we've done a few kilometers from this room, in CET, the house of this machine. The biggest scientific device that we've ever been built by the human species, from the big fish.
HHHHHC is an axis of a 27 kilometers, and we put them close to the speed of light before he's talking them in two huge particles.
In the four in 2012, scientists in CERT have been invited to the world that they found a new basis that's created by the violence in LHC: the gas of food.
Now, if you look at the news at the same time, you'd see a lot of really excited scientists, and you're going to give you if you think we're going to be done as long as we're making a new particle.
Well, it's kind of true, but the gas food is special.
We've been so excited because we've put the gas provides the existence of a commercial energy.
Now, maybe you have problems to imagine a energy field, but we've all had one experience.
If you've ever been reduced by a piece of metaphor and the emotion that's made of power to the profit, then you've killed the effect of a girl.
And the gas is a little bit like a genetic field, except that it has a permanent value everywhere.
It's around us right now.
We can't see it or touch it, but if it wasn't there, we wouldn't exist.
The Gates gives you a piece of the basic principles that we might be made of.
If he wasn't here, these bubles didn't have a coffee, and no atomic could be produced and we didn't.
But there's something that's really crazy about the gas.
Technologists and Neanthropologists tell us that there's two neural situations, a little bit like a light switch.
It has to be or a bossy, so it has a tremendous value everywhere in space, or it has to be slow so that it has a simple value.
In these two cases, atoms can't be there, and so all of the interesting things that we see around us in the universe was not there.
In reality, the Gabby Derek is just a little bit, not zero, but a thousand times a trillion times from his unusual value, a little bit like a light of light that's going to happen just before his fabric situation.
And this valuable values.
If he was a little bit different, there was no physical structure for the universe.
So it's the first one of our curiosity numbers, the power of the Gates.
Pithetheists have spent decades to try to figure out why he has this weird number, and they've made the number of possible crimes.
They've got the signals that you're going to end like "Syria Morgan" or "other big dimensions."
I'm not going to get into these ideas, but the main key is this: if someone who's explained the value of the green line, then we need to see new particles that are created in LC with the GDP.
By now, with that, we haven't seen any of them.
But there's actually even a worse example of this kind of privacy concept of a certain number, and it's coming from the other side of the lab, the universe in huge spaces.
One of the most important results of Einstein's general theory of Einstein was the discovery that the universe started in the speed of space and time 13.8 billion years ago, the big bank.
Now, by the early German's advances of the big bank theory, the universe has evolved since the decline is reduced by spinning the spread.
But in 1998, astronomers did an amazing discovery that the expansion of the universe actually leaves.
The universe is getting bigger and faster and faster by extended forces that are called energy.
Now, every time you hear the word "zero" in physics, you need to be very sophisticated because it probably means we don't know what we're talking about.
And we don't know what it's energy, but the best eye is that it's the energy of the laser space itself, the normal sense of the universe.
Now, if you're using a good anthropologists and it's going to figure out how powerful energy energy should be, you get a simple result.
You find that this effective energy should be 10 in the 120 times more powerful than the value we've built in an astronomy.
It's one with 120 zeros after it.
It's a big number that's so exciting that it's impossible to understand it.
We use a lot of the word "astronomy" when we talk about big numbers.
Well, even it's not going to work here.
This number is larger than a number of astronomy.
It's big in a trillion trillion trillion trillion times from the number of atoms in the universe.
So it's a really bad pattern.
In fact, it's called the worst bottom of physics, and it's more than a theory.
If energy was even close to so powerful, then the universe was called back, stars and galaxies couldn't be created, and we wouldn't be here.
So that's the second of these conservative numbers, the power of energy, and to explain this requires even a higher level of confidence that we've seen in the right line.
But in contrast to the Gates, this book doesn't know.
The hope was that a whole combination of Einstein's organ theory, which is a theory of the universe at a big scale, with the anatomy, the theory of the universe in a small scale, maybe you're going to make the solution.
Einstein itself has led most of his daughter's favorite search for a unique theory of physics, and physicists went on it since.
One of the most important components of a unique theory is the mystery theory, and the main interview is, if you can focus on one of those basic particles that make our world, you would see that they're not actually spending on any of energy, but you're going to put a little bit of energy, with any kind of a little bit of a little bit different, like a musician.
So it's a pretty elegant way, almost an athetic way of looking at the world, but it's got one small problem.
It turns out that the mystery is not one theory, but a whole collection of theories.
In fact, there's 10 in a thousand different graphic categories of musical theories.
Each of the universe is different with different rules of physics.
Now, the cases say that it does the mystery of mystery isn't scientific.
You can't reduce the theory.
But others actually became this and said, well, maybe this invisible failure is the biggest concept of the mystery theory.
What if every 10 in a thousand different theories of the universe actually exist there's an iPhone that's in a big universe?
All of a sudden, we can understand the values that are built in a strange way of these two numbers.
In most of the local, energy is so powerful that the universe is called, or that the bridge is so scared that an atom can't stop.
We're living in one of those places in Molti to the universe that the two numbers really die.
We're living in the universe with the identical effect and the three doors. "
Now, this idea is very satellite, and it's easy to see why.
If we go to this thinking, then we'll never be able to answer the question, "Why is there something and nothing?"
In most of the way to go, there's nothing, and we're living in one of the other places there's laws of physics that allow them to be something.
Even worse, we can't look at the idea of slow down.
We can't go to these other lines, so there's no way to know whether they're there or not.
So we're instead of really extended.
It doesn't mean that political will not exist.
There's other plants, other stars, other symbols, so why don't you get other objects?
The problem is, it's not necessary that we've ever known in security.
Now, the idea of Soviet would exist for a while, but in the last few years, we started getting the first first first first personal arms that this thought might actually be really good for reality.
Despite the big lines of LHHC, what we've been looking there -- we've been looking at new theories of physics: a symmetric or other big dimensions that can explain the value of the machine and the nation of the GDP.
But despite the highest lines, the LHHHC discovered that a theater that's just a piece of autonomy that's just by the single boss.
My experiment was published from Mr. Mr. Man where we had to be on the doors to the notice that we didn't see a new physics.
The risks now can't be easier.
The summer, the LHHC started his second activity with almost a blue energy from what we've got in the first action.
What the physicist physicists wait for it is that they're training to new products, black holes, or maybe something's completely unpredictable from the violence in the big distance.
So, we can continue this long journey that started 100 years ago with Albert Einstein to a deeper understanding of nature.
But if, in three years, as LHHHHC will be again for a second long time, there's nothing out of the gas, so maybe it comes into a new generation of physics: a generation of the universe that we can't explain: We can't explain a generation where we're living in the universe, and we're going to be able to be able to
Thank you.
Thank you very much, in our Rossi Guini: My father, even if you said that science may not have some of the answers, I would like to ask you some questions and the first one is: build something like LLLC is a great project.
I just mentioned, when I got you, we live in a short world.
How do you think so long, remote yourself out of the generation when you're in something like this?
RB: I was very lucky that I joined a experiment that I worked on in LC in 2008, just when we looked at it, and there are people in my research team who worked on for three decades, all their career on one machine.
So I think our first conversations about LHC were in 1976, and you start design the machine without the technology you know you're going to have to be able to build it.
So the computing power wasn't in the beginning of the 1990s when the planning started in spinal.
One of the big adults that record these disciplines, they didn't think that there's a technology that can stand in the HHHC, so it was basically a fixed motion in the middle of the object with some farmers around the outside, but we've developed technology.
So you'd have to focus on people's innovation, which they're going to open up the problems, but you can go a decade or more on the screen.
BG: China was just invented two weeks ago that they were designed to build a big, two times the LHC.
I wondered how you and your colleagues get the news.
HK: The size is not all in our bodies. BG: I'm sure, I'm sure.
But it sounds funny for the particle physicists to say this.
But I mean, really, these are great news.
So building a machine like LHHC requires countries from the world to one of their resources.
No single country can't afford to build such a big machine, except that they can avoid huge possibilities of resources, power and money to build machines like this.
So it's just a good thing.
What they're really planning to do is build a machine that's going to explore the gas boss food and give us some of these new ideas, such as a symmetry, they're really there, so these are new news of physics, I think.
BG: Thank you. HK: Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Have you ever experienced a jihad and his daughter?
It's this strange sense that you get when a situation looks familiar.
It's in a restaurant that's happening just like you remember.
The world's driven like the heart that you've done as a geography, but the process can't be based on experiment because you've never been here before.
It's the first time you're going to go on, so what's going on?
We didn't have a single explanation to Jah and his daughter.
It's a short, and it's going on without the device, and it's made it a little impossible for a scientist to record and learn it.
Scientists can't just sit and wait it it will happen to them -- it can take years.
It doesn't have a physicist and studies, it's scared by the people wrote or feeling.
Because of interview, there's a fire of forests for the years.
Since Al Bersey, I've shown the print and so on as a French that means already, more than 40 theories were trying to explain the phenomenon.
And yet, recent advances in neurological and biological psychologist expect the sense of possibilities.
Let's go on three of the more common theories today, by using the restaurant to each of them.
The first one is a privilege.
We're going to have action.
Let's look at a road that's made out of tools.
When the situation comes from, your brain circumstances expect a big amount of information: the hands of the road, its prosperity to help, the smell of the accident.
Within a few seconds, this information is rising in the lights and down to one moment.
Most of the time, it's all extended in a solution.
However, the theory is made out of a jungle and it happens when there's a tiny car in information from one of these ways.
The difference while the motion causes the brain to discover the very best information as another event.
When he's playing a long time again, it feels like it's already happened because, in some sense, it happened.
Our next theory is going to wear in the past and not mistake.
It's the geographic theory, and it's used in the table to look at it.
When you're carrying the walls, it's a laughter memory out of the brain's face.
In the theory, it's because memories are challenged as biographic, and in the biographic, you just need one part to see the whole picture.
Your brain sees the map with one of the past, maybe from your grandfather.
However, instead of remember that you saw the example of your grandmother, your brain leaves the old memory without identify it.
It's leaving you time with dead, but without memory.
Even though you've never been in this restaurant, you've seen this map but you're not able to identify it.
Now, look at this switch.
Do you notice?
Our last theory is a weird, and it's going to argue that Duja and it's happening when our brain is chosen around a particular way that it's conducted by a specific object.
When the computer comes back, we feel that we've already been here.
For example, right now when you've been on the road and you don't notice the map or the patient's flow.
Despite your brain is recording everything in your slide, it's done it without the necessary awareness.
When you're at the end, you're going to get the computer back from the road, you think you've already been here because you've just been, you just don't notice.
While all of these three theories share a common features of jihad and his hand, no one of them has a safe source of the phenomenon.
Still, while we wait that researchers will find new ways to capture this professional moment, we can learn the moment in ourselves.
After all, most of our studies on a jihad and based on personal experiences, so why would they not be your?
The next time you get a jihad and his daughter, take a moment to think about it.
Would you be convinced?
Is there a familiar object?
Is your brain just responding to a look?
Or is it something else?
Have you ever notice how much the moon looks larger when it's close to the horizon than when it's high over our head?
So, you're not alone.
People will look at this strange effect since the previous inventions, and most of the prison, we still don't have a good explanation, but it's not because we haven't tried.
Some of the biggest brains in history -- Eric, and to my mom, Darwi, Text -- everybody was born with the problem and his convenient explanation.
One of the first ideas that came out was that the view of the moon in a really larger bicycle.
Maybe the Earth's atmosphere is used to be a huge woman, which leaves the moon when it's wind and land.
But this explanation doesn't work.
If at all, the transparency of the atmosphere will make a little bit smaller.
What's more, if you're actually measure the size of the moon that's seen in different pieces, it doesn't change at all.
But then, why does it still look bigger when it goes?
It has to be a kind of optimism.
The question is what?
One explanation is the Amazon Amazon, where two objects look different because of the beautiful size of objects that they're focused on.
Here's the two circuits in the middle of the size.
Perhaps the moon looks larger close to the horizon because it's near tiny trees, in the water, and it's growing up.
But when it's higher, it's surrounded by an enormous amount of night and it's going to see a city in equality.
Another option is the action of the accuracy.
If you've ever tried to paint in perspective, you know that as the bone is closer to the horizon, you need to draw it smaller.
Our brain is spontaneous about it by making objects closer to a larger horizon than they really look.
The two beautiful cooks in this painting are the same size, but the top looks larger because we're spending it into a far more diverse kind of bicycle.
So, between Panna to Bangangladesh, it looks like we've evolved the diversity of the moon, but unfortunately, there's some details that are driving the buildings.
First of all, if it was just the Olympic effect, then we would expect the motion of the moon to get rid of the planes that are high over the clouds because there's no smaller objects on the horizon.
But in fact, Texas and the oceans still argue that they see the motion of the moon.
On the other hand, if it was our brain to fix the size of the objects on the horizon, then we would expect that the moon of the moon would look inside the platform, where all the sky, including the horizon, you've got a slightly fun.
Scientists showed up, with this, which is not the case.
In order to contract the buildings more, it seems to be that the motor's completely disappeared if you're going to go and look at the wind between your legs.
Now, it's just getting ridiculous!
One of those things are very known as the regulation microbes.
Our brains are judged by objects and the size of their mind by the code of the eyes.
When you look at the horizon, our eyes are focused on a game so our brain knows that we look far away.
The moon looks like the size of the size.
Our brain thinks it's far far, what's right, so you're natural as the moon has to be big.
But when we look at the night, there's no eyes on what to focus on, then they're repeated to their age code, which is a few meters.
Now your brain thinks that the moon's closer than it really is, so you're a natural way that you're not as big as you thought it's.
Instead of explain why the moon looks so close to the horizon, the microcosmography shows what the moon looks smaller than that.
Don't you want?
Well, in fact, many scientists don't, so the argument of the moon't still continue and maybe we're still seeing it in the night.
Bruno Guini: Thank you very much for TED, the president.
Annano's going to need: Shake.
BG: Let's start with a numbers.
Over 2015, as a million refugees and the cities came to Europe from many countries, of course Syria and Iraq, but also from Afghanistan, in Bangladesh, Eric will look and more.
That would have two kinds of responses: the roads of the road and high sea.
I'd like we're talking about this subject is a short perspective and a long-term view.
And the first question is very simple: Why is the French movement so much in the last six months?
AG: I think what's going to change this fingerprint was the opposite of the hormones.
There was already a limited movement to Europe from Africa, Maria, but a movement that grew up in privacy, and all of a sudden happened in the first few months of 2015.
Why? I think there's three reasons, two long-term, and one that was the gas.
The two long-term length, in comfort, they're first, that teachers have less and less hope.
They're looking at their country and they don't have a lot of hope to go home, because there's no political solution, so there's no light at the top of the top.
Second, the living conditions of the Syrian in the countries are going to go through.
We recently found a study together with the World Bank, and we found that, 87 percent of the San Eden and 93 percent of the School in Luba live under the local poverty.
Just as a speech of kids go to school, the key data on a very hard condition.
It's not pretty much about it that they're refugees, unfortunately, that they've got all that they've got, they're also living in very extreme conditions.
And the third reason -- the gas -- it's that all of the international aid has been reduced.
The global food plan has gone, to the light of resources, to jump in 30 percent of the food support that it's providing to the refugees.
The refugees don't get to work, so they're completely depending on international support, and their feeling was "The world's going to take us."
And this reason I think was the gas.
All of a sudden, there was a leader, and people started to move in big numbers and if it was completely, I was in a similar situation and I was real enough to act this, I think I was actually working like them.
BG: But I think what's surprising is that a lot that didn't just happen in academic, but it wasn't supposed to be surprised.
The war in Syria is already about five years.
Three millions of refugees are in the cases, villages and cities around Syria.
You're yourself reminded because of this situation and because the implications of the fingerprint, for example, and yet Europe looks completely unknown.
AG: Well, you don't know because there was a piano, and when you're not ready to know in reality.
You're going to make decisions, because you don't have the ability to buy.
And it's also proposed that when the device started Europe remained and it wasn't able to generate a mechanism for the situation.
You're talking about a million people.
It sounds a huge number, but the Amazon population is about 550 million people, which means we're talking about one monitor on every 2,000 civil citizens.
It's just one monitor on every three white white.
And in fact? It's hard, of course, but it's about.
So the question is this: Is it a problem that you can deal with if -- and I'm going to talk about the most important step that it's treatment in the extended problems, but we're going to have the problems that's survived, and look at the phenomenon as it's -- if Europe would be able to connect together and to the policies of
But in order to happen, the states in the corruption of Europe have to take a lot of it, and then we're going to take a planetary on the patterns and all of the mechanisms, the refugees in all countries in Europe, based on all of the country.
If you're looking at a repeat program that's going to be trained by the president, always too little and too late, or by the contrast, too little and too late -- BG: And as a motor is.
AG: My country is supposed to take 4,000.
4,000 in Portutuco is a number of prize.
You can enjoy this number if you're actually working to manage it, but in the current conditions, the pressure is in the corruption of Europe, and then, when people go in this way as an artist through the nest countries, they come to Germany, in fact, and Olympics.
In the end, these are three countries that take the refugees.
The rest of Europe is looking at the side without doing a lot.
BG: I'm going to try to get three questions, and I'm going to play a little bit of cancer.
I'm going to try to ask them, and I'm going to ask them.
But I think these questions are very expensive in Europe, the first one, of course, is about numbers.
Do you say that 550 million is not a lot of it, but actually how many people in Europe can take?
AG: Well, it's a question that doesn't have an answer, because refugees are going to be limited.
Like, there's a thing called the international sentence, so in no situation you can say, "We're going to take 10,000 and that's it."
I'm going to remind you the next thing: In Turkey, at the beginning of the crisis, I remember one bridge said, "Turkey will be able to jump up to 100,000 pounds."
In Turkey, now as two million and three million thousand or a very similar number, if you're going to improve all the details.
So I don't think it's true to say how much we're ready to take.
What's the right to say is: How can we protect our international responsibility?
And Europe wasn't able to act like this, because Europe is reduced because there's no policies in the Olympic effect.
And that's true not just in the refugees; there are many other areas.
And let's be honest, this is the moment where we need more Europe and not less Europe.
But the more the public believe is less and less in the athetic institutions, it becomes much harder to convince the public that we need more Europe to solve these problems.
BG: We'll see that we're right now at the point where the refugees make political preference, especially policy.
We've seen it again at the end of the week in France and we've seen these presidents once in many countries: in Poland, in Frankland, in other countries, which are the public feelings of the numbers, and it's even though they don't mean in Soviet books.
Her government -- AG: But, if I get to me, about this point: What is East East see in the village where there's no galls?
What East Eastern sees, on TV, a few months ago, every day, when it's watching news, a lot of it comes without the case, it's going to go out to the road, and the photos on TV have killed hundreds of people or thousands of bad people.
And the thought no one's treated in this subject, that all of this movement is going on without a convenient.
A lot of thinking, "They come to my village."
So we've created this completely experience, that Europe is under a feedback and that we're going to change and all -- and the problem is that if it's a traffic, if people were getting rid, they're going to get rid, you get the gender and you're going to make a process of the conservation, and then you &ap
But, unfortunately, a lot of civil citizens, just because Europe wasn't able to do the work right.
BG: But there are villages in Germany with 300 local and 1,000 refugees.
So what's your field?
How do you think that the sky will come in?
AG: If there was a great manager of this situation and the right region of refugees all over Europe, then you'd always get the connection that I've mentioned: one monitor on every 2,000 local.
But because the situation doesn't expect to be the end of the results that we can't live with, and of course, if we talk about a village -- there's a lot of villages that have more curiosity than white bees; to live with it.
I don't ask that it would be in Europe, that in every asteroids will be more refugees than two.
I do ask that Europe will do the work right, and you could be able to play so that you can take people as many other people in the world have to do before.
BG: So, if you look at the world's situation, not just in Europe -- Applause) BG: Yeah!
But in BG: If you look at the situation in the world, not just in Europe, I know you can make a long list of countries that don't really take responsibility, but I'm more interested in the other side -- is there somebody who works when it works?
AG: Well, as 86 percent of the refugees in the world are in developing countries.
And if you look at countries like Ethiopia -- Ethiopia is more than 6,000 pounds.
All the boundaries in open ethics.
And they've got this policy policy that they call people people, "which is all refugees.
They're chocolate in South Scientists, hormones and ants.
They're chocolate from all of them.
They're cartoons.
And also, in general, African countries are very true to refugees that come to them, and I would say that in the Middle East and Asia, we see a genetic state of open boundaries.
Now we're going to take a little bit of problems with the situation in Syria, because the situation in Syria has evolved into a hard crisis, but the truth is that for a long time, all the boundaries in the Middle East were open.
The truth is that the Afghanistan, the boundaries of South and Iran were open, and the same period that six million genes came.
So I would say that even today, the mammoth in the developing world is the countries of open boundaries.
The magazine in the developing world is that these questions will become more complex and more complex, especially when the audience thought, there's a variety of diverse on the gene on one side and death about security -- that those are fabric of innovation -- the other side.
BG: We're going to go back to this issue, you're reducing the wall in the box and the matters of the global food program.
The summer is based on the general instrument of organizations that work in these areas.
Now when the world looks like the world woke up, do you get a larger, or the conditions remain when they were?
AG: We get more support.
I'd say we're focusing on the violence of a year.
We've been a lot worse at the end of the summer.
But it's completely unclear that it's not enough to provide the refugees and the states that take them.
And here we've got a very basic series of the tricks, the training, the apartments in the development and an international collaboration that's so exposed.
For instance, Boldan are the countries of income income.
Because they're naturally income countries, they can't get the loads or they're driving from the World Bank.
Now, in our days there's no idea, because they're telling positive choices in the world.
They're choosing millions of refugees, and if they're yes, they're pretty profound of stability in the region, with all the two seconds that are being scared from the room, and they're going to be the first line of our collective security.
So there's no idea that these countries are not the first time in the policy of international collaboration.
And they're not.
And it's not just that the refugees live in very hard conditions in these countries, but the local communities are also suffering, because the sugar goes down, because it's going to be on the bone, because the primary and the primary and the prices have gone.
And also, of course, if you look at the situation today, about the intuitive in these countries, it's obviously, that the most powerful groups in the population are more and more and more because of the crisis that's built.
BG: Who's supposed to provide this support?
The support of a country, international organizations, the Iranian Islamic?
Who's supposed to make this support?
AG: We need to one of the efforts.
It's obvious that cooperation has been exposed.
It's obvious that cultural cooperation is exposed.
It's obvious that international institutions need to be brilliant to have a lot of investment in the developing countries.
We need to move all the tools and understand that today, in situations that are used for a long time, at a moment, there's no idea in the understanding of humanitarian aid to development or development.
It's because you're talking about children in schools, you're talking about health, you're talking about creativity with an engagement.
You're talking about things that require a long-term collection, open collection and not just a humanitarian aid aid.
BG: I want to get the response to something that's happening in the paper.
It's the proof of of the leadership in the French French for the United States -- NASA.
And he said the next thing.
It's not, it's about it. The interesting things.
I'm a text: "I'm going to call the spontaneous piece of Muslims to the United States, until our adults will understand what's happening."
How do you respond to this artist?
AG: Well, it's not just a child's training.
We've seen some cases around the world of people with political responsibility that say, for example, there's no Muslims of Muslims.
And the reason for this is that they think that these things are, they're protecting their own policy.
I worked in her government.
I believe a lot of government's reduction to reduce their own policy and their citizens.
But if you say, things like this, in the United States or in any athetic country, "We're going to train our ancestors in Muslims," The things you say is the best event to the Darwin.
Because what you're saying is -- Applause) The things you're going to be heard by all the Muslims in your country, and they're going to put the way to the Nigerian into the mechanisms that's using technology, diabeta, al-A-K-A-Center, and all of these organizations are able to go into our companies.
It's actually to tell them, "You're right, we're going to go."
So of course, it creates in companies that are cultural, cultural, cultural, cultural, it creates a situation in which, much easier to do with these text organizations to be effectively effectively effectively effective people to operate in states in countries where these are true.
BG: Is the last transparency in France and the response to them do your job to get more?
AG: No longer.
BG: What's obvious?
AG: In a sense that many people have the first response to these strategies is: to move all of the boundaries -- without understanding the speech problem in Europe is a lot of local production.
There are thousands of thousands of physicians in Syria and Iraq, so it's not a problem that's only developed by the way that teachers come into Europe.
And I've got to say, I'm convinced that the risk that's found, I believe, was scared by the person who's laughing -- BG: himself, yes.
AG: [I believe] it was in a car, because some of the strategy of diabetes is against refugees, they see people who need to be part of the walls that have to be part of the wheelchair.
And I think it's part of the strategy of worry by getting Europe to respond, to reduce her boundaries to Muslims, to develop trains in Europe in Europe, and so to help action action.
And I've been my profound is that it wasn't the simple movement that was the privilege of speech.
I think, as I've said, in fact, in fact, the speech in Europe today is a local product for the global problem that we're facing, and what we need is to prove that these organizations are wrong, by which we're going to get a effectively effective of this world.
And another thing I believe in is that, in a lot, we're paying today in Europe on models that don't work in the '60s, the' 70s and's's's's' 70s, and's what I believe in many years, for example,
And this insurance, often as an airport, which is in the other generation is a lot of failure in policy policy, as a failure in policy that has to invest in a lot more so that people can live together and do it.
I think it's clear.
I think it's obvious that all companies will be cultural, cultural, cultural, cultural, cultural cultural, in the future.
Let's try and avoid it, I think, will be impossible.
And I'm going to say that's a good thing that's going to be, but I'm also familiar with it, so companies have a very big investment in social media within the different societies.
And Europe, very much, it's been in this investment in the last few decades.
BG: A question: You're going to end your role at the end of the year, after 10 years in the job.
If you look back on the year 2005, when you go to your office for the first time, what does you see?
AG: Well, look, in 2005, we've come back to a million people to go back to the security and respect, because the projects were going on.
Last year, we went to 124,000.
In 2005, there were 38 million people in the world's consequences.
Today, there are more than 60 million pounds.
At the same time, there were recently, some projects that were evolved.
Now, we're seeing a function of new projects and the ancient projects have never come from: Afghanistan, Sweden, the democracy of Canada.
It's clear that the world's more dangerous than it was.
It's obviously, the ability of the international community to prevent projects and reduce them in time, it's unfortunately, much worse than 10 years ago.
There's no forces in the world, there's no mechanisms of a global government that works, which means we live in a situation that's kind of extended and worthy about the future tend to connection, and as a result more and more people suffer, these are the people who become a result of the projects.
BG: It's a restaurant in the American politics that the president reduced the room for the last time, it's leaving on the table with a restaurant with his parents to go into a few hours later.
If you'd have to write a surprise like this to come up with you, you've got a graph of Sandy, what would you write?
AG: Well, I don't think I would write something.
You know, one of the worst things when a man comes out of the office is to try and get the driver in the back, which is always saying to the new fish to do.
So that, I wouldn't do.
If I had to say something, I'd say, "It's going to be yourself, and it's a good woman you could."
BG: Hang, thank you for the work you do.
Thank you for TED.
Thank you.
What is love?
Research, but, what?
What is love?
Where does it work?
There's a bone?
Social truth?
Don't you?
Dr.'s a bridge to all the corruption?
Good?
Social phenomenon?
The answers aren't missing.
Some of them are scared.
It's about it.
It's all you need.
It's all there.
All of these, their mother, they're equality, ways to define it with the president, by believe it's more important than all the things, but the nation?
Of course, let's think more important than your age accident, but is it more important than a box?
Or expectations?
Or does a special train in in us?
It doesn't matter what your answer is, you're just taking it, you don't define it.
Another challenge in love is that often we're trying to do it as we're going to be able to do it in our time or so on.
You'd agree about someone who had a big blogging in Blottery to define the message of money?
Or, I don't know, you're going to ask the person to define them dogs while it's reduced them?
Or is the French of love not like a blog?
Did rules not like a fire of dogs?
The bad equations?
This is my point.
I don't think true because I'm love, so wonder!
We're going to take a step back, or a profession happened, doesn't matter what, love is real, the most powerful issue that you think about.
And despite hundreds of years of Obama, it's still invented us.
There's these who say it's a sense, a sophisticated emotion, a sense of someone who's ever seen as a death in the past.
But emotions are magnitude, they're not a very powerful basis for definition.
Sometimes you ask the person you love.
In addition, in your life, you're the emotion of emotions like these in the past, in a kind of an anthropy.
Your relationships with your family designs your relationships with switch.
And your love to your partner can be a dynamic system of itself, healthy, or completely strange, with your parents and your brother.
Let's also be a system of behavior that we're listening to emotions to the president of the president of presidents, beside, bicycles, dancing, bring children to the world, or just sex.
But these love effects can be effective or cultural actions.
You can love or be someone who can't bring children or not want, who's left in Sweden, but also in Shakin, who's on culture where people don't come to the details in the way we think about Diss, or who don't want to get out of the bus.
But if love is something that we can define, then how can it be meaningful for so many people?
So, maybe the love is just in your head, a personal mystery that's evolved through your bones and a natural gas, natural gas in your nervous system.
Maybe these genes are rich.
Perhaps love is an investment or a perception of the person, just like a person can be a car for them.
I don't mean, to be in the wind like a coffee.
From the evidence is that chemical materials in your brain that come out by another person can make you develop a foot to the same person.
The person's succeeded to provide physics, and you want more.
But then sometimes, look or surprise, you're alone.
It's the love of love, it's called, from the chimpanzee.
What happened?
Does the person develop facts or come to the edge?
Why do you like to stay from each other over their lives?
Maybe to create new life.
Maybe let's just love is just a optimistic method of DNA to treat itself.
There's evolutionary arguments about all human behavior, from the way we're bringing ourselves into potential, by how we're looking at each other.
So, there's the argument that the feeling you're talking about is just a biological way to make you continue our species.
The nature in the song you're going to be part of the signals, just like it's causing customers to move on the plants, and biology goes on.
But is it all that love is?
Or, maybe worse, is it just a structure, somehow an enormous idea that we're all doing it to try to live in a sense of a goal?
Maybe it's a structure, but let's be more accurate about what a structure is because love is built out of our reality: our experiences, emotions, the physical expectations, our lives.
And you can see this structure through intuitive, scientific, emotional, historical, private, or just personal.
If you don't have two people who recognize it, you also love two people's not the same thing.
So, in every relationship of love, there's a lot about what to talk and I'm going to be open to this, or the connection probably doesn't survive.
Let's always talk to the idea and of course, in the process of building.
So if we can't define it is a good symbol.
It means we're all still doing it.
Wait, I didn't mean what I did.
Imagine two people are prepared to music.
What's the risks that they're listening to the same level of cities exactly?
It's probably very low.
After all, every single one has another in music.
Now, what's the risks that your body has to have the same medical care like another person's body?
Even lower.
When we move our lives, every one of us will have different needs to our health.
Scientists and see studies all the time new ways to make medicine more private.
One way they're doing this is by a stem cells research.
Cyrus cells are not testing, which means they're not going to work in some work.
While the skin cells respond to the body, muscle cells depend, and it's self-sending signals, stem cells don't have a specific structure or action.
The stem cells have the potential to become any kind of cell in your body.
Your body uses stem cells to replace cells that laws when they die.
For example, you're completely repeating the exception of every four days.
Social stem cells under your fingerprint represents these cells when they get.
Scientists hope stem cells will be used to create personal health care in which we can replace your body parts with, well, some of your body body.
Social stem cells work hard to find ways to use stem cells to create new tissues to replace this kind of organisms that's made out of a disease or a disease.
It's used stem stem cells to decide a body tissue is called a radical medicine.
For example, scientists are using stem cells to treat patients with blood diseases like a cell.
Torma is a kind of cancer that affects your bone.
It's the bone of the object, it's a cartoon in your bone that's created cells.
In Google, some of your cells in your bone is growing in a unfamous way, and you put the healthy cells that make your blood cells.
A few categories can get stem cells.
These new stem cells have created the blood cells that require the patient's body.
There's actually a lot of stem cells that scientists can use them to medical and research.
Social stem cells or specific stem cells are in small states in most of your body.
Social stem cells decide the cells that are there in your organs when they're caused and die.
Cyrus cells are created from liberal lions that have been exposed by patients from fingerprinting.
In contrast to specific stem cells, stem stem cells are rapid.
It means they can grow any kind of tissue in the body.
A third kind of stem stem cells is called Palestinian cells.
It's a skin cells, smoke or others who know that we've been able to get rid of like fossil stem cells.
Like deforestation cells, they're also, they can become any kind of cell in the body.
While scientists and see hope to use these kinds of stem cells to create new patterns of your body, they can also be used in stem cells to help understand how the body works.
Scientists can watch stem stem cells evolve to understand the mechanism that the body uses it to create new tissues in a normal way.
Scientists hope that with more research, they can't just develop organisms that slide in your body, but also understand better how our body works, also when it's healthy and it's not.
Today, more than half of the people in the world live in urban areas.
By the middle of the century, it will grow up to 70 percent.
But until 100 years ago, just two of 10 people were living in the city, and before that, it was even less.
How did we go to such a big amount of blind, and what does it mean about the future?
In the early days of human beings, people were hungry to judges, who were asked for most of the place to a search place for food.
But about 10,000 years ago, our ancestors began to learn the secret of the Social and early agriculture.
For the first time, people can grow food instead of looking at it, and it was led to the development of fibers for the first time in history.
"Why are you just stuck into the edge?"
You ask. Well, at the beginning, the villages still had to go through a few years when the earth came up.
It was just with the progress of techniques like the Kenya and the Turkey was about 5,000 years ago that people could be on a strength of a strength and a long-term food, which is the prosperity of fabric.
And with food emissions that these techniques were created, it wasn't the worse that everyone would be farmers.
It's possible to open up the development of other business, and Derek, cities.
With cities that make food emissions, as well as tools, artists, and other forms, there was now an opportunity to trade and communities in long spaces.
And when the trade that's killed, it's also the technologies that they've made it, like crops, roads, roads, and ants.
Of course, these things were even more work to build and prove them, so more people were conducted from the village to cities when more jobs and opportunities became president.
If you think modern cities are previous, you may have been surprised to know that in a few cities in 2000 before the apartment was almost a population of this day in San Francisco or French.
One reason for this was that transition was not a profound, so everything had to be in the wall, including a few parts of sophisticated water that were there.
And the city of the city was more limited by the need to play against transparency.
The Rocial Egypt was able to develop infrastructure to move on these limits, but except of it, modern cities like we know them, they didn't actually exist to the beginning of the industrial revolution, when new technologies were made in a big rate and enabled to a larger and much larger rate, transformation, and reference, like boundary networks, too.
So, what is the future of cities?
The global population is now more than seven billion and productive that it will grow 10 billion.
Most of the tumor will happen in the urban areas of the world's poor countries.
So, but cities will have to change the tumor?
First of all, the world has to find ways to provide enough food, intuition, and education for all people.
Second, the tumor has to happen in a way that doesn't move in the background that represents the lights and the services that support the human population.
A food creation may be able to get rid of anthropologists and roads, grogen genes, or ridiculous states in cities, while electricity will come more and more than a range of regular energy.
Instead of family families, more areas are going to build an analogy.
It may look like buildings that feed everything that people need to live today, as well as small cities, which represent their products that are focused on sustainable and sky products.
The future of ridiculous cities, you can change, and I've been creative, and there's no more about a single industry, but it's about a global world and more critical world.
What if you could see one color?
Imagine, for example, you could only see red things and everything else was completely invisible to you.
It turns out, you live your life all the time because your eyes can only see a tiny part of the unfortunately of the light.
Other types of light around us are all the time, but they're invisible to the human eye, a radio that's based on you, to the two of the physicians who use them to see into your body, to the feedback that's looking at you all the food.
To understand how all of these can be light, we're going to have to know something or two of this is light.
Obviously, it's an electronic radiation that works as well as proteins and proteins.
Paul light is like waves in the ocean.
There's very high and small circumstances, cells that do on each other after the other, and it's just rolling too long.
The size of the wheel is called the limit, and how much fun is called the decline.
Imagine you're on a poem in the ocean, that's on the top and down when the cells go.
If you go to the same day there's a long leg, they're going to give you to the telescope just every time, or in a very low regulation.
If you go, instead, there's a short foot, they're going to be close to each other, and you're going to take it up and down a lot more coffee, in high prices.
Other kinds of light is everyone's cells, they just have organisms and different cultures.
If you know the laser or the diversity of light, you can choose his energy.
Life roads have a low energy, while you're going to get high energy.
It's easy to remember if you think about being in the boat.
If you've been spending on a day with short and motivations, you'd probably be at high energy in yourself, you'd have to keep things that wouldn't be beautiful.
But dogs with big circumstances, you're going to roll with it, moves, low energy.
The energy of light tells us how it's going to come up with material, for example, the cells in our eyes.
When we see, it's because the light energy's engaged in our eyes that's called retina.
Our infrastructure is only used to light in a very production of energy, and that's how we call this light light looks.
Within the infrastructure, there's a unique collapse that's called refugees and plants.
It's based on the speed, so we know how light has.
The lines are responsible for some color of light, we see because different patterns are sensitive to different light energy.
Some more sensitive lines to light with long-term and low energy, and other cartoons are harder to short, with high energy.
When light fits in our eyes, the relative amount of energy that every airplane is dealing into the brain that's active colors.
The network that we're chocolate is actually light looks at its energy room.
On one side of the web, we see the light with a low energy, and on the other side with the high energy we see blue.
If light comes from us that we have our creative energy can't measure, we can't see it.
It's a light with too short or too high energy that's going to spread in the eye before it can even go to the bottom, and light with too long patients don't have enough energy to draw the restaurant at all.
The only thing that's doing one kind of light into different than that's need.
The radio has a long leg, while the Texas has a short period.
And light looks, the kind of light that we actually see, is somewhere in the center.
Even though our eyes can't take light out of the surface of the surface, we can build special organisms that are made by these light, like a little bit of digital eyes.
With these devices, we can measure the light that we find, even though we can't see it ourselves.
So, take a back, and think about it for a moment.
Even though they look different, the heat and the feeling of a space is the same to the sun that goes on you on a beautiful day, and the same to the alcohol that you're released from the gene to protect yourself from its own, and the same thing to your television, to your radio.
Now, these examples are all things about the planet, things that you can experience in your life today, but there's something even more amazing.
Our universe represents the whole range of light, it's also.
When you think about the night, you're probably thinking about being able to see the stars in your eyes, but it's just the light that you know it's just a tiny part of the light.
If we were to invent the universe and we could only see light looks, it was like we had just one cat -- pretty sad.
In order to see the universe in all of his way, we need the right eyes, and it means using special customers that can help us see beyond the previous light.
You've probably heard about the Amazon Telescope, and you've seen his beautiful photos that were taken in the light looks and travel.
But maybe you don't know that there's almost 20 telescopes in the road, a task that can be one of them to see some of the wrong light.
With the telescopes that are our intuitive eyes, also in space and on Earth, we can see some amazing things.
And the most cool thing, doesn't matter the limit or the energy, the light that we see in the mirror is the same thing like the light that we can experience and learn here in the Earth.
So, because we know the physics of how the NASA, Alexander, or a mammogram is working here, we can learn the light of stars or galaxies or galaxies and we know what kind of stuff is there.
So, when we continue in our lives today, think beyond what your eyes can see or not.
It's just a little bit of a little bit about nature can help you understand the whole step around you all the time.
In 1977, the French Ford Ford thought that if you look at the bacteria and then you go, it's going to stop in a second.
In this time, it's going to be less than a single atmosphere.
The same thing is true and many other microbes.
It's about it that they're really small.
The microscope creates a world that helps us, there's a half feet of water, it's a huge effort.
But why is it so important to live?
What makes the world of an arm so different in the identity of the satellite?
In order to understand, we need to cure the physics of dinosaurs.
Here's a way to think about it.
Imagine you're stuck in the wall.
It's you and a big amount of water molecules.
Social molecules you have in a thousand trillion trillion trillion to one.
So, to push through your giant body is easy, but if you were really small, say you'd be about the size of water molecules, all of a sudden, it's like the conversations of people.
Instead of just sending through the small molecules, the arms, now every molecule is like another person you need to push to go to somewhere.
In 1883, the physicist Obvian Obama was born a number of spread that could expect how dinosaurs were.
It's called the Street Street, and it's depending on simple machines like the bacterial size, from its speed, and the taxes, or the taxes, or the stairs.
What it means is that creatures are very different from very different areas.
For instance, because of his huge size, a satellite represents the world of the great Nethers.
If he put his chicken once, the cell can move forward a huge distance.
While a living in the world of a number of Nazis born.
If a fire is going to stop a kitchen, it's not going to be a single atom.
To imagine how it's going to feel a privilege, you need to bring yourself down to a number of Ricis born.
Imagine yourself in the atmosphere of a fire with your arms are prepared to look like the printing of the argument, and you'll have a pretty good idea of what the arm's dealing with.
So, how can microbes get to someone?
Well, many wouldn't go to conversations at all.
They're just going to be able to join them.
It's something like a nervous nerve that's waiting under a mammogram will grow back.
But a lot of microbial microbes, and here's where they're going to get their fantasies.
One trick in which they use is to change their judgment form.
By changing their judgment to create more residents in a period than the help, fear organisms like a series of success to move through a audience of water molecules.
But there's even more geographic way that Asia came in in North Korea.
Instead of trying to communicate their judgment back, they're spending them like a coffee coffee.
It's just like a coffee that's accumulated with a coffee from a five-hicle motion to a blueprint, these little creatures are complicated their lesion to push themselves forward in the world where water feels safe like a beach.
Other strategies are even more strange.
How many bacteria take the method of Amazon.
They're using the concept of perception to keep themselves forward.
They can even use the bus as a crisis and get themselves forward.
Others use chemical engineering.
FL's Fields only live in the motor and the extinction of our cancer.
It's released as a tool that's the support of the restaurant, which enables it through the wall.
Maybe it's not surprising that these society's responsible to the Kenyan.
So, when you look really close in our body and the world around us, you can see all kinds of tiny creatures that find ways to move in a right situation.
Without all of these characters, bacteria never would find their own corner, and they would never come to their own functions, which means you would never get a camp, but you'd never be born in the head.
For many, one of the most cool things in "The France games" is that dogs of dogs and cartoons have a real language from them.
And the dopamine came right after the real language that my father was talking about "Owitter," which was certainly the father's father when to Chicago from "a journey between stars," there was a language that has been a language for them.
Since 1979, and let's not forget the transparency of the Atlantic's "Turkey", "especially because it was the extinction of the Pennestina's prosperity."
"Nananang" is a creation of a weird language.
They're more local as the Bay School and they're not just a collection of Sang's collection like the Stanford Street in the British School in the Cambridge, where "Grand" is not just a friend. "
What makes "Nanang" for real language is not the number of words that have.
It's helping, of course, there's a lot of words.
And Kiki has thousands of words.
My father started with 1,500 words.
Fathers in the Internet books have created more.
But you can see the difference between just producing words, and what makes a female language, from the end of how Twitlin has a future, "Canada," with some thousands of words.
After all, you can put 500,000 words in Russian and still don't succeeding a sentence.
A four-year-old boy will talk about you in the cases.
Because you have to know how to feed the words together.
I mean, in real language, there's a test.
For the slide there.
In English, to become a time, we've been able to make musicians. "
Women, I'm going to be saved.
In the slide, to contract that and that's a God.
The real languages also change over the years.
There's no identities today why there were thousands of years ago.
When people talk, they're pushing new strings, and they're old, they're doing mistakes, and creativity.
Today, people say, "Let's give us the daily fight."
In the ancient English, they'd say, "Uganda," "in UNajaka," and you're going to see, "Oh, you're going to have a daily Pig."
Things also change in Canada. "
Titlin is a ancient version of ancient and new news of alphase.
When the first thousands of people got in "Koyan," in their new language, the word to people was "Kandy," but in the language of one of the groups that were going on, Tesli, "and we're going to be pretty proud, when it became a click.
And just like real languages, "Canada" like a thousand pounds.
When the Romans were invited to Titan around Europe, born French and Italian and Italian.
When groups go to different places, in their way of connecting is changing, just like anything else in them.
So, the Missian word at the top was a human, but in French, it was an artist at a time in Spanish, it was going to be out of us.
Tollin made sure that I would do the same thing.
While the original word of Kennedy was Penni in the Talk, in the Olympic, which was spread in the neighborhood, it was Kennedy when he died.
The Social Sylin was invented for most of it is Kenyan and Syrian, and their words are different in the same way the French and different Science.
In Kenya, it's a secret in Nigerian, it's kind of like this.
And as you know, real languages are curious.
It's because they're changing, and changes tend to act against the room, just like in a hotel or a books.
Social languages never makes sense.
It's the reason that the Volkin has a lot of magnitude.
A lot of techniques in forms that you just need to know.
Take the word "know."
In the past, it's "you know," that's not a crisis by any of the rules in English.
We, well.
In the slide, "You know," it's Asia, but "know, it's Canada.
We, well.
The truth is, although, the slide is more like a real language than a language.
Last was a station for Titlin and not trying to create something that people could really talk.
Many of the philosopher in the movie "Turns" talk has been invented since Titler's posters of a thousand pounds in a restaurant on what Titan was in Southern.
It's the best we can do for a thousand because there's not really thousands of around us to talk it.
But the Canada's "modern" takes another step.
Darwi, Nandy and Centrinan are enough to really talk about them.
Here's a transformation of "Linkin", although they're going to take it to the patient's face, the strange thing that's in the back of your gene.
Remember or not, in fact, it's a lot of transparency around the world, like the Timbo.
Instead, the security in the slide is much more easier.
So, let's go to a decade from this show to Cananada, "in East and the three" Canada, "the other one we've been talking to a dog of a dog in the four" Canada: "Mary!"
"The Jim!"
In my father, "There's Amy!"
"Chile!"
And "Look!"
In 2008, a prison table, 17 years old, had been on a Monico from Milliams to South Africa.
And while in the table there was the most young gene, it wasn't alone.
Don't have been able to raise over 24 young men, who are in the early 20s and early 20s, and they're very active in social platform as a Facebook.
With the Internet and other technologies, they've changed our lives today today, but they've also changed sense, radiation and the previous lines of projects today.
What about the connections between Twitter, Google and magazines that go for democracy?
These numbers represent my view of Google's microbes, collective collection of the only digital boundaries that were happy and could use them to communicate with each other, to get out of the world and reduce the pressure of what's happening in their country.
Today, projects are actually unlimited.
If there's boundaries today, they're connected by digital, not the physical geography.
And it's all of this has and the universe of power there for inevitable players, private people and private organizations have the solution about interpretation and privacy agencies.
And it's because, in a generation of digital project, there's a feedback in which new technologies, platforms like these I mentioned, and these are more than generations, they can be organisms, learn, and discover by art and organizations faster than governments can respond.
To understand the rate that our governments think about it, I'd like to go to something called the World Iraq, where every year the National Institute of the United States is looking at the global and global warming, and that means, "These are the ones, these are the details, and that's what we're doing."
In 2007, it wasn't at all the way to have a foreign security.
It took until 2011, when it got at the end, there are other things, like a African trade in drugs that took previous.
In 2012, it turns out, still behind things like autism and protein.
In 2013, it became the central threat, in 2014 and the future would look at the eye.
What things like these are showing us is that there's an invisible insurance today from the government to come and learn in digital project, where projects can be unusual, unfortunately, even unprecedented.
And the project is not just on the web or not, as we see with traffic disorder, but it's also going to the other direction.
We all know about the previous events that happened in France of this year with the Syrians on Charlie Aley.
What's a single morning or a small group of human beings have done was to go into social media that so many of us took some of them.
[] Jeope].
In Facebook, on Twitter, in Google, all of the places where millions of people, including me, talking about the events and images like this, the emotional picture of a baby with "Jeope" on the hand.
And it became a weapon.
What the hackers did was turn the picture into a weapon, where victims didn't expect, like all of us in these conversations, saw the picture, but it was a fabric.
And so when you've seen this picture, it's reduced to your system.
It took six days to France Center from the world Royra.
The discovery between physical spaces and digital spaces today has an extinction, where we've got unplaces like these in Prize together with local hackers.
And it's also going to the other direction, with Ghanus.
We're seeing a local category of teenagers, which can then reduce global transparency to unusual traits.
With all of this, we see there's a new battle in the 21st century that's on, and governments don't necessarily take part.
So in another case, Anonymous against Los Angeles.
At the beginning of September 2011 in Mexico, Los Angeles, one of the most powerful cartoons, you'll take two adults with a trick who said, "That's what's going to happen to all the Internet."
Second week later, they've lost the head of a young girl.
They've mentioned Iraq, put it on her computer with a similar surprise.
And take the digital corruption because the government can't even understand what's going on or act, Anonymous, a group that may not be reduced to the most positive power in the world, it doesn't work, but in a threat to information.
In social media, they said, "We're going to get information that's transparency, and they're going to be reduced with the bank."
And this project, Los Titus Ford said, "We're going to run 10 people on any information you're going to survive."
And that's how it's called because it's going to become too happy to continue.
But what was powerful about it was that people were anonymous, not a physical goal, not the military, not politicians, could get a deep fear to notice one of the most powerful organizations in the world.
And so we're living in a generation that's based on the speech of the past in a project, in the way we're moving, in motivation behind the transparency, tools and techniques that are used, and some of them evolve.
And the question is still left: What's individual, organizations and governments can do?
In the answer to these questions, it begins in particular, and I think it's a privilege for the future is the answer.
These people in the relationships that came up to the web, we can do it with a magnitude for the future.
People have more power than ever to affect national security and international security.
And we can create the relationship to these animals on the web and reduce it, we can support and reduce the next generations of hackers, like me, instead of saying, "You can be extended or to join NSA."
It changes today.
And it's not just a single people -- it's organizations, even companies.
They have the solution that they can operate more boundaries, more effective and faster than governments can, and there's a set of chimps here.
It's sophisticated and value to show as species in digital generation, and it's just going to be more in generations that are going to come.
But we can't still move from the government, because Asia we're a collective action to keep us safe.
But we see where it brought us until now, where there's no capacity to fit and learn in digital project, where in the highest levels of the gene, the mayor CIA, the bridge of the gender, they say, "The Arabic France is happening." "" ""
But it just makes us more sophisticated, not more safe.
By unfortunately, it's not a procedure for the best of my grandfather's grandfather and Hong Mary, obviously, GCHA and NSA can take a look at you.
But it doesn't mean they're the only ones that can.
They're cheap, even anxiety.
The technical ability goes around the world, and people and small groups have the solution.
So today it could be just the NSA and the GCA, but who would argue that the Chinese wouldn't find the price?
Or in another generation, even a child in the U.K.?
And so I would say it's not what governments can do, it's that they're not.
The governments today need to give up the power and control to help us do more safe.
Wilk on a remote corner and Hong and a place to fix these groups say, yes, they can't take it after us, but also not the Chinese or this asteroid in a generation.
And governments to technology like a button and Titchen says to give up control, but it means that you're evolved, you're transparency, each of the Internet, in countries like Kenyan, Iran and China, can sell their capacity, their products, in the global market, but more important to sell their ideas, show us what's happening in their
And so it has to be unscary, it has to inspire those governments that are inspired for civil rights, free and democracy in the big states of the century, which is the first time in human history, we have a technical opportunity to become a billion people around the world that we could ever have before in human history.
It needs to inspire.
Thank you.
A lot of elements of traditional culture, like food, and possibilities, are known in the world.
Scott, a kind of Central School, maybe not obviously in the West, but it's evolved for 400 years and yet it's effective and popular to the day.
The word's cartoons find out of the beautiful word, which means out of Nigeria or Bay.
His history at the beginning of the 19th century in Chicago, where a month of a month called Tasmanian, was using the river of the river to do what to do with unusual code code, which found its profound prosthetic prosthetic prosperity as well.
In other farmers, they started to affect the same style, and the cartoons did history as the first dramatic phenomenon of Japan that's known to the simple person.
By looking at Iraq, or Chicago, and the fingers are instead of training and code in the history of historical events and life today instead of faces with fossil, coffee itself in the top of the top atmosphere that's going to be known as an accident and an academic discovery of intervention over the country.
At the beginning of the dance is only done by women and they've been treated to most of the cockroads.
It's very quickly, it's opened up to the street, and it became a normal attitude in my house, and it's going to have audience from all of the social actions.
At this point, Okraki was also used when Guines were not just to show their service and their dance, but also to publish their body to potential customers.
It's not a toxic category in the 169, led to the phenomenon of Waki with young women when actors.
But when it's also unprecedented, it's been beyond the dinosaurs, where men's influenced, what you need to wear complex and improvement to those who have emotional characteristics, or Okena.
The government's experiences to control the boss don't care about the species or the age of the surprises.
The military group of Tokokota, or at the end, was affected by ideas of convenience and administration a lot of functions on actions, a weapon to the stage, and the unemployment of the top.
At the same time, coffee became a very bridge with the effect of Banko, a complex form of a bicycle in the street.
In those effects, the only dance of dance, which was once a fantasy, has evolved to this building of five systems that were based on parts of the common philosophy.
Before 1868, then we're going to get a cosmogram and the Freeji repeat back to Sington, Japan that's been conducted to measure other countries, or Scoto.
And that's why, the development of power is particularly powerful by local effects.
But even before the box, doctors of doctors, like Callota, we were interested and got a beautiful art, like the dozens of trees, as well as animals.
After 1868, other people like Viladin and your body and the Berkeley Berkeley started to take a cool effect in their work, while a cartoon itself has gone through many changes and experiments to fit itself into the modern age.
Like other traditional art generations, conservative cockroaches in popular war in the second world.
But artists of artists like the Bay Tiji Timbi led the animal a little bit later.
Actually, cartoons even look at the kind of popular generation between the American forces that were built in Japan although the American federal on beautiful traditions.
Today, cartoons are still living as an intuitive part of the rich cultural cultural network, and you're looking at its effect beyond the television, to prevent, and to prevent.
The art form of art that started with autonomy goes to the audience with the complexity of the players, the ridiculous and the streets in the states, and the way that you can't expect the stories of the stories that make on the stage.
Almost you don't hear about Nigeria, we've been hearing out of the region of the region, but anybody who's trying to understand life on the planet has to see how we've been looking at these ideas: the Earth, life, and the understanding.
There's been born in Street in 168 in Bennedy, a boy of a chicken, he was a child who was born from the schools from a map.
It's survival to cut body as an anatomist, learning different organisms.
He's found a transformation in the skin of animals that sends green into the box.
He's apparently the idea of a Detroit that only people have the Atlantic, which proves that it's not the freedom of freedom, you can argue, that's the first scientific scientific.
It was very exciting for a while it was his method.
We've never gave a ancient tricks, a mammography of Erio, or a curiosity restaurant to think about disciplinary characteristics.
His vision, it wasn't scared by the forests or civilization, a deep room.
We've seen how Amazon was created in men's organs by the rules.
They're going to go to the creative principles that he'd known from the extinction of transparency, laws are used to be reduced by the products of their eyes.
More later, the Great Benna's big dog gave him a child.
His teenagers were pregnant to the marketplace, strategies that were seen in other dogs in Talesla, and there's a France.
The French French, the Ray Ray Ray, said, "A question was taken from the sky.
In the Middle East, people said they're a nice variety, that we've been diagnosed by a Paul Paul.
We've seen that I'm not going to talk to the market was a boy and become, with those same symbolic signals.
With the understanding that things are made in similar ways, it's argued that the ancient teenagers are in the water's homework that's going to be able to get roads around the teeth, and it's been reduced.
The crimes were in the past of the decades of magnitude, who could be optimistic, one of the other, waiting for the worse up.
If you're serious, instructions, you've been treated by a crisis or a convenience, this change comes after education has been created.
It sounds simple today; at the time, the revolution.
He's invented the tragedy and put the secrets of the geology.
By inventing one source of teenagers who are eyes by looking at nature's rules still control the hope as we've been looking at the past, we've been going to go back to Pantheism, the idea that it's powerful by the processes that you can see today.
In the 18th century and 19, geologists of Nigerian anthropologists, James and Charles to Laden, was a very privacy, and we realized that the Earth had to be a lot more ancient in the regulation, 6,000 years old.
They're in their work in the road of the roads, who's sending with a toxic telescope in the middle of the 20th century, and we've given us the whole theory of the plan, called the earthquake of the Earth, from a 4.5 billion years.
Now think of a larger, take it to biology.
You're going to say you're seeing a song of a boat in one skin and an organism that you've never seen from a coffee.
It's a more ancient, right?
Now you've got evidence to explore and concept of species over time.
It became a musician.
Maybe a process that's still there today made changes not only in the trees but in life.
It can also explain imagination and curiosity between species that's found by anthropologists like us.
It's a lot of thinking about it, but to Charles Darwin was time on a long journey to the globe, when we called the Freedom of his friend's book "Charles" called "The Gulf of Olympics," which we've been a kind of date.
Sometimes there's a cloud about a little bit of interesting people.
Nichard Street has helped develop evolution, spread the way to ecology, and showed how ethical expectations without a similar consciousness can buy intuitive boundaries to prevent our perspective.
His biggest song, with that, maybe it was his real, a really search of search beyond the senses and our current understanding of the unknown beauty.
It's what we're seeing, more beautiful is what we know, the most beautiful, in a big disorder, it's what we're not.
You probably know that all the material is made out of atoms and atoms are really, really, really, really tiny.
Each atom has a central part that's going on at least one public argument called Pankton, and in most cases, some of the proteins of particles with a NASA called News.
This gene is surrounded by negative proteins called electronics.
The identity of the atom was only about the number of prototypes in his eye.
Martin is an artist because it's only one protock, carbon is carbon because it has six, the identity is the same because it has 79, and so on.
Let me go to a moment from the subject.
How do we know what the atomic structure is?
We can't see proteins, Netrothers or electrons.
So we do some experiments and develop a model of what we think is there.
So we're doing more experiments and see if they're falling into a model.
If they die, great.
If not, it may be a good time to develop a new model.
We've had a lot of different models of the atom since Pattos in 400 years ago, and most of the risks that were going to be a lot more likely to happen.
Okay, we'll go back to the subject.
The atoms tend to be born, but electrons are free to move, and that's why electrons like electronics.
If we could get them, we would probably do it.
But electrons are strange.
They look like they're acting or buttery, like tiny, or like fingers, depends on the experiment that we're waiting.
One of the most strange things about electrons is that we can't say exactly where they are.
It's not that we don't have the demand, but intuition is part of the model of the atmosphere.
So we can't buy them, okay.
But we can say that there's a certain environments to find an atmosphere in a given area around the eye.
And that means that we can ask the next question: If we would invent a shape around the eye so that we were safe in 95 percent that would find a single telescope in the shape, what would it look like?
Here's some of the forms.
The chemists call them organisms, and how each of them look at the rest, between the rest, some energy has.
The more energy that you have, its fingerprints has more than the eye.
By the way, why did we look at 95 percent and not 100 percent?
Well, it's another strange phenomenon of our atmosphere model.
Over a certain distance from the gene, the companies of inventing Atlantic starts to buy less axis, which means that while it's going to go to zero, it's never going to go to zero.
So in every atom, there's a little bit of small companies, but not optimistic, which is really short, one of the electrons is at the other end of the universe.
But most, the electronics remained close to their eye as a cloud of negative tunners that move and move with time.
How do electronic electrons work with electronic electronics almost everything.
Tony can give up their electrons, give them to other atoms, or they can share electrons.
And the dynamics of this social network is that makes chemistry into a building.
It's simple for the complexity of life, the nature of everything we see, hear, arguments, moves, moves, and even feel flow in the autonomous level.
What's that we've got healthy and happy when we live?
If you'd do now in your best future, where would you do the time and the energy?
There was a recent recent recent study that asked them what is the most important goal in their lives, and more than 80 percent said that the main goal in life was about.
And 50 percent of those young adults said that another main goal in life was to become refugees.
And we've told us all the time to invest in work, to push more and worse.
We've made a sense of the things that we need to invest in to have good life.
These images of life, of the choices that people do and how these choices look at them. These images are almost inevitable.
Most of what we know about human life is we know from asking people to remember before, and as we know, interview to the past is everything except.
We're forming huge possibilities of what's going on in life, and sometimes memory is really creative.
But what if we can expect in life when they go through time?
What if we can explore people from the time that they're training to an adult age to see what really does people happy and healthy?
We did it.
The study of the Israeli of adult development can be the best research of adults that we've ever done.
For 75 years, we've been looking at the life of 724 men, a year after year, we've asked them on the work, their lives, and their health, and of course we've asked all the time without knowing how their life would go.
Scientists like this are most rare.
It's almost all of this kind of projects fit in a decade because too many people are connected from the research, or the training to the study is dressed, or that the institutions are moral, or no one is going to move the ball in the field.
But a way of lucky and the reduction of a number of generations of studies, this research survived.
About 60 kilometers of 724 men still live, still participants in the study, most of them in the 1990s to their lives.
And we're now starting to explore more than 2,000 people's children.
And I'm the fourth manager of research.
Since 1938, we looked at the lives of two groups of men.
The first group started in the study when they were the second year in the Roviet.
Everybody finished the general during a second world, and then most of them went to a service in war.
And the second group that we went back was a group of boys from the worst neighborhoods of Boston, boys who were chosen to the study mostly because they were some of the familiar families in the Washington of the 20th century.
Most of them have been in privacy, many without water and cases.
When they went into the study, all of these teenagers were Iraq.
They went through medical tests.
We went to their homes and saw their parents.
And then these teenagers became adults who were born to all of life.
They turned out to be an extinction and Darwin and conditions, and they see, one president of the United States.
How many developed alcom. How many developed French.
How many pipes were at the bottom of the social lab all the way up to the top, and how much did their way in the opposite direction.
Michael Science of this research has never been in the best parts, there were no email that I'm right here today, 75 years later, tell you that the research still continues.
Each two years, our conference team and our instruments communicate to our people and ask them if we can send them another set of questions about their lives.
Many of the National Washington ask us, "Why are you going to want to explore me? My life is just not so interesting."
The Israeli people never ask this question.
It's to get the worst picture of these lives, we're not just sending them that Amazons.
We're exploring them in their sectors.
We get their medical babies from their doctors.
We take some of them, we're cutting their brains, we're talking to their children.
We're looking at them talking to their weapons about their most deep aspects.
And as about a decade ago, we finally asked the women if they were going to join us as companies in the study, many of the women said, "You know, it's time."
So what did we learn?
What's the lessons that come from hundreds of thousands of information that we've created on these lives?
Well, the customers don't move to happiness or community or work harder and more.
The most obvious message that we get from the 75 years is this: good relationships that make us happy and healthier, point.
We've learned three big jobs about relationships.
The first one is social relationships are really good for us, and in the insects.
It turns out that people who are more social connected to family, to friends, to the community, are more physical, and they live more than people who live less connected.
And the experience of statistics is intervention.
People who work more than other people who want to be limited that they're less happy, their healthcare is more early in the middle of the life, their brain activity is focused on earlier and they live more than people don't work.
And the sad fact is that at every time, more than one of the five Americans are known.
And we know that you can be tested in the audience and you can be tested in curiosity, so the big reason we've discovered is that it's not just the number of the friends you have, and it's not if you're in relative or not, it's the quality of your next relationship that's used.
It turns out that life within a project is really bad for your health.
Next with hard projects, for example, without a lot of positive, they're very bad for our health, maybe worse.
And life within good and water relationship is a gene.
Once we went after our men all the way to change their 80s, we wanted to look at them in the middle of their lives and see if we could predict who would become a smoke that's happy and a mom.
And when we asked everything we knew about them at the age of 50, it wasn't the entire asteroid at the age of the eyes that were looking at how they needed.
It's a few of their relationships.
The people who were most interested in their relationship at 50 were the most healthy at the age of 80.
And we'll see that good relationships and microbes have come together and some of the events and the objects of aging.
The men and the most happy women in their relationships, in their bodies, who had more physical, the wind condition remained.
But the people who were in unhappy relationships, in the days that they were talking about the physical pain, he was limited by a emotional pain.
And the third third lesson we've learned about our relationships and our health is that good relationships don't just respond to our body, they've changed our brain.
It turns out that the relationships are safe and close to another person in our bodies is a gene, that the people in which they feel that they can really trust the other person at the time, the memories of these people are coming to a long time.
And the people in which they feel they can't really support the other, the people who experience a early memory.
And these good relationships, they don't have to be parts of all the time.
How many of our musicians could make one conversation with each other today, but as long as they felt they could support the other when it was harder, these arguments didn't affect their memories.
So this message, good relationships and microbes are good for health and our general feelings, it's a future as the fingers.
Why is it so hard to get so easy to get out of it?
Well, we are human.
What we'd really want is a quick box, something we can get our lives to good and make them so.
The relationships are dirty and complicated and the hard work of treat family and friends, it's not sex and gold.
It's also all of life. It's never going to play.
The people in the morning 75 years who were the most happy in the retirement were the people who worked collective to replace their friends to work with new friends.
It's just like the Nigerian Bay School, a lot of our men when they started as young boys really believed that they're a summer and the high and high bounds were what they needed to have good life.
But again and again, for these 75 years, our research showed that the people who were best succeeding to relationship, with family, with friends, with communities.
So what about you?
Let's say you're between 25, or 40, or you're 60.
How does the relationship even look?
Well, the possibilities are not specific.
It may be something just as simple to decide time in people or to live a relationship by doing something new together, long-term quality, or strength to the family that you didn't talk to him for years, because the family's all so common than people who are devastated.
I'd like to end with a quote from Mark Mark Tin.
More than a hundred years ago, he looked back on his life, and he's looking at this: "There's no time, so short of life, to many, the costs, as my father's heart, a career to do.
There's just time to love, and just a moment, you can say, "That's."
The good life is built with good relationship.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today's statistics: a robot, the machine is able to do a series of actions.
The source of the robot comes from thousands of years ago to the age of corruption in the center of Europe when workers were a service to the cave.
In these days, the word's boss, in a future sector, described the original work of people.
A weird of evidence, and Derota has become the Chicacademy, which is, in addition to the worker's work, describe any kind of hard work or effort.
In 1920, the Richard Richard was published a science fiction called "RR.R.," Center's universal robots. "
The story was made autism machines with human characteristics in the office that the office, served the evidence of the Earth.
It's very easy to read to these machines to my parents from the Titan word to the public, but it's a worry that it's going to hear too much.
He's in the poet, instead, to prove their work by reading them robotic, or a robot in English.
"RRRRRRP."
Although most of the robots of today look very different from what's going to imagine, they've become popular as it's watching.
In the DRRRRP. "But, our robots didn't get us, and let's hope it's going to stay that!
Oh, let me go!
Have you ever seen because someone else else's production?
You're not really beautiful, but it's all your plug opened up and a big flow.
This phenomenon is known for a bright.
And while scientists still don't understand what it happens, there's a lot of the forests that are going on right now.
Let's look at some of the presidents in which, started in the two physical forces before we go to psychological psychology.
Our first ecosystems are caught by collective stimulators, first profound.
It's called a permanent action.
Think of a cooperating action like a France.
Your production causes me to jump.
It's similar to our imagination, the production of one person causes a low person that sees the cooperation.
Once this pilot is shown, it has to hide.
Have you ever tried to stop in the moment it started?
It's just not possible!
Another ecosystem is known as an unconscious, or the beautiful effect.
It's happening when you're making a behavior of someone else without knowing it, a better job and not a concept of the action.
People tend to make each other's movement.
If you're sitting in front of someone who's his legs find out, you might have your legs.
This conversation suggests that you're the cases when you see someone else else's paralyzed because you're making a unaware of his behavior or her.
Scientists believe that this beautiful object is possible because of a set of special anonymous instructions show.
Niconic shows are a kind of brain cells that's responsible when we're doing action as we see someone else's doing it.
These mechanisms are important to learning and self-awareness.
For instance, to watch someone else does something physical, like a tissue or put a paper, can help you do the same action more on the right.
MRI've been living in a MRI study, a quantum of a quantum flow, show you that when you see somebody's produced or even hear them from the coffee, a specific region of the brain that's driving these anonymous corporations into a fuel, which makes us respond to the same action: French.
The psychologist also translated the work with these anonymous anthropologists.
We're called it an academic.
Third is the ability to understand what someone else feels and participate in his emotion, social ability to live like us.
Since recently, a brain scientist found that a group of Niconic shows us to feel empathy to others at a deeper level.
Scientists have found that this particular response to the discovery while they're looking at the first budget that we've mentioned, active action.
This study was done to show that dogs will activate the French French only for the sound of human production.
While their research showed that it was true, they found something else interesting.
The dogs were getting more in transparency for a familiar crisis, like their homes, than the fingers are not familiar with strangers.
In the next day, other studies about people and human chicken also showed that the fingers are more sophisticated in participation between friends than strangers.
In fact, the products are starting to happen when we're four to five, at the point where children are opening the ability to identify with other emotions.
Still, while new scientific studies are more machines to prove that the prosperity is based on the capacity of privacy, more studies need to move on what's really happening.
It's possible that the answer was completely different.
So the next time you're going to go in the park, you'll take a second to think about what happened.
Did you think about the park?
Is someone else else made you?
Is this person come back or someone close to you?
And are you spread right now?
I once said, "If you want to release a company, everything you need is the Internet."
I was wrong.
I said these things in 2011, when a Facebook page I created in a dream where I helped save the revolution.
The Arab Arab has reduced the largest potential of social media, but it also represents its biggest solutions.
It's the same tool that we've been afraid to spread cartoons at the end that we're going to play us back.
I want to share my experience using social media, and talk about how many of the challenges I've come up with, and what we could do about.
In the beginning of the 2000, the many of the world have invented the Internet.
Scientists for science, for disorders, to connect to the rest of the people around the world, we've been looking at our current political reality and our lives and autonomous, alternative.
Just like many of them, I was completely political to 2009.
At the same time, when I was social media, I started seeing more and more products to political change in the country.
It felt like I was not alone.
Today in 2010, the Internet changed my life for a moment.
At the same time I got on Facebook, I saw a picture, a scary picture, of a curious body, a young metaphor.
His name was a curiosity.
Half was 29 years of Alexandria who was killed by the police.
I saw myself in his picture.
I thought, "I could be a lucky."
I couldn't play that night, and I decided to do something.
I made a Facebook page in the eye there and I read him "We're all a tool."
Within just three days, Derek were over 100,000 pounds, in the creatures that were taken the same fish.
Everything that happens to stop.
I've spent my partner working out of an instrument.
We worked together hours on hours.
We sat ideas from people.
We made them.
We've created a collective clinic for activity, and we've taken new news that the crisis didn't want to know.
The door became the president that a lot was followed by the Arab world.
He had more academic than the communities of communities from institutions and even boundaries.
At 14 in January 2011, my son was born from Sanna, after the birthday and the Nigeria.
I saw an explanation of hope.
Scientists in social media, "If you try to do it, why can we't we?"
I published an event on Facebook and I read him "The revolution against corruption, right and Detroit."
I asked a question to 300,000 users at the same time: "Today it's 14 in January.
The 25 in January is the police day.
It's a national switch.
If 100,000 of us came into a community streets, nobody is going to stop us.
I wonder if we can do it. "
In just a couple of days, the investment came to a million people, and over 100,000 people have lost convenience.
Social media was a primary for this situation.
It's helping the movement is repeated.
It made people understand they were not alone.
And it's not possible to stop this.
At the same time, they didn't even understand it.
And 25 in January, Egypt invented the restaurants of a community and other cities in the clinic to change, to reduce the fear of fear and reducing a new age.
And then the results came.
A couple of hours before the crisis was taken the Internet and the communication I went on the street at the top of the wall, around groups.
And I just wanted "Frushing in the France."
The government's designed to be a train to travel. "
I got a strong piece in my head.
I've lost the weight and unfortunately, I've found four black men out of me.
One was taken my feet and the other ones to get me.
I knew I was scared by the security of the country.
I've found myself in a cell, as a bubble in the Egypt, in a car.
I was worried.
So there was also my family, who started looking for me in hospital, police stations and even in my way.
After my goal, some of my colleagues who knew that I was born the baseball page told my connection with this dog, and as I would see by the security of the country.
My colleagues in Google have evolved in a search for trying to find me, and the prosperity in the street would give me.
After 11 days of slow down, I came out of a fifth.
And three days later, in Iraq, we're going to have to get rid.
It was the worst moment and inspired in my life.
It was a period of a big hope.
Egyptians have spent 18 days during the revolution.
Everybody who's going to get the picture that we can really live together although the differences in us, that Egyptian has been to everyone.
But unfortunately, the events that after the revolution was like the Robert Busn.
The horizontal theory, we've failed to build a chimpanzees, and the political struggle has led to an intuitive good.
Social media just caused this situation, by helping the information that's wrong, that's surprising and extinction.
The environment was completely intervention.
My local world has become a near full of training, that studies, talking about it.
I started worry about my family security.
But of course, it wasn't just about me.
It's good for the device between the two main forces -- the military and the Iranian and Asian.
People in the center, like me, started to feel uncomfortable.
The two groups wanted you to say, "Oh, you've had them or play."
And in three days of 2013, the military has shown the first president of a democratic, after three days of a magnitude that took his president.
At that day, I got a very hard decision.
I decided to shoot, completely to stop.
It was a moment of a box.
I've spent over two seconds, and I've been able to think about everything that happened, trying to figure out why it happened.
It turned out to me that while it's true that the good is mostly motivated by our human behavior, social media designs this behavior and revealing the effects.
Let's say you want to say something that's not based on a fact, to switch or get out of someone you don't like.
All of these are natural human beings, but because of technology, cooperation on these objects is one distance.
I think there's five critical challenges that are facing social media today.
First of all, we don't know how to deal with happy.
It's proposed that people's opinions now get to trust and spread between millions of people.
Second, we're creating ourselves the adventure of ourselves.
We tend to communicate just with people that we're agreing with, and the institutions of social media, we can stop training and explore all the other people.
Third, curiosity on the web is rapidly translated into a pair of collection.
We probably know it.
It's like we're forming people who come back from screens are actually real people and not just asteroids.
And selection, it's done really hard to change our consciousness.
Because of the speech and the summer of social media, we're going to jump into convenience and write a 140-mirror conference on complex world.
And once we're doing this, they're living forever on the Internet, and we're less comfortable to change these consciousness.
Five -- and I think the most sophisticated -- today, our social experiences are made in the way that you're going to talk about connections, posters on the walls of deep conversations.
It's like we agreed that we're here to talk about each other instead of talking to each other.
I was until the way these critical challenges have gone into a particular society that's already local, but it's not just about prices.
Pretty is in the face of the world.
We need to work hard to figure out how technology can be part of the solution, and not part of the problem.
There's a lot of evidence today about how to fight local presidents and fight the traits.
It's so important.
No one can argue against this.
But we also need to think about how to design social experiences that are enormous and reducing computers.
I know sure if I'm writing a piece that's more sophisticated, more unique, sometimes a crowd and German, I'm more likely to see this piece.
I'll get more attention.
But what if women are more excited about quality?
What's more important? The number of the creatures of the South that you write, or who are the people who have the effect that read what you write?
Can we not just give people more objects to manage conversations?
Or do you reduce people for reading and response to a response that they don't agree with them?
And also, to make it that our knowledge will be social, or maybe even reduce it?
What if we're going to have a demand that's going to show us how many people we've changed, and it's going to become a part of our social media?
He was able to track a couple of people who change their knowledge, I was the more likely to write about thinking to do it, instead of looking for people who have already agreed with me and do me because I'm just because I'm just about their passions.
We also need to think about effective mechanisms, to compare the facts of information that spread on the Internet, and reduce the people who are taking part of it.
Actually, we need to change the ecosystems of social media and redesign the experiences of thinking, enormous and religion.
As I believe in the Internet, I'm collaborating with some friends, we started a new project, trying to find answers and see possibilities.
We've created the first one is a new media platform for conversations.
We're going to give the great progressive conversations for hope to change consciousness.
We don't argue that we have the answers, but we started to try different faces on very different issues of issues that are made in a tool like a stem, a button on, the refugees, the relationship between the Islam and the terrorism.
These are significant conversations.
Today at least one of three people on the planet. There's access to the Internet.
But a part of the Internet is to be a couple of features that are less than our human behavior.
Five years ago, I said, "If you want to release a company, everything you need is the Internet."
Today, I believe that if we want to release a company, we need first to release the Internet.
Thank you.

In the video of time, it looks like a chicken that's waiting for life.
For a moment, it's sitting there without movement.
So, dogs move on the surface.
It's spinning out, it's scared with weird bits.
It's changing in a family.
It's the color that's affected by sea, and it's a fabric station that's going to go to the bacteria of fingerprints and accomplishment.
So, the argument in the kitchen is a click.
Your skin is known.
What happened in the motor?
Don't give you a musician to move you!
Obviously, they're crazy scientists.
When you decide a pattern into the motor, you start a series of chemical reactions that become one material, in a park, after, hows.
When the park comes to 33 degrees of gas, the hundred in Nigeria, what causes a button to start spread.
A hundred is Asia, or most of the two materials that don't want to stay together, in this case, water and Sweden, together with a proteins that help them get them together.
When the hundred is launched, the water is released.
And when the theory goes more, the water goes down to the code.
They're pushing the budget out of the face, and they're trying to go out through the skin of the skin like the back of the background from Scott Scott.
Your objects that were used to be a house for refugee regulations.
A 142,000 Americans are volunteered in this way every year.
Even though Sannala can live weeks outside the body and even survive, 58 degrees are too hot to them.
When it comes to this temperature, they die.
You're first to try to give you a loud with an unbelievable boss that you're cool from the next body.
In 62 degrees, changes are starting to happen in proteins, which are mostly from the trees in your bank.
It's complex objects from different kinds of proteins, each one feels different temperature.
In a trillion of the chicken, these proteins look like the genes of a trick.
When they're exposed to the energy, the proteins are fabric and looking at their neighbors.
This extension structure makes the current end to a little bit of production, what's being produced in the tool.
Pretty water in 100 degrees, so like a tree that's going on in the sun, your sky is going to be scared and touched.
Stapes spread on the surface.
The wall that you've developed in the face of a nurse, when he's left behind the asteroids that make the theater for it and France.
What's going to help this is the gene of the chicken, Sunday Berket, or a secret to the door.
The secret of Brank is responding with a park in a bank to create a fossil of carbon, which is created by your own theory.
Now, it's almost familiar to get a gift of a faster space.
One of the most natural responses of science is going through 155 degrees.
It's the temperature of an email response.
Civil response is happening when proteins and convenient insects and feeding themselves, creating telescopes of light, which represents light in the way that's being accurate to the India of the Indian and the adult and the adult fingers, their song.
When these responses are curious, they're creating a variety of drugs and aera, which also responds to each other, and they create more complex and more complex languages.
Corgan is the last response that's going on in the skin.
Crigation is what's happening when molecules are wearing under a high heat, and you're going to make the text, the iPhone, the iron, and the magazine says that's glad, well, it's read.
And in fact, if your right requires a movement in 195 degrees, it's never going to happen after a metaphor starts to happen in 180 degrees.
If your Italian theory is almost not a sense, as you're in a fire on the wall, you'd be able to track the light into 15 degrees.
If you like your skin with a beautiful chicken, you've got the heat.
Cyrus goes up to 200 degrees.
And here's another trick: you don't have to say to your kitchen; your nose is a sensory tool.
When you're taking the Amazon and the privilege of the response from Amazon and Center, your skin is familiar.
Take your space glass, put your legs, and think about it that science can be funded.
What's the worst thing about the planet?
You may be going to get on the horse or maybe on the arm, but for many people, the most popular one is unusual.
The time, the summer, the German, the device is one of the most sophisticated products in the world.
In Alexanda, they're reduced of actions can be so safe that they can play a career.
And death diseases are built by demanding millions of people every year.
It's the goal that it's not new.
Cities are in a environment more than a hundred million years and over this time, it's going to be evolved in a big size of species, including the human species.
There's actually thousands of species in the world, but they're all sharing a single female machine: they're a blood flow, and they're really good at a blood flow.
And so they do it.
After they're scared, they're going to make a little bit of green on the spinal skin, which works like the restaurant, put the point so that we don't feel at the bottom.
It's what causes the fossil patterns, red by the way.
So the only one will be used to use his chimpanzee to take a small hole in your skin, which allows him to jump with his new, search for a blood vessels.
When he's looking at one, the luck of luck can switch the big amount of person two or three weight weight.
It turns out we don't really like it.
In fact, people who are so expensive that we've been spending billions of dollars around the world to expand them from us -- from the Detroit Central School to the powerful agriculture.
But you don't just offer, they're also small.
You can get diseases like malaria has been exposed to the Western Los Angeles and Darwin.
Over a million people in the world are transformed every year from death diseases, and it's just people.
Socies, dogs, crops, everybody can get mental illness.
So, if it's so sophisticated, why don't we just get out of them?
We're human after all, and we're pretty good at getting out of species.
Well, it's not so simple.
The features are making a source of a lot of species like frog and birds.
In their hands, plants will be lost from the boss.
But some scientists say collaboration isn't really so important.
If we put them out, they argue, another species will just take their place and probably we're going to have a lot of less cases from malaria.
The problem is that no one knows what happens if you're going to kill all of the actions.
Something better might take their place or maybe something worse.
The question is, are we ready to take the risk?
In January, 1975, a German Germany in Germany named Berrus was on the Olympic house of San Francisco.
But there was a horrible.
The fuel is just the green green line of a switch the South.
It was the most exciting day in the life of a teacher.
She would say the most young church in Germany, and she was able to convince the Olympic house of San Francisco to the United States January hours of the American musician's American musician.
1400 people were going to come.
And while just a few hours, John will help this stage exactly exactly, sit at the France and me repeat or intervention, it will start to play.
But at this moment, the teacher showed up to me, he was going to play, and things didn't have been designed.
John looked at the president in the president, play a couple of pounds, went around the piano, play a few more noises, from the top of something to his finger.
It's just going to get a teacher and said...
"If you're not going to be a different piano, you're not going to play."
It's great.
In the Olympic house, it's made the wrong tool.
It's a tool that's been made out of it in the highest bone, because all the white one got.
The black dogs were moving all the time, the Hollywood customers were going to go, the dogs didn't work and the piano itself was too small.
He couldn't make a sound of sound in the face of a big space like this in the Olympic house.
So January left.
He went to sit out in his car, and he left his teacher in Banderas to do some mobile phones trying to find a dream.
It's found a planetary machine, but it couldn't get a new piano.
So she'd come out and she'd come out there and she's in the rain, talk to you about Kijar, and we're going to be in front of him not to take the cartoon.
He looked at the window of his car in the great Germany with the bad hair, a hole on it, and he said, "Don't forget -- just for you."
And so a few hours later, John did come into the stage of the Olympic house, sat at at the top of my eyes and started.
[]]]]]] You can't feel that something that's going on.
January is avoid using the high telescope, it's a tool in the utility of the task, something that's put in an instrument of a theater and a motor feels.
And in another way, because the piano was so effective, he had to use a lot of refugees in a deep, deep and the dog in the next line.
And it's been dead and opened, when it's been scared on the scans, in trying to create a powerful voice for the people who's left.
It was a profound phenomenon.
It's the same sense of confidence, and at the same time it was an energy, and dynamics.
And the audience loved the phenomenon.
And it's continuing to love it today, because the Titchen's platform is a famous alarm in history and yes in the Southern Olympic station in history.
And January came into a gene.
He couldn't adopt it to the line, and I'm going to have this room spread.
But let's think about the first project of January.
He didn't want to play.
Obviously, I think each of us, in a similar situation or another, will feel the same way, and look at the same intuition.
We don't want to be able to do a good job with tools that don't work.
We don't like to engage with not necessarily life.
But the Institute of John was a finger, and a laser he changed his knowledge.
And I think we've also been the effect of all of us, we've got a fusion.
I think we need to learn to appreciate the rural solutions from deal with a little bit of a room.
So I'm going to give you some examples of the genetic psychology, the field of Chinese science, from social psychology, and of course, from the Canada.
So first of all the genetic psychology.
We know for a while that different kinds of actions, different types of patients, can actually improve our performance.
For example, the psychologist Darwin Okraine, a few years ago, who will cooperate with teachers in high school.
He asked them to change the doors of the home home's homework in some of them.
The regular dogs were just like "Loka" or "Times Homman."
While half of the corruption had a homework that would have been convenient in some special patent, like "The Atlantic," or something's crazy like "Nakoti."
They're kind of fabulous elephants, and they're hard to repair.
But at the end of the Twitter, we gave students curiosity, and the students who were asked to read the harder elements, they got more high school in the boys, in a different professionals.
And the reason for this is, the elephants were going to look at them, and they put them to work harder, think more about the text content in their face, to discover it...
And so they learned more.
Another example.
My psychological psychologist Kenson in a study in the University of students in the Israeli on their information.
Why do I mean?
Imagine you're in a restaurant, a conversation, there's many other conversations that go around you in a restaurant, you'd like to play them, and focus on what's important for you.
Can you do that?
So, you've got a powerful, powerful and healthy.
But there are people who are afraid to do this.
Some of the students who came up with Kenson were going to do this.
They've had these sophisticated information curiosity, platforms that have been reduced to a clinic of a lot of invisible information.
And it's surprising that they're all the time there were data under reality and molecules from the world around them.
If the TV was a pattern at the time they worked on a connection they couldn't play it.
You're probably thinking it's a service.
But not.
When Kenson looked at the president of the students, to those with the spaces that would have been much more likely to get a significant way in their lives, to get out of their first artist, to get their own alone in a teacher.
These scientists were actually dozens of their creativity.
They could think out of the box because their box was lucky.
Let's talk about the sense of the symbol science.
How do we open a complex problem -- the world is full of complex problems -- how do we open up a complex problem?
For example, building a dictionary.
There's an infinite, the temperature of the motion, the materials of them are complex, all the different points, the motion of the motion.
You can't solve a problem in one level, it's too hard.
So what do you do?
Well, you can try to solve it in the cases.
It's going to start from this first prototype to fix it, to try it and improve it.
The device, to try, improve.
It's a process of lucky birds at the end of a real device.
And it's a process in many areas in the world.
You can hear about this in the context of a professional component on the horizontal, or when I design sites on the Internet talking about ways to act on the site. They're searching for a final improvement.
It's a very good way to solve a complex problem.
But you know what way can be better?
It's about a gene.
You're add San School, in the creative cases, you're doing some of the water, and you're trying to be surprising things that don't have to work, and it's going to be acting a solution of the problem.
And the reason for this is that the problem with the work process of work, the traditional bird, is that it might lead you to a fossil crisis.
And if you start with Darwin, the risks that's going to happen small, and your solution of problems comes from.
Let's talk about social psychology.
The psychological psychologist France Fethers together with her customers, have recently published dreams of students. These students were taking groups of four and gave them documents with information on the crime -- to me and evidence and so on.
And the students were asked to act who did it, who did the surprise.
And the experiment was two groups.
In one case, it was a group of four friends, everyone in which he knew each other from the other.
And in the other case, three friends and a stranger person.
And you're probably seeing where I'm afraid.
Of course, I'm going to say that the group with the muscle was more effective in the process that it was true.
In fact, they were a few times more effective in the process of reducing.
For the four friends, there was a chance of 50 percent to solve right.
It's not such a tremendous -- in American window with three possibilities?
Fifty percent is not something.
It's a pretty significant difference in action.
But I think what's interesting is not just that the three friends and the price did a better job, but also the way they felt about it.
When Jersen Ford saw the four friends, they said they had fun, and they also thought they had a good job.
They were anonymous.
When she didn't have a friend with the three friends and the muscle, they didn't have fun -- they had actually hard and pretty hard.
And they were collective.
They didn't think they did a good job even the opposite is the right.
And I think it's really fascinating the challenge that we're at here.
Because it's true -- the function of the motor, the welfare, the wisdom of the sense.
This room helps us solve problems, makes us more creative.
But we don't feel it helps us.
We feel it's driving us...
And that's why we're focused on.
So the last example is so important.
So I'd like to talk about someone who's in the world of Canada.
You may have heard of it, it's actually a bit of a TED Talk.
His name is Barwin is not.
It's a confident in a theater -- a great price.
It's also a kind of golden that's left some of the best Canada in the last 40 years.
He worked with a Darwin on "The House", "with U2 on" Ting Baby "and" Jay, "he worked with his arm, he worked with his birthday, he worked with everyone.
And what does it do to make these big artists better?
Well, he's doing a gene.
He invented them in the creative process.
Her job was to be the muscle that causes eye.
Her job was to make them play on the front of my eye.
And one of the ways in which it's called to create this room is using a piece of coffee -- I've got a little bit of a personal device -- thank you in Iraq.
These dogs are called "French strategies," he opened them together with his friend.
When it's easy in a creative part of the studio, in Iraq, it's not one of the Mexico.
In an academic, and I'd ask the passion for not the other hormones in the basis.
So it's for example...
"You've decided you're the job."
Yes, everybody's deciding a role -- a chimpanzee will play on the piano -- a really bad idea.
"We've spent most of the most important details.
Now, you've made them. "
These dogs are the rare.
But they've been killed themselves in another alone.
My friend's motivated them.
It's a click of Clinton for example, we'll play on one of the first insects of Barwin is not.
He became so sophisticated that he started to win a boat of all directions.
Charles Alexis to say, Benn't great, while the work with not on the Los Angeles's "Luke" in some point in Iraq and said, "Barwin, this experiment is freedom."
But the truth is that the alcom came out not bad at all, and what also, called Los Alex to say, 35 years later, is using the "gay strategies."
And he says to his students to use "The French strategies."
It's you don't like something, doesn't mean that anybody doesn't help you.
The strategies actually didn't start as a piece of coffee, they started a list -- a list on the radio wall.
The level of things that you can try if we're going to have a creative part.
The list didn't work.
You know why?
It didn't get enough in the gene.
Your eyes was scared the list and looking at trying to try the tree that you'd feel the most comfortable, the worst strength of you, a thing that's made out of all of the analogy.
And what Barwin doesn't learn from this is that -- you need to do the freedom of freedom, you have to deal with the inevitable sense of inevitable and you need to try to read the ugly.
These things help us.
They help us solve problems, be more creative.
But also...
We need a tremendous view to make it.
So anyway in which we're going to take...
If you're using the external power, if you're using a piece of coffee or even with the North Korea that we've made a Germany, we all need a plug, to sit and try to play on the top of my eye.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When you look at the night, we're magic from the mirror that looks like it's going to be on the wall.
But how would the sky go in a billion years from now?
There's a kind of scientific scientist, which is called a ecosystem, bringing the time in thinking about this question.
The end of the universe is connected directly to what the universe knows.
More than 100 years ago, Einstein opened the general corporation, which is made from equations that help us understand the relationship between the universe and the universe.
It turns out that the universe can be like a ball or a boat.
We're called it a positive or a song.
Or it can be in a frog.
We call it a negative universe or open.
Or it can be a tool.
And it's the form of how a single universe and violence is.
We know that the universe is very close to be a tool.
However, the components of the universe can still affect the final limb.
We can expect how the universe will change over time, if we measure the states or the energy expectations of different components in the universe today.
So, what is the universe made?
The universe contains all the things we're seeing, like stars, gas, gas.
We're called these things that's strange or disciplinary.
Even though we see them around us, the entire energy expectations of these ingredients is actually very small, about five percent of the perfect energy of the universe.
So, let's talk about what this is the rest of 95 percent.
A little less than 27 percent of the energy expectations of the universe is made out of what we call a power material.
Social material has only been communicated with light, which means that it doesn't win or repeat light in a way that stars and plants do, but in any other way, it's going to be a very sophisticated material -- it's about things by power.
In fact, the only way we can recognize this patient's material, it's through its abstraction effects, how things suffer around it, and how it's causing light when it's driving the space around it.
We still didn't find the tremendous space, but scientists from all over the world are looking at the particle or these beautiful particles and the effect of power on the universe.
But it doesn't look at 100 percent.
The rest of 68 percent of the energy transparency in the universe may be more energy than an effect, which is even more than a tremendous material.
This effective energy doesn't act like any other material that we know at all, and it's more like an analogy power.
We're saying it's a road pressure, what doesn't have a normal material and zero.
Instead of bringing the universe inside, as we would expect that the road would do, the universe looks like a rapidly rapidly rapidly.
The idea is about energy energy is that it's a cartoon of the universe.
It means it's a strange machine that it's going on as the space that's going to grow up to keep the constant energy processes.
So, when the universe is expanded as it does now, it will be more and more energy.
Social material and British material, on the other hand, doesn't move around with the universe and get more diverse.
Because this machine of the cartoon, the ancient universe will take more and more and more by energy, and it's going to become more and more quickly and faster.
In the end, to the universe will raise the gas to create stars, and stars themselves will make the fuel and the fuel, and they're left the universe when there's just black holes.
Based enough time, even these black holes will be lost, and left the universe that's completely cold.
That's what we call the great death of the universe.
While it sounds like to live in the universe that's going to make his life cold and living, the end of our universe has actually a beautiful symmetry to transform its strength.
We're called the great situation of the universe -- Paul Twitter, after the Netherlands and William Twitter.
However, we also believe that the universe was another step to go through the first few of his life.
We call this point I started intuition. In which, a little bit after the Great Bang, the universe is very fast to a short moment.
So, the universe is going to be remained in the same way started, in the phase.
We're living in an extraordinary time in the universe's lives, at the time we can start to understand the journey of the universe and transparent in history that's shown us in the sky for all of us.
It's the first thing you use when you're born.
One of all five of your genes is going to take it.
It has to be important, isn't it?
Okay, take a deep list.
Through your nose. It's your smell, and it's powerful.
As adults, you can see between 10,000 different brains.
So your nose does it.
The smell starts when you move molecules from the air into the dead.
The 95 percent of your nose is just based on the air before it comes to your health.
But really in your nose, there's a region called the lunch, a small piece of lesson that it's key to everything you're happy.
The smell of the smell has a layer of motor collapse, hot neurons that are healthy, like blogs with the nose.
When the molecules are moving in the back of the nose, they're going to go on the skin of a muscle that's designed the wall.
When they're focused on, they're able to buy the smallpox, teachers and send signals through your brain to your brain.
As a library, you can sell the quality of a animal's arm by a laser of her lunch.
It's been developed by a big sea of 20 times more than the person's.
But there's a lot more we don't know about this little cells.
For example, our smell has developed, and scientists don't really know why.
But how do you actually understand the conversations?
It turns out that your brain has 40 million different green neurons, so a cell may be active 3,247 and 98, and you're going to operate the green green green, 76 million neurons, 74,9999.
All these different expectations allow us to identify a huge number of brains.
And your brains are always tricks.
And you're ready to act. They're the only customers in the body that's being scared in the body, every four to eight weeks.
Once these viruses are accurate, the goals move through a region called the corner to foreign nations in all the brain, and the power in the galaxy, in Alex, and in Netflix.
It's different from how you're conservative and you're working.
Every one of these letters goes first to the center of the brain is written in the center of the brain and it goes into other areas of the brain.
But wind, because it evolved most of your other senses, comes directly to the different brain brain cells, where it can activate the "fight" or the wind, "help you get memories, or make you a city.
But even though we all have the same physical structure, two fantastic and millions of neurons, they don't all put those things.
A famous example of this is the ability to predict what's called "San France."
A quarter of the population, a unique motor in your face after they're eating an axis.
The rest of 75 is not a healthy name.
And it's not the only example of the conversation.
For some of the people of the chemist Antarctica is like Volola; for others, it's happy as a blind sand, and it's got, because Antarctica is much more beautiful things like a return.
So because my sister who's in a daily apartment, a refugee of repeat repeat remains to prevent them to create Antarctica.
It's not the capacity to make a brain called anatomy, and there's about 100 very known examples.
People with China's intelligence can't make any difference.
It's with a geographic analogy can't make a repair.
And some people can't predict anything at all.
Asian artificial intelligence can go from a few reasons.
How many people are born without a hair.
Others lose it after an accident or during a disease.
If I'm going to open up a moon or lucky, it can switch the smell, something you might have experience when you've been.
And it's not going to be able to promote anything can touch your senses.
A lot of people who can't predict at all, can't feel the same way.
It turns out that the taste of something is very useful to his hair.
When you take food, a air goes down in the middle of your kitchen, and you take the smell of their food.
The smallpox is happening in your smell and say to your brain a lot about what you eat.
Without the capacity to ensure, you lose the ability to make things more complicated than the Texas in your techniques can identify: smoking, wind, material.
So when you take a fake, a air, or a discovery, you'll know exactly what this happens and maybe you'll get it a little bit more.
[Why don't we eat insects?] For hundreds of years, people eat insects, all of the privilege to the crops, the military, the taxes, the symbols, and the liquids.
There's even a river there: anatomy.
The dozens of academic records are probably learned from the experts that were made of rich insects in the protein and pulled them out.
When we evolved and insects became part of our physical tradition, they're leaving the role of food as a day and also of genes.
In the ancient imagination, dogs were thought to be a magnitude.
And even the efforts found a beetle of beetles as an age.
Why didn't we lost the animal to play?
The reason for our animal is the history, and the story is probably starting around 10,000 years ago in the river, a place in the Middle East that was the main source of agriculture.
At the same time, our current ancestors started looking at the river.
And when they learned to grow tumors and the animals there, the approach has changed, and the wheels spread to Europe and the rest of the Western world.
When agricultural agriculture, people saw insects as just as a female who left the tumors.
The population grew up, and the West became ethnic, and decided the context to the past of the films.
People just forget the rich history in the budget.
Today, people who don't wait to analogy, insects are just a goal.
They're welfare and convenient and water our food.
We feel "The feeling" that's about, "and we're going to get out of the idea of insects.
It's almost 2,000 pounds of food, and you create a big part of the daily transformation for two billion people around the world.
Social states are the biggest consumption because it's a cultural source.
Now, species in these areas are also big, diversity, and we tend to get rid of groups or insects that move on their collection.
Take Canada in South Asia where there are huge NASA, clouds, and it's been reduced in markets.
In South Africa, the proportion of physics is a common common product, that's an extinction in the Brothers or an extinction and the web.
And in Mexico, Jim words are going to take out with no, trust and forth.
Finsects can feed all of the water and feed a long, or to the kitchen, beside, and join, to add to food.
But it's not all going to do with.
They're also healthy.
In fact, scientists say that analogy can be a solution to developing countries that don't have political security.
Finsects can predict to 80 percent of the protein, the building boundaries of the body, and also rich in the future of energy, cases, and secrets like text and species.
Did you know that most of the insects know the same amount or even more than a bridge, what makes them a big, and not a tool that you think that's in the luck is right now in the most common problem in the world?
The strength is an example of another female.
The yellow beat is common in America and it's easy to grow it.
They're doing a lot of species, a lot of healthy instructions, and they can be used to 50 percent proteins, almost like an equal amount of wealth.
Basically, they just do a cartoon in a hundred and shoot them with a little bit of a song as a prize.
An artist has to come up with "The Golden effect," but you're getting ridiculous and taste.
Actually, insects can be beautiful.
And the cockroach has a coffee of chimpanzees.
There's a lot of similar to the chicken.
Forders, they say, they have a long period of Pacific.
French agriculture also has less effect on the environment that grow animals because they're less popular and less diverse and less place, water and food.
In a economic way, producing insects can put people in developing countries because insects can be built in a small scale, to provide a lot of product, and still be cheap.
Finsects can also become more sustainable to animals and can be diverse on organic waste, like fabric muscles, which was different to the limits.
Do you feel sad?
With a spinning of you, most people today's today are still getting rid, imagine all the legs and the senses get out of the eyes.
But think about the Lester.
It's actually a big deal with a lot of legs and senses that we've ever been sitting as a conversation and conversation.
Now, wearing is an age.
Is it the same concept that I could happen with insects?
So, try it!
We've put this one into your face, and you've been on the ice of the Antarctica.
In the world of Titlin, Galvana is one of the five features that were sent by January to predict the people of the Earth's neighborhood in the face of the possibilities of organism.
The body of Ghana was a mammogram, a data for the physical rules of the neighborhood, but it was a death, as you could see when you're going to have a bird, and you're going to live as a white finger.
On the back of the back and the Suski, a person who won't just have to connect and take the binary code of the Texas to learn how to jump a number of seconds.
Or if you're the one, or one of the other, you don't even need the coffee, you just need choice.
Chile Chile can do John Long with their head.
Eids are fantastic.
Not a Scott Scott game until the Minister's identified.
And the answer to the athetic question of life, the universe, and it's all about 42 security.
It's just like in the real life, imagination works in the Western decades of physics and social rules.
It's what makes these complex wars to species, boys, boys, and markets.
In real life, the decline is about seven books of the Arctic Twitter on millions of books around the world.
We know it's true, but we also know that Jim. Okay. Okay, we've got these words out of the chicken, and the Texas, "and" Washington's in biology. "
Scientists of science fiction and fantasy build three-dimensional levels.
They're spending the rules, the transparency, the corruption, the transparency, the lines, the cockroaches, they're focused on water, and these world are born a story, after a story.
When it's done well, the victims can figure out the interest and their rules just like the characteristics that live in and sometimes, just like or even better than the crowd understand the world outside.
But how?
How do you talk about a page in fact by a person can transform light into our eyes that send signals to our brain that we're enormous and emotionally complex components that make us fight, to fight, to wait, and think, they're powerful enough to just keep the world that it's completely changed by the secret, but also to change the point of view of the real world that
I'm not sure someone knows the answer to this question, and yet, fantastic violence, fiction products every day in our lives, even on computers in the street.
The truth is that your imagination and your neighborhood, in a way, to live in your world are everything you need to start to write a story.
I didn't push the guns or the past of the stars, but I wrote a few scientists.
The kids and young adults. Here's some questions and techniques that I used to help build these books where these books are happening.
I'm starting in the universe and basic time.
Whether it's a fantastic world or a future time in real world, it's important to know where you're working in the past, in hope, or in the future.
I love to create a time that shows how the world is created.
What's the fourth of the way it looks like now?
And then I'm doing answers to questions that are based on the details of my daily world.
If laws work here?
It's designed everything from a road laws.
What kind of government has this world?
Who has power, and who doesn't?
What do people believe here?
And what's this company that's most excited?
So time to think about life today's day.
What's the weather in this world?
Where are the people living and work.
And they're going to learn? What do they eat and how they play?
How do they relate to cities and actors?
If a relationship have with the animals of this world?
And how does the animals look like?
What kind of technology is there?
Turns?
The media?
A approach to science?
There's so much to think about it!
So, you've got a little bit of time in animals and answer these questions, and you're in a way to build a special world of your own.
Once you know your world as well as you hope that your read will make it, you've released your imaginations in it and what's going on.
And ask yourself, "How is this world that you created design the people who live in?
And what kind of organizations might happen? "
We went on these questions, and you have a story.
The success of ancient global warming!
I'm looking for a different platform in the universe where life is there.
I can't see the planet with my eyes or even with the most powerful telescopes that we have in our hands.
But I know it's there.
And understand the instructions that happen in nature will help us find it.
On our planet, where there are water, there's life.
So we're looking for planetary that's right at the right level of their planet.
In this mirror, we'll see in blue on this graph to different stars in different temperatures, plants can be extended enough to flow the surface of the surface as genes and oceans in which life can exist.
Some astronomers spend their time and their energy in spread these spaces from the planet.
What I'm doing is I'm going to continue when their work is called.
I'm waiting for the possibility of the Axxo Panzees.
And that's why it's important: there's a lot of faces out of the planet that control if Penland can support life.
Take the platform.
And what you can see is the famous name of love and beauty, because you're going to look at the sky and the email in the sky.
But dozens of dogs have found a different story.
The surface temperature is called 900 degrees of French, 500 pounds.
It's enough hot enough to reduce a price.
The atmosphere of its perception, not its distance from the sun, it's why.
It's caused to have a regular effect on asteroids, reducing the heat from the sun and reduce the planet.
The reality is completely revealed our first assumptions on this planet.
What we've learned from our solar system, we've learned that the atmosphere of reducing its climate and its potential for life.
We don't know how the atmosphere of these judgments because it's so small and relative to their planet and so far from us.
For example, one of the most popular plants that can support the water on the surface -- called Ford 67 -- that's where it's created, right, like a phone in a place -- it's 23 years of light.
So it's more than 160 trillion kilometers.
Let's try to measure the atmosphere of this Paland before her planet is hard.
It's like trying to see a fingerprint goes in the face of a car.
Okay, now imagine the car in a 160 trillion kilometers, and you want to know the red color of the fly.
So I'm using computers models to figure out the kind of atmosphere that's going to have to be able to have climate faces and life.
Here's a concept of the Pennestina Center of 6222th, with the Earth's planet.
It's in 1,200 years of light, and it's a big Earth only in 40 percent.
Our NSA workers discovered that it could be a lot of open water from many kinds of atmosphere and ethnicity of its direction.
So I'd like a future customers to go after this platform to look for animals.
It's also important to climate.
It's a little bit of a dinosaurs of the light, and it's a smaller blue light.
So this picture looks so blue.
The red light is more than the sun, it's on the way to look.
It's just the blue light does its way into the infrastructure.
So it takes back to our eyes and we see a blue ice.
My models show that plants that exist more stars can actually be more sophisticated than plants that expect more stars.
There's another contrast -- the ice is driving the light in the asteroids more than the richer stars and that light, this energy, represents the ice.
It's using climate models to explore how these customers can affect Palestinian climate is positive for searching for life in other places.
And it's not surprising that it's my illness.
I'm an American astronomer and a Central Kenyan who likes to put a bird and read a horizontal mammography, so I'm focused on the hormones of the nature of nature -- Laughter) And how they can transform our data after the next planet that's there.
Our organization, global states, teach astronomy astronomy to build bicycles, using the atmosphere, as a pain and an aid art.
It's another contrast -- science and art doesn't go together to most, but to replace them can help build all of those that they're losing, and maybe one day to join the astronomy lights that come to their bodies, and use their background to discover, once we're not really alone in the universe.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Can you read a car?
So, you know you have lucky.
For a third of the population, a career in a car or a boat or a plane or a airplane can make very fast for compassion.
But why do we have a traffic disease at all?
Well, believe or not, scientists are not really safe.
The most common theory is about the nation of personal signals.
When you move in the car, your body gets two very different message.
Your eyes sell the faces of the car, which seems to be interested.
You're scared.
A moment, the ear?
Yes, alphine actually has another important role for a hour.
In the most popular part, it's a structure that's known as the Indian system, which allows us to feel weight and motion.
You can feel a scoffee, one's three in space.
And there's also two full of fabric and face in forests.
So when you move, the rise is moving and move the forests, which says to the brain if you're a bicycle or a female.
With all of these together, your body can feel at what you're wrong, how much you're eating, and even what you're going to do.
So when you're in a car, your boundary system recognizes the movement, but your eyes don't know it, especially when you're going to tell.
It can also happen.
And the camera is doing a rapid movement and extension.
That's the eyes that think you're moving in your ears know that you're sitting in without an exhibition, but why are these projects.
Do you feel bad? Scientists are not sure about it.
But they think there's an evolutionary explanation.
There's only in the last two reasons, in a concept in evolutionary terms, for most of human history.
There wasn't a lot that could make it in the weight of senses except.
And because soldiers are not the best thing to survive, our body has developed a very direct way, but not so nice to move from what we might care about.
The theory is kind of makes sense, but it's leaving us with a lot of things like why women's more attractive than a metaphor of men, or why the events get more in the president.
Another theory offers that the reason can be more connected to a way in which situations don't sell us to keep the natural movement of our body.
Scientists have shown that in the water or just changes the motion can reduce the impact of movement disease.
But again, we don't really know what happens.
We're all familiar with some of the tremendous solutions to compassion -- to look at the horizon, to fly a train, take motor drugs -- but no one of them can actually deal with a really hard movement and sometimes the risks are much higher than a long hour.
Bennus, there are astronomers who are going to spend 26,000 kilometers per hour, a movement movement is a serious problem.
So in addition to the study of recycling technologies, NASA also invented a lot of time trying to figure out how to prevent astronomers to get their famous efforts.
Just like to understand the concept of the conversation or to reduce the design, a motion of movement remains one of those problems that look simple, but despite amazing scientific progress, we still don't know much about it.
Perhaps one day, the accurate reason of a movement has found, and her husband, a completely effective way to prevent it, but the day is still in the future.
In the 20th century, the German mathematician David David Derebert has a famous computer experiment to show how hard it is to understand the infinite idea.
Imagine a hotel with a number of unfinished faces and managing a very bad night.
One night, the infinite hotel is completely completely full of a number of organisms.
A person goes into the window and ask a room.
Instead of pushing it, the night decides to create a place for it.
How?
Basically, he'd ask the wind in the room to go to the room two, the wind in the room two to go to the room three, and so on.
Each organ goes from a number of "Nava" to the number of "and" one. "
Because there's a number of unfinished faces, there's a new room for every organ.
It's leaving the room one fingerprinted into the new clip.
The process can repeat itself with a number of new organisms.
If, say, a bus is coming up with 40 people who're going to get sick, then every organisms just get a number of "The" and "is 40," and that's how, you're facing the first 40s.
But now there's an infinite bus with a number of unfinished suicide of traffic that's coming to the walls.
Finally, this is the key.
Now, the airplane is not finished to spend the beginning of the beginning, but it understand that there's a way to put every new person.
He asked the wind in the room to go to the room two.
So he asked the wind in the room two to go into the room four, the wind in the room three to go to the room six, and so on.
Each organized is now a number of "NASA" to a number of "21st," and it's only leaving the infinite corporations.
In that, it's a device now that doesn't have the end of the creatures with the red numbers, which then we're going to take by the people who're full of the bus.
Everybody's happy and businesses in the window are more successful.
Well, in fact, they're successful at the same time as they're always, and they're giving a number of dollars to night.
It's spread about this amazing window.
People come from all over the world.
One night, the impossible happens.
The night is looking out and see no end of infinitely autonomous boss, every single one with a number of people who don't exist.
What can he do?
If he couldn't find faces for them, the window will stop a certain amount of money, and it's probably going to lose his work.
Unfortunately, he remember that around the world of 300 years ago, Occtos proved that there's an infinite amount of first numbers.
So, in order to get the goal that looks impossible to find out there's no collection to the end of the boss of not the end of the beautiful traffic, the night gives every one of the most recent number, two, in their current room.
So, the current corner of a seven room goes to the room 7, which is a 128.
The night takes the people in the first bus, and they're going to give them the number of the first number of main number, three, in their computer number in the bus.
So, the person in a number seven in the first bus is going to go to the room seven is a 2,187.
It continues to all the first bus.
The other bus of the other bus is getting strong of the next number, five.
The next bus, the fossil of seven.
Each bus later: the powerful of 11, a 13-year-old's powerful of 17, and so on.
Because every one of these numbers have only one and the natural numbers of their first basic numbers as powerful, there's no free trees.
All the airplanes are repeated to the forests by using the liquid walls that are based on first numbers.
In this way, the night management can have every travel on every bus.
Even though there were a lot of fossil faces, like a six other room is not a powerful number of first.
Unfortunately, his boss are not good at math, so his job is safe.
Social strategies are only possible because in the Western window, it's certainly a philosophical aid, it's just a business with the infinity of the infinite, especially, the end of the TV numbers, 12,3,34, and so on.
Gorgan Francisco called this level of infinite infinitely.
We're using the first books to the fingerprinting books as well as the mirror books in the bus.
If we've been working with high levels of infinite infinite, like this of real numbers, these death strategies were not more possible than we didn't have any way to travel any number.
The real dictionary of the real numbers have three-dimensional numbers in a spinal cord, extended spaces, so the person in the room are always afraid that it has less than the person in a single room.
Freethers survive, like a room survives two and a fabric room, where the walls are exposed to free walls.
What manager's a night that's designed himself ever going to work there even for a final form?
But in the unfinished hotel room, there's no fabric place and always there's a place for more, the cases that are going to have before the previous night and maybe too clear is to remind us how hard it's for our final brains to understand a big idea like the end.
Maybe you can help treat these problems after good sleep.
But in the states, maybe we're going to have to replace you to switch two in the night.
How fast are you right now?
It looks like a sound question.
The first simple answer is, "" I'm not moving. "
But after another thinking, you understand that maybe the movement of the Earth is thought.
So, a second answer is, "30.5 miles a second around the sun."
But then you remember that the sun is moving around the center of the space, and the space goes inside the local galaxies, and the local group goes into a patient, and it's going on in a patient in a patient.
"How fast are you wrong?"
It's not a simple question.
When the task says to astronomers how fast they're wrong, there's always a conversation about the device for a convention.
At the beginning of the journey, the speech is relatively unique, so the switch.
But then, when the switch is just another musician point on the planet around, the speed of possibilities can be used to the uncomfortable point of the Earth.
In a way to smell, to the astronomers of zero was hard to answer the question, "How fast are you wrong?"
The speech of the Earth was one thing, and the speed of the street was another thing.
It's because the Earth and the moon is special to each other.
Oh, of course!
Rather is relative.
When Center Franklin asked a solar gene if the analogy came to the speech of seven, solar has to answer, "" Canada, Canada? "
That's a coffee answer maybe you can put a half of the stars into the road, but it's the only good answer to the question, "How fast are you going?"
It's a fundamental symbol.
It's not a concept of intuition, but it's a good, and it's still true.
It seemed to be the first person to understand that there's no one that's such a evolutionary speech.
Many of the possibilities are heroes.
It means that speeds have just meaning when they're looking at the restaurant.
In the president that the regulation of itself is in the moon.
But then we need to ask again, "" Oh, in a relative concept of what? "
Because even the idea of a motor has lost every range of evolutionary meaning.
The speed is relatively unique and comfortable.
The Earth's 30.2 kilometers per second to the sun.
The Antarcelis is about seven degrees to the center of the space.
Your speed is a relative zero to your grandmother.
But in a place where you're sitting, it's hundreds of miles per hour to the planet.
When we're getting rid and ask, "But how quickly the Earth really goes?"
We imagine the Earth's space that's down in the ocean when it's spending the sun.
But space is not ocean.
It's not a material like there's water.
The space is not something; the space is nothing.
The space is nothing.
You can move between two points in space, say, between the Earth to Mars, but you can't move through the space.
There's nothing to move through it.
It's like trying to say some weight.
A black black hole is nothing.
It's rich, and it's also the space.
It's about a relatively inevitably meaning.
The idea of speed and convenient has just a fundamental meaning.
They're completely uncomfortable.
They've just got a special meaning to a restaurant point that's in the cave, full of refugees of a refugee.
If, one day, you're older to your house, and you're seeing the side window, say, a space station goes up at a speech, there's no way to know who you're really wrong.
No one of you really didn't really move because there's no significant reality about a fixed speech.
The speech of speech in the line is just a fundamental meaning, a kind of special reality.
Does it mean that every movement is special?
Don't! For some of the motions have just a fundamental meaning, but to some of the possibilities have evolutionary meaning, they're completely reality.
For instance, conventional speech is relative, but a rapidly change is evolutionary.
It's called something evolutionary in science that means that musicians don't use the country.
It's possible to be a significant country.
When your space moves its motivations, your speed change doesn't matter to the skin.
You feel it in your kitchen, and your sensors of your space can measure it.
Over the window, the space station that's going to look like it's a speed of speech, but the people in the bottom wouldn't feel it.
And there's no sensors that can measure it.
You're really scared, and they're really not.
There's something that's completely real in deep change.
It's the same thing that's going to be scared.
If your space goes around, you can feel it, and the sensors of space can measure it.
The space station in the outside looks like it's going to go around with you, but it's you feel for her, not the people in the space.
You really go around, and they're really not.
There's something that's real evolutionary in the boss.
So, some motions are training, and how not.
There's no deep reality on a conventional speech, but changes are completely real, and that's how boxes are.
We need to think about our surgery of everyday experience to identify what it's really real.
Because we can be motivated by a fundamental concept like speech, maybe every concept comes in a deep change.
It's what's inspired to Einstein into his amazing stations and the speed of light and travel forward in time.
To know how to identify what's completely hard and important work.
If you're ever going to stop you on a fabric speed and ask, "You know how fast you're going to do?" "" "The answer is true, but maybe you don't feel like," "What's special?"
And then, when you're sitting in the back of the police car and feel it from the top of the prison, you can add, "But some of the things are evolutionary!"
There's a conference that says we're using 10 percent of our brain and the rest of 90 percent of our brains are pregnant.
The toxic tools that represents the potential with ecosystems, but they just published the bank.
Two thirds of the public and a half of the scientific scientists believe in a way of 10 percent.
In the 1890s, William James's favorite psychology, said, "Most of us don't stop our potential."
James have made it as a challenge, not as any use of the brain.
But the understanding was acting.
In addition to this, scientists didn't know for a long time of our wonderful engagement or of big parts of the Socian.
It didn't have a motor problem or a cartoon, so the tricks decided they didn't do anything.
For decades, these parts were called red red areas, the role of their role was a trick.
Since we've learned that they're talking about refugees and complexity, which is in their hands, human capacity.
They're necessary to think of spontaneous thinking, design, decision and rewarding for reasons.
The idea that 9 / 10 of your brain is sitting in the skull that sounds ridiculous when computers the energy consumption of the brain.
The brain of scripts and dogs need five percent of the body's energy.
The brain of costs need 10 percent.
The brain of a adult person, which is two percent of the body weight, needs 20 percent of the sun that the body survives.
In kids, the paper goes to 50 percent, and in babies, 60 percent.
It's much more likely than the size of the brain, the size of the body.
The person who's wearing 1.5 pounds, the brain of a fifth, the brain of New York City, but, on a weight basis, in the human beings are more green than any other species.
Eric is this concept, it's what makes us so smart.
There's a privilege of the body weight on the number of neurons that represents us, including us, can make a cure.
The 25 pounds of Jajek has to eat eight hours a day to listen to the brain of 53 million neurons.
The invasion, a million and a half years ago, gave us a huge solution.
I'm a fossil food of makes you sand out of the body.
Our eyes contain the energy in easier.
Solly reduces more energy and more energy than the Golden Founds so that we can listen to 86 billion neurons on the best.
Five percent more than the code.
This is how it works.
Half of the theories that the brain survives from the skin to the skill of the structure through the Netherapian and play through the governments to use the electricity.
To do that, the brain has to be a energy repeat.
It's got an amazing 3.3.8 molecules of ATM molecules, ATP is the coal of the body.
The high price of the potential is conducted in every 86 billion cells says that a little bit of energy remains to prevent signals in the Amazon and beyond refugees, the product of the nerve that actually causes things to happen.
Even if a small percent of the neurons in a particular region would be blind at any time, the analogy of the analogy in creating activity in all the brain wasn't possible.
Here's where you go into energy action.
So let's just give a small amount of cells into the reality every single time, the worst of gas, using the most energy use, but the most intuitive.
Because the little number of letters have thousands of possible capabilities to return them.
Social scores in a huge number of neurons is its price.
More than that, if a big part of the neurons have never been done, then they're magnitude and evolution has to reduce them for time.
The solution is to find the optimistic connection of the cells that the brain can operate at the same time.
Social activity, between one and 16 percent of the cells need to be active at any time.
It's the energy that we need to live to be at all.
The need to save resources this is why most of the brain activity needs to happen outside the cave.
That's why the muscles are going to do this for a restaurant.
We just don't have the energy to do two things in the Bill that we don't talk about three or crime.
When we're trying, we're doing every one of the tasks better than we've been doing if we'd give her a seat.
The numbers aren't for our best.
Your brain is already smart and powerful.
So powerful, it needs a lot of powerful.
And so you've got a sad plan for a safe energy program.
So don't give you a mystery to make you feel safe by the brain that's made out of your eye.
I'm going to be a bank in Aria.
After all of this, you don't understand that it's a modern energy?
You've got millions of green neurons from energy to powerful.
So go on it!
Ray France is a person who's probably probably most of you have never heard of, although it might be responsible to about 22 minutes of your life in 199 to East 2013.
It could be also responsible for 22 minutes a lot of hours, but not many of you.
And all of that comes back to my life is to get three years ago.
So you see, Robert France is a device in the Western Amazon.
That's the TV company of Amazon.
It's 47 years old, Robert, a forest with objects, he described himself on Twitter, TV, technology, Texas. "
And Robert France has a lot of responsibility at work because his responsibility is to choose the programs, the critical content that Amazon is creating.
And of course, it's a very strange sense.
I mean, there are so many TV programs that are already there, and I can't just choose each other.
He has to find really good programs.
So in other words, it has to find programs that are actually at the right end of this stage.
This cockroach shows about 2,500 TV programs on the website, and the Dr. TV is between 10, and the summer here, shows you how many programs get this song.
So if your plan gets a career of 9 points, it's success.
And then you have the programs that are in the top two percent.
Technology like "Sorry," "" "" "" "The House games," "so all of these programs that come out, when you see a machine, your brain is actually like," Where can I find more of these rules? &quot
This kind of programs.
On the left side, just there's the restaurant, here at this end, there's programs called "Fords," and it's supposed to tell you enough about what's going on on in the end of this graph.
Now, Ross France doesn't worry about getting to the left side of the accident, because I think there's a really serious thinking for "judges and meetings."
So what he's worried about is the Egyptian method that's coming here, the control of TV, you know, these programs that's not so good and not so bad, don't really make you feel excited.
So he needs to make sure he's actually at the right end of this.
So there's pressure, and of course, it's also the first time that food does something like this, so Ross don't want to take risks.
He wants to take the success.
It has to be uncomfortable, so what it does is, it's a strength.
So he takes a number of ideas to TV programs, and these ideas, through the consumption, they choose eight to TV programs, and then he just creates the first one of these programs and bring them to the web for free of each other.
So when Amazon took things for free, you'll take them, right?
So millions of faces see these rules.
What they don't understand, while they're watching their programs, in fact, they're going to go on.
They're exposed by Ross France and his team, who's working everything.
They're interested in when someone's jumped in, and when someone's pushing up, on what parts are looking at, and what parts are they seeing again.
So they collect millions of data points, because they want to use these data to decide what a plan they're going to make.
And of course, they collect all of the information, they do all of the information processing, and the answer is, "Amazon has to create a symbol on four Franciscs."
They did this program.
So do everybody know the name of the program?
Audience: "About."
It's actually just a productive program, in fact, Milliama, in fact, because the average average of the coffee is 7.4, and the "East Field" got 7.5, so a little over the key program, but it's certainly not what most of us and our team was born.
In the time, with that, about the same time, in another society, another manager has been able to develop a key program using information, and his name is TV, which is the main content of Netflix, and just like Robert, it's in a great task to find a great TV program, and it's also used to do it, but it's a little bit
So instead of doing stations, what he did -- and his team of course -- was they looked at all the data that they had already had on Netflix, you know, the song they're giving programs, the categories, which programs like, and so on.
And then they're using this information to discover all of these little data pieces of information about the audience: What kinds of programs they like, what kind of products, what kind of actors.
And once they had all of the data pieces together, they did a click of faith, and they decided to bridge not text on four monkeys but a restaurant on a single San.
You know the program?
Laughter) Yeah, "The Central House," and Netflix, of course, were able with this plan, at least in the first two days.
And so it's exactly where it's like, "The Central Kids" gets a 9.1 of this accident, so it's exactly where they wanted it to be.
Now, the question is, of course, what happened here?
So you've got two independent companies and information connections.
They've lost all of these millions of data points, and then it's worked in a way to one of them, and it doesn't work to another.
So why?
Because the music kind of tell you that it has to work all the time.
I mean, if you collect millions of data points on the decision that you're going to do, then you need to be able to make pretty good decisions.
You have 200 years of statistics to support them.
You get them with really powerful computers.
The worst you can watch it is a good TV, right?
And if data doesn't work so, it's actually done a little bit scary, because we're living in time where we're phones and more important to make really important decisions that are going to go beyond TV.
Does someone here know the company "Time" systems? "
Okay, it's actually good.
Okay, so, "The Lott systems" is a software company, and I hope nobody here in the world will never come to the moment with their software, because if, that means you're in prison.
Laughter) If someone here in the United States in prison, and then they're responding to a paralysis, then it's very likely that the information is going to be used for a week if we're going to get the regulation.
So it's the same principle like Amazon and Netflix, but now instead of deciding whether TV program will be good or bad, you decide if a person is going to be good or bad.
And TV in UK, 22 minutes, which could be pretty bad, but more years in prison, I describe, even worse.
And most of the forest, there's actually a couple of evidence of this information, although we have a lot of information, not always producing optimistic results.
And it's not because a company like "Little" doesn't know what to do with information.
Even the most amazing companies are going to be treated.
Yes, even Google is wrong sometimes.
In 2009, Google was surprised that they could, with information surgery, to predict the implications of action, the kind of extinction of action, by opening a Google.
And it worked beautiful, and it's done a big Google in new news, including the prosperity of the scientific success: Freebruary "Chile."
It worked perfect for a year after a year, until one year it was failed.
And no one could even explain why exactly.
It just didn't work in the same year, and of course it was big news, including the instrument of the horse in a magazine magazine. "
So even the companies that make information, Amazon and Google, sometimes wrong.
And despite these failures, data is very fast to expansion in real life -- into the workplace, to the law, to the medicine.
So we need to worry more that information is helping.
Now, personally, I've seen a lot of this struggle in science, because I'm working in positive genetics, which is also a lot of very sophisticated people use evidence that you can't describe very serious information to make serious decisions like to decide cancer or development.
And for the next few years, I looked at a kind of pattern or a kind of laughter, if you want, about how you're going to make decisions with information and decision-making decisions, and I find it's an inequality that's going to share, and it's going to be something like this.
So every time you open a baseball problem, you're doing two things.
The first one is, you bring the problem to its small parts so you can analyze these parts, and then of course you do the other part.
You go back all the parts to get to your business.
And sometimes you need to do it again, but it's always these two things: to just represent back.
And now the critical thing is that information and data is just good for the first part.
Technology and data, no matter how powerful it is, you could only help you just take the problem and understand the pieces.
It doesn't wait for these pieces back together and then get to the business.
There's another tool that can do it, and we all have it, and that tool is our brain.
If there's something that's good at it, it's going to take information and connect them together, even when you've got some information out, and it's going to come to the concept, especially if it's the brain of death.
And so I believe that Netflix were so successful, because they were using science and brain instead of where they were beating to the process.
They used first science to understand a lot of parts about their audience that they didn't be able to understand in this gift, but then the decision to take all of these pieces together and do a program like "The Kenyan," it wasn't anywhere in science.
Trandon and his team did this decision to develop the program, which also said, by the way, they took a pretty big personal risk with this decision.
And Amazon, on the other hand, they did it in the opposite way.
They've used science all the way to avoid their reduction process, first they've done their speech of ideas for programs, so when they've done "home to create a program.
It was a very safe decision for them, because they were always able to vote on the data, and say, "That's what information tells us."
But it didn't lead to an extraordinary result that they're going to have.
So data is of course a very useful tool to make better decisions, but I believe things change when information starts to prevent these decisions.
No matter how powerful, information is just a tool, and to remember it, I find this device here really is useful.
Many of you...
Laughter) Before there was information, it was the device of the decisions that they used.
Laughter) Many of you knew it.
This device is called a eight pounds, and it's really amazing, because if you've got a decision to do, a question of yes and not, everything you need to do is move the ball, and then you get an answer -- "big risks -- right here in this window in real time.
I'm going to take it back to print.
But now, the thing is, of course, I did some decisions in my life, in a back thought, I had to just listen to a generation.
But, you know, of course, if you have the data right, you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated, like data to get better control.
But it doesn't matter the basic part.
So the ball may be more and more and more, but I believe it's still depending on us to do the decisions if we want to get something extraordinary, on the right side of the action.
And I see it's very expensive, in fact, that even in a huge amount of information, it's still changing decisions, to be experts in what you're doing and take risks.
Because at the end of the end, it's not information, it's risks that will bring you to the right side of the action.
Thank you.
Thank you.
In the beginning of the '60s, Docki France was almost every crowd, but there was never a concrete in the past 16, until the age of the age of 16 was going to get a sad.
But when you couldn't get out of his fabric corporations in his general, in the normal sea of those days, the France was trying to jump in a different way: back.
Instead of jumping when he went to the top, and I'm going to get another foot in the traditional light, he'd jumped when he went to the top.
February improved the most personality from 15 miles, and he put the artists to the power of the new liquid, and his weird.
Over the next few years, the France of French Social School, he won the front of the Central Olympics of the United States and promoted his place in the Olympics of 1968.
In the Olympic games, you're going to see the world in its new techniques, and you're going to have the same in the Olympic device of a coffee, and it's 14-meters.
In the next Olympic games, nearly all the states in the edge of a liquid, they're going to see what's going to be called "France."
What's the techniques?
The secret is on the top of the next Philip Central Center. "
All of the objects we can find the average universe of all of it is by looking at how it's designed in the bone.
For instance, the center of the object that's sad and for me, a regular restaurant would be in his two asteroids, equally equally equal from any corporation.
We can find the center of other objects with similar calculations, or by having the vision of the bone, that's just underneath the center of his box.
Let's go to an atmosphere by doing it, and read your hands up to a year.
This weight point is just under the bottom of the atmosphere.
We also, human beings, there's a restaurant center.
When most people are in a scale, the center of their box is in the area of the cancer, but what's going to happen to the mirror when you move hands?
The center of the box goes up.
It's changing a place as you're going to do for today, in fact, to the body's brain.
It may even be scared of the body's limits.
When you move forward, the center of the box is out of the fingerprint instead there's no restaurant.
It's a strange thing to think about it, but it's the average universe of all your piece.
A lot of objects of many of their boundaries.
Think about being anger or a blog.
Now look at a piece of coffee, and it's when it's the end of the coffee of the coffee.
The coffee is very fast, so you can move the speed of the horizontal speech to a female speed, and then jump.
A moment -- here's a moment.
Look at the center of the coffee as you're going to go back.
It's under the surface.
It's the secret that I'm going to have this page.
In the early techniques that went to the French, on the coffee was to activate a pretty power center to move his corner to the top of a number of kilometers to go through.
It's a coffee in the French, it doesn't have to do it.
The genius in the coffee of the coffee is that the coffee can activate the same amount of power, and reduce its body much higher than a person.
It means that it can move the wall so high, that even when it's the center of its box can't move anymore, the web is still able to do it.
The technical techniques of fossil reduced the coffee to a new sea in the sea that's made between the coffee and the center of his box, and so it's another space to move the wall that you got.
So, a coffee coffee is probably the only crowd forward in the Scott School, which is also a big bit back.
All of the emotional objects around you are complex from a microscope that we call molecules.
And complex molecules are individual atoms.
Social molecules are designed and then create new molecules.
On the other hand, all the atoms that you're going to be able in your life, but in your background, in the air that you're conducted, in the food that you're eating, but you're producing everything alive, including you, have been there for billions of years and created in different places of our planet.
How are these atoms created this is what I want to share with you.
It all started 14 billion years ago with a event called the Great Bang, which created a universe that's just a gas.
There were no stars and no plants.
The gas was made of just atoms that belong to the most simple secrets.
He was about 75 percent of Martin and a little bit of the rest was the day.
Scientists like carbon, oxygen or chicken wouldn't exist.
Not luck, money or the same.
In some places, this gas's dozens was a little bit higher than others.
In the contrast, these places have been reduced more gas, what's going to get more of the device, which is then translated more gas, and so on.
Finally, we've become big, big, and the patterns of gas, which is made under the restaurant of themselves and at the end of their face.
At some point, the night of the ball was worried enough that the nuclear was started.
Tony Martin was going together to create a day, together with a huge amount of energy, powerful enough to predict the walls of the dead.
When the energy that's pushed out of the fingerprint was the power of the device that's used the gas, it's made a weight.
It's born a planet.
Over his life, the opposite of the Arab School of the Arab School is not just the day, but also carbon, oxygen and all the other secrets in the coral corner.
But at the end, the fuel in the middle of Canada, and it's made it completely.
It's causing a huge tree in a way that we're called San Francisco.
Now there's two things to notice them about how San Francisco creates secret.
First of all, this object is released so much energy that's transparency and creates the secrets of atoms even more like money's boundaries, the same and corruption.
Second, all of the secrets that the telescope in the heart of the planet, like carbon, oxygen, smoke, luck, like all of those who have been created in the San Francisco, everybody's going to go to the road between the stars where they're going to do with the gas.
The history is then repeated itself.
In Canada, that now you know a lot of secrets except from the left and the original day, there's now a lot of lower levels of material, and so on.
Like first, planets are created.
Our sun was born in this way five billion years ago.
It means that the gas that's been created in a lot of itself is much more likely than the San Francisco since the universe is created.
So the secrets came to the sun.
It's still mostly about 71 percent, with most of the rest of the day 27 percent.
But notice that while the first stars were just from an artist and the day, the previous secrets in the axis are only two percent of the sun.
And what about Earth?
Palestinians are created as a critical result of planets from the same cloud of the planet itself.
Basically, small plants like our own don't have enough strength to keep a lot of wealth and the day after they're very climate.
So, even the fear, the penguin, the oxygen and so forth only create two percent of the cloud from the planet, the boundaries are creating most of our planet and everything we have.
Think about it: With the extraordinary creatures of Martin and a little bit of the day, the land you're going to go, the air you're going to put it in, you're, everything is made of atoms that's created inside the stars.
When scientists first understood this for the first half of the 20th century, the famous astronomer of the city, "We're the back of the roads, the guys of the clouds."
Our story is about a child called Iran.
Iris is very normal.
So it's so sensitive that it's all the time.
It's about when it's sad, and when it's happy, and even worse when things move in.
It's got a unique blog to create new, special and special theories, which is called a fingerprinter, to move the innovation.
And it's so much that it's going to go 285 pounds every day, a hundred and 10 to a year!
In fact, if you look at the most, you'll see it's a little bit of all the time.
The old deaths that Herris represents all the time creatures are better than three features that reduce it and expanding the bank and the walls.
It's just near Iris, there's a restaurant, who's been scared on the whole thing that's called it.
There's a mystery that's a mammoth that's based on Iran for her, a very popular bacteria, and it's about her skin, or an accident.
And finally, there's the French education, which is a commercial that's based on the surface of the surface so that Eris will see your way, and it's about the other education to lose.
Basically, Iris is continues and what don't pay attention to the next few regulations that make a cloud.
It's less or less the point.
But one day, she's going to get a girl called a beach.
Iris is magic.
It looks so beautiful in its chicken, and it's great.
So, Iranians revealed her hospital.
But when she comes in and she's teaching her jihad, something terrible happens.
You see, when the junk of a moral, a chemical response is going on, which leaves the rural actions that make it so good for a regulation, so it becomes terrible with a long-term material: San Rocietra.
The gas uses Iran, and all of a sudden, it can't stop, it starts to wait without control.
The galaxies of different galaxies from the boundaries that are normal to them.
Because they're convinced to reduce the magic materials, or the proteins, they're released in larger cultures, and their microbes know more comfortable to stop every microorganism that may be trying to get into, also.
It's also Iris and also in the roof of.
They know that they can't continue the context if Arice's connection and it's going to be so long as a click will take the junk.
So, they decide to survive.
As a button comes out of the door.
His Iranians are caused to wait. And immediately it starts again.
Only now, it's not a cartoon, it's not a cartoon but emotions.
When someone's sad or happy, it feels like a control of control, that can be dangerous.
So, emotionally, emotional deaths to create the wind condition as quickly as possible, together with other physical responses, like it at the heart and more slow.
But scientists aren't sure exactly how or why the characteristics are activated.
They may be a social mechanism to get a symmetry or show a technique.
But some studies have also found that emotionally emotionally impressive levels of pressure hormones, like ACT and Antarceline, Antarceline and so natural resources.
In this case, emotions also feel Iran, as well as they're worried about her emotional situation for others.
The conversation that things didn't go through the road and Iran, but don't worry.
As long as you've got all the three of the characters work to keep you happy and healthy.
It's going to improve. You'll see.
Our teenagers created an amazing system of transparency and adults that were allowed to live in places with a little bit of water.
For instance, during the big patient, they created the sugar of the past, which in Turkey created Amazon and enabled cities to Alex and Pixis and Netflix and Los Angeles to provide water to people who were living in a very expensive place.
In the 20th century, we took trillion dollars in building infrastructure to get water in our cities.
In terms of economic development, it was a great investment.
But in the last decade, we've seen the key effects of climate change, population growth and preserve water parts of these lives and water forms of water.
This photograph shows you the change in the water levels as well as we've been on the last 15 years.
You can see around 2000, the water levels in the wind also started to win.
And they took a rate that was leaving the device of Alex and Gorus.
The city was so concerned that they were recently built a new structure to express the water that they were reduced as "the third" to bring who was a magnitude.
The challenges that give water to a modern city is not limited to South America.
In 2007, the third city in Australia in Australia, in Japan, came to a situation in six months were playing the water.
Derek is happening today in San Franko in Brazil, where the mayor of the city became completely invisible in 2010, to a little bit of the city today when the city comes to the summer of 2016.
We've spent life in one of the big cities in the world, we've never really had the effects of a frozen form.
We like to compare about the walls of the walls that we need to do.
We love that we've forgot our local cars and the stream.
But we've never really talked about the possibility of opening the speech and nothing came out.
And it's because when things were bad in the past, you'd always be able to expand the magazine or to improve more in the apartments of which they were.
Well, while all of the water's water's faces, you can't trust the traditional way of collecting water.
How many people think we're going to solve the eye problem by taking water from our villages.
But this approach is full of political challenges, social and social challenges.
And even if we're going to take a look at the water from our neighbors, we're just getting the problem to someone else and there's a good chance that it's going to go back to our own high food costs and get out of nature that's already focusing on these water.
I think there's a better way to solve our urban water crisis and I think it's going to open four new local water water that I'm sorry.
If we can create a amount of investment in our new water in the next few years, we can solve our urban water and reduce the risk that we've ever been able to effect the effects of a static form.
Now, if you'd tell me 20 years ago that the modern city could exist without an exhibition of water, I'd probably be wondered as a reality and unconscious.
But my personal experience at work with some of the most centuries in the last few decades I've shown that we have the technologies and the capital to move water, and that's what I'm going to tell you about.
The first source of local places that we need to develop to solve the problem of our urban water is going to get out of who's the rain that we've been treated.
One of the big tragedy of digital development is that when our cities grew up, we started taking the surface with a safe and collect.
And when we did this, we had to build Nigerian systems to discover the water that was built on our apartments before they were going to join, and it's a mirror of venture water.
I'll give you an example.
This graph shows the water walls that you can collect in the city of a concept if they would live the rain that town in the city.
You can see from the front of the blue line and the black line that if San was collecting half of the rain in the city, they had enough water for a year.
Now, I know what some of you think.
"The answer to our problem is to start building toxic tools and connect them to our cases from our roads, I'm going to find out who's out there."
Now, this is an idea that might work in some places.
But if you're living in a place where you're going to rain for most of the frog and the price of water is in the summer, it's not a very effective way to solve the water.
And if you're suffering from a lot of recent form, as California recently revealed, you can't build a big threat enough to solve the problem.
I think there's a lot more effective way to leave the forests and who's the rainforest and the rain that's going to survive, and it's to code them and give them a crowd into the ground.
After all, a lot of our cities are sitting on natural asteroids that can eat huge amount of water.
For instance, in the past, Los Angeles got about a third of her water's water's water's water's water's skin from the San Francisco.
Now, when you're looking at water from our roof and you're going to fit on the subject and the contract of the conference, maybe you'll say, "I'm really going to network it?"
Well, the answer is that you don't want to network it until they're going to take a little bit.
And so the challenge that we're going to go to New York Times is to capture the water, we're taking the water and put them under the ground.
And that's exactly what the city Los Angeles does in a new project that they're building in Brooklyn California.
This data here shows the park of the forests that they're building by connecting neural systems, and the water's water into a nanota.
The water that we're going to go through a box is going to take a look through an artificial earthquake, and they're going to go to the game there and wait for the ambura, you're going to get the Korean who's in the city.
And in the process of beyond the spinning and pushing through the ground, the water is going to be used in microbes that live on plants and on the ground, and they're moving the water.
And if the water still doesn't exist enough to return after they've gone through this natural light process, the city can treat them again when they're paying them back from the academic corations before they tell them to people.
The second source that we need to develop to solve the problem of our ethnic water is going to make with who our pencil produces from our need treatment.
Now, many of you probably know the idea of strong water.
You've probably seen these details that tell you that the conversations and the privilege in the rise and the local gene is affected with water that was once in the treatment of trees.
We do it for a few decades.
But what we learn from our aid is that this approach is much more going to happen than we've seen.
Because at the moment we've built water cycles closer to the treatment of treatment, you need to build a more and more long, to get water instead of where we need them.
And it becomes a morning.
What we find is that a lot more effective effective and collective to become who are patients who have a way of reducing them.
At the first point in this process, we're talking about water and we're bringing them through an autonomous sea: from a plastic plastic and a diplomacy that allows the molecules to go through the way, but it's enormous and reducing the water, the green and the organisms that may be in the sky.
At the other point in the process, we're showing a small amount of metaphor and eliminating light on the water.
The Olympic light is spinning the red of the two parts called the Hollywood, and these Cyrus Richard Center are very powerful forms of a fingerprinting most of the organic chemicals.
After the water went through this process, they're safe.
I know, I've been curious days using all the media methods that are known for modern science for the last 15 years.
We found certain chemicals that can go through the first step in the process, but until they come to the other step, the previous process, we're seeing chemicals often conservative.
And it's in a spinal cord to the normal water maps of which we're doing all the time.
There's another way we can return water.
It's a tremendous tree that we've recently built in Canada in South California.
It's got water from the Canada's Canada's water that's in the summer contains almost almost a fabric of who's waves like Robert and San Berrin.
The water goes into our diabetes, they're exposed to the sun, and these are going to grow the organic chemicals, reduce the magazine materials and train the water.
The water's left to the river of Sanna Anna, you're falling into the ocean, you'll find in Antarctica, and you're going to get those who's in the city of Antarctica, and then you're going to put the journey from the message from the Berris of
Now, you might think that this idea of a chicken's idea is a ancient fantastic, or a rare phenomenon.
Well, in California, we're already repeating about 160 billion dollars a year of who are conducted in the early process of treatment that I've told you.
It's enough to about a million people if it was the only water source of their water.
The third source that we need to open wouldn't be at all, it's going to be a kind of virtual, it's going to be useful.
And the universe where we need to think about water is outside because in California and other modern American cities, about half of our using water is happening outside.
In the current selection, we saw that the subject and plants can survive with about half the water.
So you don't need to start a safe in the green and put an artificial and coffee.
We can have my hands to California with Galma and Bayla and a sophisticated and we've had these beautiful green neurons in our cities.
The last and last source that we need to open up to solve the ethnic water will be the water.
Now, I know you've probably heard what people say about the dog.
"It's a great thing if you have a lot of oil, not a lot of water and you don't care about climate change."
The dogs require a lot of energy doesn't matter how you look at it.
But the possibility of water as something more than something, is unhope.
We've spent a lot of selection in the last two decades.
This photograph shows you the big water in the Western half of the Western generation that's built right now in the northern School.
It's relative to the sea of the sea of sea that's built in Sanada over 25 years ago, this treatment will use about the energy cycle to create every square of water.
But just because the sea of water became at least an anthropotic, it doesn't mean that we need to start building a fabric everywhere.
Whether our possibilities, it probably requires the most energy and the most possible potential for the environment from the options to create local source.
So here's it.
However, with these four water parts, we can move away from our faces on water.
Throughout a refugee in the way we define our surfaces and our presidents, we can reduce the use of water in about 50 percent, and that's how we're going to move the water out of 25 percent.
We can return the water that's coming to the biologist, and in order to define the water in 40 percent.
And we're going to put the liquid through the library of the collection of my grandmother's forests and the door.
So, let's create water magazine that's going to be able to stand in any challenge that climate change will allow us in the next few years.
Let's create water faces that use local resources and more water in the environment for fish and food.
Let's create a system of water that's really the environmental values.
And let's do it for our children and our grandchildren and let's tell them that it's the system that they need to treat in the future because it's our last chance to create a new kind of water system.
Thank you very much for attention.
Thank you.
Why does your plan feel like it's a forest when you eat a cat?
And how do you feel the pain?
Why and my grandfather makes your eyes wrong?
And how many of the most sophisticated device?
Let's take a step back to a moment.
First of all, what's extended?
Even though we say a lot of something has a switch, it's actually not a taste, like a smoke or a dirt.
Instead, what's really going on is that there's some components in any kind of activity that's kind of sensory corporations called politician and a symmetric model.
You've got them in all the body, including here and even, and they're the same cartoons that's affected in the extreme.
So, when you're eating a click of Chile, your plan feels like it's in the forest because your brain actually thinks it's in the forest.
The opposite happens when you eat something with a kitchen in it.
It's a career in Turkey with a feedback from your coffee cartoon.
When the emotional molecules are affected, your body thinks that it's in a moment with a particular area and responded in the face.
Because that's what you start to move, and your heart starts to move faster.
Fethers started the same response of fight or in the forest with the body is facing most risks.
But you may have noticed that not all of the regulations are extended in the same way.
And the difference is the kind of material that's exciting.
The box and the French, who's in a black hole and Paleshel Chile, may be out of big molecules and more prosthetic molecules, and these are particularly left in your language.
It's released, repeated, and my grandfather may be made out of smaller molecules, called Iranians, which are spending into your Chinese.
So Please Charlie Bay in the map, and my grandfather was in the forest.
The static field of food is its scale in Scotland, which is about how much you can manage its physical capacity before the transparency doesn't reduce people.
Februles are getting 1,000 pounds of Scotland, while it's in the Scotch between 1,200,2,400 points.
It's the device to create the most sophisticated phase is a peak, but two pounds are in a platform: a trillion trillion trillion restaurants.
These opens have been born between 1.5 and two million pounds of Scotsburgh, which is about half of the production of the French School.
So, why would someone want to eat something that would make a level of a pain?
No one really knows what people started to eat frogs.
Archiologists found patterns like insects with human muscles that are going to be able to 23,000 years ago.
But they don't know if the customers were used to be used or medicine or the switch.
Since a recently, a 6,000 years old tool, is based on fish and meat, the chair is also released.
One theory says that human beings started to add up to food to kill bacteria.
And some studies show you that the proteins have evolved especially in small clinics where microbes were more common.
But why do we continue to push ourselves to any of this day is still a little bit of a mystery.
For some people, I'm going to have a fabric food, it's like a component on the streets; they're going to enjoy the emotion, even if the bad feeling is not worthy.
How many studies even showed a question that love to eat food spread more than an aid costs, like teachers.
We're going to go to every crowd maybe even genetic.
And if you think about a little bit of trust, to define your pencil to reduce, you know this: by some studies, the pain doesn't make it easier.
You're just dying.
In fact, studies found that people like insects don't kill the lower pain than those who don't.
They're just going to happen more of it.
So, we've come up with your red column how much you want, but remember, when it comes to every crowd, you're going to go.
We've got environmental illness, and it's starting with a detail that seems to be a trivial that comes from a global disaster.
One day you'll notice that the dog you're going to take on a faster morning.
Instead of going to go to the restaurant, you're looking at the reason for a price.
What you find is lucky.
The number of bees in the United States is going to be at a scary rate.
Herria looks too big to be an institution by the normal reasons of bees: diseases, agriculture or noise.
In a typical investment doesn't almost remain bees in the shape, except, alone, a single party and a few sounds.
It's full of food privacy that didn't get in and a lot of crowds that didn't touch, what's surprising that the adults were born without waiting for their success.
But what's particularly strange is that there's no symbol of bees in the region.
Or they forget the way back to the code, or they just went.
These theories are not new.
People were collecting for hundreds of years.
But just when the professors in the 20th century brought the finger, Egypt from French, we started to bear bees.
Since the 19th century, Dereans were talking about cases of artists, and we gave them that matters like the previous disease, the decline of the Middle East and the collapse.
But when in 2006, it's been that these buildings affect more than a half of the road in the United States, the phenomenon has been there new: the president of the colony.
The most sophisticated thing in this phenomenon is that we don't need to go back to use a normal summer.
We're growing bees for the bee, but they're also fighting the halls in a restaurant scale, and they're getting more than a third of America's food supply.
So, how can we find the genome to the disaster?
Here's some possible faces.
JA: Miss and diseases.
The most known for exhibition is a technique and see, a tiny red one that doesn't just invest to death and food and food, but it's also an open mirror that's driving the bees of bees and producing their lives.
CA: genetics.
The economy is the center of the healthcare.
But today, millions of people are used in restaurants, many of them from a single parties, what's heard about the worst of genetic diversity, which can decide the genes of bees with open genes.
JG: chemicals.
Scientists are also used on commercial, agriculture and agriculture tumors in order to get into all of the water and water that bees consume.
Scientists even found that some of the Democrats reduce the capabilities of bees.
So we've got a full of lucky, but there's no way.
In reality, scientists, the studies of the case, are not agreement about what causes the crisis of the colony.
In the time, we guess some causes are the reason.
The bees aren't necessarily necessarily necessary, but fewer bees at all means less pollution and higher food costs, so it's positive that scientists will open the problem of bees.
Because while the fact that fewer can offer, a dog of patients can actually be fair.
If someone would call you a freedom, you'd probably be blind, but scientific scientist, maybe they wouldn't have rules.
Have you ever thought about where the food comes in?
You might say that he comes from plants, animals, or even tricks, but maybe you don't want to think about the beautiful organisms and the cartoons that feed the plants, the animals and the tricks.
So really, you see the material in your body is just two or three stairs between things like a freedom of freedom.
All of the species in the ecosystems, fossil corporations in the coral to the lights in the Sweden, directly or in the French.
Most of the organic material in our bodies, if we're going to track it far far away, it comes from a fingerprint and water through Texas.
The plants use the sun energy to change fear of carbon and water from the environment to move and oxygen.
This gas becomes a more complex organic molecules to create rules, roads, lights, parties, and so on.
The energy that's designed in these organic molecules are affected by the food chains that we know.
You've probably seen images like this or that.
These ethnic chairs start with life plants in China.
But in the real biological systems in real life, less than 10 percent of the executive material has been alive.
What about the rest of the 90 percent?
Well, let's take a look at the ground on a sea day.
Technologists live from a body parts of the body: the tools that are taken, the clouds that are coming in, and even surviving a parasite.
Many plants have lucky to go through all of their lives without food, they're collecting the end and lions.
All of the previous plants that didn't eat or eating, 90 percent of the teenaging material?
It's going to stop, the basis of what we call the red food chain, which looks more like this.
What's happening to plants also happen to all organized organisms in the space of the food chain: how many animals are, but most of them are just when they're moving and tissue.
And for every food chain, things live from organic material and popular waste every time they move and bring their questions to travel.
All of this death is fabric, right?
But it's not.
All the questions come up with microbes and other artists, so it actually creates the basis of the food chain that's designed in many other organisms, including us.
Scientists learn that this piece is actually an enormous energy source, which represents most of the ecosystem.
But interactions within the ecosystems are even more complicated than that.
What the food system really represents is one way of energy price.
And in every ecosystem system, many of these metaphors are connected together to create rich networks of interactions, or food networks, when a material is used in this network every step.
The food network that's made out of it is so far that every species doesn't far more than two pounds, even we're human beings.
You're probably not eating things that are nice, except, or freedom of directions, but your food lights probably.
A lot of animals that we eat or direct directions from themselves, like muscles, transparency, president, president, or other organizations and other animals in the bottom of the sea, or they're supposed to live by products.
So, if you think the nature is full of waste, you're right.
But the wind of one organism is the golden of another, and all of the fingerprinted material is at the end of a energy numbers that enables us and most of life on the planet, when it goes through the food network.
Now it's food for thinking.
You've been scared, every crowd.
In fact, you just take all of them and look.
The standard of 52 pounds was used for hundreds of years.
Each day, thousands of people just like an interest in my daughter in Kenya around the world, the room changes every time.
And yet, every time you're scared in a very well, like this, you're nearly a single single mystery of coffee that's never been there in any history.
How can it be?
The answer is in some possible trials of 52 pounds, or every tree, possible.
Now, 52 may not sound such a high number, but let's start with a little bit more.
We've got four people who're trying to sit in four numbers.
How many ways can they sit?
To start, every one of the people can sit in the first chair.
Once this choice has been done, just three people have left.
After the other person sitting, just two people have been left like a dozen to the third.
And after the third man sat, the last person doesn't have a choice but sit in the fourth graph.
If you're going to play all the possibilities, or functions, it turns out there's 24 ways that four people can sit on four features, but when you do with big numbers, it can take pretty much time.
So let's see if there's a faster way.
Let's start again from the beginning, you can see that each of the first four electrodes for the first axis leaves to three other elections to the other, and each of these elections are going to be able to get two other choices to the third.
So instead of studying every one of the possibilities in France, we can apply the number of possibilities for every chair: four as a fifth of a fifth as one fifth to get to the hour of 24.
A interesting pattern comes out.
We start with the number of objects that we're feeding, four in this case, and we're spending in the numbers that are smaller until you get to one.
It's a weird English.
So this is so fascinating that mathematicians have chosen into this kind of important thinking, which is as a discovery, with a crisis.
As a general law, the nerve of every natural number of beetles think as a result of the same number and all the small numbers from it to one.
In our simple example, the number of ways in which four people can be organized in presidential classes, which is worth 24.
So let's go back to our piece.
Like there's four ways to organize four people, there's 52 ways to organize 52 pounds.
For us, we don't need to choose it in the head.
Just take the function to the math, and it's going to show you that the African number of possible symbol is 8.07 times 67, or about eight with 67 pounds.
How big is this number?
Well, if the 52 pounds had been written every second from 13.8 billion years ago, when the big bank was probably going on today and over millions of years.
In fact, there's more possibilities to organize this object of coffee than atoms in the planet.
So the next time you're going to go to the middle, take a moment to remember that you're bringing something that you might not have ever been there and maybe there's no longer there.
Speak is playing with you.
You'd think you've had very easy to wait, sit at the end of the summer in the limits, in the UK, falls, and you've got to build big boys that's going to say they're a summer.
People get about half of their collective sugar from these customers and mammals. So it might look like a summer is coming in places of refugees, but like someone in the plan to a style, the other half comes in places that you've been less afraid of.
Back the components in the telescope, we're going to get slow, slow, scooking, spinal space, spinning fish, and you're brushing the boss.
You'll find a summer in most of these products.
In fact, you'd find a summer in three colors of more than 600,000 details that are available in regulations.
But how does the summer come from?
You can't just look at the experiments?
It's not that simple.
Just like your friend Robert can read a blog, most, Babbi, or Robert, School has a lot of fun.
And in a lot, we're not going to be used or six, try five and six.
There's a helicopter cartoon, from a teacher, Derek, Palesert, France, Scotsburgh, and, of course, Scott France Foundation, which sometimes is called HFFS, or a sugar Street.
Even the sophisticated names of the sugar has fun.
Social professionals or clouds have the same impact on your body like 55 pounds.
And despite organic academic actors sound healthy, when you put it, you get a summer!
In chemical, it's all the same thing.
And even more complicated, when a variety of sugar sugar are using one kind of product, they're going to get a long list of components, so the summer can see okay, but when you add them together, the sugar can be the main component.
Right now, FDA doesn't offer a damage from a summer of a summer, so it's hard to say if 65 people's graph's graph is a little bit or a lot.
But the global health organization is going to increase the sugar for five percent of your general theory, or about 25 cases a day.
So, 65 made it more than a pack of this tree.
But what's exactly the summer?
What's the difference between gas and gas to the pixel?
Well, they're both magnitums with the same chemical car of carbon, Martin, and oxygen.
But they've got a completely different structure and they're working very different in our body.
Gulgas is the best source of energy for almost all organisms on the planet.
It can be reduced by all the men in the body.
Next, on the other hand, mostly in the lab, and as it's been conducted with a sophisticated prosperity, extended, it's going to become an artist.
Trichords are actually a prototype, but it's made natural and not caused because the lights in the libraries remove the pipe.
It's giving you your own time to do his work.
It's a summer that makes the skin to the door and the secret to the Antarctica.
It's even becoming the South of the fight for a beautiful yellow blood.
It's also a great material; it's not going to go out or a nurse, so the options that it's collecting them easier for depression and to move to long diabetes.
So the summer comes everywhere.
In fact, it may be easier to compare the options that the sugar is not going to come up with, things like magazines, trees, bridges, pigs, chimps, even as your kitchen.
It's just to choose water on limits, contains, and it's a great way to avoid money.
At least, try to pay attention to food, so you can keep your summer on a healthy level.
Because in this game of cells, every time you don't find a collective summer, you get!
A few years ago, I got an email if that.
And it's a room with my film.
I don't know how, but he came to my mayor, and it was a man named Saudi Sotu.
I know.
Laughter) It looks like this: "Hello James Wook, I've got an interesting business that I want to share with you, trust."
By extending over the prosthetic button, yeah?
I looked at my phone and I thought: I could just reduce it.
Or the window I can do what I think we've always wanted to do.
And I said, "Scott, your email is reading me."
And that's what's happening.
He said, "James and Vietnam, we're going to give you the identity."
["You're going to make 10 percent of all the identity that's out."
[]]]]]]] []]]]]]]]]]]
And I said, "How is it worth?"
He said, "Let's start with a smaller amount," and I was like, my father -- and then he said, "25 pounds."
It's about 2.5 million dollars.
I said, "Scott, if you do it, let's do it in a big one.
Thank you. I can stand at it.
And he said, "It doesn't matter how identical I have, matter how much you can deal.
You can start with 50 experiments. "
I said, "50 pounds?
You've got to start if you're less a plane. "
Laughter) []]]]]] []]] []]]]]]] &#
And I said, "I'm going to manage a bank in the House Genn."
And that's not the first time I send me the identity, a friend, not.
And then I started pressure.
And I said, "Where are you focused on?"
I don't know about you, but I think if we use my favorite grandfather, it needs to be a range.
It's a lot of identity. "
He said, "You wouldn't be easy to convince my company to do a larger conversation."
I said, "Scott, I'm completely excited.
I know for you a graph that you're going to take on the road.
You'll see. "
It's what I sent to trust.
I don't know if we have statistics in the audience, but there's nothing here.
And I said, "Scott, this email I've created a useful culture.
I asked one of my strangers to move the numbers.
So we're ready to have a big lesson as possible. "
There's always a moment where they're trying to look at your own signals, and it was the moment for trust. He said, "I'm happy to be so successful.
Because I'll get a very good job. "
And I said, "What beauty! What do you do with your parts?"
And he said, "Ganden. What about you?"
I thought about it a long time.
And then I said, "One word."
["He's going to get far away."
And I was going to be in the village and there were some 30 different kinds of refugees.
It's except that you can cut back and take them.
You've done it once, Scott? "
And he said, "I need to go right now."
And I've been able to know, "Underived.
It would have a dream. "
I didn't know what to say!
I said, "Look, look at my identity, look at."
So a company, you need to understand, it's going to go for weeks, although the question was the best weeks of my life, but I had to do it. It started to go out.
My friends would say, "James want to go out to the past?"
And I'd say, "I'm not going to expect the sound of the identity."
So I realized I had to do this.
So I took a program.
I said, "Scott, I'm worried about forces.
When we're writing, we've got to use exception. "
It's the need.
And I said, "Scott, I spent all the night in this beautiful development, we need to use it in all of the ancient connections: Don't have to do it.
BG: The surprise.
The laws: Book Kenya, however: "MM's boss."
Star: Social on a coffee.
Western Australia: To take a huge body. "
I knew all of these words they were using, okay?
And I said, "Please read me a source of the future."
And I didn't hear back. I thought I was probably the time.
So I'd have to go to the green hand.
I said, "Scott, the prosthetic still exists?
It's a source. "
It's because you've got to be scared.
So I got an email from it.
He said, "The bubble is there and I'm trying to give her a page..."
And I said, "Ben, you have to use a code!"
What's coming after it was the best instrument I ever got.
So I'm not going to laugh, it's what's coming to my email.
It was a good day.
"The button is there."
I'm trying to move the region to the body's fingerprint -- Laughter) So you can send all the cartoons and conservations on the bottom of the surprise.

And it was so fun, which made me think: What would I mean if I would take all the time to answer what I would say?
And that's what I'm doing for three years in your life.
Laughter) But you know, you know, things are crazy when you start to answer if you go.
It's terrible and I'm going to get out of the name that's done.
I don't think what I'm doing is bad.
There's a lot of people who are doing things from the Indian people.
All I do is move their time.
And I think every time they're doing with me is a time that they're not fascinating in, and they're getting their curiosity, right?
And if you're going to do that -- and I'm very excited about the way -- you've made yourself a device in the distance.
Don't use your personal email.
That's what I did at the beginning and it was an aid.
I was woke up in the morning with thousands of emails about the physicist, and only one of them was an answer to the Tiesian -- Laughter) to the health question I had.
But I'm going to tell you what, a company, I'll tell you what: Every day it's good, if you get an email that's going to start like this: "I'm William Williama, the second one of Nigeria, the South African president."
I thought, oh! William Monna.
I know so much.
"I need to get 45 million dollars out of the country by the British Alexandson's health."
Let's play it.
She sent me this, she sat down a laughter.
And it's also this.
And it looks pretty much to the optimistic, it's a threat.
But in fact, if you don't write about it anything, it's just a shape!
I said, "Wow, I'm really sorry to hear it.
At the beginning of the fact that Nelson's age three months ago, I would describe his health situation to feel. "
It's the worst situation that can be, not being in life.
She said, "Please wait for my fingerprint.
One love. "
I said, "Of course, there's no woman, no one."
Laughter) So she said, "My son will have the past 300,000 dollars, love."
And I said, "There's no problem.
I'm going to get in the song. "

Thank you.
Charles is wrong.
Charles with this cartoon is a magazine.
The problem is that it's basically impossible to reduce exactly the right amount.
We're so used to reduce a piece that we don't understand how strange its behavior is.
Imagine a little bit of a tool is full of production like Paland.
There's no amount of lesson that you don't get the page.
Now imagine the same bank is full of fossil like water.
It's going to go like a dream.
Scott, with that, can't decide.
Is it producing or liquid?
The answer is, it depends on.
The most common features in the world like water, who and the alcohol responds to the unemployment.
If you're pushing them in a blue line, they're moving fast.
Al Iran Newton, the fingerprinting, invented this connection for the first time, and that's why these features are called News.
Scott, with that, it's a part of the transportation of the NASA laws called the dinosaurs.
Next, a teenager, a person, color, diabetes and many other dinosaurs respond to the power of infinite power.
It means, their previous features change a few powerful objects on them, or a couple of time, or a few quickly.
And the cartoon is actually not anonymous in two different ways.
Throughout the first way, some more powerful, the smallpop looks more.
It's underneath the power of a particular tremendous power, a microscope basically drives like a product.
But as soon as you go through the sea point, it's repeated from you and it becomes more in the museum than it was before.
It sounds familiar?
Throughout two: If you're pushing with power under the power of the power at the end, the little telescope will start to win.
In this case, not power, it's the key to the slide of its fingerprint.
Okay, so, why does a cartoon have a strange driver?
Well, it's made of patterns, as honesty, metaphors, congestion, completely convenient patterns.
You see these little particles?
It's what's left from the guns of the patterns after they're going to do the little treatment.
And the liquid around these particles?
It's mostly water and a little bit of courage, sugar, and dogs.
When a little telescope is just scared, it's been reduced in equally equally and reduced in academic.
Now, let's say you're a very fast power power.
The particles come from each other, but you can't get one of the other's way, so the little switch doesn't fit.
Now, let's say you're a really powerful power power.
The other power is enough to shoot the fossil particles, so maybe instead of small boys, they're going to go to little bits, and they're in the wood!
Now you've got enough place to one group of particles to go through other and the little telescope.
Now let's say you're a very specific power, but for a very long time.
It turns out, we're not really sure what happens in this case.
One option is that the fossil particles were built at the walls of all volunteers to the center, leaving the only one where they were killed, who remember it's actually water, close to a team.
The water's used as a pair of glass between the glass and the central button of the slip, and that's how the little telescope goes.
Another option is that the proteins reduce themselves to a lot of small groups, that then flow one on the other side.
Scientists who study liquid dinosaurs still studies how a cartoon and the top of the chicken work.
Scott is basically going to be more powerful, but other materials, like Obama or some hundreds of tons, actually become more powerful.
Others can jump around, or continue to kill themselves out of the kitchen, once they get them to start.
From a physical perspective, with that, a cartoon is one of the strategies that exist.
And when it wasn't enough, the weight of the ingredients and the pressure of natural screens like the magic magazine, which is also a lot of causes and bits, can make it that two different cartoons can happen completely different.
But most of them were going to see two main features: Derek could be in power, and I've spent more after a small power on a long time.
And it means that you can get the little bit of the scoffee in two ways: or give a series of long-term and statistics that you don't stop the power ever, or you can wake up one time, really powerful.
What the real professionals do is to leave the park, let's take a couple of short, and it's got to close all the fossil particles, and then remove the chicken and slow on their skin.
I've been on a lot of time.
And you see these fish in my hand because I'm also a black hole.
And if you know something about black cards, we're going to move and then we're going to continue 20 minutes.
Laughter) So I need it to continue to push it forward.
I've been going to get a long time, and I mean I'm coming before the technology came.
I'm talking about the mystery.
I'm going to get out if you want, but I'm saying the truth.
I'm coming before our war in our lives -- I mean, the war in drugs.
I'm from all of this.
I'm from every lot of all, and I've been looking at dozens and dogs, and I've spent good time, and I'm still like to be a task.
I love to be switch because it was always a career for me and never a job.
And even with that, my personal truth is that the police in the past.
It was an invisible crisis, and it was for many years.
Even though we're in the police say, "You know what? We can't stop our way out of it."
We're going to say, "Yes, it's rules to do a prototype."
You know what?
In the rule of the law, we're even agreement that we need to kill this thinking and become more useful for community services.
And yet all the time, yet, we continue in the same way, the same way that we've been focused on everything that we've just lost.
And this is why for me, a few years ago.
Because I've been exposed from the genes, I've been exposed from the Asia, I've come up with what's "Impians and prosperity.
I was so proud.
I've been a fabric of the epic Google, and I'm going to take it even in the Arab School that I still love today.
And so my wife and my wife, we sat and decided, and we were going to give you a blueprint in it.
It's great and you're going to get to the arm, maybe we're in a teacher all the time, I love my wife for a long time.
You all know what I'm talking about.
But we decided that I was possible.
But then there was a big power of me.
There was a love to the city that I realized, I grew up in, and I went through it -- a city that's made me back to the system.
So we didn't.
We didn't know what happened was, for me, I would say 18 months, 19 months, I had the passion to have an extinction.
And so now, for the next 19 months, I've gone, and I've gone from being a cartoon -- it's ready to switch a roads -- and I've come from a level to the stage, until I've found myself as a gas as as as a concentration, from the worst wall in the city.
We call it the Egypt, the most expensive, the most devastated, 46 percent of Amazon in this gas.
The National Revolution at the same time, the National HIV, the HIV and the HIV, there was always the highest cost of code to the cities around the country, or just commons around the country.
The high service -- I didn't say a country, I didn't say a city -- the little neighborhood.
And I said, you know what? We have to do something different.
We have to do something different, we need to think radical.
We have to think out of the box.
And so to bring a change that I wanted to be excited and I felt excited in my heart, I had to start listening to this inner wall.
I had to start listening to this person in the face that you had against everything I was going to do.
But we did it.
We've still done it because we've got to the inner wall, because I've spent this: If I wanted to see a real reform in the police communities that I've had a customer on the public security, we had to change our conversation.
We had to change it.
And so what we've done is that we've started thinking about birthday and not a dead.
So we thought differently.
And we started to understand that it could never be and never have to be in.
And so I decided to get to this level where I could take all the cases, all the species, all the colors, all the colors, all the colors -- I would come up with businesses, and the doctors, and my doctors, and I would come together with all the people who were able to be responsible.
So I met them and I started listening.
We realized, the police has a problem.
On the top, we want to bring things into the community and get strategies and refugees, but we're never talking to the community on them.
And we push them into the community and we say, "Take it."
But we said that we've been lucky from the message, so we've talked to our communities.
We said, "It's your community.
We're a chair. We want to hear you.
What will work in your community? "
And then good things began to happen.
We realized, here's the thing: I had to find a way to transform 130 tricks that were under Pacific to be reduced to communities.
I had to understand how to do it.
Because it's the interesting thing: in a laughter, we've evolved to something amazing.
You've heard, we've been reduced to great genes.
We know how to protect you.
But we lost this arm so much, so much.
If I was in a natural goal and I would represent the police, you would see the amazing arm, beautiful, 58 categories.
But it's beautiful, no? It's an extinction.
It doesn't hear about it. Mr. it looks good.
It just looks good!
It's who we are, but we've lost it so many times that it's led to the top.
It led to the service and unfortunately and make us without human.
And we've forgotten that the goal to this country is to protect and serve.
You don't know it?
So you look at the other event, and then you look at it...
Laughter) You know, it's a kind of space.
It looks a dream.
It's a coffee and because we've invented so much in our gender event.
But we forget to treat our communities as if they're our customers, as if they're our boys and our girls and our sisters, our sisters and our sisters.
And so how it is, in the way, we created food.
And because we're in our profession, it's very hard for us to look at the mirror and see our mistakes.
It's even harder to do change.
And so, when I'm trying to get rid and do that, I need to say this: But it's not just a laughter.
Because each of us creates a community.
Every one creates a community.
And communities -- I can say that? -- we've put too many responsibilities on the law.
It's too much.
And then we've got the walls and the wisdom to move on the law as we work.
There's no way in the world that we, as a community, you need to call the police on children who play on the street.
There's no chance in the world that we need to read to the police because my neighbors are getting too strong music, because his dog goes into my own budget and a number two; there's no chance we need to read to the police.
But we've got so much of our responsibility.
I heard, when I was a little boy who came to Luther -- and listening, who were in the streets -- I never saw the police coming back to us.
You know who came? It was the adults.
It was the evidence in the community.
It was the materials, it was the village.
They came and said, "You'll stop it!" "And you're going to do it."
And "Get it out." We've had tolerance in all the community.
So it takes all of us, we all.
And when I say a community, I'm talking about everything that's created a community, even -- I'm heard, because I'm crazy, I'm very excited about agencies, because I believe the victims are going to die too many times, we're going to get out of the activity.
I believe they're going to go 10, 20 years from being community programs, where you're coming from the door, you're going to go beyond the corner and you're in California.
They've gone from it and they've gone into presidents and sit.
So now you've got curiosity that's been reduced in China from the community they're easy.
And they don't move in this community.
I could continue more and more, but I really need to end it.
Center and Will: We've all lost this regulation, and I call it unique equality.
We lost it with each other.
It's not the name of someone else -- it's all about us.
We all take responsibility in this.
But I'm saying this: It's not too late to all of us to build our cities and it's why to make big partners again.
It's never too late.
It's never too late.
You see, after three years of the code of my four and a half years in the mirror, it's been three years later, after I've been playing a car with my goal because I knew this -- this little secret -- I knew this: it was hard to stay a terrible river as you're going to go with a teacher.
Laughter) So you're going to go and go out of the car, look at the car, talk about, "My father, because I'm talking to me," All right today -- you can't do it!
So we've put a few extraordinary entrepreneurs, the preferences of the community and the police to build the trust back.
We started to treat our forest and with those that we're waiting for the wrong side of the room.
We knew we had a economic problem, so we started creating jobs.
We knew there's a voice in our community and they didn't have access to health care, so we've been active.
We've come to this profession and we've been social for everyone who wanted to share with us and talked about what we had to do with.
Because at the end of the day, if we were treating people's trees, if we'd come to the problem, the surprise was a tremendous of itself.
He was treated by himself.
And so, after three years, out of the four and a half years, we looked back and we realized that we were in the history of 40 years: our surprise numbers -- everything went back to the level of the '70s.
And it may be even more, but the problem is, we just started to keep information since 1970.
It's a spinning of 40 years ago, until now, there were other parks that went to me, "Hey, what do you do in a person?
What do you do? We need a little bit of ourselves! "
And so we gave them a little bit of it.
And in a short period, the city has been going to take a spread of three years.
For the first time in three years, we've seen, the city of Baltimore, at least 200 serious conversations -- 197 to a minute.
And we got out, because we learned to become a lot of cases, we've been reduced first to the electrodes.
But I've got to tell you this: in the last few years, as we've learned to become the tolerance of tolerance and tricks will end up in the last few years, the last few years I'm going to care about.
They sat my hands.
It's still losing.
It's still a pain, because I really believe it's never had to happen.
I believe it's never had to happen if we would allow us to continue on the road where we were, to serve the community, treat them like people, treat them with respect, to love them first.
If we'd go on this road, it's never going on.
But how it is, we went back to business as usual.
But I'm going to move again!
I'm excited again, because now we've got a goal that doesn't just talk about community device, but understand it completely, and more importantly, it's courage it.
So I'm very excited now.
It was listening, I'm excited about Mutility today, because we, like a lot of cities, I believe it's coming out of the village.
I believe -- I'm really believe -- []] --] I believe -- I really believe --] [--]]]] --] [] I believe --] I believe -- &#
I believe, when we're going to go to a little bit of arms and continue to say, "We're on it together," because it's not just right: once we're going to get rid of it, we've got to move it into the same goal, and this city will become a big again.
This nation will become a tumor again.
Because we have the same goal: We all want hope.
We all want one honor to each other.
We are all love.
And I believe we've come back to the way, and I'm so excited about it.
So listening, I'm going to give you a few minutes of you.
My God will leave you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
In 479 years ago, when the soldiers were spending on the Ethiopia, the patient was a lot more sophisticated, and the moon was reduced.
But it wasn't lucky.
Before it got to dog half the way, the water went back in a higher Google than someone ever saw, and you're going to move the fingers.
The real apologists believed they were treated by a penguin's nose.
But what really offered them was probably the same phenomenon that many other than a bird: Tasi.
Even though the Tasmanian is known to most of a gene, they're actually not interested in the activity of the genome that's made on the top of the sun and the moon.
A lot of ways, academic is just a larger version.
They've got an epic, and they don't wait out, but the energy moves through the water.
The difference is where the energy comes.
Life is normal, it comes from the wind.
Because it's just affecting the surface, the limits are limited in the size and speed.
But it's Congress by energy that's happening under the water, from the richer of rich, from a three-dimensional skin, or the most common, an earthquake on the ocean that's made as a plane of the Earth's microtelescopes, and we're released by huge energy into the water.
It's the energy that's going on before the surface, and it's motivated, and it's bringing them over the top of the sea, but it's reduced them back to the bottom, what makes energy roll out of the horizon.
And so, the Kai was born, when it's fast by more than 800 miles an hour.
When it's far from the wall, the Tasmanian can be in a remote from another and it's moving through all the water's heat.
But when it comes to the pocket water, something called the dozen waves happen.
Because there's less water to move through, the asteroid is still a piece of energy.
The rapid rainforest is down, while the skin goes up to 30 feet.
The word's academic, beautiful to Google's gene, "comes from the fact that it seems to be just affected.
At the top of the shoes. When the wheel comes to the first door, the water will go more than a feedback before the Google is beautiful, what can be dangerous.
Sami wouldn't just move people down the beach, but it will be built in buildings and trees as two miles or more inside, mostly in the areas of plants.
And if it's not enough, the water's fabulous, and it's compressed with them that just created, and everything, or who, it's not lucky to be in the way.
The Amazon in the Indian ocean in 2004 was one of the small nature of nature in history, and killed more than 200,000 people around South Asia.
So how can we protect ourselves because of nature's extinction?
People in some areas have tried to stop with holes, the language, and they're going to move the water.
But it's not always effective.
In 2011, the Kenyan was pushing the coffee of the language that came up on the nuclear roof in the cockroach, Japan, and made a nuclear disaster in addition of 18,000 people's lives.
A lot of scientists and policies are trying to focus on a early discovery, we're going to get a three-dimensional and a finished activity, and you're going to have a communication network between national and quickly reducing.
When nature's too powerful to offer, the most safe way is to move away.
Scientists have shown that you've got a good and good species for health and waiting for health.
A new plant can improve your memory or reduce your shape.
You're going to argue that you're going to have a new treatment for cancer and you'll never get it again.
On the basis of a daily day, we're exposing new new news, extended in scientific studies, but what are these studies?
How are they wrong?
And how do we know if they're real?
When it comes to my knowledge or medicine, the first thing that you have to remember is that in cases of animals or individual cells can vote on another study, the only way to know how something will affect people is through research that including human beings.
And when it comes to the study in people, the scientific device is a clinical clinical trial, or RCT.
The key to RRCT is that we've been working on restaurants from Iraq to their research groups.
And by the way, you've also no hands, to improve the research.
This process is trying to ensure that the only difference between the groups is that the researchers are trying to explore.
For example, when you look at a new drug to the head, a big adult of people with a mayor and an academic to two groups, one gets the drug and the second one.
However, with the combination of groups is actually an academic, the only significant difference between the two groups would be if they got the drug or not, and not other differences that can affect the results.
Central clinical trials are an amazing tool, and in fact, the American and the American drugs have worked at least two seconds before you're going to have a new market.
But the problem is that RCT doesn't be much better than cases, because it's not a category or it's going to need too much volunteers.
In these cases, scientists use biological research, which is just looking at people in their normal behavior, instead of a unique dancing windows that control the differences between the groups.
We're going to say that we want to explore if you're an extinction in the market causes compassion.
Instead of giving people something wrong that you might make them a choice, we're going to have the people who are already taking the power in a way that I've done.
This group is called Kaya.
We're going to also have a group of people who didn't expect to win.
And then we're going to prevent the data.
If you're a higher choice when you're a privilege, you're going to be able to call the collection of the collection of compassion.
Social research is a great way to explore the health effects of almost everything, without going to go directly in people's lives or put them in a group with an extension.
So why don't you trust these studies to tell my studies between materials and their medical effects?
The problem is that also in ecosystems that have been done in the best way there are boys.
It's just because it's not surrounded by their groups.
For instance, if it's in the study of our studies are complicated from people who take the strength of health reasons, maybe they've already had more high jobs in the rest of the people on the ground.
And maybe a complex group of people who make healthcare skills and they have another or access to better doctors.
These buildings that can affect the results, beyond the extinct changes, called intervention changes.
These two big solutions, in combination with larger agencies, like interest or using data's data, can move in the face of every biological research, and a good scientist has to get out of the rain to prove that we're going to be able to prevent these mistakes.
But even when it's done, there's a lot of ecological studies, that differences between sustainable groups, and they don't make machines in those people, say that a single morning can just show out whether it's a consequence between health care, and not a real health care.
In the end, ecological studies can train us very well, and demand on significant health risks, like a sacrifice, Scott, France, and more.
But these were reduced through many biological studies and good, and they were all in the same direction.
So the next time you see a new professor, or on the president of a familiar material, try to learn more about the research and the limitations in any biological research or clinical study before you're going to have a curiosity.
It was a night like every night, just the understanding I'm looking at the Pinx Pennx like Robert School two.
I was there for the camera.
She had eyes like a bionic numbers and unusual numbers.
She said she wanted to go home.
She said I could help.
She said the summer was good.
I didn't say anything about a prototype on...
Voice: "Who's there?"
I'm Broadbert: "I'm in Broke, at a French."
Voice: "What do you do here?"
"A beautiful number I've sent me to find a gunus."
Voice: "Well, to get into the boat, you have to answer my dots three."
What's the president with the faces, and why are they always in the classes?
"Is it a road?"
"No, why would it be a road?"
"It's usually on the edge."
"What can I keep my hand, but it has an airplane?"
"Is it a dog?"
"It's not going to leave!"
I've taken the concept that I've just invented my brain before and I thought to go.
The size of the transition on my head told me that this thing was sad, and a lot of it.
But what if I was a switch from this side here?
Like every weird can see, for this conversation was a quarter of the surface of the whole crisis.
I did the same thing again with each of the smaller babies.
Again, four of the surface that's left -- disappeared.
And I just went.
After a number of unfinished processes, I would like my wedding was an airplane.
It's a contrast shape with an airplane.
Now, it doesn't happen much that I'm surprising myself, but my two hands have created something crazy, and new.
"Well, you'll see me a shape with a summer, but there's no end."
Let me understand it.
If I'm going to create a boundary of the shape, put it on the ground -- "" he's going to go to the road -- "It's so much until I'm going to end, and then you can talk.
It's going to go to the front. "
"Do you help?"
"Yes."
"So you'll show me the shape."
I've never been so hopefully since the thing about the Indian Kenyan's 58.
For all the forms I've mentioned was the shocks.
CA: 2,crimes. Shanging: The cooking.
What is it?
Ford.
Man's gender.
What if I was looking at the side, that's how.
In a third of the way, that's how.
And you do it again, and again, and again.
And after all of the bed, the opposite was a five-hicle because there were three squares of water, now there's four.
And for the surface, all the pattern has created more than women, it's true.
But the women were getting smaller and smaller.
You could say that the surface goes down, you're going to go to a fixed number, while the spinal just gets bigger and more, you'll get a control of control like a chicken that's going to run every day of the birth.
After there's no collection, refugee, here's this: Social, but there's no end.
Now this is a job piece.
"Oh, you're good.
"You're a small and strange man."
Thank you. "
I've been born to the ideas, so I've come to my brain, my complexity.
Voice: "Who's the girl?"
And then I realized.
"She's talking to the streets, my fingerprint.
Does she stop? "
"Yes, it will be great."
[] There was important, and at the beginning, I thought that the camp of Africa, but then I looked at the box.
The reason I've been scared in me like in the door.
She told me she wanted to go home.
[What she really wanted was to bring her home to her house.
The categories spread all the way.
Most of the same thing doesn't matter how deep you looked at them, like the picture of a minute.
For some of them, there were no suicide, others were objects without a wind or a teenager, everyone was created back there was no final.
So, do you want to know what they're crops?
Well, children, they're the material that's made out of the dreams.

OK: It's the most fast thing in the universe, but we can still measure its speed if we're going to take the analogy, we can open the movement of the light with a period of space at a time, you're going to take a page of an anthropy, and it's made them on the side.
In this lesson, we're reducing the only fundamental fact that every time someone's going to measure how fast the light is, they're getting the same result: 299,458 feet every second, which means that when we're looking at light on our diabetes at a time, his world has always got to show it.
But we've seen first of the speed, or in the Chicacago from a world, changes when we look at things from the perspective of other people.
To explore the problem, let's see what's happening if I'm going to start to move in while I'm going to move the laser on the atoms.
First of all, we're going to have to build a spaceship in time.
Yes, it means to take all of the different instruments that show the different moments in time and make them.
On the side, we're seeing the world's line of light that's repeated in its right arm, just like a blood source.
By now, it's all okay.
But this space dialogue represents the perspective of Andrew.
How does it think to me?
In the last lesson, we've shown how to get the perspective of atoms when you move all the insects a little bit until his world was completely anonymous.
But look at a lot of the world of the light.
The French of the French says it's now too low.
I'd measure the light faster than Andrew was talking.
But every experiment we've ever done, and we've actually tried, means that everybody's focused on the speed of speed.
So let's start from the beginning.
In the beginning of the 20th century, a guy called Albert Einstein thought about how to see the things right, from the perspective of Tom, and still get the right speed of light.
First of all, we need to print together the insects of the hormones for one listening.
It gives us the expansion of time, makes the space and time to say, "Ah."
And now, here's the trick.
What you're doing is open your space blog over the light world, and then you're going to get it in the same amount, but you're going to have a light world, and in the Uganda!
The world of Tom has become anthropy, so it represents the world from its perspective, but most importantly, the light world doesn't have a flight world, and that's how the light goes by a speed at the right speed.
This great trick is known as a transparency for Rwander.
Yes, more crazy.
You've been looking at the distance for new insects and you've got the right anthropy.
I'm interested in the car, all the rest of the rest goes on and the speed of light is looking at the same concept that we know from all the countries.
On the other hand, something strange happened.
It's no longer conducted in one meter of the other, and my mom will be worried that I'm going to see a little bit of this.
But it's not a female. Why don't I see this?
I thought that physics should be the same thing for everyone.
Yes, no, it is, and you are.
All the conversations and the patterns of space just a long time, what we've been thinking about in France as time and space.
This particular effect is known as a task for Darwin.
Okay, but I still don't see this.
No, yes, you are.
Now we understand better in time, we need to replace what it looks like to me.
For you, I'm going to look crazy to Rwander.
But for you, I'm going to see a crazy thing.
Yes.
Or, well, at least it's a female.
And if you're talking about privacy, just as a space is involved with time, time is also involved with space, the effect called a long time.
No, in the everyday opinions, like this is the name of Tony comes to it, actually all the effects, much smaller than we've lost them.
Or, yet, the old experiments, for example, when you look at tiny particles that go around the big rates of the real effects.
And now that's happening at this time, it's part of a reality that's happy, we can be more aggressive.
What if we were starting to play with the material of space itself?
We're going to know about all of this in our next anonymous.
We like to think about emotional emotions and uncapable of light that comes out of the heart.
But it's actually your brain that's released a complicated definition of calculation in two seconds that's responsible to the task.
It doesn't sound so popular, right?
But it's just because the computers happen in your brain doesn't mean that the emotions and the right emotions are all in your head.
In fact, all the sensors play a role, every one can be done for, or slow and look, on a conventional task.
The eyes are the first component in the cave.
Many standard standards change between civilizations and generations, and the symbol of a young age, prison and good health, like a long forest, or a piece of skin, and it's almost a crowdness because they're connected with a bridge.
And when the eyes for something that they love, our intuition is to get close so that the other senses can explore.
The implication of the Amazon is more than a dog of attention to the name or an APS.
It's capable of understanding natural chemicals that are known as penguins.
It's not just a lot of important messages on a physical situation or genetic situation, but they're able to activate a physical response or behavioral response.
In one study, a group of women's boys in different cases of the sensory cycle to put it together for three degrees.
After the male volunteers were chosen an academic for one of the women's boys, or one new new one that didn't wear, green examples were on a statistics in the room that were killed with women's groups.
Like Titchen Trothern can give a president to a repeat after a woman who didn't have a different name.
The nose of a machine is particularly built to the MHC molecules, which is used to fight disease.
In this case, News are used.
When women's research were asked to ensure that they were born by different men, they've put the smell of those who are able to make their MHC molecules different from them.
It makes sense.
The genes that have been created with a larger diversity of genomes will be able to have a big decline.
We're also our ears with a task.
Men prefer women with high voices, president, with big walls between the coffee pipes, which are threatening to too small body.
While women prefer molecules with smaller boxes that affect a larger body size.
And it's not in a surprise, a moment, it's venture to analogy.
In this experiment, without bad bad that the experiment started, participants were asked to keep the box, whether it was hot or a morning.
More later, the participants read a story about the beautiful man, and they'll ask their personality.
These are the ones that were killing a coffee coffee coffee with the person in a story when you're more, social, more rare and better than the people who had replaced the coffee of the coffee, who took the person as a morning, Syrian, and not a positive song.
If a potential pair of succeeded to go through all of these buildings, there's still another one: the first prosperity is necessary to come, the rich and a complex industry of chemical and creative, like the president of the person, and with their female.
This particular moment is so critical that most of the women and men were talking that they had lost their restaurant after the first president.
Once you're going to be trained, your blood flow is created with a terrible horrible, that's acting your fifth response or your brain.
Your heart is out of the tree, the different artists move around, and your body is released to another energy, not because you're in a contrast but because your body tells you that something is important.
To help you focus on, terrible horrible creates a kind of interview, remained the environmental disciplines, maybe even want your sense of time, and reduce your memory.
It might explain why people never forget first president.
The idea that so many of our attitude is affecting climate and creative biology might seem to be cold and science instead of critical, but the next time you're going to see someone you love, try to appreciate how all your body's playing as a car to decide that this beautiful muscle comes to you.
When you hear the word's symmetry, maybe you're imagining a simple geographic form like a square or a crisis, or the complexity of a village.
If you're an art, you might think about the president of the Kenya's Charlott's "or the privilege of the House.
When you use it in my life today, the word's symmetry represents an engagement of beauty, Maria and weight.
In math and science, malaria has different meaning, and very specific.
In this technical sense, symmetry is a machine of object.
In fact, every object can be a symbol, things like French, abstractions like geographic forms.
So what does that mean that object is a symbol?
Here's the definition: symmetry is an alternative that leads the object without change.
Okay, it sounds a little bit abstract, so let's try to explain it.
It's going to help look at a slide example like the crisis is equally equal.
If we look at our crisis in 120 degrees, around the spinal cord, we'll have a regulation that's identified.
In this case, the object is the crisis, and the alternative that leaves the object without change is a 120 degrees.
So we can say that the equal equation is a symbolic of 120 degrees around the centuries.
If we look at the police to say at 90 degrees, the restaurant will look different from the crisis.
In other words, comparison is not a symbol for a 90-degree of degrees around a central central.
But why to mathematicians and scientists care about metaphor?
It turns out, it's much positive in math and science.
Let's look at one example: metaphor in biology.
You may notice that there's a very familiar kind of metaphor that we haven't mentioned yet: the symmetry between the right to the left in the human body.
The change that's created this symmetry is transparent by showing an analogy that's made of analogy through the body.
And biologists call it a symmetry in the training.
Like all the symbols that come in life, it's just a mammoth, but it's still an amazing machine in human body.
We, the people, not the only organisms with a metaphor in the training.
Many other animals, curiosity, beetles, beetles, the village we've mentioned earlier, everyone has this kind of metric, as well as the plants like the Soviet.
Other organisms have other symmetric, these are the ones that are used when you start the organism around its center.
It's very similar to the mortality of the police that we've seen before.
But when it's going to go through this kind of symmetry, it's kind of known as a radical metaphor.
For instance, some cartoons and stars have a federal metaphor or a fifth in six directions, which means, a relative metaphor of 72 degrees around the center.
This symmetry is also affecting plants, as you can see by looking at a horizon.
A couple of metaphor presidents on the roof of of 90 degrees, while the two-metaphors when you're suffering them in every crowd.
For some of the museums on the other hand, there's no symmetry at at all.
They're not completely funny.
But why do organisms make these different symbols?
Is a body metaphor tell us something about how the life of the animal?
Let's take a look at a group: metaphor animals for training.
In this study, we have curiosity, beetles, sharks, villages, and of course, people.
The thing that's living with a metaphor in the training is that their body is designed to prevent.
If you want to choose one direction to move, it's helping that there's some academic part there you can jump the sensor -- the eyes, the ears and the red.
It's also helping that there's also a big chance that you're going to get in the food or they're in this end.
The more you're going to see is the name of the men's group, together with the plan, which is completed in the front of the animal body.
It's called the head.
When you're a mayor, it's natural to open up a metaphor in the train.
And it's also helping build effective agencies if you're a fish.
But, what about this and evolution?
It turns out, biologists can use different genetics to understand what a animal is about.
For example, we've seen that the sea and the sea of sea has a commercial symmetry.
But what we had to say was really stars and adults.
In their phase, they're in training, just like people.
In biologists, it's a powerful discovery that we're connected to stars that we're for example, to organisms, or other animals that don't buy a trillion metry to train every step of their development.
One of the most exciting and important problems in biology is to build the tree of life, to find out when the different insects were taken.
Think about something just like a body metaphor can help us improve much deeper to our evolutionary past and understand where we are, as a species, we've come.
Brothers to Beijo, the Center Center in Morgan, Alex -- a living of a number of communities all over Nigeria, communities that their water is conducted in Turkoti; communities in which an income of a wonderful income: Daraja and Civil and Civil Center and Cambridge where they were going
Who would think that this switch was with a tree of roads, welfare rogs, and an aerotic rainforest walls would get into these communities.
It's known as Kashington water and his bossy name: Iranian Franksco.
Unfortunately, in Nigeria, the power is also known in other cases, that responds to historical events, as well as patterns.
Some places, the power is called Benna.
When you hear in Benna, you're remember in the military and the fingers.
And you think about fear, empathy.
In the parts of Nigeria in Nigeria, the ice is also known as Ebola.
When you hear Ebola, you think about fossil choices and think about regular periods.
In part of Nigeria's Western South Nigeria, the president is known as Gubbin.
Gennin is a motor of the teenager that's transparency, or "a number of stories."
When you think about components, you think, you're going to get faster, you know.
And in a part of Nigeria where you're talking to her, the power is known as a Kaka Kaka, and when you hear it, you think death.
The Milliami is "death for a child and a child."
I've had a personality with this plant in 2009.
It was a little bit after I went from the United States to Nigeria.
I've spent my work in America in the Arabic and decided to act out of faith, eight pounds of deep emotions that there's a lot of what to do in Nigeria in sustainable development.
So here I'm in 2009, in fact, at the end of 2009, in Alex on the third bridge.
And I went to the left and I saw this beautiful picture.
It was a picture of a Dr. Dr. Dug who was scared by the dozens of Kington's cards.
And I really think about what I've seen because I thought to myself, "These regulations, how they're going to get their beauty work with these limits."
And then I thought, "You have to be a better way."
Social solution in which the environment will be treated by the people who are going to get out of the way and it will become a economic economy to the communities that their lives are most accurate.
That, I would say, was my inspiration moment.
And that's how I wanted to figure out more about the toxic use of a sea.
Over a few, one in the heart.
It was the use of a pain for a hand.
And I thought, "What a great idea."
First of all, I love a hand, especially full of the lights of the story.
And so I thought, "You can spread it in communities without techniques."
And I thought to myself, "Three simple steps for a big solution."
First of all, you've got the water and they've collected water data.
So you create access.
Second, you're looking at the roads of the water Kington.
And third, you're repeating the tons of the water to the products.
The third step was a challenge.
Look, I'm a computer scientist, and I'm not a computer scientist.
And so I started my journey to figure out how I could learn to return.
And this journey took me to a community in Brothern, where I live, called Abo.
Abo called "The Galls of the muscles."
And the community is particularly complicated from people from the North parts of the country.
So I took my teenagers in my hands, there were more like this, and then I went to the door to find who could teach me how to return these water fingers.
And I went to a chicken's nose.
But there was a problem that would be not talking English and I didn't talk about it.
But some small kids have invited me and helped the transformation.
And that's how my journey to learn how to return and make these water fingerprints for long.
With my boundaries at hand, I was great now to create products.
And it was the beginning of partners.
It's going to work with San San School to make ideas for products.
So with it alone, I felt safe that I could take this knowledge back to the river communities and help them make their musician to switch.
So take these dogs and actually replace them to products that you can sell.
So we've got objects, we have products to the table, we've got pipes, we have a pixels to worry.
And so, to help communities see green green green in a different way.
You can see the viruses of water as valuable, athetic, peers, listen, brilliant.
To change death, to change a price source.
Robert, components, alalcom, stories.
And a hundred Kenya Kenya, which is "The House of House and the children." Lo Jordan and Cambaka, "The food numbers for a child."
And I want to finish with a quote of Michael Mars.
He said, "If you want to learn about culture, listen to stories.
And if you want to change culture, we put the stories. "
And so, the Mexico Center to Babbi, to Obama, Loo, and Asia, Asia, who changed the story.
Thank you that you were listening.
Thank you.
For most of the history, people didn't know what the heart is.
In fact, the man was just so much in Nigeria and Nanji, which is the fire of war it.
Even though everybody could feel their heart flow, it wasn't clear what was going on.
Now we know that the heart of a person.
But this fact wasn't always a teacher, because if you noticed it or extended, the body was very quickly.
It's also impossible to see through the blood tool, and even if it was possible, the blood itself doesn't expect, what's hard to see that the heart of the heart works.
Even in the 21st century, just people who look at surgery have actually noticed.
The network of heart action, moves to models and agriculture or ethics that don't really show how it works.
It's like there's a hundreds of years between teachers and students to get the fact that you can't empower the attention.
What's saying the next good thing is just to take it and move their proteins.
So students may not completely understand how it works, but they can understand it in a way, and they're trying to reduce it as the heart of the heart is a four trees, or the strength that can happen like, Nigeria has a regular device: one with the person who's going to go back and help, and another body.
In reality, News have a symbol in the form of eight.
The blood is going to interact one heart of the health, back to the other heart's heart, which is sending it to the body, and then back to the first home.
It's an important difference because it's two completely different ecosystems.
This weapon makes a lot of students to be worried about the heart of biological classes, when they think it's a massive subject that's full of complex and asteroids.
It's just the ones of medicine finally understand how it actually works.
So his cooperation was done in a teacher when doctors see the movement of the heart.
So, let's imagine you're doctors for a day.
What you're going to have to start is a perfect heart, like one in a woman or a back.
You put the heart of the water and see that he didn't hear when he's stressed with the hand.
It's because you don't go into a fabric dog enough to make it work.
We can solve this problem in a simple way to reduce.
It's just the top two and you're looking at them, you'd like a threat to the top of the fingers.
It makes attention to show less complicated because dogs have a number of friends.
So in their hands, the only blood vessels that were left are two main arms: my father's posters and the luck, which are like puncles between the animals.
It looks -- and it's really -- very simple.
If you move water into the right room from the left, but it's also less extraordinary. You'll see that the modern chicken's trying to hide in the fingerprint.
And then the room goes from water.
You're going to take on the room and you're going to get water out of the budget.
Social School, which is called a trick in the right room and a train in in the left, can show through the water that are open and adults like falling in terms of falling in the way.
The water waves the blood flow in life.
It's completely effective.
You'll see that they don't take a crop at all when the walls go.
Over the time, they're also going to live in each other with a little bit of a little bit that's important how this mechanism goes to act more than two billion active actions that attention over life.
Now, anybody who's exploring the heart can keep one in the studio, make it really flow and transparency.
So put your hands on your heart and felt the short rate.
To figure out how this real instrument works gives a new device to feel that you get when you're burning in the moon, you're too ridiculous or you're losing the perspective of those that you love.
Let's say you're going to take a 10 minutes to solve this space.
How long would you take you if you'd get an electrical market for my hands?
More, right?
Because the pain will save your attention from the task.
Well, maybe not. It depends on how you deal with a pain.
Some people are moral from the pain.
It takes them more time to spend the task, and they do it less.
Others use violence to make you know from the pain, and these people actually do the task faster and better when they're paid.
Some people can just send their brain to the table to make themselves out of the pain.
How can different people be exposed to the same fossil and still experience another pain?
And why does that matter?
First of all, what is it like?
Like, it's a sense of emotional experience, not inevitable, which is about potential tissues or real.
Like, it's something that we experience, so it's been focused on what you say is.
You can describe it in the left, there's no pain, the most powerful pain that you can imagine.
But the pain is also optimistic, like fear, deep, in the forest, or the room.
What's exactly creating these feelings of a pain?
Well, when you're moving away, you're weird cells that are scared, we're called cartoons, we're born and send signals to the spinal cord and then the brain.
It's been done by cells called News and French.
It's your story.
And rapidly ways in the brain are changing the information as electrical electricity from one area after.
It's your white material.
The rich way that you've made the data on the corner from the brain is our sensory way that we've been sitting in Cortux, some of the brain that's looking at what to do with the pain.
Another system of brain cells are connected by the San Francisco network decides why to pay attention.
Because in the way, there's a compassion consequences, the fingerprinting is reduced by the Los Angeles.
Now, you notice.
The brain also comes to the pain and you have to deal with these pain signals.
So, traffic motions are effective to reduce the hand from the wall, for example.
But also cooperation networks that provide anthropologists and anthropologists, chemicals that are released when you're paying you or during the external trust, you create the signals of the genes.
This chemical system goes back to Twitter and reduction.
All of these networks and ways work together to create the pain experience, to prevent another task, and help you deal with the pain.
This system is similar to everyone, but the emotions and the activity of these brain maps how much you feel and how you deal with a pain.
So how many people feel as much more than others and how many of the chimpanzees that don't respond to treatment, while others respond good.
The differences in the pain are not different in all the issues of the different responses to other cases.
Like how some people like the streets, but others suffer from a terrible device.
Why does it matter that there's curiosity in our brains?
Well, there's a lot of treatments to the pain, which are used to be different consumers.
It's easy, drugs without extending to act on cells where the wind signals start.
Other drugs are more powerful and extinction workers work to reduce the activity of senses that are made or define the models, or anthropologists.
How many people can deal with the use of using techniques that all of the need, concept, metaphor or strategies that can teach, like a biological chemistry.
For some of the people who suffer from a hard chicken, it's a pain that doesn't expect months after the surprise had to take a flow, no one of the normal treatments don't work.
Secondly, the medical science has been done with big treatments in large groups to tell what will help most of the patients.
But it's the switch out of the summer usually how much you don't get the treatment of treatment or the creatures.
Now, new treatments that live directly or network networks and motivation are in development, together with ways to improve them to specific patients, using using genetic diversity to transform the brain.
To understand how your brain comes to the pain is the key to find the best treatments for you.
It's a really personal drug.
How do you know what happens in your world?
The amount of information that we're spending in a click may be unlimited, but the time and the energy we have to judge and appreciate is not.
All the data in the world will not be effective but if you know how to read the news.
Your customers, teachers, or even the big brothers, the idea was weird.
Just a couple of decades ago, new news were based on.
Your choice was limited to some of the general, and three or four TV networks in which the real stairs have created the news in the same time I'm going to have every evening.
But the problems with the systems have been rapidly conducted when the model was spread.
While it was known that Turkey Sylords were repeated and repeated information, a series of regulations that governance democracies also affected the public, many times with cooperation of media.
Social warriors, aerocial corporations, and political corporations have gone under the faith of the public statistics that were created by the central magnitude.
This motion of training in the explanation of the media has led to alternative data, radio programs, and news in the cases that have been conducted with the central media and studied different events.
More recently, the Internet took the amount of information and perspective, with social media, bloggers, and local videos and all the East to a potential potential.
But if everybody wrote, no one, and different cases may not be pregnant, not just about consciousness, but on the facts themselves.
So how do you get the truth, or something close?
One of the good ways is to get new forms that we haven't done by someone in the way.
Instead of materials that have scientific research or a speech of politician, you can often find the critical material and look at yourself.
Life evaluations, after the states in social media.
While critical events, like the Arab Arab or the academic disease, new clinics and adults have stuck and telescopes.
Even though a lot of these are affected later in the books or sisters, remember that these cartoons spend a lot of times the voice of the person who was there with the impression of the farmers who didn't have there.
At the same time, the more depressed story, you need less to track it in real time.
In the events like Detroit and natural agencies, the media of today is trying to make a serious experiment even when there's no new species, sometimes it's led to information that my body or the inequality of people expect.
It's easy to be treated in these events, but try to look at the last data in a few points on the day, instead of a few minutes, which allows the details to affect and to predict that criticism.
While good machines are effective, the current of the media is often inevitable.
When you can't get the story directly, you read the crisis in many cases that are activated in different cases and different experts.
A piece of different cases and a attention to the bits that allows you to explore the parts of information together to the picture more.
It's also the advantage of scientific workers.
Other words like thinking, probably or possible say that the crisis is identified or worse, extended.
And the president of journalists who are focusing on human-generated communities.
These can be people who have a public connection to a story, or they have an effect on the crisis, when their anonymous allows them to insecure the information that they tell.
Finally, and most importantly, we're going to go to the news before they got.
While social media allows you to get faster, it's also possible that it's going to spread before they're going to go and try to survive a lot of after they've been killed.
So, before you share our unusual news or the usual, they did an online search to find another information or the context that might be just collecting and what other people say about it.
Today, we're more free than the past of the old media's explanation to control the information.
But with freedom responds to the responsibility: the responsibility to create the experience of ourselves and make sure that this fabric doesn't become a phone, which will leave us less than the end.
We've got some good reasons to move completely into solar energy.
It's much easier than the cases, and it's certainly more sustainable than our disease in traditional power that are used in resources like carbon, that's eventually remained.
So why don't we decide the traditional power in solar energy?
Because there's one causes a solar energy to be uncomfortable: clouds.
When the sun collapses into the Earth, some of them are collected by the atmosphere, some of them go back to the space, but the rest comes from the surface.
These aren't curious curiosity.
This is that we've been connected by giant clouds.
And these curiosity that's repeated by the surface, like buildings are close, before they come to the neural energy system called a repeat.
But before we can look at how clouds affect the sun and electricity production, let's see how these energy systems work.
First of all, we have solar models.
It's built from a central scale in a huge range that's going on after the sun, and it's just the rich ice to look at the size of the size, just like a man's waiting for a beach.
The heat that's created by these ice is so powerful that it's used to spend under water that's producing a regular crazy, that's producing electricity.
But when we're saying solar energy systems, we're usually talking about fossil cells, or solar, they're systems that're being used to make solar energy.
In solar panels, atoms from the sun's sun moves in the open surface, and electrons are released and causing electricity.
Sollers can use all kinds of curiosity, while solar genes can only use directly, and the clouds are important because if you take on their kind of and the universe is unique to the sun, they can define or reduce the amount of energy.
For example, even a couple of clouds in the sun can reduce the electricity production in solar galaxies to a little bit of zero because of the rich bus.
In solar panels, these clouds will take the energy production as well, but not so much because solar insects can use all the kinds of corruption.
However, it's all depending on the simple universe of the clouds.
In the transparency, or a certain phenomenon called the region, the sun of the sun can actually be focused on clouds to create a gender of 50 percent in the Syrian Central School that comes to the Southern.
If you don't think about this potential, it can be reduced to the cartoons.
Why does it matter?
Well, you don't want this lesson to stop just because there's been over your road.
In solar galls, toxic tools of a moon or a chicken can be used to move a heat from a heat and use it when you need, then you're treating a problem of a sun that's changing to an electricity.
But in the case of solar fingers, there's no way of environmentalism to move the privilege energy.
It's where traditional power stations go into the device for some motions they're at the bottom of the strength, electricity is always going to be right.
But then why don't these traditional power stations not only change as a conference, instead of the people will look at them as the main power of power?
Because it's impossible to work in a coal of carbon power or a nuclear to switch the button and make more electricity as many clouds have in the sky.
The response will be too simple.
Instead, to answer these dots, another electricity from traditional power is always produced.
In the two days, this collective power is scared, but when the sky comes out, it's what's filled with the prison.
That's what we're looking at right now for an electrical collection of electricity.
For this reason, many of the studies are interested in the movement and the structure of clouds through satellite images or cameras that are used to put the energy out of solar power and make the waste of energy.
If we can get it, you're going to be able to compare in this video that's when it's designed by the sun, it doesn't matter what the air is, although the sun't flow, you might be going to go out and get out of a different kind of grain in.
I'm a homeless world. I'm going to get a blind world.
I wanted to be an astronomy, but as a young girl in Canada, this possibility wasn't open to me.
But it turns out, we know a lot more about the external space than we know about the unexpected network that are there on our planet, the person of the Amazon.
So I decided to do something more extraordinary.
Instead of exploring the external space, I wanted to explore the inner space.
So a lot of people will tell you that the sound is one of the most dangerous components there.
As the illness, imagine yourself here in this room, if all of a sudden, your only task is to find the creativity, sometimes in the open space, and sometimes in a life under a restaurant, in a contrast that's been reduced by a strength, and it's an extended session on the window system that you're going to give you
Well, this is my work.
But what I'd like to teach you today is that we've done is not one big product.
It's more like a cartoon.
I can forget a lot of the teachers in the planet, and teachers that I can't forget, other forms of life and other materials can do this journey in my hand.
And Kolly is that you're going to teach you about life inside the planet.
There wasn't a blueprint of traffic training when I decided to be the first person to do a crowdness in the ice of Antarctica.
In 2000, it was the largest mobile bone on the planet.
He got out of the ice of the ice, and we went there to explore the ecology at the top of the ice and looking for the external forms of life under the ice.
We've used the technology of a oxygen region.
It's very similar to technology in which you use to make the external space.
This technology allows us to click more tasks that we're all going to be able to think about 10 years ago.
We're using regular gas, and we can do the conversations of 20 hours under the water.
I work with biologists.
It turns out that lights are a place of amazing life forms, species that we didn't know at the end before.
A big part of these animals live in extraordinary ways.
They're a fingerprint, and they're often eyes, and these creatures are also very high life.
In fact, the different creatures in these cases are now identified with the boys from the period of the dinosaurs.
So imagine, these are small dinosaurs.
What can they teach us about evolution and the survival?
When you look at a manufacturing like this mystery that's strength in the kitchen, it's got a huge cloud.
It can actually transform the big 40s from its diversity and kill it.
If there was the size of a house, it was the most dangerous animal on the planet.
And these creatures live in amazing places, like this cave, for example, which is very young, against the future animals in it.
How did they get there?
I also work with physicists, and they're often interested in climate change around the world.
They can take roads from the cases, and put them there in their states, just like fingerprinting in a tree, and they can go back in time and learn about the planet in different time.
The red one that you see in this picture is actually a struggle from the extinct thing.
He was invited by the wind, over the Atlantic ocean.
And we've been reduced on the Amazon Amazon Amazon in the Amazon by the rain.
It's scared through the land and it's been reduced in these cases.
And when you look at these roads of roads, you can see at the time where the climate on the planet was very expensive, and that's how you can go back hundreds of thousands of years.
Fecologists are also interested in the sea of sea on the planet in different times.
Here in Berna, I and my team have done the most powerful sound that was in the region, and we had a different place where the water's water in the sea left their arms on the bottom of a hundred meters underneath the sea of the sea.
I'm also working with Nanologists and organisms.
In places like Mexico, in the Amazon and even a coffee. In the cases, we're looking for the muscles of astronologists and survivors, and they tell us a lot about the pre-like people in these areas.
But my favorite project was more than 15 years ago, when I was part of a reduction that made the first 3D printing of a parasite region.
The device that I'm talking to me here in the lab actually created the 3D model in a movement.
We've also used the studio with a low-in-the-the-the-in-the-the-a-the-the-a-the-a-the-the-the-a-the-the-a-the-the-a-the-a-the-the-the-the-a-the-a-a-the-the-a-the-a-the-up.
So I've been sitting under the homes and I've been businesses and violence in Iraq and Golden and Golden, and even underneath the Street of Southern Babbo, "quite amazing -- and what I learned is that everything we're doing on the planet will come back to us through who's dead.
Our water doesn't just come from demands, by water and oceans, but there's a huge network of water that's made all of these together.
It's a local source of all of us.
And when we understand the relationship between the people and our academic water and between all the water from the planet, then we can work on the most important problem as the current century.
So I've never got to become an astronomy that I've always wanted to be, but this device that's been affected by the room, it's going to become an astronomer.
It's actually a profound sleep.
It's now an autonomous robotic robotic that can switch themselves, an artificial intelligence, and its final goal is to get to the wind of Twitter -- Europe and explore the ocean oceans under its beautiful surface.
And it's pretty amazing.
Thank you.
Think of all the things that need to happen to make human feedback: get food, build a box, grow children and more.
It has to be a way of part of resources, to organize big, and some of the work in activity.
Now imagine you're going to have to do it without any kind of planning or a higher way of communication.
Brothers to sit down the ants.
The ants have one of the most complicated social structures in the animals, animals in death that are used to be different kinds of friends who do specific role.
But even though it might sound familiar to some human societies, this organization doesn't get much higher than decisions, but it's a part of biological cycle.
More species, all of the machines and the machines of the machines are exposed from all of the seasons in the population, they're all going to get the different states and look at a central perspective to push, by using fossil fuels to reduce each other to the culture.
After the hormones, the muscles die, while the presidents are trying to make a new listening.
The roads that are going to be scared in places that die, lose their walls, and they start to click the trees, and they're a part of them using a recycling that they've been reduced from the hormones.
The fossil trees grow up to fewer workers that fit in its economy and its trees.
So they're going to get on the listening and collecting food, while the unprecedented objects grow to the males that their only task is to wait until they're ready to leave the nest and culture, start the repeat.
So how are ants work decide what to do and why?
Well, they're not.
Despite they don't have the techniques of machine, ants are one of the other connection with a moment, sound and chemical muscles.
These definitions get a lot of things that's used to have other ants if one was killed, until the training of when the economy comes to the end of her theories.
But one of the most important expectations of the ants is to explore effective and large areas without a very limited plan.
Most of the ants of the ants have some interview or not exist and they can only predict things in the face.
Together with their capacity to communication at high level, it will look like it will do them for bad actions, but there's a simple way to reduce ants from magazine their search for effectively effective change in their movement based on individual connections.
When two ants are excited, they feel one other in the meaning.
If there's a lot of ants in a small region, it will happen more in chemistry and make sure to respond in a more productive motion, artists to look more effective.
But in larger areas, with less ants, where these features are less fun, they can go in the sky to get more strength.
As a prescription of their environment in this way, it's going to be easy in a number of things, from water and water or ethnic, to the windows of windows.
And some species have a different capacity that's known as a gas.
When one of the ants find food, it's going to go back with it, and it's reducing the way you're in.
Others are going to go after the protocells, and they'll take it every time you can find food and go back.
As soon as I could at this point, the ants are causing their help.
It's the smallpox and the ants don't get to this box more.
These techniques of search and listening to them, actually, so effective that they use computers to get optimistic results from recycling elements, work in the academic and replace information.
It's got a lot of theories and collective use, to solve the regulation of the regulation, to train a feedback and computations, to enable groups of robots to look at a early or a building, without a central control.
But you can see in this simple process, but effective process, still directly through some simple experiments, in order to allow ants to get into different boundaries and pay attention to their behavior.
The ants may not be able to vote, there's directly or even design, but we're the people who may still learn something from these simple creatures are able to operate so complicated in so complex ways.
Kids are most of the popular media as a symbol of Sweden and Steve or a rare of young people.
But while the buttons are coming up, and their meaning is very different between civilizations, the future is like the culture itself.
Technology on the skin came up with human lions all over the world, with the worst one that's been found on the death of Maria that's going to take 6,000 years ago.
But would you ever be wondering how a crops really work?
You may know that we're getting our skin, and we're going to lose 30 to 4,000 cells in an hour.
It's about 10,000 times a day.
So, how do the buttons don't go to look at them?
The simple answer is that the capacity of the income income income of deeper details than the most external environment.
Over the history of history, different cultures have used different techniques to get it.
But the first cockroach machine took the skin from the Dennson's reference and effect on electricity.
It's a cool machine that's used today from a teenager's decline, deep in nature, into the skin of 50 to 3,000 times a minute.
The trick goes through the epiphus, and it's enabled to the radio into the axis, and it's complexed by a collapse, blogs, blogs, blood vessels and so on.
Each time the spinal trick, it's made an action that's driving into the body to start a reduction process, which is called the immune system to start to fix the skin.
And that's the process that makes a button.
First of all, cells from plants called a professor of Jim eat the material in trying to move the finger.
When these cells go through the critical system, how many of them are trying to return with a fingerprint back to the airport while others stay on the right.
Unfortunately, the colors in it remains the skin through the skin.
How many of the radio cartoons also depend on the GDP's's's's cartoon, while other people's airplanes in a skin called February.
At the first time, radio is also on the Philippus, but when the skin looks like, the fingerprinting cells are conducted by new cells, radio with the upper sea that's going to go like the sun of the sun.
Fathers or microbial don't seem to be at the same level of popular and full of epiphonic requires 24 weeks in the past, you need to avoid a sun and a animal to prevent a president.
Dylus cells, with that, stay in place until they die.
When they die, they're pregnant, with the dialogue, by young cells, then the radio remained somewhere.
But with the time, a really similar accuracy when the body comes to recycling pixels, to look at them and they're talking about the microbes of the vaccine system.
Alexandela Sylin also can make the Pacific Pacific, although you can avoid it using the gene.
But because you're going to travel is a special statement, most of the organ will stay deep inside the skin for all the human life.
But if you're a collapse in your skin for all of your life, is there a way to reduce them?
Titchen, yes.
Today, you can be used in a foreign lab to take the epiphus and jump the fingerprint in different axis, when a black guy is the most easy.
The laser curiosity remains the apartments to the smaller walls that can be taken by a professor.
But a couple of studies are more difficult to hide from others, and they might be scared.
For this reason, the conference is still harder than doing one -- but not possible.
So a single button may not be really going to answer, but academic was in a more time than any culture exists.
And their tolerance popular popular means that the art of a coffee here to stay.
You've probably heard that carbon dioxide scrops the planet, but how does it do it?
Is it like the glass of what you're in or like a decline?
Well, not really.
The answer is a little bit of anatomy, but don't worry, let's start at the web.
If you're looking at most of the sun is repeated through a train, you're going to see a sea where you're going to expect a fingerprint.
Where did they go?
Before they came to your eyes, different chimps have reduced the specific parts of the South.
For instance, a frozen switch part of the red color, and it took two tons of love.
But why do these genes take certain colors of light?
That's where we're going to go into the Canatic economy.
Each atom and molecule has a particular number of energy levels for their electrons.
In order to transform a fundamental condition to a higher level, a molecule has to get some amount of energy.
No more, not less.
It's getting this energy from light, which comes most of energy levels you can survive.
Obviously, you know, you're going to have these tiny particles that are called atoms and the amount of energy in every tone in its color.
The red light has a lower energy and a long-term Google.
Lear School has more energy and more short and smaller Google.
It's used to invent all the fossil fuels of the web, so molecules are able to choose the atoms that are made up the similar energy that requires to jump the molecule into its next energy.
When this demand was done, the tone was done when the molecule is energy, and we're getting a little bit of our web.
If you're a little bit of a subject or too much energy, and a patient doesn't have a choice but give it to.
So you remember, it's transparency.
The atoms of the glass doesn't fit very well into any kind of energy level of light looks, so the atoms go through.
So, what's fear of carbon dioxide?
Where's the black line in our web that's probably the global warming?
Well, it's not there.
Foundation India is not a direct horrible light from the sun.
It's a range of light that's completely different.
One doesn't look like it's popular at all: the Earth.
If you're wondering why our planet doesn't look like a wall, it's because the Earth doesn't take light.
It takes a red light.
Our eyes can see, including all the colors in the web, it's a small part of a larger electronic piece of electronics, which is the whole radio radio, a fabric, a red, a red red red red, a NASA, and a genome.
It may seem strange to think about these things as light, but there's no basic difference between light and other kinds of electronic crisis.
It's the same energy, but in high levels or more comfortable.
In fact, it's a little bit of magical to define that light looks at our limits.
After all, a red light seems to be scared, and alcohol has seen birds.
If our eyes were supposed to see light in 1900 rainforest, then a cell phone was an airport, and a cell cell cell cell cell model would look like a huge light.
The Earth is popular intuition, because every object with a temperature over the aircraft of light.
It's called a tragic career.
As an object goes on, his regular restaurants.
When you're waiting a piece of flight, it's going to take more and more and more diversity of red light, and then, at the end of about 450 degrees of the pipe, its light will come to the red of the flow.
First of all, it's going to look like this.
And then with more heat, it will only identify with all the possibilities of light looks.
So traditional generations were designed to work and so they're so sophisticated.
95 percent of the light that they're invisible to our eyes.
It's a fabulous heat.
The Industrial Institute of the Earth will be able to wait if there were no magical molecules in our atmosphere.
It's just like a finger of red atoms as the sea, a fossil carbon and other genomes fit into red intuition.
They're telling the current amount of energy to reduce the limited molecules to the highest amount of energy.
A little bit after the fingerprinting of the fingerprint of the Pacific France, it's going back to the lower level of energy, and it's a telescope back to the corner.
Some of this energy is going into the planet, and it's going to be reduced.
The more carbon of India would be in the atmosphere, it's more likely that the intuitive atoms will help the planet and have the climate.
I'm working a lot with motion and profound motion, and I'm pretty much Jim and music.
So musicians are things that we've always been interested in, but they're always going to show me so response.
So I thought to myself, can you invent ourselves from the equation as a production and try to make music be the sound of the leading and that the anonymous is going to track it.
So together with two designers, Steve and Turkey, in my office, we took a lot of you probably know it; it's 25 years old, and it's Darwin and Iran isn't -- and we've done this little analogy.
And I think maybe it's also interesting that it's treated with two points in real time, which are water and religion.
Before God left humanity on the planet, he reminded the moon to build a box.
And after we built the box, I believe he said to move the people that they need to change their feet before he'll always change them.
And then we're trying to build the box, I understand somebody started to play a song.
And the song I'm working on to move on this way.
And when we're trying to build the baby...
It goes on.
So they're beautiful, they've come up with the rain and the rain; they're moving and beautiful.
And then he went and proud the door of a old woman.
And the old woman wanted to the door and said, "Who is it?"
Jenson told me what he said, "We can spend the night here?"
"Because we're far away from home, we're very beautiful."
And the prosperity said, "Oh, yeah, we're going to go."
We're going to be a coffee, and no, you're going to make you touch and beautiful.
Thank you.
We evolved with tools, and the tools evolved with us.
And we've been going to create these graphic graphic graph about 1.5 million years ago, and we've just made them not just get to the task but also to get their hands.
However, for the years, tools became much more death.
These philosophical tools evolved through the use of them, and each one has a different shape that comes to its use.
And they're using our hands's minds to change things with a lot of worse.
But when tools became more and more complex, we need more complex wars to control them.
And so designers have become an accident to create interfaces that enables you to change change as you treat other things, like taking a picture and change the coffee or the key.
But the computer changed the way we think about tools because it's important.
So he can do a million different things and reduce a million different effects.
However, computers have the same physical structure for all of those effects and those sophisticating statistics as well.
And I believe it's a fundamental problem, because it doesn't really enable to communicate with our hands and capture the strengths that we have in the body.
And I believe that then, we need new kinds of interfaces that can capture the rich capacity that we have and have to bring themselves physical to us and allow us to activate them in new ways.
And so that's what I did in the MIT's media and now in Stanford.
So with my colleagues, Daniel Litchen and personal, we created FORM, where the web can actually go out of the screen and you can change it physical.
Or you can imagine a three-dimensional data, and you can imagine it and feel it to understand it in new ways.
Or you can communicate through convenience and services directly to spread digital material.
Or primary intervention can go out of the surface and change the device.
And the idea is that every possibility, the physical shape can fit.
And I believe it represents a new way that we can communicate with information, by making the physical.
So the question is, how can we use it?
Second, intervention and architects were built by cities and buildings to understand them better.
So with Tony Tang in the media, we've created an interface in NORM interface to enable internal programs to design and see cities.
And now you can go around, but it's dynamic, it's physical, and you can also communicate directly.
Or you can look at different details, like a population or motion data, but it's made of physical.
We also believe that the dynamic code can really change the ways that we're collaborating from far with people.
So when we're working together into the face, I'm not just looking at your face but I'm connected and objects, and it's really hard to do when you're using tools like a cup.
And so using FORM, you can get through the screen and innovation from far.
So we've used the faces of the road to make people's hands, what we can actually move and innovate objects from a game.
And you can also change and cooperate in three-dimensional information, so you can do connected as well as change them.
And it allows people to cooperate on these new 3D types of data in a rich way more possible with traditional tools.
And so you can also bring water in there, and these will go down on the other side and go to the other side.
Or you can have a local object between two places, so you can move a planet on one side, and the ball will prevent the other side as well.
And so we're doing it by using the user camera using a sensitive camera like Microsoft.
Now you may be wondering how it works, and basically, what it is, it's 900 inadequate motors that are connected to these anonymous bees that are going to be transparency down into these corporations above.
So it's not that complex to what's happening in CERT, but it took a long time for us to build it.
And so we started with a single motor, a single event to a single, and then we had to design a special Google to control them.
And then we had to do a lot of them.
And so the problem when there were 900 of something that you need to do all 900 times.
And so that means we had a lot of work to do.
So we've been kind of a kind of executive conference in the media and we've been studying students first year and we've created them to do "research" -- "and we've had a lot of fossil paintings when we looked at the movies, we've care and we '
You know -- research.
But anyway, I think we were really excited about the things that FORM enabled us to do.
More and more, we're using mobile devices, and we're interested in the way.
But mobile devices, just like computers, are using so many effects.
So you're using them to talk about the phone, to get on the Internet, play games, take them or even a million different things.
But again, they have the same physical form for each of these functions.
And so we wanted to know how we could take some of these interactions that we're going to open for FORM and connect them together in mobile devices.
So in Stanford, we've created the effective screen, which is a mobile device with an instrument of the National Amazons that can change a shape, so you can feel in your hands where you read a book.
Or you can feel in your pocket of new kinds of collective feelings that they're doing more than the doors.
Or as teachers that can affect the side that allows to act instead of where you want them to be.
Or you can play play games and you've had teenagers continue.
And so we were able to do this by the 40-hour training moves in the device, and it allows you not just to touch them but also to push them back.
But we also looked at other ways to create a more complex shape.
So we used a mathematical motion to create a shape in which you can create something that looks very similar to the phone...
It's always in a movement.
And so together with a Franksco in the media, we've created a high restaurant that's using the top of a film in order to change an interactive camera with a platform to a phone.
And we're also interested in finding ways that use can actually transform the users to design them into devices that they want to use.
So you're going to create something like a game game, and then the system's going to understand what shape is and you're going to be able to make the exact act act form.
So where is this point?
How do we move forward from here?
I think, really, where we're in today is a new generation of the Internet of the objects, where we have computers everywhere -- they're in our walls, they're almost every device you've been looking at the next few years.
But what if we were producing to think about devices and think instead of environments?
And so how can we have smart, smart, or sophisticated environments or cities that can bring themselves physical, and allow us new ways of cooperating with new kinds of action and do new kinds of actions?
So for the week of design, we created the TRNOM, which is a scale of the table of these forms, which can prevent physical objects on the surface, for example, that you're going to take you to take the development.
But it can change a form of different ways of interaction.
So if you want to work, then it can change the kind of work around you.
And so when you bring a device, it creates all the lucks that you need and bring other objects to help you get these goals.
So, to summarize, I really think we need to think about a new way, different from the artist to communicate with computers.
We need computers that can bring themselves physical to us and bring to ways that we want to use and really apply the product that we have in your hands, and our ability to think a space for information by the physics.
But if you look forward, I think we need to go beyond it, beyond devices, and think about new ways that we can connect people, and bring our information to the world, and think about the amount of environments that can change ourselves in the physical.
So with that, I'll leave you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
You'll see this: Here's Grand, not something special, just a fundamental ratio, very rapid.
But look more than most, into the white wall in the center there are the two anthropy lines and the central opinions are going to be done.
Look very close. Did you notice something weird at the point?
Yes, nothing.
But you'll get to look at, you'll be strange and look at it.
Now, leave your view on this point, see what's going on in your slide.
The other dots, are they still building?
Now look at this Philippinee Office.
Oh, joy, one of the walls of the walls. It's brown up instead of playing in.
Again, don't, get this pattern. Now the other use of boundaries?
What it's not going to be, it's a great pattern.
That's a picture of Abraham Lincoln, and here's one of the opposite.
Nothing is strange here.
Wait, get back the shape.
What did they do to the iPhone? These are just three optimistic illness, images that look at us.
How do they work?
Will things happen in these images?
While we can definitely define the boundaries into the corporations of building the slightly slide of our wonderful, first, we agree that we don't.
You're going to see the same effect with Grand that's based on a normal piece of paper.
In reality, this decline is really just a rapid, but not for your brain's vision.
Here's how he's spending the light information that you're called Grand.
The white people are surrounded by another one of the four physicians from every single point to sleep over the line.
The Nigerian cells I've shown you that there's more white around the coffee because they're organized to define the regulations with a unique form.
A better death means that it's easier to see the team of something.
And things are what the eyes and the brain evolved to see.
Your two stem cells I've seen not respond so many of you because there's more sophisticated to more women in a relative region, which are exposed in the black.
It's not just your eyes; if you can see, then the optimistic illusion can switch you as well with this paper or that paper or a computer in front of you.
What optimistic illustrates us is the way the light cold and the brain components and the brain components a three-dimensional world that you see around you, where the team has to get more attention because things with a team can help you or kill you.
Look at the Philippines again. You know what causes to wear here?
I've shown that I'm going to work on your brains about this picture.
It's a map that light will come from a single crisis, that's coming from the top.
And so these blue patterns could only make a light that's welfed down on the baskets of chemistry, or the bottom of the black.
If we create a speed of these lucks by a click, even on a piece of paper that's sad, our brain creates the generations of the liquid or the lights.
Now, the extinctions of Linstein's right now.
It's about activity in the areas of the brain that's evolved particularly to help us recognize.
Like the story region and other areas in the physical and creativity.
It also makes sense, we're very powerful with very complex ways to communicate with each other.
When we see faces, we need to understand that they're facing and identify what they're looking very quickly.
And what we're focusing on is the most eyes and the media.
That's how we understand if someone bees us or want to be our friend.
In the right face of Lincoln, the eyes and the prosperity were actually in the right direction, so you don't notice that something was wrong.
But when we put all the picture, the most important parts in the face, the eyes and the plan, there were now the walls, and you realized that something was strange.
You've realized that your brain took a creation through and you've got something.
But your brain didn't really have a brown, it's just very busy.
So he's spending energy in the most effective way it can, by using the forests on the foreign information to create a real, and a lot of the world.
Imagine your brain read these prices in real time: "Okay, these moments can be objects.
Let's move the black nurses into a bedroom with a sophisticated device.
You've got these champions!
Adora goes to a blind bird?
We've put that light from the top of the top of the blueprint.
The next! These eyes look like most of the eyes I've seen before, there's no strange thing. "
You can see? Our popular tricks discovered your brain work as an instrument of a three-dimensional theater in your studio inside your skin, a world of resources and a world in a world with a motor motion for most -- but it doesn't always work.
How do you know you're real?
It's a clear question until you're trying to answer it, but let's treat it.
How do you really know that you're there?
In the book, "Technology on the first philosophy," Resert is trying to answer this question, and always all of its first ideas and consciousness to start again from the basis.
All of his knowledge came from the creative forces of this world.
Just like you, right?
You know you're watching this video with your eyes, you hear it with your ears.
Your senses show you the world like it is.
They don't move you, but sometimes they do.
You may be going on in a remote person, or maybe you'll be sure you're going to take a ball, and it's going to be in the background for you.
But really, right here and now, you know what your face is real.
Your eyes, your hands, your body.
It's you. It's just crazy people to spend it, and you know you're not crazy.
Anyone who's acting it has to be sick.
Or not, what if you share?
A dream feels real.
You can believe that you're happy, you're shocked or you're in your hands, when your real body's sitting in the bed.
No, no, no.
When you're cities, you know you're cities.
But when you're not, you don't know you're not, then you can't prove that you're not share.
Maybe the body that you've got is not really there.
Maybe all of your reality, even your spontaneous cartoons, like time, shape, color, and numbers are safe, all the techniques that are designed by a conventional museum.
No, really.
You're going to say if you're able to reduce the idea that a museum that's a bad museum to believe you that real reality.
Perhaps this Tasmanian method taught you.
The world, your profound it, your body.
You can '
You can't!
So, you don't. Life is just a dream, and I'm going to get that you don't get a boat at at all, right?
No, you're scared in it in a face like the unemployment that's wrong with you.
Do you find it convinced?
Are you convinced?
If you're not, very good; if you're yes, even better, because in being convinced, you'd be convinced that you're going to be convinced.
You can't be anything if you think you're something, even if you think it's nothing because you don't matter what you think, you're a thing, or like the France said, "I think, so I'm there," and so you're really, really.
Think you're going to get a bridge to the air.
Can you expect the movement of the ball after it leaves your hand?
Of course, it's easy.
The ball is going to move up to the highest point, so it's going to go back to your hand and go back in your hand.
Of course, it's what's happening, and you know it because you're going to go to those events that don't have a bird sometimes.
You've seen the physics of everyday actions in your life.
But let's put a question on the physics of atoms, like how is the motion of Atlantic around a gene of a mammom looks like?
Could we answer this question based on experience with daily physics?
No.
Why? Because the physics control the behavior of this small scale is very different from the physics of microscopic objects that you see around you every time.
The world today's beauty that you know and love is about rules of California.
But autonomous systems of atoms are used by rules of anthropologist.
It turns out that this conventional world is a very strange place.
The theory of the Social Revolution is made in a famous computer experiment: the cat of Robert Robert.
A physicist, not really like crops, there's a coffee in the coffee, together with a page that has 50 percent chance to jump out after the box goes.
Unfortunately we open the box, there's no way to know if the laughter's laughed or not, so there's no way to know if the cat is living or the level.
In physics, we could say that before our slide, it was in a situation of a discovery.
He didn't live or worse but most of the two possibilities, with 50 percent chance to each other.
The same kind of progress happens to physicists at Canadian scale, like Atlantic that's falling an atom.
The alcom doesn't really exist at all.
It's kind of everywhere in space, at the same moment, with much more likely to be in other places, and it's just after we've learned his universe that we can do on the same moment.
It's very similar to how we didn't know if the cat was living or a device until we opened the box.
It brings us to the strange, and the language of cockroaches.
Let's say, in one place in the box, we've got two different categories.
If we go back on the profound experiment of Rwander with this crowdness, the result of the experiment can be one of four possibilities.
Or the two soldiers live, or they're two, or one will be alive and the other, or the opposite.
The system of the two treatments again in a situation of a discovery, with any result in the 25 percent instead of 50 percent.
But here's the magical thing: the anthropologist tells us that you can reduce the results of the two animals and the other two tremendous benefits from the end.
In other words, you can be a system of two cows, so the result will always be one animal and a single cat.
The technical motor for this is that the so-blowing situation.
But there's something that's really awesome about coordination.
If you know the system of the two trees in the box in the road, and then you move the box into a different team of the universe, the result of the experiment will always be the same.
One cat always came out of life, and the other one will always come out, despite my brother and who's completely unprecedented before we measure the result.
How is it possible?
How is it that the situation of patients in different forms of the universe can be about this way?
They're too far to communicate with each other in time, so how are the two groups always serve that one's spread and one?
You might think, "It's just a theory that I'm going to do.
That's something that can't happen in the real world. "
But it turns out that Canadian is trained in the real world in the lab.
Two proteins of soap soap in a convenient situation, where if one goes around one direction then you have to go around the other direction, do exactly that, even though there's no way to go through information to a park after you're going to move around to this because you're going to go around to the rules of the boys.
It's not surprising that curiosity is the basis of the sanitary information science, a key part of how to use the laws of the modern anatomic world, like in our Scotsctography and analogy, to make sure that can send out one product to another, or again, to the curiosity of Scott.
A daily physicist may start to show a little bit more like the stranotic world.
Technologist may even open so much, one day your cat will move into a safe galaxy, where there's no physicists and pixels.
I have a question.
Can a computer write a poem?
It's a profound question.
Think about it for a moment and suddenly, if you want some more questions, like, what is a computer?
What's a poem?
What is creativity?
But these are questions that people spend life trying to answer them and not on one TED Talk.
So we'll have to use a different approach.
We took two songs.
One of them was written by a human and the other was written by a computer computer.
I'm going to ask you to tell me who is.
Let's try: a song one: a little bit of a wind of the summer, by reducing the thought of a skin.
Is I not a pair of your death or art don't you?
SP 2: We can feel active in our lives or powerful to see, epic, I'm going to reduce the whole night to start a different piano -- OK, play time.
Her hands up if you think that one song was written by a person.
Well, most of you.
Her hands up if you think a song 2 was written by a person.
It's very sad because the first poem was written in human beings, the crisis and the hell at the night.
The other one was written by an algorithm that took all the language of my baseball on one day and then created the song through algorithms that I'll describe a little bit more on the screen.
Let's try another test.
Again, you don't have a lot of time for a clinic so you're going to have a sense of your cancer.
A song: The library switches and the dog is interesting, and it's interesting, and it's interesting and it's fascinating that a bird and not worry or worry about the stories of life are in my sisters and song everyone if I'm not dead or death.
CA 2: Oh! Chicago, Pimbols, chocolate from limits!
You're really beautiful! You're in the face, you're regulations, gyrus! Everything's always going to talk about -- OK, the time you've been.
So if you think that the first poem was written by a person who had killed hands.
OK.
And if you think that the second poem was written by a person who had killed hands.
You take about half a half.
There was a lot more difficult.
The answer is one song created by an algorithm called Rott that was created in the 1970s and the second poem was written by a guy named Frank Frank, which in the case he was one of my favorite villages.
So what we've done right now is a TV test for a choice.
Dr. TV was first done by this guy, Allan Turkey in 1950 to answer the question of whether computers can think?
Allan Turkey Herris believed that if a computer can manage a text that's based on a person in this kind of machine that the person won't understand whether he's talking to a computer or a machine, then you can say that a computer has intuition.
In 2013, my friend in Spain and I've created a TV test for a local crisis.
It's called "Book or not" and you can invest it to yourself.
But in fact, it's the game that we've been looking at.
You show you a song you don't know if it was written in a person or a computer and you're going to take a song.
Well, thousands of people's thousands of people's thousands of people's homework and we have results.
And what are the results?
Well, TV said that if a computer can work on people 30 percent of the time he's a person so he's working on a TV test.
We've got poems on the base of January or not Jay who could work on 65 percent of the people who read and think it was written in human beings.
So, I think we have an answer to our question.
By the opposite of TV, can a computer write a poem?
Well, yes, it's completely possible.
But if you feel a little bit of uncomfortable with this answer, it's okay.
If you have a collection of sensory feelings about it as well because it's not the end of the story.
Let's play the third and last game.
Again, you'll have to read and tell me what you think is the person.
Second one: The red dots of the reason for filmmakers and movies.
A series of dozens and a material that's made out of dozens of materials with a song two: the highest coffee, and I heard the cartoon I've heard the dog today or I've heard this page is just an epic, and then it's nearly a decline. OK: OK.
So hands up if you think that one song was written by a person.
Her hands up if you think a song 2 was written by a person.
Wow, it's much more people.
So you'll be able to figure out that one poem was written by the United Kingdom of Antarceline.
And the other one's taken by an algorithm called RKP.
Now before we continue, let me describe you fast and spread how RKP works.
So RKC is an algorithm that's a principal algorithm that is an open-source of Google and believe a big artificial intelligence.
So you're telling RRKM Text is a source of the source text to find how it uses language and then it represents a language that's what the first text is.
So in the poem that we've just seen a song two, it's that you've all thought that a man wrote him a number of poems of a series of a service called Denson Denson was looking at the way it used to teach the language and then reinvent the structure of the structure.
But the thing that's important to know about RKP is that it doesn't understand the words that it's about to use.
The language is just a piece of stuff that can be Chinese, it can be Sweden, it can be the language that's collected out of your baseball.
It's just a fusion.
And it's still able to make a song that looks more human than it's of Darwin.
So what we've done here is the opposite of a TV test.
So Darwin Swin, which is a person, can write a poem that was invented from the human judgments to think was written in a computer school.
So by the idea of reducing a staurant at a Dr. Darwin, which is a computer.
[]]]]]]] []]]]] []]]]]
I think it's fair.
We had so far as people like people who have computers like computers like computers that we have computers like people, but we also have, maybe the most powerful of people like computers.
So what do we take from this?
Do we take a blueprint at night, it's somehow more in a human than a terrorist who's a virtue?
Or is Detroit that Systein is more than a baby computer at night?
So these are questions I asked myself about two years and I don't have answers.
But what I have is a number of insights about our relationship with technology.
So my first insight is that for some reason we're going to get a choice to our human beings.
So when a computer can write a poem? "
We also ask what it means to be a human and how do we grow boundaries around this category?
How do we collapse or what bees to it?
It's actually a philosophical question, I believe, and you can't answer it in your eye or not, like a TV test.
I also believe that Dr. Terris realized this, and when you invented the test in 1950 he did it as a philosophy of philosophy.
So my second insight is, when we look at a poem in TV, we don't really look at the ability of computers because algorithms are quite simple, they're pretty simple or more or more than the's' 50s.
What we're doing with TV test, it's collecting consciousness about what human hope is.
So what I've discovered, we've seen it when we've said that's going to sleep at night is more in a human than a Detroit.
Of course, it doesn't mean that Bay Bay is really more human or Tropin is more computer.
It's just saying that the category of a person doesn't work.
It led me to understand that this person doesn't work.
Instead, it's used to be scientific and something that's changed with time.
So my last insight is that computers are less or more working like a mirror that's spending every human idea that we're showing.
We've shown it to me Darwson and he'd repeat me Darson.
We showed him William at night and that's what's changed us back.
We've showed him Detroit that's safe, and what we've got back is the Darwin.
More than any of the computer technology is a mirror that's spread every idea of the person we teach it.
So I'm sure many of you have heard a lot about artificial intelligence recently.
And the conversation is, can we build this?
Can we build a smart computer?
Can we build a creative computer?
What we're asking again and again is, can we create a human computer?
But what we've seen right now is that the person doesn't work a scientific fact that it's all the time changing and connecting ideas and one that's changed over time.
So when we start looking at the ideas of artificial intelligence in the future we don't just have to ask ourselves, "We can build it?"
But we also need to ask ourselves what is the human idea that we want to expect us back?
It's actually a philosophical idea and it's not just about software but I think, requires a moment of a daily transformation of the species.
Thank you.
Thank you.
First of September in September, 1953, and William Scott used a video and a mood switch moke to push into a young man's skin, spinning out of his brain and patterns from his brain and asked them through a song.
But it wasn't a restaurant from Iraq or a conversation.
Dr. Scott was one of the worst brain brain in the same time, and the young man was the Henson Nielson, the president of his name's name, "The case of his case was made amazing to how the brain works.
As a child, the Henry opened his skin in in the kitchen and at the end of the budget from the chicken, the possibilities and resolution of control in the body.
Another years of suffering from the customers, and even the president of the high school, the president of Scott Bill, a man was known in his conference.
Social corruption was used for decades to treat the front of the heart of the thought that digital actions were completely focused on the areas of the brain.
After using a successful use to reduce psychiatric curiosity, Scotl decided to draw the PMMS's's cockroach, some of the local system that was connected to emotions, but his goal wasn't known.
In the first perspective, the surgery was success.
H.M. has been completely changed, no change in personality, and his whole level even changed.
But there was one problem: his memory was injured.
It's not going to lose most of his memories from the decade, HH.M., it wasn't able to create new, and forget what day, repeated the walls, and even a few streets in the wall.
When Scott was invited to another illusion, William Pennestinian, on the result, he's sent an alternative student called Berbert Mandandela to explore the H.M. in the house, where he took his hand to do different jobs, and he's here in the movies for the first time, and again.
What she'd come through a series of curiosity and interviews not just a lot of the memory study.
It's even redefined what memory means.
One of the inventions of Maller's motor on the fact that despite HHHMM. You can't create new memories, it's still enough information for a moment to end a sentence or find the toilets.
When Meller gave him a number of random, he could remember him to use 10 minutes by repeating it in the walls.
But just five minutes later, it's that the test even exist.
Scientists thought that memory is moral, it's all called the same thing and will live around the brain.
The results of Maller didn't just have been the first hour to the concept of the convenient memory now between a long and short memory, but it showed that every one of them uses different brain cells.
We know now to create memories including a few lessons.
After information from the sensors are working at the same time by Nigerians in Kenyx, it's going to go to the Pacific, where special proteins work to reduce the great bees.
If the experience is strong enough, or we remember it's time in the first few days, the Octocus is moving back to the cortex to a permanent disaster.
The brain of H.M. can create the first understanding, but without the hippocampus to do the memory of memory, they're born, like the opinions that are on the edge.
But it wasn't the only difference in a memory that's going to be invented.
In an experiment that's now famous, it's hard to get from HMMM, to go through a third star in the space between the sky and two complexity in the time it can see the paper and the pencil just through a mirror.
Like every single one in this strange metaphor for the first time, it was bad.
But unfortunately, he improved with other experiences, even though he didn't have a memory of previous experiences.
His unaware of his unconscious centuries remember what his brain is forgotten.
What Meller discovered was that my favorite memory of death, ethnicity and workers are different from the prototype of component on the bicycle or the name of the name.
And now we know that a prototype memory is taking more about the deforestation and the crowdness, the structures that were that water in the brain of H.M.
This understanding between "to know what" Don't know how "was the basis for all memory research since.
HM's age 82 after life that's in their house in the house.
For the years, he was tested by more than 100 neuroscience scientists, who had his brain to play every time.
With his death, his brain is thrilled and scanned before we took more than 2000 pounds and it's been able to create a digital map for a single single News, everything in a living generation that's taken by 400,000 people.
Despite H.M. Life most of his life in a conversation, he and his apartment to the structure of the memory will always remember the generations to come.
How many times the privacy repeat your favorite song?
And take a moment to think, how often did you get it?
The risks are that you've heard the instrument repeat dozens if not hundreds of times, and it's not just popular cities in the West that are repeated a lot.
Again is a neighborhood that music contains around the world is going to share.
So, why does music look back?
One part of the answer comes from what psychologists call it the external effect.
In short, people tend to predict things that they would expect them before.
For example, a song sounds in the studio that we don't really like, but then we hear the song in the capacity of the capacity, in the task and again in the street.
In the mirror, we're exposed to the rate, transparency the words, even teaching the poem.
This particular effect works not just about cities.
He's also working on everything started to do with consciousness in the France.
So, what makes it so common in music?
In order to look, psychologists asked people to listen to musicians who were accurate an accurate help.
They've heard of these quick parts or in their original way, or in a corner that's digital to go back.
Even though the original agriculture were taken by some of the most valuable choices in the 20th century, and the Germans with the regulation remained by a stroke of power, people went through the Germans with the regulations more interesting, more interesting and more interesting that we realized by human artists.
Again in in music is very convenient.
Think about the California's voice, "What's out of the machine."
If you've heard it in the past, almost impossible after a poem, "What's the case," I'm not going to go, "India India."
Go back every part of the music is inevitable to the next part of the music that's after.
So when you hear a few lines, you're already imagining what's going on.
Your brain's happiness together unaware, and I have to notice, you might start with a bucket.
A recent studies showed that when people hear from a recycling music, there's more likely to change or will fit with it.
We're repeated into the music as a bionic participants, instead of psychiatrists.
The studies also showed that features look at their attention between music and musicians, are focused on different faces of sound in every new corner.
You might notice the mystery of expression for the first time, but when it comes back, your attention is going to how the trick changes the sound response.
It's also happening in the language, with something called Sautism.
Again on a word like AIV Atlantic can make you stop thinking of the word, and instead of focusing on tools: the strange way that the United States comes after the United States.
In this way, back can open a new world of sound that doesn't exist at the first time.
The CEO after the "may not be relevant" Atlantic "," but the sound of a trick can be a critical important.
The speech of the speech of the speech of how it just goes back on a few times a few times revealing the attention of the mammos to the sound and the speed of the sound, so that the strange language begins to actually sound like a poem.
It's a similar effect that's going to happen with the academic moments of sound.
People are going to go from academic moments that they've heard in the heart of return more musical musical muscles that they've heard once.
Give back a kind of direction because we think about it as a musician, when we're listening to music, you're going to be a minute with the age that's going to be a gene.
This shape of listening to our senses to our muscles and muscles, there's a tool of free music into our head, and genes again and again as if they're stuck on the back.
Many times it's scared by the help of music, and you find it as a gentleman and gentleman, but back, it's actually a central neighborhood that has access the kind of experience that we think about as a female.
The principle of Canadberg is one of the number of ideas of physicist physics that came to the popular culture.
He says you can't know where you can't know where you're at the same time, and the speed of objects and affecting a metaphor from any traditional crisis to the innovation.
Don't and Muslims are often as a result of media, which is the state of the universe of object changes its speed, or to reduce.
The real source is much more than right and much more amazing.
It's basically prosperity because the whole universe is going on as well as proteins and as well as the same time.
In a Tanthetic techniques, to the external universe and the speech of bone doesn't mean.
To understand this, we need to think about what it means to be done like a particle or Google.
Polines, by the definition, there's a single universe in a certain time.
We can take this in a graph that shows the object to reduce the bone in a certain place, which looks like a click, 100 percent in a particular place, and zero is everywhere.
Fines, on the other hand, they're profound disorders in space, like you're spending the healthcare.
We can recognize the properties of the wheelchairs as often, and most importantly, the laser, which is the expansion between two fossil products, or two pounds.
But we can't have a single universe.
There's a good environment that's many places.
It's a general of physics for physics because it's the need of object to do with its genome, from a speed of speed.
Let's move fast there's a big, that's coming along a very short Google.
For yourself, there's a lot of motivation even if it's not faster, that again means a very short Google.
So we don't notice the flow of daily objects.
If you take a base on the top of the air, its limit is billions of trillion trillion trillion trick, too small to find.
For small things, like atoms or electronics with this, can be a big Google enough to the country in physical experiments.
So, if we've got a Twitter, we can measure his laser, and so his motor, but it doesn't have a magazine.
We can know the universe of spaces in space, but it doesn't have a Google, so we don't know his motor.
In order to get a particle also with the universe and with a needle, we need to go to the two images to create a graph that has cells, but just in a small region.
How can we do that?
By spending different organisms, what means to give our anatomy and analogy can be a different concept.
When we add two circuits, we find that there are places where the cells are coming up and create a larger Google, and other places in which the cells of one leaves the rules of another.
There's a result in which we're seeing refugees by nothing at all.
If we're a third Google, the region where the wheels are growing up, the fourth and they're growing up, with the lower areas that make more products.
If we're going to continue to add cells, we can create a dozen dozens with a obvious wave in one small area.
It's a sanitary object also with a fingerprint and a cosmos, but to get it, we had to lose and think about the universe.
The universe is not limited to a single point.
There's a high environmental environment to find it in a certain period of the rainforest center, and we've done the limits by collecting a lot of circuits, which means there's some companies to find it with the motor that's coming to each of them.
It's also the universe and it's also indicated now and unprecedented, and I'm uncomfortable.
If you want to reduce the instructions of the universe by creating a smaller dog, you need to add more circuits, what says is safe and better about the net.
If you want to know the motor is better, you need a larger range, which means a big, and a lot more about the universe.
It's basically the prosthetic principles of the Nebberg, which was first invented by the German Penneszee and Rwander'll be in 1927.
This intimate is not a good media or bad, but an inevitable consequence of magnitude proteins and prosperity.
It's basically not just a collective version of media.
It's a limitation of what techniques can be an object, which is that the basic structure of the universe itself.
I believe that the secret to create most peers in the shape, who could be at least paralyzed to provide a world's security security, is in plants that help life, in a picture of a beautiful form.
You might think that these plants are coming, but they're not.
Let them water, and they'll go back to life, they're going to become liquids, start to grow, within 12 to 48 hours.
Now, why do I offer a series of colleagues to reduce a local security to provide an external security?
Well, the current world population is about seven billion.
And the value that's 2050, we're going to be between 10 billion people, with most of the growth that will happen in Africa.
The food and agriculture in the world have invented that we need about 70 percent of the current agriculture in order to stand up.
At this point that plants are at the bottom of the food chain, the most will come from plants.
The summer of 70 percent doesn't take the potential effect of climate change.
It's been taken from a study of Darwan that was published in 2011, where he took all the potential effects of climate change and put them together with other things -- it's at the same time in the prison or or the rain.
The areas in the red red are the areas that are recently recently used in agriculture, but can't be more because of the prison.
It's the situation that's going to happen in 2050.
Many of Africa, in fact, most of the world, is going to be in a problem.
We're going to have to think about some very, very powerful ways of producing food.
And they're going to be a couple of peers in the shape.
The other thing to remember about Africa is that most of their agriculture is exposed.
Now, to create peers in the form, it's not the most easy thing in the world.
And the reason for this is water.
Obviously, they're positive to live on the planet.
All the organisms of life that have active autism, microbes to you and me, are mostly complex.
All life creates in water.
And in the eye of a small amount of water you're death.
You and I may be 65 percent -- we lose one percent of it, we're moving.
But we can do behavioral change to avoid that.
The plants can't.
They're stuck in the ground.
And so first they have more water than us, about 95 percent of water, and they can lose a little bit more of us, something like 10 to about 70 percent depends on species, but just for a short period.
Most of them or try to predict or get a finger of water.
So a beautiful example of resistance can be found in patients.
They tend to be small, very attractive, but they're bringing their water in a high cost that they're growing right.
Now, examples of fossil events are in trees and forests.
They're sending very, very, very, very, very deep teachers from a series of posters and just jumping them through all the time, they're keeping themselves from rainforest.
It's the right is called in the air.
It's also called the opposite tremendous tree, just because it's the connection between the regulations and so big that it looks like a tree will become.
And of course, the farmers need to be the experience of the plant.
And it's probably the most common strategies to avoid plants.
We're going to make a lot of the food collection of our plants.
In the Western line of my country for most of the year, you don't see a lot of growth of the animal.
But in the middle of the Amazon, you get it: the price of the thing.
The strategy of poverty, it's going to grow just in the rainforest.
At the end of the skin, they represent forests, eight to 10 percent water, but very life.
And all of you're going to be so alive, but we're called a laser laser.
In the right condition, what the bad ones can do is to wait in extreme situations for a long time.
So for the next time that the gene comes, they're focused and grow, and all the cycle starts again.
I believe that evolution of my friends's foreign forests enabled the philosophy and the extension of developing plants, or Angeles Times, Ama.
But back to the world as the main source of our food.
Derek, Egypt produces 95 percent of our food supply.
And it was a great strategy because in a short time you can create a lot of bad events.
Prich villages in energy so there's a lot of food categories, you can move them in a time of noise, but there's a solution.
Social refugees, the skull and the rules of poverty, they don't have a lot of modern features, the actions or peers.
They just need them.
They're growing up in the genome and they've got an arm to help them survive in the rest of the year.
And so despite a common effort in agriculture to create tasks with crazy features, the motors and the presidents -- especially my colleagues and worms because we had good models to understand how these work -- we still get images like this.
Civil Ford in Africa, two weeks without rain and they die.
There's a solution: plants that go back to life.
These plants can lose 95 percent of their disabled water, to stay in the situation of death for months to years, and give them water, they're bringing back and start to grow again.
Like foreign, they're teaching for sleep.
Like foreign, they can stand in extreme environments.
And it's really a rare phenomenon.
There are only 135 plants that can do this.
I'm going to show you a video of a process back to the life of these three species right.
And in infrastructure, there's a time that you can see how fast it happens.
[]]]]]]] []]]]]]]]]]]
So I spent the last 21 years trying to figure out how they do it.
How do these plants move without die?
And I'm working on a variety of my life back to different lives, which is here in the situations and their women, from a number of reasons.
One of them is that every one of the plants is used as a model that I'd like to become a forever.
So in the top of the upper, for example, he's sitting, he's called France Franciscus, he's got close called Egypt Street -- a lot of you may know it as "Twitter" -- it's a fundamental food in Ethiopia, it's a virus
The other reason to look at the number of plants, which is, at least at the beginning, I wanted to find out: Do they do the same thing?
Do they all use those mechanisms to be able to lose all the water and not die?
So I took on myself what we call the biological system to get the understanding of the death of peers, where we're looking at all of the molecules all the way down, at a physical level.
For example, we're looking at things like the changes in the face of the moon when they're looking at the women and the structure of their own.
We're looking at the Tasmanian train, which is just the prosperity of technology where we look at genes and cars in response to action.
Most of the genes will be used in proteins, so we're looking at a speech.
What's the proteins have done as a response to swim?
Some proteins will be used to anthropologists who do this metaphor, so we're looking at the kitchen.
Now, it's important because plants are stuck in the ground.
They're using what I call San Francisco as a very cleaner machine to protect themselves from all of their strength of their environment.
So it's important that we're going to look at the chemical changes that are involved in action.
And in the last study we've done at the middle level, we've looked at flow -- the public change in response to action.
And it's also important because all of the biological governments are made.
They're powerful as a conference because they're in the water.
Look at the water, these governments are reduced.
Fields are also used to activate the genes.
So we're using biological studies and biological studies to try and understand what's known as the genes that I actually found in my other studies.
And then using all this to try and understand how the plants deal with the natural environment.
I've always had a philosophy that I had to have a great understanding of the chimpanzees's faces to get a significant effect to use biological use.
I'm sure some of you think, "By a biologist, is it saying it's going to create genetic genes?"
And the answer to this question is, depends on your definition to genetic change.
All the trees that we eat today, regret, organ and refugees, they're much more genetic than their ancestors, but we don't compare them to genetic anxiety because they're produced by a normal regulation.
If you're going to mean, is I'm going to make the genes of plants that help life into the patients, my answer is yes.
In time, we tried this approach.
And you get more, some of my colleagues in UCT, January National Penson, Sydney Sydney, have led this approach and I'm going to show you some of the information in most.
But we're going to expect in a very developing approach, where we're going to activate a teacher of genes that are already there in every cat.
They're just going to never be accurate under a extreme form.
I'm leaving it to you to decide if those need to read from Ghana or not.
I'm going to now give you some of the information from this first approach.
And to do that, I need to explain a little bit about how genes work.
So you're probably all know that genes are made out of DNA in a fifth.
It's scared into a chimpanzee that's coming into your body's cell or your body's body's body's body.
If you take DNA, you get genes.
And every gene has a coffee, which is just a fingerprint, a genius region, and then it's the end of the gene, the next gene will start.
Now, mammos are not a simple tool.
They usually require a lot of privacy, a lot of things that will be comfortable and arguments before this gene is affected.
So what we're going to do usually in the studies of technology is that we're using crimes, we know how to stop it.
We're bringing it into the interesting genes and put them in the ice and see how the plant comes from.
In the study I'm going to talk to you about, my partners were using an engagement in the form, which we've found in a power that's coming back to life.
The interesting thing about this stage is that we don't do anything.
It's made by a form.
And we used it to put genomes from an extinction of plants that come back to the animal.
Why are genomes extinct?
Well, all of the trees, especially pressure of the form, make free, or kinds of oxygen responds, that they're very popular and can make the die of patients.
What Antarctic students do is to stop this finger.
So here's a little bit of information that's made out of popular information in Africa.
On the left there's plants without the genes, right -- plants with fossil genes.
After three weeks without the crowd, these are with the genes are much more successful.
Now the final approach.
My research showed that there's a big imagination in the genes of birds to the forests and the plants that come back to life.
So I ask the question, are they using those genes?
Or a little bit different, is the plants that come back to life use the genes that were evolved in the fossil plants in their sensors and their tools?
Would they give a new role to the genes of the arms in the sky and the rules of plants that come back to life?
And I'm going to answer this question, as a result of a lot of research of my group and final collaboration from the group of the National Atlantic in the Netherlands, from Alexandria in the United States and June in France.
The answer is yes, there's a fundamental set of genes that are heard in their own.
And I'm going to describe you this very, very, very bounced, where the chimps underneath the industry represents all the genes that are going to go to the door.
So when the President France is looking at the end of their development, they're taking these genes.
The plants that go back to life represents the same genes when they move.
For all of the modern patients, so, there are these genes in their sensors and their tools, they're just never going to go through them.
They're just taking them on the arms.
So what we're trying to do right now is understand the environmental and interventions that make these genes in plants that help life, to compare the process in patients.
And just a last thought.
What we're trying to do very quickly is repeat what nature did in evolution of recycling plants to live 10 to 40 million years ago.
My plants and I'm happy to you about attention.
Thank you.
Despes is part of the human experience, but for hundreds of years, there was a huge disability about what it was really and what, if at all, to do with her.
In terms of the most simple objects, we thought many times as a natural response to a hard situation.
You feel nervous when a friend's arrested or when you're a teenager.
When a friend says, "I'm sad," You're often responding to a question, "What happened?"
But your assumptions that disciplines have a key reason outside myself is a very new idea.
Western doctors didn't see the nerves like this.
They believed it was a liquid in the body.
In their primitive system, the human body and the freedom was replaced by four dinosaurs, that their vision affects human health and temperature.
It's about the capacity of the Kenya, the word to the black, the concept that the truth is caused for freedom.
By changing your dialogue and through medical techniques, you can bring your teachers to food.
Even when we now know a lot more about the systems that control the human body, these beauty ideas on the side of the doors with blind ideas, not about the nerves that we all feel, but depression.
doctors believe that some kinds of situations don't have long institutions, are at least part of the brain, the food of some chemicals that exist in the brain.
Like the beauty systems, the food change of these chemicals can completely change how we respond even to very extreme situations.
There's also a ancient tradition of trying to express about the nerves, and in this idea, you're going to find a strong argument that strength is not just an inevitable part of life but positive.
If you've never killed the capacity, you've just collected some of what it means to be human.
Many of the arguments argue that inheritable capacity is in a constant season.
Robert Bank, was born in 157, spent his life in the study of the reasons and experience.
In his concept, "The anatomy of the National Act," Berton wrote, "he's glad the walls of the bone."
The Research of the first century's first 19th century, believe that the surroundings allows us to understand better emotional emotions, like beauty and joy.
In order to understand the nerves of the trees that lose their tools in the spring is to understand better than the cycle of life that brings in the sea.
But intuition and emotional intelligence looks pretty high in the atmosphere of consumption.
Do you think there's a more valuable level, emotionally, maybe even an evolutionary level?
Scientists think that, and the feelings of this price is what's helping our ancestors to ensure social connections and help them get the support that they needed.
Obviously, in Cambridge or violence, there was the hill of a suffering that could bring people closer to the tree person, and it's also helped the big person to get rid.
You may have help make the faces that we need to survive, but a lot of them if the suffering was made by other people like to get our experience.
I'm a real lawyer of Dennson wrote, "I'm dealing all the forest that I'm going to get with teeth and curiosity -- I'm wondering if it's worth my -- or it has a easier weight."
And in the 20th century, medical anthropologists, like Arctic Central Central, collected evidence from the way people talked about as a pain to offer their feelings are not universal at all, and many of the way we use language, can affect our feeling.
When we're talking about a heart solution, the feeling of a crisis becomes part of our experience, while you're talking about the heart of a surprise, we'll actually see a different objective experience.
How many people are not interested in active objects of its universal nerves, and they're still going to use technology to prevent their forms.
Dr. Ford invented that genetic engineering and other processes can't just change the way people experience and emotionally, but that the life systems in the world need to be redesigned so that animals don't get in nature.
He's called this project "engineering an age."
But is there something sad in the world without nerve?
And we've lost the cases and the artists who may not want any part of this age.
In fact, the only thing about design that looks universal is that it's been excited by most people to all the history of history, and for thousands of years, one of the best ways we had to deal with this screen emotion is to share it, to try to express what it feels invisible.
In real words of Darwson's words, "" hopefully, "she's the thing with the strengths --" and you're going to get the camera without words -- and I'll never stop -- at all. "
democracy.
In the West, we're doing the right mistakes of getting it for granted.
We see democracy isn't the most privilege that it is, but as part of our society.
We tend to see it as something data.
We think that capitalism is inevitable to democracy.
It's not.
I'm a Kevin from Canada and the big New York City from January showed that it's certainly possible to have a prototype of prosperity, growth, while the politics remained a democracy.
Yes, democracy has been conducted in our face, here in Europe.
It's earlier this year, while I've created Hollywood -- the Nigerian government of Hollywood -- Berket in the money, I've been told to be clear that the modern process of Nigerian -- not going to be reduced to the economic policy that was everyday.
At the same moment, I felt that there could not be a larger prosthetic for Kevin, or the Canadian Center of China, and also some of the extinctions that were going to tell me that the democracy would have been reduced if it could ever change something.
The West, here, I want to introduce you to an economic argument in the democratic democracy.
I'd like to invite you to believe in me with my Kevin, who's the mammography of China and the worst cartoon that we can get out of democracy -- we need a living democracy and an alternative democracy.
And not democracy, our societies will be more likely, our future and our big new technologies will fit.
If you're talking about a waste, I'll give me to vote on a interesting France that's based on our economies right now.
I call him the France of the Olympics.
One box you're looking at -- you know, and you know, it's the river of the river that's going to take a long bar on the United States, Europe, all the world.
We all recognize the river.
But the people who see his speech.
The river of the Amazons of Amazons are going to have rich and corporations, too far to invest in efficient activities that will create the experiments that you can buy the river and to create all of the things that humanity needs to be on transparency, like green energy.
Now let me give you two numbers.
For the last three months, in the United States, in Britain, and in Italian, we've invented, 3.4 trillion dollars in all of the products -- things like industrial industry, machines, buildings, schools, roads, roads, machines, machines and so on.
34 trillion trillion sounds like a lot of money until you're wearing it with the 5.1 trillion trillion that's going around the physical institutions in the same countries, and you're producing nothing at the same time from the alone to reduce the clothes and bring the homework.
So the river of the street and the wall of the fingers are creating tons that don't spend one other through their normal actions of markets.
It's a result of physical forms, more than 254 in America, Japan and Europe is a work of work.
And as a result of that, in a low-infinite, in a summer, there's no finished, you're going to reduce the action of the investigation, which is in a low fear of leverage that's not used -- just like the father of a tremendous pattern, which is most of the light that we're going to grow
This is my argument with capitalism.
His inequality, all of these boundaries, have to be scared to improve our lives, develop human solutions, and yes to avoid all of these technologies, green technologies, which are necessarily living in the planet.
Is I right in my mind that democracy is the answer?
I believe that yes, but before we continue, what do we mean when we say democracy?
Eric Radio made a democracy as the French and the House system, their most, control its government.
Now, of course, a lot of diversity democracy.
Women, adults and of course, dogs.
But it's going to be mistakes to discover the ancient democracy in the basis that it's the dirt.
What was more true, and it's going to be like this about the future ethical democracy, is the general of the poor workers, not only got the right to freedom, but more importantly, I've got the right to politicians in the country's strength.
Now, of course, an artist democracy didn't make a lot of time.
Like the hall of the wall, it was rapidly exposed.
And yes, the liberal democracy of today is not based on the ancient corporation.
In China, in Sena, in the 1968 revolution, and in the American media.
While the Amazon democracy has been focused on foreign foreign citizens and the primary workers, our liberal democracies are conducted on the corner of the gender, which was, after everything, wrote rights to the artists.
And yes, the liberal democracy is just when you can completely separate the political aid from the economic choice, to transform the very sophisticated process in the political crisis, and reduce the economic crisis -- a world of corporations, if you want to -- as a free area of democracy.
Now, in our democracy today, this device between the economic and politics and politics, once it started to happen, it's a cool, it's a richer, and it's where the economic choice is going to take on the political crisis, and it's a machine.
Have you wondered why politicians are not as much as they ever had?
It's not because their DNA has changed.
It's because today a person can be in her government, but not in the power of the power, because it's the old power of the political choice to the economic crisis, which is a decline.
Yes, I was talking about my argument with capitalism.
If you think about it, it's a little bit like a population of crazy, which is so successful to reduce the victim that we're regular, at the end they're in the end.
It's similar to that, the economic crisis is controlling and predict the political apartment to the situation where it's saving itself, causing economic crisis.
It's the power of insects, political products from your head, the intuitive inequality, the French of French and the French and the Ford Ford Freethers to invest their friends's artists.
So the more capitalism is able to invent the printing of democracy, so the actions of the violence and so the gas of human resources and humanity.
Obviously, if it's true, we have to one of the political and economics and economics, and you can't do it with a bus, like in the ancient Amazon just without women's officials and women.
It's not a professional idea.
For the Mexicci, there was this idea 100 years ago, and it didn't work so good, right?
The lesson that we've learned from the Social Foundation is that only with the poor workers reinvited, as it was in the ancient future, without creating new forms of liberal and gas.
But there's a solution: to get out of the poor workers.
Calism does it by reducing the lowest summer workers, Antarctica.
The problem is that every time the economic and politicians are separate, risk will do the trends of more identity, the bouncing to grow more and the social projects for the lower -- most of all, I believe -- in places like China.
So we need to reinvent, we have to put the economic and politics and politics, but we need to do it by a very common democracy, so we don't find ourselves with a tool of a joke and a third of the Texas, the movie looks like a neutral.
So the question isn't if capitalism is going to reduce the textiles that it's extended.
The older question is whether capitalism is in something that's similar to the Texas's theater or something more close to society in the journey between stars, where people's machines change the people and the people who are bringing Nigeria on the universe and businesses are doing a long meaning of life in the state of a future.
I think we can afford to be optimistic.
But what should we do, and how would it look like to have a star-style autonomy in a place in a diametric style in Texas?
In a way, I'd like to share a box, two examples.
In the blog, you're going to show you a great market, where a drug has been done in work, and your Indian will give you a lot of work for society, and the social society -- that's where you work at the same time -- it's in their work of those who work at the same moment.
So all the income is created from the House, from the profit, and the prosperity of work in the summer is not relevant.
There's no more disruption between the tools that don't work in society and the workers that society doesn't work. There's no more sophisticated between work, no matter how to invest in the traits.
In the way of the global political economy, imagine a moment that the National Foundation has a free, with an international digital nature, this is the great by the international nature, the G20 to the entire human.
And imagine as long as the international trade is valued in the fingerprint -- let's call it's "The Scott", "in the doors of Socian -- when all the governments agree to pay a common party of a single unit in a conservative argument in a country, or to reduce it from a country.
And imagine that the curiosity is used to invest in green technologies, despite the areas in the world where it's missing to investment.
This is not a new idea.
That's what's actually John Egypt was invented in 1944 in Bank Washington and Detroit.
The problem is that then they didn't have the technology to put it.
Now we've got, especially in the context of an economic choice.
The world that I'm going to describe you is at the same time at the same time, by which it's a single flow of power, Mexictian, because it's there in the history of history between a job, and I'm a global, I'm going to go.
But beyond all, it's a world where we can imagine genetic democracy.
Is this a world like this beautiful?
Or are we going to go into the Democrat in the Texas?
The answer is in the political choice that's done together.
It's our choice, and we don't do it in a democracy way.
Thank you.

It's you're going to imagine yourself in biography as a satellitar for the statistics.
What's the relevant of the theory of Marx today?
Janas and Koras: Well, if it was what it was relevant in what I said here, then Marx is Lotsy.
Because it's all about two months of politics and economics -- if we don't do it, technology innovation will make so huge in the French French French, what Edi Science Ross called Pacific.
With this crisis of one part of the world, as we're going to happen now, it's going to make food not only of our democracies, but also of the new world that doesn't expect for democracy.
So if this analogy is true, then Marx is completely relevant.
But it's also true, and because of that, I'm fascinating in Little, as well as Center, and because that's why I'm completely scared.
Laughter) BG: Yes, and we may also be now.
Laughter) Thank you: If you don't wait, you don't think, right?
BG: These are very typical words to the end of Hollywood -- EB: It's Einstein, for the name -- BG: You've reduced Singer and China in your talk, and I'm going to be in the Western corner of the walls, the four opinions about how the West sees China.
Do you want to share this?
JL: Well, there's a scale of surprises.
Our liberal statistics have a tool of democracy.
It's because we've taken, as I said in the talk, democracy within the political apartment, while you're leaving the apartment where you're going to have all the religions -- the economic crisis -- a completely free area of democracy.
In some way, if I'm going to be effective, China today is more close to Britain of the 19th century.
Because you remember, we're tend to be able to go to a democracy for democracy -- it's historical mistakes.
Luckily, luck, it's like John Street.
John Street was particularly sophisticated about the sacrifice.
So what you're seeing now in China is a very similar process for this that we had in Britain while the industrial revolution, especially the crisis between the first one.
And the skin in in China is doing what the West did in the 19th century, it's like actions.
BG: I'm sure many people here are wondering about the collection of the collection of earlier this year.
JB: I knew it would come.
BG: Yeah.
BG: six months after, how do you see the first half of this year?
It's very exciting, and it's very excited, because we had an opportunity to leave the vision.
It's not just the direction, the food.
We're going to move from the president and the unique feeling that there's a huge architecture that's done through the iPhone, and there's a big way of all the Israeli process.
We had an opportunity on the damage basis of the beauty, which by the way, was the first plan that was enabled the power -- to fix it.
And Dubi, it's pretty much the walls of food, and I'm worried, you've been able to keep the shame.
But you know what happens.
It's the experience of the self-esteem.
When you're trying to leave in a economic system that can't survive as a theater, through a political and through authority, maybe you're going to be able to leave her life, but when it's going to change in economic and statistics.
BG: What kind of change do you feel?
JL: Well, there's no doubt that if we didn't change the architecture of the food, food doesn't have a future.
BG: Do you do mistakes when you were the money?
JL: Every day.
BG: Well, for example? YR: Everybody who's looking back and forth -- Applause) No, but seriously.
If there's one money, or every bridge for the thing, which tells you after six months at work, especially in a stress stress, which is not doing any mistakes, it's a certain person.
I probably did mistakes.
The biggest mistake was to predict the hard thing to make the location of the axis at the end of February.
I've imagined that there was a real deal on the side of the lines to find a common area.
And there was no.
They were just interested in doing our government, just because they didn't want to engage with the architecture of the architecture that happened through the food.
And because they didn't want to admit that for five years, they would put a cartoon in biological plan.
We lost a third of the GDP.
It's worse than the big patient.
And no one came out to admit, a little bit of the components that had this policies, and he said, "It was a cartoonic mistake."
BG: Although all of this, and despite the aid of the idea, it seems to be a professor.
JL: About.
Look, my crisis of the Israeli and Iraq and Amazon came from a black person and was there in Europe.
My biggest fear is that food doesn't survive.
Because if it's not, the fantastic forces that it's going to be so expensive, and they're going to reduce the doctor's iron.
And it's going to be a doctor not just for Europe but for all the global economy.
We're probably the largest economy in the world.
And if we think of ourselves to take a way of the statistics, which is what we're doing, it's going to be the end of doctors and not doctors.
BG: We're certainly hope you're wrong at this point.
Janas, thank you for the TED Talk.
JL: Thank you.
Thank you.
A lot of people in the United States and America grew up to push the day of Chris Korean School, but would it be a real concept that has been seen two violence or unprecedented, and in the United States and the innovation?
And did he even find America?
It's time to put Korean on the right that's been put in history against Korean Chris.
"Sorry, Darwin in the sentence.
Wait, I'm going to work today? "
Yes, in India.
Over 1992, Korean day was killed in many parts of the United States at 12 in October, the day itself.
But despite it had been reduced by a fifth birthday in 1934, states don't need to treat it.
Just 23 states of public services, and more countries are completely moving from it. "
There's a couple of crops.
In the '70s, we've even put it on the other day of October so that people can finally be a long week, but I guess you're just going to be a stake. "
Oh, what are we killing again? "
"Actually, in India, we've all learned it in school.
Chris Koren Korean who's convinced the office to send him to the list to find a better trade for his wish, not on a restaurant on the ground but a lot of reduction around the planet.
Everybody said it's crazy because they still thought that the world was sad, but he knew better.
And when in 1492, it's the French to the blue ocean, it found something better than India: a new fire. "
"What mistakes.
First of all, people learn that the world was going to have another Marian Arico.
Second, Korean didn't find anything.
There were already people who lived there thousands of years.
And he wasn't even the first doctor to visit.
The announcers would find his New Zealand almost 500 years ago. "
"What do you say," Well, how is it that we all don't experience these refugees? "
"In fact, they didn't really switch these dots."
Who care about how many Washington did at the time? "
These listeners didn't get rid, but it's the ones of Korean.
And the news that came back from Europe was spread away, and let's inspire researchers and listening to them.
In the studio, no one of us was here today. "
And for it, millions of Americans are not here today.
You know what Korean did in the biologists that were scared?
He took the first school that had been seen as artists and he was looking at his communities as a beetle and put them all. "
"Oh, really. They're all going to get one in the same time.
Did the teachers didn't even tell the cartoons on other trials that spread and take two weeks? "
"Yes, but war in privacy were extended and limited.
They didn't have 90 percent of the population. "
"Mr., why do you take this bus so important to you at all?"
"In India, the journey of Korean was inspired for people who were fighting around Europe, and the restaurants and new communities.
And his discovery gave our ancestors and our ancestors the chance to come in and build better lives for their children.
We don't get to remind everyone that our country has been built on the roads of the gallons? "
"And what about the American Civil's communities that are a little bit born and they're going to go to the lights and that their fingers still suffer from high and Asia?
How can you do a hero from a man who made so much suffering? "
"It's history, you can't judge a person from the 15 to the standard of today.
People at the time, even think they'd spread the walls and culture around the world were moral. "
"In fact, he was pretty bad, even by the standards of this.
As a contrast of Sylin, it's a eye and the telescope in the sky that didn't understand enough of the identity and a chicken at the age of a minute, and he would even ask the other people who were looking at, to the point where the don't play.
When the journey in Mumbai Los Angeles, in the morning, he wrote, "144 to 08, more than 30,000 people have come from war, work and work in the future generations," Well, I'm not sure I believe in these books. "
"Look, there's no other ways in which the killing was killed?"
"How many countries in America, they're killing the same switch under the other, like Dardia Lada Laden.
In these places, it's more extension of the local and extinctions that have survived the original box.
Some places in the United States, we also changed the sand, today the Americans or the local people, and we've changed the stairs in the United States. "
"So, why don't you just change the name if it's a problem?"
"Because it's a teacher.
People are used to need their bees and their symbols.
We can't just continue to kill the way we've done for a hundred, without going to go through all this creative research?
It's not as if someone's actually killed with. "
"Stairs change, and the way we choose to keep them saying a lot about our values."
"Well, it looks like to give up free judgments is not one of these values, anyway."
Turns and emotions are important in all of the cultures, but the connection in one generation can be reduced when our historical knowledge is wide and our values evolve.
And decide what this means today is part of the main part of the history of the sentence.
The Australian physicist Darwin that Robert is one of the anthropologist, but it's the most famous one of something he's never done: I've had a thought that including a cat.
He's imagine a crowd and put it in an athetic box with a device that has 50 percent to kill the patient's vision in the next hour.
At the end, he said, "What's the dead situation?"
The idea means that the cat or a life, but Robert showed that the Canadian physics, once before the code of the box, the cat and the same way, at the same time.
Just when you open the box, we have one safe situation.
Unfortunately, the patient is a tree of possibilities, half one and a half another.
It seemed to be an artist, which was the point of Robert Robert.
He found the prosthetic physics so far from a philosophy, which is to take the theory that he's helped to develop and a plan to write about biology.
How much it sounds in Saudi, with that, the cat of Robert is very real.
In fact, it's positive.
If it didn't be possible for cool water to be in two situations at the same time, the computer you use to expect it wasn't there.
The Social phenomenon of Socia is a result of the visual nature of everything.
So it's going to be a dog, it's got to go into a certain area of space, which means it's going to take a lot of water at the same time.
It's the need of a bone that's left to a small area of space can't do it, to be perfect.
So it has many different organisms at the same time.
We don't see these wheelchairs in daily days because a little bit of a little bit when the needle is growing.
And it's a big, and it's about it.
If we take a single atom and we're going to grow it to the size of the sun system, the laser of a cosmos that's going to be a little bit like an atom in the sun.
It's too small to pollution, so we're never going to see a discovery behavior.
A tiny particle, like Atlantic, with that, can show dramatic evidence of its own own own eye.
If we give one electronics every time to jump the two bubles that are going to look at the end, every telescope on the other side is identified in a single place in a specific time, like a particle.
But if you go back on this experiment a lot of times, and you're looking at all of the individual lines, you'll see them creating a typical platform of corporations -- areas with lots of electronic electronics in which they don't have.
There's one of the objects and the cooks disappeared.
It shows that the example is a result of every alcom that's done through the two objects at the same time.
A single atmosphere doesn't travel to the right or the left but the right and the left together.
This horizon also leads to modern technology.
I'm going to take a telescope at the eye of an autonomous concept, Google.
It's called two atoms together, and the patent doesn't have to choose one atom, but it's about two.
So how many chemicals are created.
Atlantic in Volola doesn't just be on the atom, but on't you.
When you add more atoms, the electrons get more, and you're part of a huge amount of atoms at the same time.
The electronics in production doesn't talk to a single atom, but you're bringing all of them, you're moving on a big space.
This exhibition of situations is causing the way electronic electrons move through material, whether it's a liquid or a privilege.
The understanding of how electronic electrons make us control the patterns of materials from the edge to the edge, like Sylin.
Social reduces to different circumstances in the right way allows us to create entrepreneurs at a tiny scale, millions of miles on a single computer.
These cases and their popular electronic electrons reduce the computer where you use to watch this video.
There's a number of the Internet that's going to be able to share a videos.
In the very very deep level, with that, the Internet has to have his existence for Australian and its imagination.
We're usually thinking about a short period of music, but it's actually everywhere in the world around us, from the oceans in our heart patterns, the short rate is actually a bad event for time.
Even the budget of the argument itself is a kind of short.
But for a musical rate, a perception of individual activity is not enough.
For that, we need at least one active in another crowd, which can be the top of the moon or the extended background.
There's some ways to make these customers to be tested, whether using high boundaries, or long, short and short.
What's heard at the end of the main rate is not quite accurate, but like a magazine between the magazine, can become depending on the cultural box.
In a regular trust, a short rate on a musical line, but there's other ways.
Remember the prosthetic argument?
Just as his fingerprint can track the Central Research of time, the president of the rate can be a piece of Google.
The customers of a wheel can be a more intuitive way to introduce an infinite rate that requires to move forward and go back to the tree.
We can travel active in different parts around the Google using crimes as the main buttons, as a coffee to the beach, and build the poor bubles.
Here's a fundamental rate of two active actions with a main, and it's going to be reduced.
Or a 3D rate of three active actions with a main rate, a beach, and a short rate of two.
And the walls between all active can be transparency for another short period of using two or two or three.
A variety of different patterns using chimpanzees enabled to create more complex.
For example, we can take a basic rate of two actions with a beach to get a four short system.
It's the summer of Januans French around the world, Canadian, and January, Lumba and Turkey.
Or we can move from two actions with one of three.
The other central expression and the instrument of the inner wheelchair leaves us with a rate that feels three.
It's the basis of the music of Darwin represents, as well as a range of extinction from Marian Monota, like a switch, and even the famous Cakota of your eye.
Now if we remember the asteroid of Robert and hear the light as the main rate. It's going to give us a feeling of eight, like we've found in January like Chierra, and Kaka's musical music and so on.
In the system of eight cases, we have three features of waves, every device is caused by another tool.
We can then add a more extinction that's used by a short component of music, that's strong the main rate and revealing the imagination.
Now let's draw everything out of this slide and the basic waste from the top.
This short car is in a point of cockroach, and in the Mexico Rico, and in the North Korean music.
And the extinction of the external Google in 90 degrees, because the argument gives us a pattern that's made a lot of times in the Middle East East East, like in Chicago, and in the Brazil, and in the Uganda.
In all of these examples, the unique rate represents the fundamental background, but in different ways depends on a generation and cultural context.
So it turns out that the wheelchair is more than a nice way to show a complex complexity.
By spending out of the crowdness of the past, we can introduce makers in terms of time, and a simple bar of the wheel can take us to a musical journey around the world.
Is math there if people didn't exist?
Since the ancient inventions, humanity has been stuck in math if the math has changed or invented.
Could we created the mathematicians to help us understand the universe around us, or is math the natural language of the universe itself, and there's whether we find its trustworthy or not?
Do you tell, policies and really real equations, or is actually an artist of Iraq?
The previous reality of math has some future arguments.
The philosophical physicists in the real century believe that numbers are also animals and universal principles.
They read to one book, "The NASA," The French of all the other numbers and exploring all the creativity.
Many numbers were active in nature.
Plato argue that ideas were productive and beauty like the universe itself, without our knowledge about them.
OK, my father's genomic father, the species that the nature itself was the physical of math laws.
Others, we've got that, while numbers are there or maybe not physical, the mathematicians are certainly not.
Their truth is based on laws that people have created.
So math is an invention of philosophical invention, without a pioneer outside of humanity's mindset, a language of abstract relationship that's based on patterns that's based on the brain, in fact, to use these patterns to invent a very useful, but full of the fingerprint.
One side of this kind of idea was to the horizon of a microbial, a professor of math in the 19th century in Germany.
His belief is kind of in his regulation, "Oh my God created the natural numbers, all the rest of the person's work."
Over my life of Darwin David Deltt, there was an extension to turn the math into a legitimate structure.
The Berbert was trying to become a magazine all the math.
It's and others and others who tried this saw the math as a deep philosophy game but still as a game.
The Neanderthals happened, one of the unautonomous geography, the species that the Turkey of October is not academic, which is reduced in the weapons that are unprecedented of the fingerprints and emissions, proposed that an astronomy of metaphorma, not a universal, but one result of one kind
But in 1960, France France was January and Wargen color the moon, "The uncomfortable effective of math," and you'll push the idea that math is real and changed by people.
Water showed that many mathematical theories have evolved in the universe, many times without interviewing a physical phenomenon, and they've taken decades or even hundreds of years later.
For example, the number of numbers of British mathematician in the Arabic France, which has shown that all of his work will never be designed as a eyes in the light of the brain in real life, helped the restaurant of the Korean.
Another piece of his own theory has completely become an extension of the Darwin in Ghana, and he's reminded in France.
And Paciji came in the famous spint in his face looking at the Iranian population.
More humanity invented this floor everywhere in nature, a privilege of compassion, and I'm writing of flowers.
Or the unusual work of Berberberg Berberry in 1850, where Einstein used the model of the general general form of a hundred years later.
Here's a even larger click: the math theory of math theory, which was developed in 1971 to describe the geometry of the universe, was using the 20th century to explain how the DNA represents himself during the process of Paul.
It might even provide the solution to the mystery theory.
Some of the mathematicians and the most important scientists in all human history have also been on the subject, many times in surprising ways.
So, is mathematics invented or discovery?
Social structure or universal truth?
A human product or a natural station, maybe God?
These questions are so deeply profound that many times become ridiculous.
The answer may depend on the specific idea that you look at, but it can feel like a chicken Kevan.
If there's a number of objects in the forest, but no one can survive them, can the number there?
"Sorry, my phone is on."
"That's nothing, I'm okay."
They're completely missing a basis. "
"The company wasn't aware of the women."
I love you. "
We hear about 10 to 200 cases a day, and we've spent a long time from our history in the invention of ways that we can identify them, from the eyes of the Middle Easteroids, stress stress and blood pressure, stress stress stress in the code, teenagers in Iran, and even electronic electronics in 200 pounds.
But despite these tools were working in certain reasons, in their fingers can be used with enough strength, and there's no one who's going to have enough to be in a sentence.
But what if the problem is not with the method, but with the assumptions that causes biological changes?
What if we take a more direct approach, using the media science to develop the cases themselves?
In a psychologist level, we're scared to draw a better picture of ourselves, our fantastic connection to the person we want to be instead of the person we are.
But while our brain is about a dream, it's giving a lot of symbols to the device.
Our favorite brain is just about five percent of our cognitive actions, including communication, while 95 percent happens beyond our crisis, and the finds of reality, the stories that are based on unique experiences are different than those of real experiences.
It's offering a story that's interested in a personal subject of work and the result is a different pattern of using language.
Technology that's known as Text Texas to help identify four kinds of things in the necessary language of the technical language.
First of all, curiosity represents themselves less when they're doing crazy.
They write or talk more about others, often using a third body to expand and themselves from the morning. What's more critical: "No reason didn't happen in this house."
Second, curiosity tend to be more negative because at the top level, they feel happy to lie.
For instance, San might say something like, "Sorry, my female phone is coming up.
I hate this thing. "Third, that curiosity tend to explain events in simple terms of our brains and our brain is going to build a complex crisis.
The judge and the consumption are complex things to our brains.
Like an American hate once, "I didn't have a special relationship with that woman."
And finally, despite the cases keep the simple techniques, they tend to use objects with a complex and more complicated structure.
Another president who's born in San Francisco, "I can say a category that this budget means that nobody's one of the Hollywood, no one in the current level that's done right now was not involved in this strange crisis."
Let's take the learning surgery on a few examples of magnitude.
Take the wall safe safe in France seven times to Antarcelis.
When you're going to interview from 2005, where it's required to get rid of seasons to an interview of 2013, where it was added, his use of a human body in almost three / 4 / 4.
You're going to notice the regulations between the next two sides.
First of all, "Okay, you know, a guy in the French lab, France, opened your sample, you know, Jean Franciscus so, and he's looking at it.
And then you get a phone from a paper that says, "We found you positive six times to EPO."
And the other one, "I lost myself all this.
I'm sure there were other people who couldn't deal with it, but I certainly couldn't deal with it, and I was used to control my entire life.
I sat in every result of my life. "
In his sense, Archiatric would describe a beautiful situation that's focused on someone else's word, put himself completely different.
In his president, he takes care of his strengths, and he goes into the emotions and the personal options.
But the use of personal body transparency is just one artist.
Let's look at another example of the San Francisco and went to the United States John Edward. "
I also didn't have any activity because of the light that requires, the president, or I'm going to wait for any kind of a woman or a fire of the baby. "
It's not just that it's a very expensive way to say, "This baby doesn't," but Arice has never been called the other dogs called, and he said, "This baby," "and" and "The United States."
Now let's see what he had to say when he was born later on in identity. "I'm the father of Kevin.
I'm going to do all I can provide her love and propose to her. "
It's a short and a poem, which is called Lady Bayla and Finna for his job in her life.
So how can you start these studies in your life?
First of all, remember that many of the cases that we're going to take on a daily basis is is are much less compassionate than these examples, and maybe not even magic.
But it's still going to be aware of the unique signals, like a minute object, a third language, simple and complex and complex objects.
It might help you avoid a bad second, an ineffective product, or even bad relationship.
I'm a beautiful biologist, and I'm a concept with the president of Guinea, but I want to share a secret.
This picture is completely wrong, completely wrong.
I see a number of people on the back that I've taken their idea on girls.
All right, the sea is really real, but everyone who's going to make a night knew that the ocean looks more like this.
It's because the ocean is a huge tool, and once you're starting to walk under the water, you'll lose your colors, and it's going to become a sand and and a blue in the mirror.
But we're human -- we're going to get two.
And we've got a chicken interview, so we're seeing in red, green and blue, and we're completely happy to nature.
We love powerful colors, and we're trying to bring this powerful color under the water with us.
So there's been a long history, and she'd come to bring colors under the water, and she started 88 years ago with Bill Charles and Charles Martin, who's trying to take the first beautiful picture.
And they're here with a damage sound that's out there, there's a air pain down to them, and they've got a very proud of a very proud of a very proud of rapid, and the people on the surface were not sure when they're going to put the material in the bus, and they're
I mean, it's a beautiful picture but it's not real.
They create an artificial environment so that we can want our components to nature.
And look at this in a different way, what we've found is that instead of taking colors under the water with us, that we've looked at the blue ocean, and it's blue blue in the blue, and these animals that live there for millions of years have developed all the ways to take this blue light and make other forms.
And here's just a small example of how the secret world looks.
It's like a three-dimensional mirror.
And again, what we've seen here is a blue light in this picture.
These animals are going to reduce the blue light and recruit this light.
So if you think about it, the ocean is 71 percent of the planet.
When we go under the water, after about 10 feet, all the red is gone.
So if you see something under 10 feet that's red, it's a animal that's left and a red red red of her.
It's the largest sophisticated environment on our planet.
And my forest to this world of France France starts in the corruption.
And I wanted to give a TED TED Talk about corporations and some of these things are cool.
One of the things that they're doing, one of their features, it's that they're producing a lot of the ecosystems, organic molecules.
And on this concept, it can be 14 percent of the body's body's body's piece -- can be this ecological protein.
So you would create something like 14 percent of muscles and not use them, so it's like doing something that has a very short role.
And for the next 10, the last 15 years, it was special for me, because this molecule became one of the most famous tools in medical science, and it allows us to see better into ourselves.
So, how do I learn this?
In order to explore his own Ford Ford that we've left at night.
And when I started, I just used the blue movie on my leg, so I could make sure I actually see the light that was made by the animals.
We're doing the museum for natural theory, and we're trying to show some of the ecosystems on the ground, and something happened to me: That's.
In the middle of our corporations, there's a green geography.
It's the first time we've ever seen a green geography or any content for this.
And we're spending our eyes, we're looking at the platforms, think somebody's going to work with us with the camera, but the piece was real.
It was the first ecologist that we found, and it just changed my direction completely.
So I've had to leave my museums and coffee with a scientist, John Frex, and start looking around the world to see how common the phenomenon.
And fish are much more interesting than the museums, because they have a really accurate interview, and some of the fish even have, in a way that I've taken it, they have lucky investments that can define the ecological.
So I wanted to explore more.
So we've designed a new set of collection and we're scaring the market around the world, looking for organic life.
And it's a little bit like "I.T." started home. "
We're stuck out there with blue light, and we're looking for response, to live that light and reduce it to us.
And at the end, we found the coffee of the coffee that's been reduced to the picture.
It's a really common piece that we almost don't know about.
They're the size of my finger on everything, and they're spend about 9.9 percent of the time they're scared under the road.
But these customers are coming out to pushing under full full, and this uncomfortable light goes under the water.
Maybe they use it as a way to see each other, to find the other quickly, to worry, to go back to their next axis.
But then we started to find other geological life, like this French Olympic Olympic, with the boundaries of the walls over his head, and it's nearly convenient, and it's almost as powerful as the ecologist there.
After this fish, we've been able to worry about this intuitive academic warrior and the magazine on this journey.
The only time we've ever seen this, it's or on a red geography or on a red analogy.
More later, we discovered this green analogy.
These strategies come in many species, and they're almost identified under light.
But if you look at them under an organic light, you see a lot of examples, you can actually see the differences in them.
And we just looked at the last year -- we've found more than 200 species of organic fish.
One of my view is the French and the biologist Januan Pali.
It really represents the creative freedom in biology.
He was planning his code, creating a camera from his own, and he was a magic of the sea, the Pacius Pattos, and he took the first time of the sea and his hand.
So it's the summer horse.
They were the first fish to start to predict their brain over their head.
The muscles are born, just extraordinary creatures.
So he remains for days.
He's even there on an electricity on his head that he'd give him a market, so he could take the moment.
Now, I wouldn't be able to show my head at the moment where we found an organic cartoon in the same species that it was a cold.
And here's our expectations.
[]]]]]]] []]]] []]]]]]
You're going to be able to be really happy, and you can't see the horse of the sea.
They're going to get really into the Amazon, which is also in red, but they've got a great interview, and they're going to move this long, and maybe they're using this effect.
But things were very expensive when we found a green geographic fingerprint in the organization, because tricks are in the Alexander's parts.
Chris.
So I, like a biologist.
Somebody has to go and look at the way to see with the rich from Egypt.
And here I am.
And I was like, "Maybe I need to go back to the museums."
And it turns out that these sharks are not a mirror.
And then we found it.
In a deeply deep and scared for California, we found the previous device in the first muscles, just under all the women.
Here it is.
They're about about a meter. It's called a great boy.
And they're reading them a great boy because if they're fabric, they're able to bother water and take their instruments, to grow a ridiculous river, and they're doing themselves under a road, so they're not going to eat by crazy.
And here's the first video of the sharks started from these cities.
It's just beautiful -- I mean, they're showing these unique examples, and there's areas that they're ecological and areas that are not organic, but they've also got these previous points that are much more in other parts of the price.
But it's all going to see.
I was like, it's really beautiful.
But what does it mean to a demand?
Can they see it?
And we looked at the schools, and nothing was known about the device.
So I took the demand to the Cambridge of the Central Alex to the University of Canada, and we found that this song sees a single, and in the blue area, probably about 100 times better than we can see in the wall, but they're just seeing blue and green.
So what he's doing is take this blue world and he's driving the blue, creates green.
It's creating a contrast that they can actually see.
So we have a model, which shows that it creates the ability to see all these examples.
And males and features also have, we're extending, unique examples.
But our last discovery has actually come just a few email from where we are now, in my mom.
We sat at at night, and I've been conducted in the water in his fingerprint.
So now it's going to get rid, and it's just a month, and again, it's just a month, but it shows us that we don't know almost anything about the sun.
And it makes me think about how much more we can learn.
And here in my mom, there were only a couple of thousands of features from this species, and it's one of their areas.
So this shows us how much we really need to protect these animals as long as they're still here, and understand them.
In thinking about biological hair, I wanted to know, how deep it comes?
Is it coming all the way to the ocean infrastructure?
So we started using costs, and we took them in the lights as a special hospital.
And we've been studying down, and we've looked at one important thing -- that when we've gone to 1.,000 feet, it's gone.
There's no beauty life in the Olympics there, underneath 1,000 feet -- almost nothing, just so forth.
So this is a really radical phenomenon.
And it's about 1,000 feet, we've got in the biological region, where a hour of 10 animals actually make light out of them and the girls and the girls.
When I'm trying to get deeper, it's to wear one person's dog -- how many people call it a moment of Jakoko Kakkotu repeated Wow. "
But when we studied there, I thought about how we're going to live in the clouds?
Because we go into a new generation of research, where we need to treat speed, and we need to give an example of how we're studies.
So I've been working with the robots most War at the University of the University, and we've been designed with these great robotic fingers, so we can connect to the 30s there.
The idea is that most of our technologies to explore the ocean comes from oil and gas and the military, you know, they don't really care about being better.
How many organisms can be 1,000 years old.
You don't want to go just and share them with a big piece.
So my dream is something like this.
At night, I'm in a coffee, I've got a chicken with power feedback, and I can do a lab in my lab, where my favorite robots are collected in laws, and that's what's going to do in the walls, and we can do our research.
Give back to the fingerprints.
Here, you're looking at the brain in the brain that uses the DNA of beautiful organisms, it's from previous and corporations, to move the human brain and see its bees.
It's funny that we use RGG just to kind of want to want our human intuition, so we can see our brain better.
And even more amazing, it's my fastest and a student in a object, which is actually a mirror and an ecological protein that's coming to the brain.
So he can see when a single unit is going to see.
You're basically looking at the hotel to the device that was designed by beautiful creatures.
So it brings me back to perspective and relationship.
From the deep space, our universe looks like a brain cell of a person, and here we're in the deep ocean, and we're spinning beautiful creatures and cells that can move the human brain.
And it's my hope that with death brains, we can identify public connections that's coming anywhere of life, and take a lot more than it's about the oceans in healthy.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The big man in your body is not the shape or the brain.
It's your skin, with a face of about two meters in adults.
Even though the variety of the skin has different properties, many of this surface has done similar role, like a heat, a heat and a cold, and a hair of hair.
But after a page or a deep, the skin that the soldiers will look different from the skin around it, and maybe you wouldn't actually get all its capabilities for a while, or at all.
To understand why it happens, we need to look at the structure of the human skin.
The upper environment, which is called the Philippus, is mostly early cells, which is called Franciscus, and it's the gene of the gene.
Because the current selection is perfect and extended, it's pretty easily easy.
But sometimes it's made a room into the restaurant, which is a blood vessels and different methods and boundaries that are going to get a lot of jobs.
And when it's happening, it's acting four percent of the process I've started.
The first step, the Romas, is the response of the skin to two email organisms: that you're now losing blood and the physicist's physical president.
When the blood vessels are going to reduce the motion, in a process called and Sankotsy, the two organisms are affected by creating a blood crisis.
In a special protein that's known for the healthy creates bees on the skin, and it's motivated from the blood to get out and in the bacteria and the genes of war in.
After three hours of this, the skin starts to become red, what's left on the next step, a dog.
However, with the patient's finger and the chimpanzee is safe, the body sends special cells to fight every open gene that might be able to go.
Whether the important ones in those are the white cell cells, which are known as microbes, which are extended in bacteria and diabetes through a process that's known as a fingerprintos, in addition to create a strategy of growth to move the arm.
And because these tiny soldiers need to move through the blood to get into the surprise region, the blood vessels and welfare until now move around the process called it and aeroid.
Before two days to three after the operation, the culture begins, where February cells start to get into the wall.
In the process of a musician investment, they create a Chinese protein called a microscope in the operating region, which creates a 3D printing to decide the finger from before.
When epical cells come in to recreate the external environment of the skin, the rainforest is going to move the operation.
Finally, at the end of the fourth point of rebuilding, the action was reduced when a musician was recently remained and repeated to specific types.
Throughout the process, that can take more matter, the power of the new skin is improving, and as a person and other bees are conducted.
With time, the new restaurant can reach and 5080 percent of the original code of healthcare, depends on the mirror of the crisis or the code itself.
But because the skin doesn't completely change, the button is going to be a critical problem for doctors around the world.
And despite scientists did significant actions in the understanding of the lunch process, a lot of characteristics in Chinese remained not evolved.
For instance, is the frozen cells coming out of the blood or the skin that's going to do?
And why do other mammals like IDs, show their actions more effective and reduce people?
By offering answers to these questions and others, we might be able to reduce ourselves so well that the customers will be just memory.
Have you ever notice something that's sad in your vision?
It might look like a little bit of a little bit or a transformation, and when you tried to look at a master, it's just going to show up again when you've been looking at you.
But don't go to the eyes!
What you're seeing is a common phenomenon that's going to be accumulated as objects.
The scientific name of these objects is convenient and virus, to the Teslan, "and" as a name, they can be a little bit of products. "
But they're actually not released or what it's kind of external object at all.
In fact, they're there in your eye wheel.
Ford objects may look alive, because they're wrong and shape, but they don't live.
Paul objects are tiny objects that make a crowd on the retina, the range of access to the back of your eye.
They might be refugees, red cells, or bodies of protein.
And because they're depending on the virus of the Henry Ford, the jihad of the junk that's full of your eye, objects are exposed with your eye movement, and we're going to take a little bit like your eye.
Forgeous objects can be almost unprecedented most of the time.
They're going to become better as they're close to the infrastructure, like your hand is closer to the table with light from the top of the walls to get more sick.
And fossil objects are captured in mostly when you look at the surface of a fire, like a musician computer, or put in the walls, there's the walls of the background causes them to be easier to lose.
The more the light is faster, the instrument means more.
It's got a similar effect to a big return to a single unit, which also causes to show more at the speed.
There's another vast phenomenon that we're going to reduce objects, but it's actually not about.
If you're seeing a tiny light points that you're looking at the road of the rich patients, you're hoping something that's known as the anatomic blue blue line.
In some ways, it's going to make objects.
Here, you don't see crops but tiny windows that allow light to go to the bottom.
It's actually Congress from human beings that are affected by the president.
These slides can be so big that they're almost leaving the genes what's caused for a long-term term to evolve.
Because the white space is also more transparency for a red blue light that's usually red in the water, we see a great point of light where it's going on, which is when you're going to go together with your fingerprint.
During an Italian condition, you might see what looks like the sea is going on after the point.
It's the red neurons that were made behind the box.
In some science fiction, there's some products that are used by a blue light, which allows you to see the boundaries of the blue skin in in the speed of the speech look very normal.
While everybody's eyes experience these effects, the number and the kind of changes very well.
In the case of fossil objects, they're most unprecedented when our brains learn to get out of them.
However, a big amount of unusual or big objects that invest in Italy are maybe a sign to a more comfortable situation, which requires health care.
But most of the time an anthropotic phenomenon, like fossil objects and roads as patients, they just reminds that what we think we're looking at at at the same way in our biology and our brain as it depends on the outside world.
Imagine you're in Rome, and you've got to the decline.
You're going to go through a long restaurant, you're taking over the box, French, a lot of things.
You're going to go through the Chinese paralysis.
Finally, a long-term stadium, a road and a door.
You're going to be on the end of the Chinese box.
Why did you see?
Civil fuels? Mexids are full?
There's not all of these things.
Little, ask yourself, what is there?
Well, the screen goes on the Chinese box.
You're surrounded by great windows, the original judgments of the box.
Despite the warm in the box, curiosity was used in a wall as a way to switch the big theater of life.
The human mammoth where each of us play a role is a great story. It's a story that's driving the world and it's been reduced by the three pounds of the Chinese French.
This building started a space in a small group of materials that are created, real and consumers.
There they took out there.
Five hundred years ago, it was the athetic materials.
You're probably asking how today it became a task, and you're going to have five million people a year, from a variety?
Because in this spinal space, there was a crowd of station, which was built by the implications of new political corruption, reinventing the astronomy tradition of the church and produced one of the big art in history.
It's developing in a dramatic way, started from a restaurant, until today we're going to get the sounds that come from all over the world.
It's developed in three steps, every one of those who have been conducted in historical reason.
The first one was limited.
It's about a profound perspective.
The other thing happened after dramatic changes in the world's view of the historical journey of Koreus, and the third step, when the president of the medicine was in the face and the Francisca went to the challenge of the President.
The original design of the church that's going to have a smaller world.
It was a deep prosperity that told their lives of his life and her husband and, and they took the development of the Indian and the products.
The work of work, the Paul Mexico Mexico, revealed a team of the collective art of the Industrial art, to the streets of School in Timbi and who was going to become the Monajo's Gimbo, Serro.
They've been looking at the walls in the Egyptian's walls of nature, and these stories you can recognize fossil photos, the artists and the artists used in some of the fossil fuels or tunners in order to talk to a very familiar story.
In the end of his friends's friends and his family's family's family's family, it's the perfect switch for a little bit of a little bit of reduction in Europe.
But, in 1492, the new world, the bicycles came out, and this small microcosmos was also going to go.
And so there was a creative depression, for food and a great story.
The creative museum was Malo in October, who was 33 years old when he was going to go to about 1,100 meters of an accident, he was fighting against all the risks, even a library is to focus on the corner.
In France, there were pharmaceutical penguins, because the price of art is made out of the restaurant, after it started to come to Rome in a big project but the project wouldn't work.
And it's remained with an invention for a 10 years that's designed against the statistic background of the Chinese Kenya, which is like any other thing in Italy.
But Gabby went into a challenge.
In the age of which people have been able to cure the Atlantic, as Los Angeles had to go to the autonomous unconscious.
It's also a story. It doesn't actually have the negative, but a story that's going to do with fabric, in fact, in my mind.
It's not easy to market stories about action.
How can you see a deep picture of 20 meters?
The painting technical techniques that went to a generation for 200 years in Floridans didn't have to deal with this kind of funny.
But as Los Angeles wasn't really a painting, and it's about his profound points.
Instead of taking the space in the wave, it took a switch and an alphase and a button that's when you're going to switch the patterns in the face.
As Los Angeles was from the front, and he told his story through Mexico and dynamic boys.
The program is done by the Olympion of the other life's life, a person who doesn't prefer from the extinction of the Ghana.
He was the life of the fourth Texas, he put art art for 30 years and knew the power.
The history is called it "The Olympic Ford," but it's been reduced to a device in holes and alliaria, but art.
He's left us with French, the Chinese Kenyan.
He's invented the basis of the House Detroit, and yes, there's an extraordinary collection of uncomfortable and unusual toxic fingerprints in the middle of the first modern museum, the device.
And Vius was a man who saw in my eye and a device that would remain sanitary to win with a beauty and a beauty of beauty, and he was right.
The investment between these two clouds, as Los Angeles and the second virus is that we've given us the Chinese box.
As Los Angeles was so connected to this project, which was able to finish the work in three and a half years, he used a team of paralysis and spent hours on a road of hours, which was going to go over the head to draw the stories on the case.
So let's look at the case and see how the story became wearing.
It's not even more artificial memory to the world around.
There's just space and energy and energy. It's a tremendous framework that's evolved into an hour, which's worse by a conducted shape than by color.
We're going to be at the end of the road near the cortex, far away from the kitchen and the heat from the bottom to the teacher and we're looking at a mirror, looking at the beginning.
And whether we're in a way of a scientist or a scientist's way, we think in the brain of a coffee.
As Los Angeles gave us the first energy when he gave us the price between the light and the afraid, the strengths of a mirror, a dog into the space.
The next character as a big budget, and you see the patterns from the side.
She's left the sun, the moon and the price.
As Los Angeles didn't focus on the presidents, as the other artists.
He's focused on the healthy woman itself.
And then the motion is made like a series and a space.
What does it do?
Is it creating the Earth? Is it creating the water?
Or is he looking at his work, the universe and his Octoco, as Shadn't done Milang, when he looked at his work on the case and the CEO's good. "
So now the background is ready, and you're going to get to the healthy restaurant that's the person.
Adam jumped into the eye of the eye in the moon against the ground.
But in a closer perspective, his legs on the ground, the arm was stuck on the screen.
The president of the National Social who's going to put it into a dolphin.
It's a huge tremendous object in most of the boat through this fingerprint, that's made one millimeter from a person's face.
We're in the wind, because we're in one moment from this moment, which is going to get the person out of his hand, will go and get the source of the British.
And then Malang was surprised.
Who's there in the other arm?
And hope, the first woman.
No, she doesn't think of a work. It's part of the program.
He always thought about it.
You'll see it, so intuitive with God until she'd been opening around the wind.
And in my work, the art of art, American from the 21st century, it was the moment where this painting was talking to me.
Because I realized that this exhibition of humanity has always been business in women and men and women, so in the middle of the picture, at the end of the case, you're an accident of the woman, not a person.
And the fact is, when you see them together in the cloud, they're moving together and fear of the gene becomes a coffee.
You're now in a significant action in the case.
You're just at the point where you're and I can't move more into the church.
The area of the gender is expanded us from the month, and we're perfect to the tree, like a person and hope.
It's going to be the photos in the case, you're spending the fingerprint in the world that we've lost us.
There's a wind, his baby and the cat.
There's a wind. He's a curiosity and a decline with God.
Maybe it's the wrong.
Oh, but not. It's the one that's a huge difference, invented the finger, the plan and the wind, the South Amazon.
It's a crazy way to design.
And that's how, compared to the person you might think that as Los Angeles has to worry about us.
But it's going to spread the curiosity by using the fossil colors that's going to go on: buck, piano, Gabby's on the right.
The malaria is a light that comes from the Middle East, and at this point we're pharmaceutical to a new step, with nanoes and we'll bring us in the camera.
There's heroes and heroes that expect the way, and we're going to go after the signs and disasters.
They're driving the big human little, pushing it forward.
And now we're in Babban's woman's woman's woman's woman's wife, the whole thing that's going to get out of our space, we've read to our space.
It's the most key profession.
It's an extinction in hope.
This imagination, yesterday, for three days in the satellite in the satellites, in the contrast, we've been able to reduce human beings through our victims, but in the Museum of Museum in Museum, in the cases there every day, it's the moment where the past has been killed in the right reality.
All of this brings us to the needle of the wall in the wall, where we're looking at the day of Monajo, who's in 154, after the world has changed another day.
The French produced the church, the Januan Francisco became the Islam there and the Minister found a fire into the Pacific.
How would a 59 years of an artist that never occurred beyond the motion to the new world?
As Los Angeles chosen to draw the wheel, the same universal answer, the department of all of us, to leave a great arm.
It's a village in the extinction of the last day, at the end of the world, as Los Angeles gave these beautiful characteristics.
They don't have any more experiments, not even more accurate for a few.
It's a component of only body, 391, there's no two, unique as each of us.
They're starting in the bottom corner, they're moving from the ground, they're losing and trying to move.
These are the ones that have been destroyed behind to help others, and one amazing event, there's a black man and a man who's working together in an amazing food of human beings in this new world.
Some of the space's array is going to make the walls.
Here you find men and women are completely indicated as ethical.
They're who were killed on the profession, and they've been reduced by Nanjo's people who've been fighting, and men are just like ethnicity.
So there's men and women who do muscles and prefer in this wonderful light.
If they're in this head of Asian, it's going to be, in the head of a human beings suffering on the door, now a third of the Olympic gene.
And as Los Angeles proposed in his father, stressful and cables, they don't get the professionals, they're waiting it.
Now, it leads us to talk one strange.
It's the primary line of the epic, and the best way to describe it is in a tool of South.
But as Los Angeles tried to use but only in the best artificial language, the most universal language you can apply: the human body.
And so, in order to show degrees like a moral or self-control control, it's that I'm going to be collected by the right insects of the other virus and that's how you've seen an external power.
One of my time wrote that the judgment was too beautiful to not move from a piece.
And so it was.
As Los Angeles discovered in the House of House Amazon, which was based on the West spread everywhere, and at the end of his human mammographic mammography, at this point, one of the other Ford Ford Ford, one of the man in the morning, and one of the one of the one of the Amazon had made it, and one of the other
Last year, he saw a part of these characteristic characteristics, and he's going to look at his language to the community.
And now we're going to be here and now.
We're in this space between the beginning and finally, in the extinction of human experience.
The Chinese party of us have to look around as if there was a mirror.
Who am I in this picture?
Is I one of the audience?
Is I the poem?
Is I the ethnic?
And as we got this concept of beauty, we get inspired to ask ourselves the big questions of life: who I am and what role I play in the big theater of life?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Again, represents the geography subject, too much in South and too many everyday expectations and things are not the genes of the coffee.
But it's actually this story more.
It's not just small customers and fun some of the characters.
It's a piece of art nearly fit because of that.
The effect of the last day was huge.
The content of the preservation promised it that everyone saw it.
So it wasn't something that happened in a few weeks.
It was something that's happening over nearly 20 years of materials to the system and curiosity, and they're going to say, "You can't tell us how to live our lives.
You've noticed you've got Portography in the box of the Paul? "
And so, after depending on and trying to make a piece of creativity, it was at the end of the year of Los Angeles where the president was on a train, a way to save the painting, and it's done in a way to add 30 trials, and it's the source of my grandfather.
The name of all started, and it came from a conference that was trying to save art, and not the impact or kill it.
What we've given us here is not the Central Research that people get today when they're going to the Chinese party.
I don't know, it's a secret?
I don't, no, no, not necessarily, it's the statement.
The experience of art today's experience.
More people want to see it there, and the result is five million people who go into the small door, and experience the creativity completely different than we've done right now.
I think it's very nice to be able to stop and look.
But also to understand, even in one of these days with 28,000 people on the day, even in the days you're there with all those people, look around you and think how amazing it's been made from 500 years ago, can still put all of the people who are going to go on, and you look at the top of their customers.
It's a great explanation about how beauty can really talk to us all over time and through the space.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
For all of our history, people would have been magnitude and lives.
A little bit of every world in the world has some of them, and the first mystery of the last two languages, the presidents continue to go back.
But are you really possible?
And what's the difference between creating a living body, anyway?
To understand what it is death, we need to understand what life is.
One ancient theory was the idea of digital, which is that things live were unique because they were full of special material, or energy, which was a life expectancy.
Whether it's called Charlie, the dinosaurs of life, or Homas, the belief in this material was common in the world, and there's still stories about creatures that can somehow crowd from other animals, or some form of traffic lights that can take it.
And capitalism started to move in the Western world after the scientific revolution in the 18th century.
Richard Dartt took the idea that the human body wasn't actually different from any other machine, the military of life was made by God that was built in the Atlantic.
And in 1907, Darwin's Darwin's dry even argued that Nigeria has a restaurant, when it's wearing patients before and after death trying to prove it.
Even though the results were killed, just like the rest of the Italy, the lions of this theory is still in the popular culture.
But where do we leave us all these disorders?
What we know now is that life doesn't be familiar with a material or a coffee, but within the biological processes that are affected themselves.
And in order to understand these processes, we need to do a park of a single cell.
Within each of these cells, chemical responses are happening without the business, motivated by gas and oxygen that our body leaves to molecules that are known as ATP.
Egyptian cells use energy to every chicken to the culture.
It doesn't just require a lot of energy to create these positive molecules, but it requires even more to avoid them to where they need to be.
The universal phenomenon of Antarctica says that the molecules will be built by the institutions of London, and they're going to get out of the areas with a high gas with a lower train, or even will go to a little bit of smaller molecules.
So cells have to keep all the time on the asterography is used by using energy to keep their molecules in very complex forms that require biological actions to happen.
These symbols of these sisters when the whole cell comes into anthropy is what causes the end of death.
That's why organisms can't just go back to life once they've already gone.
We can sell air into someone's health, but it's not going to help if the other many other values that are connected to the list region doesn't work more.
Like, the electrical markets of Brothers didn't move the heart of their own heart, but we're going to put the muscle cells in the heart of the heart of a normal way that they can go back to a regular rate.
It can prevent the person to die, but it's not a body body's body, or a chicken that's going to get ridiculous.
So it seems to be that all of our different medical trials can just predict motion, but it doesn't make it.
But it's not just as simple as it sounds because the academic interventions in technology and medicine have been reduced to strengths like a dirty, which are situations that can be the expectations, where people in the past were computing.
In the future, the alphase dot may be a little bit better.
How many animals are known in the capacity to reduce their fingerprint or survive extinct situations by their biological processes to the point where they're actually powerful.
And a study to Canada, I hope to get the same result by taking people and returned to life later when new technologies would be able to help them.
Look, if the cells are frozen, there's a little bit of a molecule, and Detroit is actually powerful.
Even if all of the interventions of a person has been read, it can still be in theory to become by starting by building robots, which move all the molecules back to their original situation, and invite all the cells to the ATP at the same time, an athetic will just go out of the universe.
So if we think about life doesn't expect a coffee, it's about the situation of a complicated organization that's exposed itself, death is just the process of the anthropography that represents the Amazon.
And it turns out that someone's completely unusual is not a source of nature, but just a few of this anthropy we can now become.
Basically, the relationship to human beings need, their own personal disabilities, has happened many forms around the world.
But one institution is also one of its global size and also in its extinction.
The Atlantic Atlantic School, which happened from the 20th century to the 19th century, and usually three will be done, brought in more power than 10 million African African countries in America.
The effect that it's the device that's affected not just these faces and their iPhones, but on the economy and history of big parts of the world.
There were hundreds of years of communicating in Europe to Africa through the Middle East.
But the Atlantic Atlantic started in the late 20th century with Portugal policies in the West Africa, and the liberal possibilities in America a little bit later.
The dolphins that were scared in the new policies, a summer, Tash, Tasmania, went through a lot of workers, and there were not enough sitting in this work to work on the new land.
Americans have been working, but many of these new diseases, while others have been active.
And so in order to stand at the end of the workers, the doctors look at Africa.
The African innovation was there for hundreds of years in different forms.
A couple of dogs were serving in this, with a limitation in time and a chance to buy their insects.
Others were more like doctors.
In some companies, dogs could be part of the toxic interface, be an earthquake, and even go to the jobs of power.
But when judges come in, and they've been invited by refugees, weapons, and most of them, for the African and the lights were a party for the horse.
They've seen the people who've been conducted not as peers but costs, the street, or Asian Western Westerners.
By conducting, the economists have made their governments, and they've taken them against neighborhoods.
The African economists who have been trained from the road trade, but it's about the big asteroids that have created a huge strength.
Social workers decided to be other female women, and they've become a reason for the war to war, instead of its result.
In order to protect themselves from dozens, from the economists who have been a professor, who have also been in the faces.
Social traffic became a weapon, which changed companies and economies around the continent.
And in fact, they've been worried that you can't imagine.
After they went to the balls on the beach, they were going to prevent genes, and they were stuck, they were scared on roads in the way to the Americans.
About 20 percent of them have never seen a more land.
Most of the penguins at the same time there were insects, and they had some more people that you could under the phone.
While issues have made a lot to die of diseases, and others have gone out of the North because it's, or to start a significant, the judgments put their walls by spinning their fingerprints.
Some judges took their own buildings.
A lot of African people out of the continent have never seen faces before, and think they've been scared, who've sent people without a prosthetic and repeated.
They're afraid to feed, or just to avoid the road, they've lost or showed themselves, when they believe that they're going to come home.
These are the ones that have survived completely from their own humanity, and they've been treated to them like a metaphor.
Women and children have been killed over the North and the team would be able to, while the men were going to do curiosity to keep them on a bridge and prevent.
What happened to the Americans who came to the new world and how the restaurants still affect their fingers today's best known.
But what you don't talk about is the effect of the Atlantic trade on the future of Africa.
Not just that the continent has lost tens of millions of people from her richer population, but because most of the people who took were men, the great effect for a long time was even larger.
When the presidents were spread out of the road at the end of the Asian and Europe, the African governments that their economies were reduced in the collapse, and they invented them open to the walls and cooperation.
And the contrast and the president of physicians were going to take care and the strength that's going to come up with today.
The Atlantic Atlantic is also a part of the development of the rapid biological apartment.
The majority of the African innovations didn't have a deeper reason than a lawyer or a warm between crisis, but the doctors who were joining universal universal, and the time it was invited out of the workforce that were created, there had a prosperity to be clear against their inequality.
So they realized that the African were biological, and they were trained to work, and they were great to join the theory.
So, in Europe and Americans to fix races, what you've made it impossible for their future faces and their future cells to achieve an equal plane in society.
In all of these ways, the Atlantic Atlantic was injustice in a huge scale that the effect went on a lot of after it was inevitable.
The human eye is a wonderful, that's trying to identify between how many neurons are directly directly, or to change your screen from the screen to you to the horizon in a second month.
In fact, the great structures for such a chimpanzea thought of so complicated that Charles Darwin itself was the idea that they evolved in the highest level.
And yet, it's exactly what happened, from over 500 million years ago.
The story of the human eye begins with a simple light point, like this is the fingerprint in a single cell, like Kenya.
It's a collection of sensitive proteins that's connected to the window of organism, which is when it's produced light, and so I can.
It's a more complex version of the light point can be found in the walls of conversations, Nigeria.
It's in a form of weird and uncomfortable, allows her to feel better at the direction of the light that's coming.
Whether it's used, the capacity allows an organism to look for a click and come from crazy.
Over tens of thousands of years, when they're using light as they've become deeper in some organisms, they've evolved into a little bit of them.
The result was the oil effect, which represents the discovery in a dramatic way, reduce the toilet by which it allows just to happen a great light to get into the eye.
The Nitius, the restaurant of the corn, used an eye to reduce a crazy and a journalist.
Despite the eye of the eye enables simple images, the main step to the eye as we know it is lucky.
You think it's evolved through cells that are translated the key to prevent pollution, what you can go into the eye that will improve the feelings of light and respect.
Social proteins that are created on the surface have created a structure that's used to code light into some point on the bottom.
It's the key to the discovery of the eye, when it changes its faith to fit into a microbial Iraq.
This structure of a guy's structure with a restaurant that's served as a basis of what's eventually opened into the human eye.
The birds on the screen will take a coffee that's called HIV, which sends the light of the light that's designed in the eye, which is a very statement, which is as an extension, to keep its structure, and to keep it out of a glass that's called the genome.
But it wasn't less importantly, it was the key development of the brain, with the expansion of the cortex that I've shown to work the images and the skin that it got.
We know now that it's far from being a professional creation. Our eye knows the symbol of development.
For instance, the general human infrastructure, with light cells that phosphorus is developed.
The result of this is a fabric point, where the Italian nerve has to go to the retina to get the approach to the left.
The red dots of Palestinians, which evolved in France, there's a regular restaurant, which allows them to see without the wind.
Others's eyes of other creatures show different violence.
Los Angeles, what's called the frog, there's eyes that go to the two regions to look at the water and you're going to get water, it's great to the corporate and also joint.
Civil, in the same night, you've developed a light that represents the amount of light that the eye can recognize, what they're going to give them a great disease, as well as the bridge.
It's just a few examples of the big direction in the eye of the animal.
So if you could design a eye, would you do it differently?
This question isn't crazy as it's heard.
Today, doctors and scientists look at different eyes to help plan that are used to be used by the gundry.
And in the unfortunate future, the machines that have built exactly and emotions of human eye may allow them to move on evolution.
It was the other end of 2005.
I've been working in the ACLEO's rights as the science of the organization.
I'm really, I really loved my job, but I had one of these days in which I felt a little bit crazy.
So I was volunteered by the Darwin's office of my grandfather's office.
Chris was in ACLS over 30 years, so he had knowledge and deep institutions.
I've come to Mexas that I feel a little bit of time.
I've been looking at a number of issues in the face of science and civil rights -- an interesting secret.
But I wanted that ACLS is going to be on these issues in a much more rapidly, in a way that can actually do change.
So Chris was right and interested, and he said, "Well, of all the issues you look at, what are the first five?"
"Well, there's genetic effect, and it's biased technologies, and biological structures, and."
Oh, there's a cool subject, MRI'm Faki and using it as a magazine, and...
Oh, of course, there's patents on genes. "
"Philips on genes?"
"Yes, you know, patents on human genes."
"No!
Do you tell me that the United States of the United States has shown the patents on some of the human body?
It can't be true. "
I went back to my office, and I sent to three materials.
And 20 minutes later, he came to my office.
"Oh my God! You're right! Who can we play?"
[Chris]]]]] []] []]]]]]]]] &#
I knew something about genetics, but I didn't even have a lawyer, and on the surface that didn't wait in elephants.
So of course, we had a lot of what to learn before we could respond to a surprise.
First of all, we had to figure out exactly what was in a patent when someone was raining a patent.
Civil on genes usually contain dozens and dozens, but the smallest skills are the ones that are called "Soviet DNA" -- which means, some of the DNA that's seen from the cell.
Scientists of the genes as a patent say, "You see? We didn't reduce all of your gene in your body, we've been scared as a fingerprint."
And it's true, but the problem is that all using a gene that it's going to be dead.
And the patents didn '
So what does that mean?
It means you can't give your gene to the doctor and ask it or it's from looking at it, for example, if there's some motions, without the emotions of the patent.
It also means that the student has the right to stop each of using this gene in the study or clinical trials.
It's going to enable the patent muscles, often privacy companies, to operate parts of the human genome is affecting patients.
Think about the age of age, 10, 10 with a long TT prosperity, a mood in my hands, that if not a patient, you can travel in an accident.
The company that made the patent on the two local genes for a situation developed a test to lose the prosthetic.
But then they'd spread a foot and they've never invented it.
So another lab was trying to offer the test, but the company that made an iPhone to describe the lab on the patent.
So as a result, for two years, no test had no right.
Over this time, the age of age comes from a long day from a birthday that didn't look at.
Citizes on genes are a clear problem and motivated in patients.
But is there a way that we can read about?
It turns out that the top summer crisis over a long line of patterns, that some things don't get rid of a patent.
You can't see any patent on nature's products -- the air, the water, you're indicated, they're conducted by the tumor.
And you can't see any patent on the rules of nature -- the rules of power goes, "M2."
These things are just too basic and you have to stay free and not be happy to each other.
We think that DNA, the basic structure of life, which is used to stop all of our proteins, is also a product of nature and the law of nature, no matter if it's in our body or the bottom of a restaurant.
When we looked at this, we went around the country to talk to a lot of different experts -- scientists, medicine, lawyers, lawyers in the patents.
Most of them agreed that we're right to policy, and less in theory, in terms of the law.
Everybody thought our chance to win against patents were about zeros.
Why is it?
So, the patent office put these patents for over 20 years.
There were, simple, thousands of patents on human genes.
And the elephants were deep inside the bus, the biological industrial industry grew around this building, and there's a lot of patents on the genes that was taken a year in Congress, and the accident went anywhere.
So the bottom line: I just wouldn't be ready to make these patents.
Now, not Chris and I wasn't the prototype that's going to be a challenge, and that's why, "it's just not enough," it looks like another reason to fight this bank.
So we're going to build our baby.
Now, patents tend to be: a company that's going to take a company on some small, and unimportant and important.
We didn't really want to be interested in this kind of action, and we thought that this will be much larger than that.
It was about scientific freedom, medicine, patients's rights.
So we decided that we're going to develop an instrument that wasn't like the typical babies of elephants -- more like a civil rights.
We've been able to identify a demand of a gene of a gene that's watching his patents and then to organize a lot of colors and experts that can say to the sentence on all of these ways that these patents are affecting patients and emotional.
We've found the main president to move in "Mr. Janux," a company that's focused on Scott Scott, Turkey.
Mr. Mr. Ford has been able to do the two genes, the BRRI and the BRRI.
Women with certain motions over these genes are important at high risk to develop cancer and disease.
Myrus used these patents to make a perfect moon on on the BRCA in the United States.
They've taken a lot of jobs that's been invented in BRCA to stop.
The company has gone a lot of money on the test -- more than 3,000 dollars.
They've been trying to share their mental data with the international scientific community.
And maybe the worst of all, to the period of a few years, Mr. Sydney has been able to do their test so that there's another motion that's left by a team of studies in France.
It's been valuable in this period, for a few years, until 12 percent of the women who have gone through the test had an answer -- a third test that had to be positive.
It's Charlie Mexica.
The sister of Kenyan, Iran, developed cancer in the age of 40s and it was built by Mumbridge.
The test was negative.
The family was hard.
It means that AIran's cancer as much as it didn't have been in the family, and the other family companies didn't have to work.
But two years later, Charlie was diagnosed with cancer at a time.
It turns out that the sixth of Chan was between the 12th percent that got a negative trial.
If AIran was getting the result of the budget, Jenn was scared, and her breast cancer could avoid.
Once we decided about Martin, then we had to create a function of colors and experts that could move these problems.
We've finished with 20 very convenient colors: genetic objects, geneticians who have been extended, Argentina, Australian organizations, four big scientific organizations that will be created in common over 150,000 scientists and professional scientists, and women who couldn '
One of the big challenges we had in the baby was to figure out what the better shape to transform science.
So in order to argue that what Robert did wasn't the invention, and the BRCA genes were the products of nature, we had to explain two basic components, like, what's the DNA?
How do we take DNA? And why don't it invest?
We've spent hours of hours with our arguments and our experts, trying to find ways to explain these components in simple, but exactly.
And at the end, we've been looking at the faces of using patterns, like the same.
So to measure DNA -- it's like a faster song or his fingerprint from a fabric.
You may be able to notice the process of the golden, but you can't click the gold itself.
It might take a lot of hard work and effort to improve and get the gold out of the light; you can't see the patent, it's still the same.
And the golden, once it's been reduced, it's probably possible to be used for all kinds of things that wouldn't be able to use when it's in the light; you can't predict when you're in the light -- for example, you can't still be the same as a patent, it
So now it's 2009, and we're ready to react our hill.
We've been in the French French Center in the New York City's Center's Center, and it's an academic accident to the Street Street.
In 2010, the Scott Street published his knowledge -- 152 pounds -- and we're going to be able to take our side.
Back the consciousness, we couldn't get out of what it is to describe the science in this surprise.
I mean, our budget -- it was pretty good, but not so good.
How did he develop such a deep understanding of this thing as a short time?
We just couldn't understand how it happened.
So it turns out, the French of the Scott Scott who worked in his time, there was not just a lawyer -- he was a scientist.
He wasn't just a scientist -- he had a Ph.D. biology.
Laughter) What's an amazing luck!
Mr. Mord, so I was going to go to the Freedom of the United States's Foundation.
And here are really interesting things.
First of all, at a very bad moment, the United States government decided a side.
So at the Social Foundation, the government came up with a lawyer on the side of Mumbahi.
But now, in a contrast of its elephant office, the United States of the United States, the United States came up with a piece that the government was replaced the subject of the previous sentence, and the meaning to a concept that DNA is not necessary.
It was really big, completely uncomfortable.
The French of the French School switches all of the patents, and it has a prototype of being very, very, very on the patents.
So even with this extraordinary development, we wanted to stop.
And we went.
About.
The final decision was a dream, two to one.
But the two details that we've been born, they've done it for completely different reasons.
The first one, the judgment to my parents, built himself a modern biological theory -- completely wrong.
And he decided that Rayrus made a new chemical chemistry -- completely unconscious.
Mr. Resert didn't even get it, so it was very surprising.
The other one, the judge said that she was basically a concept with us that the DNA is a product of nature.
But she said, "I don't want to take the technology industry."
Third, the Brothern Guinson, agreed with us.
So now we've been spread by the top sentence.
And when you go to the top sentence, you have to show a question that you want that the sentence is going on.
It's usually these questions to take a form of a long list, something like a whole page with a lot of very sophisticated, "from this in" here's "and" Oh, "Oh," Oh, "Oh," there.
We've got maybe the most successful question we've ever been asked.
Four words: human genes are capable of a patent?
Now when Chris asked me for the first time I thought about these words, I said, "Well, I don't know.
I think you have to say, "Is DNA frankly possible?" "No."
I want judges to be exactly the same response that I had when I got this thing from me seven years ago. "
Well, I couldn't make a conversation with it.
The top sentence is only one percent of all the surprises that it gets, and it's going to hear our own.
Today's argument came in, and it was very, very exciting -- a long parent of people out there, people were about two: 30 in the morning to try to get into the court room.
Two organizations of the cancer cancer, "cooperation against the breast cancer and" FFORC, "we've lost a regret on the court stairs.
Chris and I'm sitting in a stadium, moments before he'd be going to go in and make the most important argument in his career.
I'm clearly more to feel of it.
But every unfortunate that I've been stuck when I went to the sentence room and looked around the faces of social faces: our women who were our privacy customers who were going to reduce their great stories, the geneticians who had taken a big time from their investment to move themselves into this struggle and pushing their own diversity of medical organizations, on civilization organizations, around the
In the room, there were three leaders from the human genome project, including one of the partners of the DNA in itself, James Watson, which was going to be a painting to the sentence, where he was conducted to the patents of genes as a argument. "
Laughter) The direction of the communities that are created in this room and the components that each of them did to make this day for a lot of reality talked about what was about the areas.
The argument itself was fascinating.
Chris argued in general.
But for me, the most excited pencil was to expect the unexpected sentence of the previous sentenced DNA, with a spinal series of style markets and hormones, very similar to what our critical team did during the last seven years.
The judgment of the GDP was born to the walls of an extinction from the Amazon.
The Robert Robert put it from a baseball baseball.
And in one of the usual moments I've been exposed by, the Sott Sott Saudi Soviet that DNA is "just nature's sitting there."
So we felt pretty safe about ourselves when we left the sentence room at the same day, but I could never predict the result: however.
"The DNA motor that's affected in natural is a product of nature, and you can't get a patent just because it's a single one.
And I'm going to put on yes, Mr. Mr. didn't get anything. "
Within 24 hours of the decision, five of the regulation that they're going to start to offer the BRCA tests.
Some of them were able to offer the tests in a lower price than Muhammad.
Some of you have been able to provide a more test than a period that's officially invented.
But of course, the decision is going to be much beyond Radio.
She's finished a 25 years of enabling a patent on human genes in the United States.
It's a significant device to discover and invention in medicine.
And it's going to make sure that hospital like the age of age, Jalin and Iran will have access to their hands that they need.
Three weeks after the sentence was published his decision, I got a little bit in Mark.
She was a Cadian, a professor at the University of David and one of the first people who wrote and I went to visit when we started to voice whether to take this baby.
I opened it to see a small animal.
So we took a big risk when we took this baby.
Some of what we gave us the courage to take this risk was that we knew we were doing the right thing.
The process took almost eight years from the beginning to the end, with a lot of patterns and changes over the way.
It's a little bit of lucky that's been the communities that we've seen with, the healthcare that we've created, which is that they've been able to move to the skin.
Thank you.
Thank you.
How do your phone know exactly where you are?
The answer is in 19,300 kilometers above your head on a satellite that's on the time to the short of an autonomy that's driven by anatomy.
Wow.
Let's look at it.
First of all, why is it so important to know what's wrong about the satellite when what's worried about is the universe?
The first thing that your phone has to tell is how far it's far from the satellite.
Each satellite satellites in radio signals that move from the space to your phone quickly.
Your phone is moving the right time and using it to look at the walls to satellite by using the page of the page, from a time, and it's a speed of light, and it's how long it took to Mexico to get.
But there's a problem.
light is really fast.
If we were just able to choose time to the next second, all the universe on the planet, and much more far, it would look at it from a satellite.
So to look at the distance for a single metaphor, we need the best argument that's ever found.
And here's where you go into autonomy, some of them are so accurate that they're not going to go in a second even if you're going to work more than 300 million years.
Tony arguments work because of physics.
All the faces need to be a fixed device.
In other words, there's got to do some help action to travel insects in time.
It's just like the San San Francisco's launched on the front engineer's back of a airport under the road, the baby of an autonomy that's driven by the crisis between two energy products of autonomy.
Here's the picture of the music physics.
Canologist says that atoms are energy issues, but they can't take an artistic amount.
Instead, autonomous energy is limited to the accurate of violence.
We call it cockroaches.
As a simple analogy, think about a box with the car into a fast road.
When you get the speed, you're usually scared in the chimpanzees from 30 kilometers to 110 miles per hour.
Now, if you had an autonomous car, you wouldn't get rid.
Instead, you'd jump an email, or go, one speech for a second.
For autonomy, when beyond one energy level to another, the anthropologist says that the energy's equal is equally equal to physical disorder, it's known in the week, the energy changes is equal to a book, called a France, as a price of the price.
This typical disorder is what we need to create our argument.
GPS depends with autonomous atoms and daily as a trick to the door.
In the case of a 133, the French School is 9,1926,6,7770s.
It's 9 billion parts of the second.
It's a really faster.
It doesn't matter how special it's, every airplane, a style and a chicken switch in a little bit different.
However, every atom was 133 in the universe in the same distance.
So dots to the autonomous argument, we're getting an accurate time for the other billions, and a really accurate fact of the distance from the satellite.
Let's get out of the fact that you're almost confident on the planet.
We know now you're in a concept of a satellite.
In other words, you're where it's on the surface of a complexity around the satellite.
You've been talking about the distance to the satellite two and you get another free wave.
It went on to do it, and with only four institutions, and a little bit of using an inner form of Einstein, you can draw your universe to one accurate point in space.
So that's all that requires: a network of satellites in billions of dollars, autonomous atoms, from anthropologist, satellite, satellite, and you.
There's no problem.
"Hey Baby."
"Good morning. The boys look great."
Have you ever wondered how your dogs experience the world?
It's what it sees.
Not really interesting.
But what it's happy, it's a completely different story.
And it begins in the open surface of her repair.
When your environment sees the first streets of traffic air, the extended part of her nose helps the coffee all the moon that's driving.
The ability to predict in France with every piano, to join in San, helps the direction of the wind source so that in the first moments of wind, the general starts to be aware of the kind of things there but also to their universe.
When air comes into the tree. A small patient of a tissue is part of it to the two patients, one to where and one is just a lot of conversation.
The other air pollution comes into a full area with cells that are called the horizontal cells, some hundreds of millions of them, relatively to our five million.
And we're going to go through our bodies to the task and push through the same way, dogs are scared through their face, and so you're creating a range of air that's going to remove molecule molecules and enabled to the muscles of mood to be built during the walls.
But all this particular architecture didn't help a lot without doing the information that was collected.
And it turns out that the horizontal system that's going to open surgery takes a lot more beautiful brain brain in dogs than people.
All of this allows the dogs to look at and remember a huge number of small boundaries of 100 million times of what our fingers can recognize.
You can win a small room in a small room, notice there's not a problem to demand it in a concept of concept and chosen in the kitchen without a problem.
And all over the street, every person or a car goes down, the capacity of a chain, every kind of tree, and all the birds and the birds where everyone has a unique prototype that says to your environment is, where it's wrong.
It's more powerful than our own, the smell of the dog can recognize things that don't look at all.
The optimistic system that's been reduced, which is called the Indian Iraq, above the French, recognizing the hormones that all the animals, including people, who are released by problems.
It allows dogs to identify fossil fossil beings, or to push between deforestation or not.
It moves them on our emotional states, and it can even tell them when you're pregnant or sick.
Because our smallpox is more primitive than our sensors, the corner of the corner to connect directly to the brain's emotions, including emotions and intuitive, we may even say that the box of a mirror is more unique and a technique.
But the most amazing thing about your dog is that it can move in time.
The past is affected by traffic, and by the heat of a car that was recently invented the questions of where you were and what you did recently.
Scientists of a way like a tool and objects are a long awareness of the opinion of who was there, and what they eat, and how they feel.
And the future is in this healthy, they're dealing them on something or someone who's going to get a lot before you see it.
Instead of where we see or hear something at the same moment, revealing the whole story from the beginning to the end.
Some of the best examples of cooperation between human beings, dogs help us by collaboration and responding to these stories.
They can respond with a good attention to people in a boat, or with Asia for violence because they're scared and they're in a cloud of hormones that's familiar with the dog.
With a training trust, they can even avoid invisible organisms that are made out of cancer.
It turns out, the best friends of human beings don't experience the same things like us, but one of his fingerprinting is completely different beyond our eyes.
If you know a person who's older, the risks they had to learn to write and eat with their right hand.
And in many parts of the world, it's still a common concept for children to use their right hand.
I'll give the word to the right is true or good, not just in English, but in many other languages also.
But if you stay there is so wrong, then why does it happen from the beginning?
Today, about the rich of the world's population are happy.
Social architects show that it was at least about 5,000 years, with about 10 percent of the human responsibility that represent the differences of the arm and the object, and some ancient tools and ancient details that are made up of use.
And despite what a lot of thinking, the intuitive hand is not a choice.
You can see it even before the restaurant is based on the motion of the Olympic.
So, if Italian hand is a molecule, does it mean it's genetic?
Well, yes and not.
The identical objects, they have those genes, can be a different unique hand.
In fact, it's going to happen in the same way like other brothers.
But it's likely to be happy or demanded by your intuitive hand of empathy in surprising.
If you're going to be happy, but your mom's right, you've got a 17 percent chance to say that, while two artists will be a kid who's just 10 percent of the time.
It seems to be a neutral that's been used by a coffee coffee, but it's the risks by your genes.
All of this is changing that there's a reason that evolution has created a small tree of poverty, and it's been shown for thousands of years.
And while there were some theories who were trying to explain why Iranian hand has been there at all, they were trying to explain why or why most people are beautiful, a very recent model that the real connection of food and creative pressure of human evolution.
It's about being happy to be the most general of costs that can be declined, like a disciplinary or an emissions.
For instance, about 50 percent of the good roads in baseball were happy.
Why?
Think about it as surprising.
Because the water is a remote from the beginning, they're also an artificial, and that's where you're going to get most of them to get easy and get an artist in front of the eye.
So when the two are going to be one in the other, the left is better at the right hand, while the right is not ready.
The Locial theory, which is not the food in the population, is a solution to diabetes or ethnicity, it's an example of a negative device.
But by the principles of evolution, groups that have a unique advantage to grow up until the solution is gone.
If people were just thrown up and move through human evolution, the natural choice was much more likely to be able to be able to be able to be so much of them, that it wasn't more rare.
So in a completely intuitive world, 50 percent of the population was happy.
But human evolution is powerful by collaboration, as well as stations.
And cooperation pushes the intuitive emissions into the other direction.
In the back, there's no longer depends on the sea, just four percent of the best players are happy, an example of a more common phenomenon of tools.
It's just as young Golden Golden can find easier than a star of symbols, a lot of the most important tools that made the society were designed for most of the artist.
Because the left's less good at using these tools, and they're suffering from a higher level, they'd be less productive in a completely collaborative world, and eventually we're going to get rid of the population.
So by making a true piece of people who come up with the general population, as well as the data of different spontaneously, the model shows that the decline of the left is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit, but it's going to reduce the weight that's coming from independent and collaborative effects that play over time.
And the most interesting thing is what the numbers can tell us about the different population.
So from the modern foot of a genetic foot that's in collaboration of collaboration, to the highest speech of white societies, we can even figure out that the answer to some of the first human evolution has already seen.
It's the next universal language.
In the '60s, it was a Pacific music that was driving the generation.
In the 1970s, it was probably money.
But my generation of people, software is the web for imagination and our world.
And it means that we need a lot of more diverse people to build these products, to not see computers as anxiety and objects and water, to see them as things they can play with them and evolve, and so on.
My private journey to the world of aging and technology started at the age of 14.
I had the love of a crazy guy in a older guy, and the older guy who was just in the case of the United States, said, "Don't live."
And I did what every teenager was like to do.
I wanted to somehow express my love, so I built him a website, it's here.
And in 2001, there wasn't Twitter, there wasn't Facebook, it wasn't an epic.
So I had to learn to code to express all the emotions and love.
And so programming started for me.
It started as a way for self-esteem.
Just as I was a little bit smaller, I've been using fossil protests and go.
And when I was older, I would use my goal and predict a theater.
But then, there were other things to get excited about, like a poem and a poston and the bias of the French actions in French and invest places and Berberbert and Robert and his philosophy.
And I started to be one of these people and felt that computers are critical and techniques.
Here's what I think today.
A small child doesn't know they're not supposed to love computers.
The small children are amazing.
They're really good at conducting things and accurate actions and they're asking amazing questions like, "What?" Why? "
And "What if?"
It's the parents who do it.
It's us the parents who feel that computer science is an athetic scientist, a strange scientist who just belongs to the Mordan.
It's like the worst of life today's lives like, say, nuclear physics.
And they're a professionals about it.
There's a lot of transparency and control and information and algorithms and death, prototypes and privacy.
And we're as a community, we've done smaller computers.
We've built the features of one method on the other between the person and the neighborhood to the point that we didn't have a more idea of how computers work or how to talk to them.
And we teach our kids how the human body works, we teach them how the inner motor works and we even tell them that if they really want to be astronomers, they can really be.
But when the kids come to us and ask, so, what is the algorithm that's wrong? "
Or, "How does the computer know what happens when you're a French, how do he know what video to show?"
Or, "Linda, is the Internet a place?"
We're adults, we're becoming strange projects.
"It's magic," How many of us say.
It's too complicated, "The other people say.
Well, it's no one of them.
It's not magic and it's not complex.
It's all just happened really fast.
A computer scientist built these amazing machines and physical machines, but they made them very, very recent, and also the language that we talk about computers so that we don't know how to talk more computers without the users of our fingers.
And that's why no one wondered that when I got unusual actions in French, I actually adopted my patterns of pollution.
And when I was excited about a restaurant, I was actually following a series of symbolic dogs that were generated with them.
And the long journey of Berrand Robert Robert to find an accurate language between English and mathematics discovered his house in a computer.
I was planning, but nobody knew it.
The kids of the day, they're pushing, chimps and looking at their way in the world.
But if you can create tools to build with computers, we only grow consumers instead of creating.
All this journey led me to this little girl.
Her name is Roberi, she's six years old.
It's completely fear, unprecedented and a little bit of corruption.
And every time I was going to take a problem to try to teach myself like, "What's this instruction of objects or what it's collecting?" I'd try to imagine how a little girl was going to explain the problem.
And I wrote a book about it and I took it and the things that I've spent is going to go like this.
I'm most of my favorite that you're not supposed to be afraid of the blogs under your bed.
And even the big problems are a group of small problems that are based together.
And my brothers also showed me to her friends, the blue side of the Internet culture.
It's got friends like a remote, which is beautiful, but you don't want to play with the other kids.
And it has friends like the green robots that are really social, but very curious.
And it's friends like Nicox Nicox that's really effective, but it's a little bit hard to build.
And Iranian weapons, and so on.
In the world, you learn technology through a game.
And for example, computers are really good at repeating things, so the way most of the cell phone works like this.
It's the Amazon movement on Ray, it's going, "Kelp, Kelp, Scott, a telescope of a telescope."
And you're learning cell phones on it for four times.
And you're learning cell phones while "by repeating the floor on one foot.
And you're learning a mobile phone by repeating this floor until a mother's really done in a car.
And especially, you learn that there's no answers.
When I brought the learning program to the world of Roberi, I had to really ask the kids how they see the world and what kind of questions they had and I was an extension of a game.
I was going to start to show kids these four images.
I'd show them a picture of a car, cutting out of the capacity and services.
And I would ask, "What are you thinking is a computer?"
And the kids were very conservative and say, "No one of those is not a computer.
I know what it's a computer: It's this beautiful box from Asia and Dad spend much too much time. "
But then we were talking and we would find that, in fact, a car is a computer, it has a neutral system in it.
And in a sudden, it may not be a computer, but it has a cold and chocolate maybe there's a computer.
And the skills of the capacity, they have so many different kinds of computers, like the coffee system and the alphase.
And children, you know what?
In Japan, services are computers and there's even the cases that represent them.
And we're going to continue and I'm going to give them these little boundaries with small toys on them.
And I say to kids, "Today you have this famous capacity to make everything in this room to the computer."
And again, the kids say, it sounds really hard, we don't know the right answer to it. "
But I tell them, "Don't worry, your parents don't know the right answer.
They just started to hear about this thing called the Internet of things.
But you're the kids, you're going to be the ones that are really in the world where everything is a computer. "
And then I had this little girl who came to me and took a bicycle bicycle and said, "This horizon, if it was a computer, it would change colors."
And I said, "It's really a good idea, what else can it do?"
And she's thinking, and she says, "If the horizontal plane was a computer, we'd go to my dad with my dad and we'd go to the audience and we're going to be a film and this horizon could be a movie."
And that's the moment I'm looking for, the moment where the kids understand that the world's certainly not ready, that a really amazing way to do the world is by building technology and that each of us can be part of this change.
The last story, we're also building a computer.
And we know the bicycle and the skin memory and the South that can help him remember things.
And after we put our computer together, we've also designed an effect for it.
And my favorite story is this little boy, it's six years old and the favorite thing in the world is to be an astronaut.
And the child, there's an enormous object and it's completely transparency in his young paper because you understand, it's built a paralysis between his church.
And his father, the single astronomer on the road around Mars, on the other side of the room and the important task of the child is to bring the father back to the planet.
And these kids will be a completely different view of the world and the way we build it with technology.
Finally, the more technology we're going to do the world is more likely to say, more and more diverse, the world will look better and faster.
So imagine with me, for a moment, a world where the stories that we tell about how things become not just the same children of Sylin and me, but also, we're also a terrible, terrible and terrible victims.
Imagine a world where it's going to lose the little boss of a bridge, which is living in a fixed reality of one and zero, they grow to be optimistic and objects about technology.
They invest the forces and opportunities and the limits of the world.
And it's a technology that's fantastic, slamming, and a little strange.
When I was a child, I wanted to have stories.
I liked to create a fabric, and my favorite thing to do was get rid in the morning in the species.
After the luck, I was scared around Titan.
And in the evening, I've been going to sleep in Nigeria.
And it became the perfect profession for me.
I'm still creating violence.
Instead of stories, I create them with code.
Technology gives me a huge power to build all my little world with its laws and refugees and behavior.
I'm going to create something because with the great power of the corner.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The humanity was a speed of speech for eyes.
The history of human progress is one of the speed of the rainforest comes, and one of the most important ones in this history was that the sound of the voice.
It's not a lot of after the first production, the pixels were to add their plants to fly faster and faster.
But when they did it, the range of voices come up and big conversations on the plane have come up with them to kill more.
How many were trying to shoot the problem through a dangerous sound, which many times have been in tragedy.
Finally, in 1947, design production, like optimistic bias, the whole president, enabled to the United States Chile Chile to move the bus of 127 kilometers, and to become the first one of the speed of the voice and prevent the speed of the speed.
The New 1 was the first one between a lot of planes on the liquid after it, with a lower fingerprint that comes to the speed of more than you were three.
The airplanes are rapidly on the molecules create a coffee with a dirty noise that's worried about coffee, which can make stress and animals under or even keep buildings.
For this reason, scientists around the world have studied water on pollution, trying to predict their female in the atmosphere, where they're going to come, and how powerful they're going to be.
In order to understand better how scientists studied water on cockroads, let's start with the basic principles of sound.
Imagine a little bone in a fingerprinting.
What would you see?
The artist causes to move in the water in the same speed in any direction.
These crops that are going to grow in Bercus is called the roof.
Like, although we don't see them, a mobile voice, like a Australian system, creates a voice that's coming out.
The speed of these wheels depends on the faces like the heat and the temperature of the air is moving.
In the sea, a voice was about 1225 miles per hour.
But instead of throwing up on the surface of too late, corruption corporations are now fantastic, with the voice that's going to move through these customers.
Now imagine a very bad voice, as a train decline.
When the source continues to move in a certain direction, the next wheels to the face of his face.
The highest limits is the genome to the famous magazine effect, where objects are coming up with a high sound response.
But as long as the source is going to take more of the voice themselves, they're going to get one local in the other.
It's when the bone is moving quickly on the liquid, it's fast from the voice that it creates, that the picture changes dramatic.
When he's on the sound of a voice that he's made, when he's created new products from his current universe, the wheelchairs get together, and you create the switch.
No sound sounds when it comes to the floor because the object is faster than the voice it creates.
Only after it's the coffee worker to hear the bone on the coffee.
Instead of the switch of the land, it creates a fingerprint, and it's a decline that's going to be worried in the bone that's when it's moving forward.
It does it for the French to put the region that's affected by the bone on the Kiki.
What about understanding how powerful the bone is going to be?
It's including the paralysis of the Nazoo Syrus School in order to find the strengths in the air of the airplane that's going on.
The result is a piece of pressure that's about the National.
What does this shape mean?
Well, the boss on the coffee is happening when there's an advanced change in pressure, and the Kenya is two days: one of the first pressure of the aircraft in the airplane, and another one when the finger goes down, and the pressure goes back to the corner.
It's causing a flight, but it's usually sound as a single one of the people.
In fact, computational models that use this principle can often predict the universe and what's made of water on polystems and data with autonomy, and there's a research study that's going to discover these effects.
In the meantime, Turkey on the ground remained a library.
So, are the water on the politicians are a recent piece?
Not exactly.
While we're trying to find ways to stop them, other animals use water on the walls to the face.
The great diplomus was maybe able to join a quick speed of the voice, over 1200 kilometers, probably to move crazy.
How many species of muscles can create a similar body in the water, and the name or even kill a mirror with the accurate in the cloud.
So while we've come up with a lot of our conventional instrument after the speed, it turns out that nature was there before.
It's focused on the top of the coffee, it's a small organ and an enormous power on your body.
It's called the refugee.
Like the Central Brothers in society, her job is to worry that your cells are working well.
It's doing it using conventional use to provide numbers for each of them.
The Horry Rott is made out of light that every single one of these smaller cells called fossil, who live the hormones in the spinal cord sends into the blood.
Two of the most important hormones that it's producing green and Titan, or T3 and Text.
When you go, the role of the hormones is to predict every cell in the body when you take a pencil and you put out of the magazine.
It's about the atmosphere of the body, the response of the response that our cells do to provide energy.
These hormonal opinions from the spinal cord causes to notice more efficient effects, and our cells to just take materials faster.
When you need more energy, the spinal cord is repeating instructions to define the materials.
In the end, the boss boss represents our cells to use energy, grow and culture.
The refugee boss is reduced by the more brain, the hormones of the hormones that reduce deep in the brain that's driving on the boss tables, and it's why she knows when to send her negatives.
The role of the current blog is to feel if the hormones are too low or too high, in this case it sends hormones instructions in a way of instructions in the bus.
Even in this conventional system, with that, the demand is sometimes a piece of piece.
A certain diseases, a tumor in the spinal cord or an artificial food in the body can switch the man and turn it into an extinction of the brain's rights.
The first problem that causes is a theory.
It means that the cells are focused on reducing materials and oxygen.
They become too different as a result, which means that a person with a lower autonomy theater that's more likely to hope in a faster heart quality, an instrument, and it's a faster speed.
They're also feeling a heat, the arm, and they're going to sleep.
The extension problem is that it's gone into autism, which is going on as a spinal cord sends a little bit of hormones, which means that you don't get enough sensory to predict them.
As a response, the cells become unprecedented and the atmosphere.
People with the end of autism, you see the symptoms of it weight, privacy, common, common and depression.
Unfortunately, there's medical treatments that can help activate the activity of the refugee again, and bring the body back to a strength rate.
For this small man, the France of House was in a Western power.
But a healthy blogging demands our cells so effective that it can keep us working in a part of no matter that it's there.
Mary Wajan: Aley -- my mother's mother.
Isal Wajan: A green age.
MG: Or...
It's a privilege.
I'm going to say, "Don't have a cat."
AK: In Bali, we represent 680 meters of plastic waste every day.
It's about a 14-year-old building.
And when it comes to plastic, less than five percent of them are repeated.
MG: We know it changes the picture you have of my father.
She's also changed our own, when we found it, when we found that a little bit of the plastic creatures in the Alex comes to the homes and then our teenagers and then our ocean.
And those who don't even respond to the ocean, they're or pregnant or refugees.
AK: So we decided to do something about this.
And we've worked almost three years now to try to say not to get plastic on our house.
And we had some significant success.
MG: We're alive, and we're going to go to the best school on the planet: the green schools, in me.
The green school is not just different in the way it's built in a bank, but also in the way it's teaching.
We teach us to become leadership today, something that a terrible book can't be able to do.
AG: One day we had a lesson in the classroom where we learned about meaningful people, like Nelson Mandela, Lanada and the Ghandy Gandy.
When we went home at the same day, we'd also wanted to be meaningful.
Why do we need to wait until we're adults to be meaningful?
We wanted to do something now.
MG: When we looked at the book at the same night, we had ideas and thought about all the problems that I was going to be in front of them.
And the only thing that we looked at was the most plastic.
But it's a huge problem.
So we looked at what was a primary goal for us, the kids: a plastic.
And the idea was born.
AG: We started exploring, and let's say, as we learned more, there was no good thing about plastics.
And you know what?
We don't even need them.
MG: We really started inspiration from the efforts to say not to buy a lot of plastic in other places, from Alexanda and a few cities like Okland and Atland.
AK: And this is how the idea became a reduction of "Baby" in Palestine. "
MG: In the years we did the campaign, we learned a lot.
First lesson: You can't do everything alone.
You need a big team of children like you, and so we've put the team in my hands in Palestine.
The volunteers including children from all over the Amazon, I've spent local and international.
And together with them, we started a lot of infrastructure, based on a huge piece of piece of paper and also on paper, commons and ethnicity in schools and we've got general awareness in markets, roads, refugees.
And most importantly, we're looking at alternative parts, you're making a network, that you've got a recycled paper or you're going to take a hundred percent of a repeated organic material, and you might be made by local tuns on the left.
Or: We're educated as a experimental village, a house to 800 families.
The head of the village was our first friend and he liked our partners, so it went back.
We've been focused on being aware of consciousness, because there's the change that change should happen.
The village is already in two thirds of the way to become a plastic tool.
Our first experiences to make the government of my grandfather to join his face.
So we thought, "Mr. -- huge with a million pieces.
They can't move away from us right? "
MG: Right!
AK: But, who was a million of this piece of piece like, a thousand times an alone?
[]]]]]]] []]]]]]]]]]]
Somebody reminded that the airport of the Alexi is a 16-million techniques and reality a year.
HG: But how do we go into the airport?
And here's a number of three: the device.
We've created a direction of the airport.
We've gone through the skin.
And then it was the bus of his boss, and then San Minister from the office, and then the office, and then...
And we gave us two levels and thought, well, here's the list again.
And after a few days in the parking of doors and just be children in the task, we finally got to the restaurant management of the Amazon.
And let's see, "The Palestinian video of Aley," and it's very nice, he said, "Honey" I can't believe why I'm going to say, but I'm going to give you a collection behind the paper and the bridge. "
And I've been able to do this: in the first and a half of our first half there, we've got almost 1,000 pieces.
How cool is it?
Four number four: We need God in all of society's levels, teaching students to predict people's crimes.
And dots for the walls of the green school, we had access to the prize of Syrian School.
In the Amazon, we teach us that the mayor of the United States doesn't have a huge amount of toxic -- but even if kids get beautiful.
But it's the promising to spread the motion, and now we're working in the bottom with the very special violence.
MG: Jamin will grow us the power of people's networks.
It started with one group of survivors and now it has 4,000 groups around the world.
We are one of them.
It's inspired real inspiration.
If you're peers in Broadi, you're nice to meet you.
We're connecting, the most young reference of international aid.
AK: But we also learned a lot about curiosity, from MG: How do you deal with conservations, OK: Hoo, HG: Ford, a team, AV: companies, from the MS: We've learned more about their artists and their culture: and we've been talking about the importance of life.
MG: It's not always easy.
Sometimes it's done a little bit hard to do like things.
AK: But last year, we did exactly that.
We've been trying to make a talk, and our parents took us to visit the private house to the past of the Ghandy Gandy.
We've discovered about the power of noise that he did to get to his goals.
Yes, until the end of the conference, when we met our parents again, we decided, "We're going to go to noise!"
[] MG: And you can probably imagine their faces.
It took a lot of action, and not just our teachers but our friends and teachers.
I've been serious and I've been serious about doing this.
So we came up with an exhibition, and we went to a fire of not to eat from the arm to the wall every day until I'm going to get to meet us to talk about how to stop the Palestinian transformation in the Arabic.
Or, "Man Man," as it's called the Indonesia, started.
We used social media to support our goal and over the other day, the police started to come to our house and school.
What did these girls do?
We knew we didn't make our brain look best at doing this noise -- we could go to prison.
But, Hey, it worked.
Two hours later, we went from school and went to the office of the office.
MG: And here he was -- []]] --]]]]] --]]]]]] []]
He was looking at the joke to help people's people's conversation to say not to Palestine.
And we're friends right now, and on a fixed basis, we're lucky for it and they've got his conversations that they've done.
And really, recently, it's the painting and it has to have a Palestinian crisis to 2018.
Thank you very much: And also, in the Amazon of Amazon, one of our documents is designed to start a plastic policy to 2016.
MG: I've stopped part of a Palestinian transformation for free, and I've spent very useful, our next message to change the audience's audience's audience.
AG: The campaign of our short term, "One of one voice," is all about it.
We've looked at and we've seen the agencies and the restaurants that this boy has been a plastic region, and we've put their conference on their conference and we've published their violence in social media and how important genes are in me.
And the dream, it's from a light on those who don't have a bicycle.
So, why do we actually tell you about it?
Well, in particular, it's because we're looking at results, fear with our team, we'd be able to get to them.
But also because in a way, we learned that children can do things.
We can make things happen.
I've just been just 10 and 12 girls when we started it.
We've never had a business plan, not a permanent strategy, and not Janua Banada -- just the idea of us and a group of friends who work with us.
All we wanted to do was stop these plastic animals from the kitchen and move our beautiful house.
Children have no energy and motivation to be the change that the world needs.
AK: So all the kids of the beautiful world, but this challenge: go on it!
Do the change.
We don't tell you that it would be easy.
We tell you that it's going to be worth it.
We're the kids maybe 25 of the world's population, but we're 100 percent of the future.
MG: We still have a lot of work to do, but we know that we're not going to stop until the first question that I'm going to ask when you get to the airport of the AI would be like, "Brothers for the next one, you have plastics to get on them?"
It's a sudden that's slow that's slow.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Right now, you're probably sitting in order to watch this video and describe a few minutes to see it's probably okay.
But the more you'll find, your body will be more unemployed.
He's sitting there, and he's told the moments until you're going to go back and take it to the top.
It may sound diverse.
Our body likes to sit, right?
Not really.
Of course, sit into a few moments can help us get out of a war or expect a beautiful activity.
But today, our life organisms make us sit much more than we're wrong, and our bodies just don't have this day that's done in thinking.
In fact, the opposite is true.
The human body is built in motion, and you can see dots to it in the way we're built.
We've got more than 360 temperatures, and about 700 muscle muscles that are coming out of a coffee, and you've got more than 30s.
The unique biological structure of the body gives us the capacity to stand with the power of the field.
We're going to take our motion to make the best.
Our nerves are conducted, and our skin is altrum, which means that it's bringing itself into our motions.
So if any of the body's body's body's brain and you're going to get you wrong, what happens when you're not?
Let's start with the spinal cord of the problem, liberal.
Your spinal cord is a long structure of objects and the conservative business that's sitting in.
Rather, muscles and crazy muscles that come together.
A common way to sit is with a flight and chemistry that's designed, a motion that's active is not worth on your spinal cord.
Over the time, it makes a prosperity and a career in your service, a certain motion of moves, and a stress on the muscles that are designed to jump on the local motion of the wheel.
This beautiful motion also sees your home as you're sitting in, which means your health has less place to grow when you're waiting.
It's a problem because it's increasing the amount of oxygen that's full of your imaginations and it's going to go to your blood.
Again around the survivor has the muscles, the nerves, the walls and the parents that make the quality of the body.
It's the cooperation of a convenient thinking, a little bit and a piece, and these lower tasks really feel the pressure.
Have you ever killed a sense of sense and unprecedented when you sit?
In the worst areas, your nerves, the farmers and the teachers can get famous, what's coming to the communities of the nerves, and makes sense, and leaving the blood flow of the sea in the streets, which makes them get rid.
Technology's also a reference that's also revealed to the Pittocin, a special anxiety of the preference that's been scared in their face, so when you sit, you don't survive a good one as you're moving.
If effects have the movement on the brain?
Most of the time, you're probably sitting in order to use the brain, but in a way, a long period of thinking actually works in this goal.
It's going to be a remote of the blood flow and the oxygen that's designed for your blood flow through the mirror.
Your brain requires the two things to stay eyes, so your boundaries will probably see when your brain's activity.
Unfortunately, the negative effects of thinking doesn't only exist in the short term.
A recent studies found that thinking of long-term transparency for some kinds of cancer and heart disease and can make a conservation, and liquid problems.
In fact, researchers found that in the world, inactivity is made about 9 percent of corruption before every year.
It's more than five million people.
So why seems to be an unhappy driver actually has the power to change our health.
But unfortunately, the solution to this model is just intuitive and intuitive.
When you don't have a choice but to sit, try to replace the chickens in a brilliant service, and when you don't have to be connected to a chair, try to move as possible, maybe by reminding yourself to the universe every half an hour.
But most importantly, you're just going to see your body is built into a motion, not an extinction.
In fact, because the video is nearly extinct, why don't you get it and take right now?
Put your body in the night.
He's going to give you later.
When you think about a moment of Ethiopia, you probably think about it.
But it turns out, maybe it was more like this.
In the third century before the apartment, the solution, the city of the Chicacacadea Center, in the village in Egypt to take on an engineering project that doesn't look like.
The species that's got a big tool that's 50 times away from the standard of ancient war, called Korea and Turkey on the city.
The solution wanted to build the biggest prosthetic ever, which was a device to give a device to a metaphor, Pitti.
But could a tumor in the size of a hormone could even expect?
In the age of Archias, nobody tried something like this.
It was like to ask, "Can the river fly?"
For you a lot, it would depend on this question.
The hundreds of workers were supposed to work on the building of the cartoon from organisms and forget fast, roads from Kenya to grow in the Spain, and the France of France.
The top one, he was supposed to stand up to the picture of a musician, and we wouldn't be fed by pounds, but by a total of Atlane represents the world on its own.
On the back of the conference, a huge popular flow was able to fit in a weight of 90 pounds.
For the worst generation, it was supposed to be on a restaurant pipe, a restaurant that's scared, and I've spent a space with water from water, a library is full of books and crowds, a monitoring to Amazon, and a right room.
And it's just to do the things that's harder to the horizontal, the solution is to fill the scene in the kitchen: 400 tons of control, 10,000 pounds of crazy fish, 74 tons of who you've had, and it's 600 tons of a paper.
It was more than a thousand people on Syria, including 600 soldiers.
And it's about 20 pounds in France cells.
To build something about this scale, just to make it happen in her restaurant?
Well, let's just say that failure didn't have an enormous option for architecture.
So he took the problem: Is it a background?
Maybe he's sitting in a single space, and he's wondering how aestheia would expect, when inspired it.
Obviously, there was a sophisticated period of power that's equally equal to the current weight that's been driven by the bone.
In other words, if the cartoon is wearing 2,000 pounds of water, it's in a coffee.
If it was a 4,000 tons of water, it would expect without a problem.
Of course, if it's going to move 1,000 tons of water, well, the solution will not be really happy.
It's a piece of view, and engineers still read it from France.
He's explaining why huge features can predict the same click of a piece of a tree or an aesthetic.
If the weight of the water's weight that's driven by a song that's under a fire is equal to the weight of the sand, what's on the other hand will stay out of the water.
It sounds like a different story that including Alex and Asia, and it's possible because they're actually the same story, they're interested in history.
The Central story of Ethiopia and killed the streets of the streets that a simultaneously demanded around the wall, or a corporation in Titan.
In the heart of the Chinese story, there's a blueprint, or a biologist.
Could one be able to fit with the other?
Maybe we'll never know.
On the day that the cartoon came to Egypt in its first journey, and the only one, we can just imagine how Alexandria came to the left to predict the president of this extinction.
This unusual tool was the Titan of the ancient world, except from the part of the mistake, dots to our friends, Archius.
How does this music make you feel?
Do you find it beautiful?
Is it creative?
Now, you would change the answer if you were to teach that the presence is this robot?
Remember or not, people have lost with the question of artificial creativity, together with the question of artificial intelligence, for more than 170 years.
In 1843, for Alice to Amazon, England mathematician who thought for the first computer programs in the world, as a machine can't be in a human genome as well as any other person is doing what a person was designed in a car to do.
By Ablice, a machine has to be able to create a professional ideas to think of genetic.
A look at Alexis, that you've got to my name in 2001, invented a way to look at the idea.
A machine can go through the test if it can create a result that its program can't explain on the original code.
Despite Alexis is, in our minds, more computing experiment from an objective scientist.
But it's a place to start.
In the first perspective, the idea of a machine that creates optimistic music and professionals in this way you might see impossible.
We'll be able to get complex ethnic emissions using millions of books, deep biological functions to create a series of musical muscles in the way that you can't track.
But even though it's going to make a lot of traditional theories that you've never heard before, just a tiny particle of them will be equal.
When a computer doesn't have a way to understand those who might think possibilities and those who don't.
But what if we took a step back and try to grow a natural process that allows creativity to make?
We know about at least one process that has led to the results, valuable, and even physical: the process of evolution.
And evolutionary algorithms, or ecosystems that make biological evolution, they're one attractive approach to make neighborhoods to create artificial and artificial values.
So how can evolution create creative machine?
Well, instead of organisms, we can start with the creative population of muscles, and the basic algorithms that make a piece of strength and accurate motion by changing some parts, and other combinations, and the spontaneously accurate.
Now we've got a new generation of monkeys, we can apply a choice using a process called a bridge.
It's just like a fossil biological reaction by pressure around extinction, our happiness functions can be scared by a positive diversity that's tested by human musicians, or in my own music, to represent the autism.
The algorithms can then compare between our musicians and this beautiful diplomacy, and just a guy who's awesome.
Once the worst parts find, the algorithm can activate the motion and rethink what's left, to choose the most similar, or the most impressive generation, again from the new generation, and repeat a lot of generations.
The process that brings us there are so many academic and complexity that are built in the face that the result might be able to take the test to Alice.
And more importantly, resilience to human astronomy in the process, we're going to create a range of dialogue that we can remove.
But does it tell our intuition why really creative?
Is it enough to create something from the magazine, or is creative require and aware of what's created?
Maybe creativity in this case really comes from the programs, even if they don't understand the process.
What is human creativity, anyway?
Is it something more than the system of News are connected by biological algorithms and the invisible experience that's made our lives?
Darwin and Ocus, a machine and human beings.
These are the events in the heart of the creative beauty of the machines that are now creating music, boxes, holes, poetry and more.
The colors may not even decide if it's a female to read these creative actions.
But if a piece of art can make you make a beautiful, or open you your head, or send a mirror in your spinal cord, does it really matter who or what made it?
It's a geologist.
Porologist is a robot that's designed to mix a kind of kind of weapons called Porus and Talk.
Porologist can go, as you see here, and you'll see later, which is also a conversation.
So you might ask, why did you make this robot?
And in fact, this robot was designed as a neuroscience tool.
And really, we took it together with Nigeria and biologists to figure out how animals are wrong, and in particular how the spinal cord sends in a motion.
But the more I'm working in a robotics, I'm getting more of animals.
If you think about a dolphin is saving or a crowd or a coffee, or even we're the people, when you're laughing or games, we're doing amazing things.
And in fact, our nervous system developed very complex movement.
It needs to be less or more 200 muscles in the heat, because if our speech is worse, we're going to get worse or worse.
And my goal is to understand how it works.
There's three main components behind the animal movement.
The first component is just the body, and in fact, we can't appreciate enough to this level of anthropy has already shown the movement in life.
So you've got the spinal cord, and in the spinal cord, you're finding a click, a refugee that's producing a cell theory that's produced a motion between self-activity in the spinal cord and an active activity.
Third components are the central patterns.
These are interesting circumstances in the spinal cord of organisms that can create, themselves, very complex and complex patterns of activity as they get just a very simple reception of very simple signals.
And these curious signals come from high parts of the brain, like the modern corner, the little brain, the next two, everyone will move activity to the spinal cord in our walls.
But what's interesting about is what part of a low level, the spinal cord, together with the body, has already evolved a big part of the movement.
And you're probably familiar with the fact that you can take the head of the chicken, and it can continue to a certain time, which shows that just the bottom part, a spinal cord and a body, has already evolved a big part of the movement.
Now, to figure out how it works is very complex, because I'm going to record activity in the spinal cord is very difficult.
It's much easier to buy electronics in the modern motion than the spinal cord, because it's protect by connections.
Actually in people, really hard to do.
Two lines is that motion is really in a very complex communication and dynamic between these four features.
So it's very hard to figure out what the role of every single time.
There's the robots like Pallott and math models can help.
So what's it in robotics?
Back robotics is that a very effective fact of research in the bosstics where people want to take inspirations to create robots that go out, like robotic and search and search, or a robotic one.
And the big goal here is to take an inspiration of experts to create robots that can deal with complex surface -- stairs, foreign, places where robots still have actions and animals can do better work.
The robot can also be a great scientific tool.
There's some very nice projects where the robots are used, like neuroscience tools, to their own anthropology or to be dynamics.
And it's exactly the goal of Pallott.
So what we're doing in my lab is to cooperate with Nigeria like Jazan Minkin's's's's's's's's biologist,'s what we're going to do in France, and we want to
And here we want to start just.
So it's good to start with simple animals like a privacy, which are very primitive fish, and then look to go into a more complex movement, like a cosmos, but also in human beings and humans, and we're getting very popular.
And here, a robot becomes interesting to move our models.
And in fact, for me, Pallott is a kind of dream that's happening.
Like, less or more than 20 years ago, I've been working on a computer that was the imagination of the French and Central and Center during my cartoon.
But I've always knew my consciousness was crazy.
Like, waiting the physics in the water or with a tree or a complex surface, it's very hard to worry about a computer.
Why don't there be a real robot and real physics?
So between all of these animals, one of my surroundings is the restaurant.
You might ask why, and it's because an artificial animal, it's really important from an evolutionary perspective.
It creates a great link between the animal, as you find it in walls and fish, and it's about four feet, as you see in the banks and people.
And in fact, the modern transition is very close to the first two animals, so it's almost alive, which gives us access to our ancestors, the reasons for all the other tasks.
So the restaurant is scared by what's called the Coradian California, so they create an interesting movement of muscle activity from the head.
And if you put the restaurant on the ground, it's deciding what's called the Titan French.
In this case, you've got a very nice period of the genes that are very beautiful with a Google's motion of the body, and it's exactly the key that you're seeing here in Ford.
Now, one thing that's surprisingly surprising and fascinating in fact is the fact that all of it can be made just by the spinal cord and the body.
So if you take a brain scanner -- it's not so nice, but you're leaving your head -- and if you're producing the spinal cord, in the lower levels of Rome, it's going to win what's going to look like the liver.
If you're a little bit more, you're going to get a little bit more.
And at some point, there's a collection, and autism, the animal is repeating.
It's amazing.
Just change the global movement, as if you're pushing on the gas of a motion goes down to your spinal cord, and it creates a perfect device between two very different forms.
In fact, the same thing is diagnosed in patients.
If you move the spinal cord of a cat, you can move between the night, a prototype and a career.
Or in the birds, you can make a bird out of the wall, at a low-level level level of Rosey, and we're going to get in high levels of Rome.
And it really shows that the spinal cord is a very complex movement.
So we've been looking at a much lower movement, and we've actually had access to a really fantastic video video game from a prison at the University of Uganda in Germany.
And for that, you really have an amazing machine to record all the objects in a big detail.
And this is what we did.
So we basically looked at some important objects for us and collected their movement in a 3D printer.
And what we've done is we've been collecting a whole whole data of movement, also on the ground and in the water, to actually collect a whole information of real motor motor motions can do.
And then our work as roboticians had to treat it in roads.
So we've done a perfect process to discover the right structure, where you're going to put the events, how to connect them together, to be able to return these movement the best you can.
And this is how Poltt came to life.
So let's look at how close it's in real life.
So what you're seeing here is almost a direct equation between real and real animals.
You can see that we've almost come back to one of the night form.
If you go back and privacy, you see it much better.
But even better, we can do a animal.
So for that, we have a sound that we put on all the robot -- and then we can go into the water and start to return the animal form.
And here, we were very happy, because it's really hard to do.
The physics of action is complex.
Our robot is much larger than a small price, so we had to do what we called a dynamic reference of cultures to make sure we had the same physics.
But you see at the end, we have a pretty good action, and we were very happy with it.
So let's go to the spinal cord.
So here's what we've done with John Mary Kenyan is to grow the spinal cord.
And what's interesting is that the contrast is that it's based on a very primitive Google, which is similar to this that we're finding in privacy, this fabulous feminist, and it looks like in evolution, motion and new motions have been invited to control things, to do the emotional movement.
And we know where these nervous objects are there, but what we did was create a mathematical model to see how they needed to be connected to enable this crisis between these two different forms.
And we put it on a robot.
And this is what it looks like.
So what you're seeing here is a previous version of the alcohot that's reduced on a corner model that's designed on the robot.
And the only thing we're doing is we're going to send a robot through spread the two sides that it's usually need to get from the top part of the brain.
And what's interesting is, by playing with these signals, we can control very quickly, in the direction and the kind of wisdom.
For instance, when we move in a low levels, we have a shape of the night, and at some point, if we move a lot, very quickly it's changing the animal form.
And finally, we can also do very beautiful patterns just by one side of the spinal cord more than the other.
And I think it's really beautiful how nature represents the control to really give a lot of responsibility to the spinal cord so that the top part of the brain doesn't have to worry about any muscle.
It just needs to worry about high levels, and it's really the work of the spinal cord to whether all the muscles.
So now let's go to the device and the importance of his daughter's daughter.
So it's another project where we've been looking at a prosthetics of patients, and we've wanted to see some of the biology helps the motion.
And we've found three important tricks in machines, basically, of the boys.
The first is that the fingers of smaller or more look like a structure of Pantum.
So Pautotography is a structure that's on the top and the unemployed parts are always listening.
So a simple geographic system that kind of motivates a little bit of the inner movement of the cartoons.
A second neighborhood of crops is that they're very climate.
Most of the muscles are in the body, which is a good idea, because then the boys have a low intuition and can move at high speed.
The last important feature is the very low-theater's prosthetic prosthetic, to deal with vulnerability and conversations.
And that's how we've designed the Richard.
So let's expect the boat to the stage.
So it's Pixar, which makes his Ph.D. on this robot, as you see, it's a small robot.
It looks a little bit like a toy, but it was really used as a scientific tool to explore these properties of the cat.
So you see, it's very easy, very weight, and also very altruistic, so you can jump on it in communities and it's not going to slow.
It's just going to jump, actually.
And the United States is also very important.
And you're also seeing a little bit of these three moments of the foot as a piano.
Now, what's interesting is that the kind of dynamic shape is just about open and open, which means without sensors, without complex feedback.
And it's interesting, because it means that just the techniques already represent this speed of speed, and this really good technique is already a movement.
For what we can even avoid motion, as you'll see in the next video, where we can do a regulation where the robot goes down the stairs, and the robot wouldn't get a big surprise for us.
It's a small disorder.
I've expected that my robot is going to take an email, because there's no sensors, there's no feedback.
But not, just the anthropy represents the step, and the robot doesn't fit.
Obviously, if you're doing the larger step, and if you've got chimps, you need the back of the Maria and Forps and all of you.
But what's important here is it's just to discover small disorders, the mechanism is true.
And I think it's a very important message from his daughter and the robots to the brain science, which means to appreciate what the body's already helping.
Now, how does it communicate to human motion?
In obviously, human movement is more complex than a cosmos of patients and treatments, but at the same time, the nervous system of people is very similar to each other's connections.
And mostly the definition is also the main crisis of movement in human beings.
So, if there's a surprise in the spinal cord, it has dramatic effects.
The person can become a game in the pocket or my hands.
It's because the brain is lost the media with the spinal cord.
Obviously, he's going to lose the motion of motion to start and move the motion.
So a big goal of corruption is to be able to return the communication using electrical and chemistry.
And there's a number of services in the world who do exactly that, especially in EPL.
My curiosity is a curiososity and Syrian in Australia, with them that I've been collaborating.
But to do that right, it's very important to understand how the spinal cord works, how it's communicating with the body, and how the brain connects with the spinal cord.
There's the robot and the models that I've been doing today in hopefully being a important role for these very important goals.
Thank you.
So in our own Octoco: Oh, I saw in your lab other robots that do things like curiosity and measure their fingerprints.
But for that, you've got your talk, like a very specific project, search, and it's got a camera on the nose.
Oh, October: Yeah. So the robot -- we've got some specific projects there we'd like to use blogs to do a search, so this robot sees you right now.
And the big dream is, if you've got a hard situation like a building that's read or a building that's made, and it's very dangerous to a team or even to get a robot, why don't send a robot in the region, to go, to the camera, with a camera to do a and pollution of patients and maybe create
BG: Obviously, the president that the patients didn't expect the form of this.
AA: Yeah, we've probably had to change the look pretty much, because language, I'm afraid that there might be a heart attack just to be worried that it would be going to eat it.
But by changing the view and make it more right, I'm sure we can create a good tool from it.
BG: Thank you very much. Thank you and a team.
There's an agriculture that's been invented in humanity since it's going to go.
The Greeks were fought by a long piece of posters, while the Chinese used boundaries.
In the ancient Indian institution, it's going to look even for a party reason for Rwin.
This great thing is the library, which is another is called the river of the revolution.
But what makes it, and why is it so universal?
Well, think about some of the bad forces that you can imagine, like a cat, a post or a bridge.
All of these brains come from the activity of organisms, mostly in bacteria, and how much it sounds like, in the diverse of animals in the environment that you're doing.
Don't die.
The pressure of your body is not just terrible, it's actually positive for all kinds of things, like eyes and disease.
But like all of the things of life, bacteria need to eat.
The bacteria in your map are conducted from a plane, the lions of food, and the tissue is falling.
In order to push the materials through their cells, they're alive to just take the organic material into a lot of smaller molecules.
For example, they're going to get proteins to believe that the components of them and they're taking them even more to different components.
How many of these regular products of response, like a mirror and academic, a city to the air and do their way by insects not afraid.
Our feelings to these conversations and their bad customers may be an evolutionary mechanism that enabled us from all the traffic and the forces of diseases.
The moon is one of the most intuitive and sensors, that's made a important role in our support for potential warming.
In one house, 59 percent of the men and 70 percent of the women said they wouldn't come out with someone who had a bad arm from the revolution, which might explain why Americans to pay one billion dollars a year on a variety.
Unfortunately, most of the bad brains have been capable of treatment.
The most recent products come from graphic cosmos if negative animals live in the walls and the teenagers and the teenagers.
By extending and using a fantastic page, using an anthropotic language in Kiki before the song, a remote of my brother's broken brothers with a French French and even a lesday morning, we can put a lot of these little bloggers and their food source.
In some cases, these events may not be scared in the face of great problems, problems in the nose, or more rare diseases.
The behaviors like a smoke and a chicken algae also has a familiar muscle.
Without the case, the bad source is nearly always the revolution and not from the Kenya or from another crisis in the body.
But one of the big challenges is in fact to tell what our smell is, and it's not clear why.
Maybe because we're used to win in our plate to judge it.
And as you take your hands on the page, or go and sell your hand also doesn't work in a perfect way.
One study showed that even when people do this, they tend to take a collective smell by how bad they thought it would be.
But there's one simple way, if it's a social, to find out how bad you're happy: just take a deep list and ask a friend.
Like the story is going, the Amazon William William was going to get in the power of a challenging challenge by a red red red red.
William's son's son's son's boy to be a product, but if William could serve in a strength on his head.
William succeeded, but let's imagine two sides of a story.
In the first graph, the red of a summer that would remove the real web of William. So he had to ask a nice web from one of the artists.
However, the web that doesn't travel in the halls, and William revealing his training lights are falled in the corner under the web.
Unfortunately, it has time to move the statistics before it's too late.
Very two: And if you start to click in his classes in his decades before the challenge and his partners are extended.
His hormone lions are still local around the kitchen but in an academic program.
Sometimes, it's going to go in the wind, but with the step, there's no security in a disorder.
He has to avoid his nervous hand and repeat his boss to save us.
In the heart of all these organisms, there are two conditions that are used to make sure: right and art.
The test between the two is actually critical to a lot of scientific challenges.
Just say how close you get to the right result.
Your imagination is improved with tools that use right and that you're very careful in conservation.
From art, on the other hand, it's the Western where you get the results using the same method.
Your art is changing with better tools that require less valuable.
The story about the genome was about art without just right.
William got the same results every time it's a poem.
The story with the wind wind was about right without art.
The trees of William was designed around the right consequence, but without the art of the bank for every single trial.
You can probably move with a worse, or a quick speed of art in daily speech.
But engineers and studies often require just a microscope at a microscope with high and high speech of being right every time.
Fails and beetles define the art with a better and more details.
These stories can be expensive, so managers have to decide what's most common to every project.
However, investment in the machines can take us beyond what was possible in the past, even far as Mars.
It may be surprised with you that San doesn't know exactly where their features are going to be on other plants.
They've got some of their reference requires complex calculations that are available by institutions that don't always have an accurate answer.
How does the atmosphere patterns change in different sea?
What's the brilliant warrior that's going on in the atmosphere?
What's the speech of the freedom in the box?
Scientists want thousands of emotional culture, culture and intervention for all of the devices.
You get all the possibilities, the computer represents the local region to come in a way of 3D printing.
In 1976, the 30-page printing was 100 miles, almost the surface of New Jersey.
With these limits, NASA had to move from a lot of interesting Ethiopia, but dangerous.
Since then, new data on the atmosphere of Mars, remote biological technology, and the more powerful computer computers have reduced inevitable insurance.
In 2012, the 3D printing was only six miles on 20 miles, a small surface of Vong.
It's enabled to President to a certain point in a reference, a big scientific area that's first been possible for.
While we're at the end of the moment to worry, from art is reducing our instructions to predict.
With these two principles to us, we can track the stars and safe and safe that we're going to have every time.
It's so clear that it's just like evolving.
You can't get back in a hard arm.
Well, it turns out you can, about.
What the ethical energy did for the spinal molecules, energy from anthropy can become.
Obviously, they're going to be made of water and proteins.
The proteins are starting with complex forms, powerful by complex chemical connections.
It's a heat that's driven to these connections, which allows them to evolve, to prevent and engage in freedom.
This process is called Nigeria.
The proteins that are released right now, we're starting to create new connections with each other, more and more when the heat costs, until at the end, they're so on in each other that they're becoming a production, a hardware.
This object may seem a permanent, but it's not.
By the chemical idea called the microscope of the microscope, everything that's going on, like a bubble protein that's going on, can be theory to become if you're going to go back on the road.
But it's more than a heat that's spending the proteins more, and it's just going to make them, so there's a trick: to switch them at the same speed.
I'm not laughing.
So it works.
First of all, scientists reduce the white in the edge of the sea with a chemist called Asia, a molecule that works as a chance, which shows the rich of the proteins of proteins and makes it easier for them to decide on one other.
So, they're complicated in this box at a very quickly rapidly rapid of 500,000 times in a minute, what causes a perception to spread in South Korean.
Here's the main part.
It's the profound that the microbial goes faster than the box that's called more to the center.
The rapidly difference is more stress stress that's strengthed and moves again and over the proteins until finally they jump back into the original and they're going to be left.
Unfortunately, the patient's name is repeated to the original unprecedented.
The techniques work with all the kinds of proteins.
A big proteins and more complicated proteins can predict, so scientists have lost a plastic plastic to one that's reduced another pressure and revealed it to fit before.
It's not going to work with a restaurant that's going to work with her kitchen from the other side and the box has to be sold on all the feet.
But the goals come beyond spending your morning budget, anyway.
A lot of drugs contain proteins that's going to be expensive to generate, in particular because they're volunteers in complex geographies, just like the spinning space and have to reduce them and reinvent before they can do their work.
This particular technology has the potential to be simple, cheap and more likely to reinvent proteins, so it might become new drugs for more people faster.
And there are other things you need to remember before you're trying to make your food's voice.
Unfortunately, it's actually an unusual process because although it changes the way proteins are made and connecting together, it doesn't actually change their chemical identity.
Most of the different types of decline is more likely to respond to the French Revolutionary, which makes chemical changes that become sugar and proteins to happen Antarctica, and they're much more difficult to make it.
So you might be able to make a song on the road, but I'm sorry to say you can't make her organization still.
There's no big thing or faster than the universe.
The questions that I'd like to say is one: One: What's the building we?
How did the universe be?
Do we look at the universe?
Is there an unusual life?
What is the human future?
By the 20th century's 20th century, everybody thought that the static universe in its own time and we don't change for time.
And then the universe is expanded.
And the galaxy galaxies are moving around us.
The crime in the past is probably more of those.
In Mexico to the back, we find that all of them would have been extended together about 15 billion years ago.
It was the big bank, first of the universe.
But was there something before the big bank?
And if not, what made the universe?
Why did the universe evolve as it's out of the big object?
We used to think that the universe theory is possible for two.
The first: there were the rules, like the Soviet and the general and the general form, which remains the evolution of the universe, in which it was exposed in every single time.
And Second, there wasn't a threat to the physical conditions in the universe.
We've come very well in terms of the first part, and we've got the knowledge of evolution in all conditions, except for the most expensive.
But until we recently knew a little bit about the physical conditions in the universe.
But this dream, to the rules of evolution and the conditioning conditions, from the president and understanding between time and space.
In extreme conditions, the general and the cockroaches are spread for a long time to get a different dimension of space.
It's driving the discovery between time and space, which means that the rules of evolution can also tell the situation I started.
The universe is able to express itself from the nose.
It's more and more, we can look at and find the universe companies are created in different situations.
These patterns are completely different in one corner with a satellite "Walp" of the Social Social Research ", which is a very expensive part of the universe.
We think we've evolved the healthcare.
Maybe we have to have a patent on the universe and have to all of them in their own bones.
Now let's go to the other big question: Do we learn, or is there other life in the universe?
We believe that life in the Earth have been created in a conservative way, so you may have a life in other planets, and that's probably many in the galaxy.
But we don't know how the first time the life was.
We asked two creative conversations about life's environments.
One: We've got artists from 3.5 billion years ago.
The Earth has created 4.6 billion years ago, and the conditions where there were probably too sophisticated for the first billion years.
So life has been affected on Earth within a half billion years of the thing that's possible, which is a little bit compared to a billion years that they've spent the life of the planet's life.
It means that the environments of life was pretty high.
If there was very low, the expectation was that there were a lot of a billion years.
On the left, we'll see that we didn't have a curiosity.
I'm looking at a click for the "water". "
Why do they just affect people's artists and help?
If there's a government from a magnitude to pull out the walls and try to itself the scientific knowledge that the creatures look at, there's so much that it looks like it's a traffic policy.
It's more and more, although the extinctions of a statistic project, "The search for a constant, we didn't take any extinct satellites.
It might mean that there's no corruption that's happening at the point of our creativity at a few hundred years of light.
It's an insurance of insurance because of a fabric in my hands look like a pretty safe investment.
And it brings me to the last question: the future of human species.
If we're the only building creatures in the galaxy, we've got to ensure our skin.
But in our friends, we're going to go into an age that's going to make a sense.
The man of the Earth and the end of the end of our hands on an engineering, together with our technologies to change the environment for a good or a movement.
But our genetic code is still a subject of humanity and prosperity so they had a unique value.
It's going to be hard to avoid the next few years, not to talk about a thousand or a million years.
We've only been able to survive over days, it's to stop on the planet but to go out and return in the external space.
The answers to these important questions show that we've gone through a lot of way in the last few years.
But if we want to continue beyond the next few years, we're going to be reduced in the extinction space.
So I'm at this journey that I'm in a fabulous space without a magazine.
I've been trying to understand the universe and find answers to these questions.
I'm lucky, and my sister didn't have a serious limit.
In fact, it's probably given me more time than most of the healthcare to another knowledge.
The final step is a perfect theory of the universe, and we're going to be very careful.
Thank you for your listening.
Chris Anderson: A professor, if you had to touch, do you think we're going to spend more likely for the space, as a culture of our nation and compassion?
It's about this question from seven minutes and it gave me an amazing idea of what an amazing action of TED was this talk.
SG: I think it's quite likely that we're the only culture in some hundreds of light; we've been visiting radio.
The second choice is that civilizations don't wait days, but it's used themselves.
CA: The professor of Hawking, thank you for this answer.
I think there's a very important apartment for the next week.
The professor, we're very excited about the unusual effort that can share us today in your wife.
Really, thank you very much.
Thank you.
When I started to learn from the extinction, it was just to pay attention to my violence and when my computers came back, to bring them back to a place.
It sounds pretty simple.
And yet, I've been sitting in those presidents of a trick, hitting my dog in the middle of the wall.
I was focused on every opportunity, because it was a really hard job.
Actually, it was extended.
The animal was pretty simple, but I realized something very important.
So why is it so hard to pay attention?
Well, studies show that even when we're very trying to pay attention to something -- maybe this talk -- at some point, about half of us will be in the summer, or we want to look at our Twitter.
So what happens here?
It turns out we're fighting in one of the most evolutionary learning from evolutionally evolutionary, it's known to know, the most basic nervous nervous nervous nerve.
It's a process for this learning, the boss on a restaurant, it's called positive and negative, and it's actually working like this.
We see food that looks wrong, and our brain says, "Sorriculture!
"We eat the food, make it -- it's wrong."
And in particular in the summer, our body is sending a message to the brain that says, "You remember what you're food and where you're looking at it."
We're making memory depends on this context, and we're going to go back on the process for the next time.
You see food, eat the food, feel good, and repeat back.
Trizen, behavior.
Just, right?
After a while, our creative brain says, "You know what?
You can use it not just to remember where the food is.
"The next time you feel bad," Why don't you try to eat something wrong, and so do you feel better? "
We're focused on our brains, trying to learn faster that if we eat chocolate or feedback when we're moving or objects, we feel better.
The same process, just a different trick.
Instead of this noise will come from our cancer, this particular artist -- the nerves -- brings to eat.
Maybe in our 20s, we were the nurses in the school, and we saw the main kids out of the tree, and we thought, "Hey, I want to be a voice."
And we started doing it.
The Hollywood man wasn't design, and it wasn't in the case.
Look at what it's a voice, it's going to be a voice of yourself, you're going to feel good, you're going to feel a program.
Trizen, behavior.
And every time you do that, we learn to go back the process, and it becomes the foot.
So later, the feeling of motivating the need to do the need of California, or eat something that's funny.
Now, together with those animals, we went from learning to survive myself with the same emotions.
The smoke and the smoke is between the fossil genes to the windows and death in the world, the News to prevent.
So back to my violence.
What if we're instead of fighting our brain, or try to transform ourselves to pay attention, we'd be able to connect it to the same natural learning learning on a gene.
But in a tool?
What if it's instead of leading really curious about what happens in our experience of that moment?
I'll give you an example.
In my lab, we learn if a city of listening can help people stop doing it.
Now, just as I'm trying to transform myself to pay attention to my violence, they can try to move on themselves to stop doing.
And most of them have tried it in his past and failed -- six times, on average.
Now, with a listener, we've been reduced the little bit of the plastics and where we've focused on curiosity.
In fact, we even told them to do.
What? Yeah, we said, "Go out," Just be really curious about your experience. "
And what did they understand?
Well, here's an example of one of our innovation.
She said, "Bush Kenyan again:" Shair like a restaurant, "and it has a taxe of chemicals," Oh! "
Now, she knows that I'm going to have a prosperity that's left, so she's going to join our program.
What she's discovered with a conscious curiosity while she's a year, he's a smoke has an insector.
But now, it's done information for a few.
She went to know in her head that the smoke leaves her to know it in her bones, and the magic of the smoke was sold.
It started to reduce her behavior.
Now, the Francisco Francisco, the most young part of our minds, from an evolutionary perspective, understand the intuitive level that we don't need to do.
And it's trying to help us change our behavior to help us stop doing, to help us stop eat the second skin, the third and the top.
It's called cognitive control.
We use thinking to control our behavior.
Unfortunately, it's also the first part of our brain that's coming out when we're going to win, something that doesn't really help us.
Now, we can all connect to our personal experiences.
It's more likely that we're going to do things like clicking on our partners or our kids when we're going to wait, even though we know it's not going to help.
We're just hard to control ourselves.
When the French Francisco comes out, we're going to help our old patterns, so this concept is so important.
The understanding of what we get from our emotions to help us understand them at a deeper level -- to know ourselves, so we don't need to move on ourselves to move or to our behavior.
We're just less interested in doing it in the first place.
And that's the goal of listening, to see what we're getting when we're touching our legs, the preservation of a facility, and that's from this discovery, to release natural.
I don't say that the magic magic is great to do.
But over time, when we learn more to see the consequences of our behavior, we're releasing new emotions and create new emotions.
The paradox here is that states is just a limited, and it's about what's actually going on in our body and our head right now.
It's this extension to move in our experience instead of trying to stop the unfortunately.
And it's this extension to move in our experience, it's getting support with our curiosity that it's reducing itself in natural way.
How does curiosity feel?
It feels good.
And what happens when we do curiosity?
We're starting to notice that the objects are actually complicated from body feels -- or, there's pressure, there's a discovery -- and that's the same body feels in the face and the quality.
They're small pieces of experiences that we can manage a moment instead of pushing on the top of the tree and this tree that we're moving away from.
In other words, when we're curious leaders, we're going to come out of the old behavior, that's based on fear and response, and we're starting to be.
We're becoming this inner scientist when we're waiting for a wind of the next data.
Now, it could be that it sounds too spontaneous to affect behavior.
But in one study, we've found that you're going to have an effective, two times of the best mammography in helping people in the business.
So it really works.
And when we looked at people's brains that are transparency, we've found that some of the nervous parts of the nervous behavior called a healthy network that's going to get here.
Now, one of the current forests is that part of this web, called the background corner, is shown by the page of the beach itself, but when we look at it, when we're wearing in it, and it takes us with it.
In addition to that, when we're released -- we're coming out of the process just by the way we're leading curiosity in terms of what's going on -- that's the same part of the brain looks like.
We're now looking at effects and interactive programs for the most important awareness of consciousness that's focused on them with main mechanisms and irony, using those technologies of extension so that help us get out of our productive behavior of eye, self-esteem and behavior.
Now, remember the part of memory depends on the context?
We can send these tools to the fingers of people in the most important connections.
So we can help them connect to their interpretation to be curiosity in a way that's just when the dog is done or eat anything costs.
If you don't wait for years, or ethnicity may be the next time you're going to feel this page to look at your email when you're crazy, or when you're trying to find a scientific conversation during work, or maybe I'm going to know SMS in a time you're going to go through if you
It's going to be another opportunity to continue one of our infinite and our feelings.
Or go out of it.
Instead of seeing SMS and go back in a way, feel a little bit better -- notice, you'll be curious, you'll be curious, you're going to feel the happiness that's going to release and repeat it again.
Thank you.
Thank you.
How many would you spend on the skin?
How many dollars? A hundred dollars?
What about a million dollars?
It's probably not.
Well, how many would you spend on this house, or a very popular site on a website that's known to live a class?
In different points in time, boxes, grew up and socc.co.com, they've all been scared much more than they were equal.
Anyway, the price came up and then wrapped in an academic.
The economists call it a bubble.
So what's going on just with the bubble?
Well, let's start with the faces to understand a little bit more.
The 19th century, you've seen Netherlands into the Hollywood age.
By 1630, Amsterdam was an important, and the Center Center Center.
The Nigerian School will come in from Mexica in tremendous characteristics to put in the Europe.
So I'm going to join that phenomenon in rich rich, and we'll find their wealth in life in presidents are surrounded by flowers.
And there's been a very high privilege: the skin.
The time I came to Europe on a trade of trade that the Fego from the Middle East.
Because of that, he was looking at an ecotic frog that was also hard to grow, because it would take years to a single pain to wind.
Over the 1930s of the 1930s, the France of Los Angeles sold in the walls of villages in cities to be even more beautiful by the strengths in the fossil plans.
It was much more rare than the age of the age and the result, these farmers started to go, and their own, the popularity of the fingers.
It didn't take a lot of time until the sky became a national, and the skin is born.
Detroit was happening when it was in a restaurant with a lot of families to pay big money for something that was much lower value in terms of the letters.
A recent example of this is that the TV argument in the 1990s.
Social Egypt and magazines were like the skin in in the 18th century.
Everybody wanted them.
The more people wanted the faces, the price was going.
At some point, a single fingerprint is a lot of wealthy than the federal form of a daily worker.
In the policy market, the price of policy was based on the shape and the budget of the events.
The mystery prices have been used to go as it looks that a company is more successful in the future.
Research may be done so much more than the other, and it's going to have her price even more on the patient's budget.
The result of this can be a mobile feedback where the walls are going to go into the cat and eventually reduce the prices a lot of the intuitive value, what's produced.
Everything requires that the analogy is going to be proud of it, it's the collective understanding that the price of the second, or the sky, are much more on the value.
That's what happened with the two anonymous.
All of a sudden, the end of the conference.
The farmers were exposed to a big tree, and a cop!
The bubble was laughed, and the market is called.
Today, teachers work a lot and hard to predict what makes weight and how to avoid them.
The strength argument is an effective pattern of the basic principles that work in the morning and can help us understand the worse examples like the GDP of 2000.
The economy is going to continue to go through the states of bees and zero.
So while we're waiting for the next argument that will start, and the next one that you're going to get out, we'll get yourself in the fingerprint and understand the fact that you wouldn't have to pay so much for them.
What's this sound?
You're going to ask, the sound of the microbes is or the sound of a conventional notion or the sound of the foot that makes the cancer.
Really, with that, what's this sound?
I mean, why is your fingerprint in a certain way that makes them move like this?
Scientists have invented the number of explanations, including corporations that are rapidly moving, and in extreme cases, objects are made out of one another.
But the most common execution for the reason that you're going to hear is that you're going to hear like boundaries is, well, there's a bubble there.
Your fingers in your fingers are the most successful to move, but a lot of people are also populated between holes and roads, and in the road, and even eggs, the frog, the walls and so on.
All of these details are symbols, and they're the most exciting in the body.
The walls between the two objects are full of a prosthetic, a symbolic liquid, which is used for a long amount of risks, like the Italian and in China.
Syric liquid is less or less in the mirror of a protein in and its main goal is to make the bone and help them decide one on the other.
It's also concentrated stem cells to help clean all of their own lights and refugees that come to the park.
But the reason that it's important to move temperatures is that like other dinosaurs in the body, it contains a lot of death molecules.
Pacific judges know that to get the fingerprints, you're going to reduce the park beyond it usually comes by the flow of fingerprints back, for example.
When you're doing it, the bones are bad one of the other.
It's happening between the objects grew up, but the amount of the Chinese decline remains.
It's creating a low stress region that's driven from the Mexico's gene, just like a single fear of a secret that's happening out of a secret when you open the box.
Within the park, the walls of the walls are creating bubles and objects.
But the bubles don't stay a long time.
It's got around the blog that they're trying to end up.
The gas of the gas is reduced in the Chinese space and to look back to the walls back to the walls of 10 minutes, so you can take a little bit of time before you're able to jump it out of a feedback.
Some scientists think there's actually two actions.
One when the bubles are created, and two when they're spending.
Pacific is spread it at the same time, what you might explain is why they're reduced from the fingerprints of the fingerprint and the gas says that their arm causes their fingers to feel more free and faster.
But maybe you've heard a lot of worrying or a friend from a office office that a mirror is going to get you to the temperature.
A doctor named Dr. Dang Okkinger heard this as well.
So, it's going to reduce the arms of his mother, it's producing the left fingers for 50 years, while the right hand is not a coffee.
Three to 3,500 pounds later, the two guys were free of temperature.
On this unprecedented feeling of a lot of science, don't. Okay, Robert France France Foundation, a prosperity on the horse of the stimulus that's been reduced in the walls, but you're fascinated by science.
Okland wrote that his results need to start exploring the other theories, like the importance of a therapy.
The color friend still didn't decide about it.
Think about a temperature, one study showed that all of this fingerprint and a tremendous objects can make my hands into the wind and decide that empathy.
But it seems to be the greatest concept is to reduce the people around you.
The more we know, the mammogram has never been taken to the England of the Middle East, or the Detroit of Detroit, but it's done by struggling with forces between two degrees and a big collection of great characters with complex and complexity.
If it sounds familiar, it's because it's the terrible historical project as a war war that's used as a basis for a lot of the level of the plane games.
The worst of the real life of the war has come up by the death of the third earthquake in 1377.
The Bordan's sea's seat before his father, but we've built a bridge, Richard, who's going to take the wall before the three years ago in Edward's life.
This slide on the whole generation of the apartment is going to draw out between the different fingers, especially the Lankans, the fifth of the third guy's hand, and the fingers, the fingers of his fourth eye.
The name of the next violence comes from the symbol that's going to have for the two families, the white hand of New York and the red side of Antarcter.
The Lanthropologists were first in the village when Richard was killed by the fourth graph of the 139.
Despite the unprecedented instrument, the vaccine has remained to 142, when the death of the fourth Henry Bay's daughter's baby's baby's baby's baby's babies.
Social and scared by objects, the president who was trying to end up with a magazine from January to get a French support.
Mext was beautiful, invention, and there's a tremendous threat on the power, and she had an instrument in Richard, more than everyone.
The New York was the most close summer to you and NASA, but it's been pushing all the time by the Mexica, who've been looking at the worst documents on it, like the Dr. Teslan and School.
The New York City's crisis on their own action in the war in France has led to his legacy of the Minister and his daughter to Ireland.
Now, in the time, when you've been scared, and a service is scared by Mark and her husband and her husband made an unprecedented conference, and in the middle of the US, Richard France repeated with the military to stop the Southern and do a reform of the France.
At the beginning of no success, in the mirror got his opportunity when it's eight to the government after the Nigerian suffered objects.
However, less matter later, the presidents all of the soldiers and the platform that would turn it into the New York City.
New York City and again, the colors came in.
Even though it wasn't able to search directly the plane, he could return himself to the magazine and he would get his arms.
But instead of writing, the head of New York City is a decline after he was killed in the middle of the Minister.
We've built the city received the text to the wall and wrote as a fourth Iraq.
Edward has been done from a great park in the middle of the Los Angeles.
The Henry was born, while Mext Berket was trying to find out with a structure that was thought to the Egyptian, Edward Street.
But the new musician was doing a traumatic political mistake by reducing his president with the French French president to move the army to the state of a mirror from an extinction.
It's reduced his most powerful friends, the Dr. Morota.
And Volta was a friend to Antarcticals, made the city and the city of Edward School in India, and even succeeded to return the Henry for a short time, but it didn't go for a long time.
Edon't reimagine the component, you're going to go to Antarceller in the ground, and the president itself a little bit later.
The rest of the fourth Iraq was a project, but with his death in 1483, the tree of water went on.
Even though we've spent the years of 10 years, it's going to be supposed to wear it, the young father of Edward Richard's third apartment on our ancestors as not to have the secret president of his father.
He took the chimps on himself and reduced the kids to prison.
Although no one knows what happened to them finally, after a while, the presidents were born and the name of Richard looks safe.
But his party was only two years later beyond the sound of the English revolution.
Henry TV was a director of the first chair of Little's head, which would grow in the galls after his father's violence before.
With the concept of Richard's third Art that came out of Lug in New York City, the Henry was going to support his prosperity.
He's Gates in France, he'd pushed the 1485 and at the end of Richard's forces.
And by trying to civil civilization, the big sisters of the presidents, the next few recently remained the two hormones, and there's a coffee to the end of a few years of war.
We think a lot of historical warriors as motivated mortality with walls and refugees.
But the horrible war, like the power that they made, show us that the security can be safe, corruption is not stable, and even the power of water is scared like the skin.
If someone would ask you who was the rich person in history, who would you think?
Maybe about Benney Bennia or societies, like Bill Gates or Jersey Rakler.
What about the first African is the first ocean?
A trick from me in the 14th century to the camp, trying a Muslim, or from the Western, the Indian who probably did one of the most richest people who have ever lived.
But his great wealth was just one of his hair tradition.
When a Muslim came to a song in 1312, a lot of Europe had been driving and civil wars.
But a lot of African countries and the Islamic world that's left, and it's trying to play a big role in exhibition to explore its own economy.
By making a strategy of the city of Timbo, and the president of the city of Gabo, he was thrown up on the roof of of the states between the Middle East and the Western African, and the period of a period of spread, which is the genetic definition of the size of my left.
The theory of a planet from me was rich in the resources, like the same and the moon.
The world was first looking at the size of the size of a morning in 134-year-old when he did his foot for so much.
As one that doesn't go on a limb of limitation, he realized that he's going to go through the horizon.
His evidence about his journey is particularly based on different actions, so it's hard to put the horizontal details.
But what most of the agreement is the visual size of the journey.
Citian chicken chickens of tens of thousands of soldiers, citizens, and dozens, 500 metaphors are identified in the best, and a lot of ants and cases that are compared to me.
When a switch in cities like a community, he said that a Muslim is trying to invent huge types of identity, gave the eyes, a luck, and even a restaurant all over the way.
In fact, his chimps may be intervened by the Amazon economy, what made a primary intuition.
It turns out that the journey took more matter, and to try a recycled moral, stories about his wonderful wealth spread to the Middle East.
Mali and her daughter was almost pretty much invisible, which was conducted around their little telescope of 135.
One of the most important world of Europe's eye Europe, it's showed you an enormous gasm and a gold identity.
It's trying to prevent the government and its own decline on the map.
But Mr. Mary wasn't the only fish of the next.
Like my mother believe, he was particularly interested in his finger, which was already the center of learning and learning before the card.
However, he came back from the top to Google, he built the School of January with an analogy architecture.
It's also a critical university, which has reduced more of the city, and over learning and students from all over the Muslim world.
During the government's institution has become green, with schools and restaurants in high states.
His restaurant continued generations to the day, there's fabric, lions and restaurants that are going to be treated to this golden generation of Mali.
There's a common concept that if you're feeding your things in California, you're going to put on the hands of fabric, or you're planning the end of the last week, maybe you've got ODC.
Actually, OCD, which means a crazy, is a serious psychiatric situation that a lot of times isn't aware of the society and also by a great health health care.
So let's start by the system a few patterns.
One number of: repeated behavior or Tasmanian behavior is where it looks like OCD.
Like the name is offering, to a female president has two faces: the modern thought, death, or previous, accumulated, and the behavior of behavior that people work in order to be easy for the restaurant that the asteroids are caused.
The kind of activity that people often get from OCD, like a limited arm, or looking at things over and over and over again, maybe there's an optimistic examples or convenient that many of us exist every time.
But the disruption itself is much more rare and can be pretty good.
People who are active have a little bit of control if they're at all about their federal computers and female behaviors, which are used to take a lot of time and invest in their work, at school or social life to the point of significant pressure.
It's a set of security tricks is what represents people who suffer from OCD from those who may just be a little bit more aggressive or more academic in the age of age.
MS: The main symptoms of OCD is a limited decline.
Despite my hands is the most common picture of OCD in the popular culture, academic and capacity can wear many different forms.
Obvia can rain as fear of demand and disease and disease, tolerance in other people, or thinking of numbers, patterns, metaphor, or sexual identity.
And the creativity can move from a limited, or in restaurants, to a limited organization of objects, or to go in a fixed patterns.
MS: People with OCD doesn't understand that they're working in a sense of sense.
A lot of people with OCD actually understand the connection between the boundaries and their features very well.
They're not able to avoid these computers and actions even though they're aware of their idea is part of the reason for OCD is so crazy.
The roads from OCD is based on the emotion that will argue on the emotion of regret on the computers don't make sense and find it hard to control their responses.
So what's exactly the OCD?
The right answer is that we don't really know.
However, we've got some important lands.
OCD has been considered a biological disorder.
In other words, studies offer that the conventional forces from OCD is actually connected to be done in a certain way.
Scientists started three areas of the brain that are involved in a way that's changing social behavior and complex biological design, convenient movement, and emotional reactions.
The other version of the code is that OCD is a local OCD for the levels of Stotocin, Nigeria that's communicating between the brain's brains and help the political costs, like our wind condition, Ghana, control, decline, body temperature and body.
But is Stotocin and activity in these brain corporations from OCD or species of reasons in the basis of the reason.
We probably don't know until we have a much more intuitive understanding of the brain.
The good news is that there's effective treatments of OCD, including drugs, which reduce the concept of corporation in the brain by return to the brain cells, behavioral therapy causes their emotions, and in some cases, electricity therapy, or open electricity, as an OCD responds to other forms.
Your brain's familiar with you as unless you can predict his dots can be a mirror.
But with knowledge and understanding is the power to search for help, and the future experts can collect the answers that we're looking for.
In 1997, in a game between France of Brazil, a young Brazil called Robert Robert Council was used to be free from a 35 feet.
No direct direct to the river, Richard decided to try the impossible.
His fact that he sent the ball to a rapid beyond the players, but just before he got out of the long-term, he would go to the left and fell into the forest.
Before the first law of Nigerian, it's going to prevent it because it's speed up to the power of power on it.
When Charles looked at the ball, he gave him a direction and speed, but what power made a generation to the university and put one of the most beautiful cities in the history of the Street?
The trick was the boat.
Corus represents the eye in the bottom corner of the ball, and sent it high and right, but it also scared it around a crowd.
The ball started his partner in what looks like a bridge line, with a air flow from two studies and text it.
On the one hand, the air is moving in the direction of the planet, what makes a stress stress, while the other side, the air is moving in the same way as the boat, what's made a lower area.
This device made a generation to move into the lower stress region.
This phenomenon is called a genome effect.
This kind of problem, which is many times more about it as a bedroom, trying to expect, and it's one of the elements that make this beautiful game.
But I'm going to switch the ball with the device, so it's also going to switch around the walls and help into the forest it's hard.
It's too high and it's going to go over the forest.
It's too low and it's going to be in the ground before the reference.
It's too space and it's not going to go to the world.
It's not a lot of enough and the genes will make it.
It will be too early, or not at all.
And it's too fast and it's going to be too late.
It's the same physics that makes it possible for another impossible event, in a restaurant without aid.
It was the first effect of the President Einsteel Newton, after his son in his name was a Tennis game in 160s.
It's also there for the Golden Golden, a post of a page and a baseball.
Anyway, the same thing happens.
The ball turns out, it creates a disorder to treat the fingerprint of the air that's going to take it in the road direction.
And here's the question.
Could you be a theater for a powerful generation to make it fly like a song all the way back to you?
Unfortunately, no.
Even if the ball didn't get out of the prosperity, or you're looking at the sky, when the air is looking at it, the taste of the train was growing, what would make it released into smaller walls until at the end of the end it was made.
And just to get this cure, you had to make a generation faster than 15 times of the Amazonas's environment.
So in success with this.
Imagine a hundred people, everybody's perfect musicians, we're going to go by a metaphor.
There's no way to win, except one weird.
Each artist can go to a paper at night and ask to leave.
If it has green eyes.
It's going to release. If not, it's going to send into the river.
It turns out, every 100 musicians have green eyes, but they've been there since you've spent, and the smallpox that they can't discover their eyes.
There's no surface of light, all the water in the tools of atoms, and most importantly, they can't communicate with them and themselves.
Even though they see each other during the entire sea in the morning.
However, everybody knows that no one will be able to leave no security without success.
After a lot of strength of human rights rights, the dictionarization requires you to visit and talk to the musicians under the next conditions: you can only do one, and you can't give them any new information.
What can you say to release these muscles without getting the dirt of the dictator?
After you thought about it a long time, you tell the audience, "At least one of you have green eyes."
The cartoon that's been devastated, but it's dealing itself that your statement can't change anything.
You're waiting, and you'll see that life on the island is used as a usual.
But in the 19th century after your exploration, all the musicians were born, each one asked to leave at the night.
So how do you move on the motor?
It might help understand that the Amazons is an artificial musician.
Let's take a look at the things by imagine just two, architecture and Bill.
Everybody sees one person with green eyes, and as they know, it can be the only one.
The first night every one was left.
But when they see that every single one is still there in the morning, they get new information.
Asia brings out that if Bill saw an artist without green eyes for his night, there was the first night that the gravity could only treat it.
Bill between the same time on architecture.
The fact that the other person says to every artist that his eyes are green.
And in the other morning, they were both gone.
Now imagine a third artist.
Aria, Bill and Karl all sees two people with green eyes, but not sure if the other people also see two people with green eyes, or only one.
They're waiting for the first night to go like before, but in the next morning, they can't be safe.
Charl thinks, "If I have green eyes, Asia and Bill just look at each other, and now they're going to get a second night.
But when he sees both of them in the third morning, he realized that they were exposed.
Aria and Bill all went through the same process, and they all move at the third night.
It's used in the same intuitive intuition, we can see that the example of a region doesn't matter how many artists you add.
The key is the idea of a common knowledge, which is built by the philosophical David Los Angeles.
The new information wasn't all of your extinction itself, but to say it all together.
Now, except to know that less than one of them have green eyes, every artist knows that all the other people go after all the people with green eyes they can see, and each of them know it, and so on.
What every single trick doesn't know is if they're themselves from one of the green musicians that the other people are going to go back to their career until many degrees have gone as the number of musicians in the Amazon.
Of course, you could save 98 days on my mom if you told them that familiar with 99 of you have green eyes, but when the cartoon is involved, you're better with a solution I started.
It might look like the point of stop struggling with identity.
It looks like the device between stop to the point.
Maybe that's why we're using these philosophical signals like Kaki to the School.
We're focused on the right use of them.
In fact, it's the history of half that makes it so useful.
It's harder than a park, and it's less finished at the point.
It's from a place where they are, and for this reason, it has some specific and important task.
One of them, it can make ideas in the sentence that's already full of games.
"A stop: First of all, they might look scary, so, they're becoming artists, finally, you're going to find yourself in love with these fossil artists."
Even it's an exhibition between different parts of the sentence. It's easy to lose because of what's going to be there.
But then the point is stop coming into the success.
In additional details, it can operate more power power, you'll take the sentence to parts and judge the details that are working together.
The point of stop represents the things, but it's also about bees.
One more of his colleagues is to bridge between refugees.
It's the sentences that can stand up with themselves, but when they're connected at a stop point, they're looking better because they're replaced in some way.
"Turk's point was once a mystery for me.
I had no idea where to put them. "
Titchen, there's nothing wrong about it.
These two details can stand for themselves.
But imagine they're affecting a long list of other sentences, everyone at the same time, every single one is reduced at the point.
Things will become a very fast motor.
In this situation, a psychiatric point brings up and direction to the future by connecting connections.
But how much they're wearing, a stop point doesn't beat anywhere.
There are two main rules that control them.
First, it's if they're using violence, a psychiatric point has to be only connected to the details that's connected in some way.
You wouldn't use one here, for instance, "Scooking point was once a big remote for me, I really would like San San."
A point works here because two different ideas are completely different.
It's the work of a psychiatric point is to repeat two sentences of insects that can make them one company because they're looking at the same thing.
Second, you'll almost never find a psychiatric perspective before you're scared, the words, "and," but, "for," No, "or" or, "so," and yet. "
It's the place of stop, actually.
But the point of stop can replace a decade to make a sentence or to give it a little bit of direction.
Finally, the inevitably inevitable philosophy can give a speed of speech, power, and Stephen, they're all falling at the point and small line that just waves to be put in the right place.
Our ability to create and make economic growth is the model of our time.
Of course, there's also other challenges -- health, diseases and transparency, environmental challenges, and of course, extreme terrorism.
However, to the level that we can actually solve the economic growth challenge, it will take us a long way to solve the challenges that I've spent.
And more and more importantly, it's if we're going to make the economic growth and create economic growth from there and profit, we're not able to treat challenges that are inevitable and continue to spread in the world today, whether it's health, education or economic development.
The basic question is this: How are we going to create economic growth in progress and evolving like the United States and Europe while they continue to fight to create economic growth after the economic crisis?
They went on to do less than the map and see that you've been looking at the three main diverse of economic growth: House, work and French.
Obviously, these developing economies went to see the street and the argument, the decline and the quality of the quality and the amount of work and the amount of work and they also bring the creative creativity.
Like, how are we going to create economic growth in the market markets, where 90 percent of the world's population and where on average, 70 percent of the population is under 25?
In these countries, it's the expansion that they're going to grow at seven percent per year to move a little bit in the sky and reduce the income to a person in one generation.
And yet today, the largest economies -- countries with at least 50 million people -- continue to struggle to get the end of seven percent.
It's worse, countries like India, Russia, South Africa, Brazil and even China's under seven percent and many cases, in fact in Germany.
Olympic growth changes.
With economic growth, countries and companies go into a moral Google of a movement, an opportunity and text remains.
Without growth, countries are going to go and convenience, not just one year of economic statistics but also in the jobs of life and how life is.
Olympic growth changes very much to people.
If the growth is funded, the risk of human progress and the risk of political strength and social strength goes, and the companies become more important, reducing and small.
The context changes.
And from markets in markets don't need to grow in the same short as developing countries.
Now, I know some of you in the room see it as a very dangerous girl.
There's a couple of people here who've been going to go around and take by what's going on in the world around us and basically they're going to take it into economic growth.
You're worried about the old population on the planet.
And when you look at statistics and the last aspects of the United Nations that in the world will be 11 billion people on the planet before it's going to be at 2100, and you're worried about what it does for natural resources -- earth, water's fabric, energy and feedback.
You're also worried about the reduction of the environment.
And you're worried about how the human beings, from the reference of global corporations, it's going to be so dead and extended.
But I'm here to tell you today that economic growth was the definition of change in the standard of millions of people around the world.
And more importantly, it's not just economic growth that's been affected by capitalism.
The definition of capitalism, in the simplicity, is that the causes of manufacturing, like trade and industry and work, remains in the hands of the private sector and not in the state.
It's really the advantage that's in fact, the crisis is not for economic growth in the economy but what's happening to capitalism.
And why we need to create economic growth in the long term, we're going to have to look back with a better form of economics.
Olympic growth needs capitalism, but it needs to work true.
And as I mentioned a moment ago, the night of the digital system was limited by private players.
And even that, with that, it's a very sophisticated chemistry.
Calism: Well, not capitalism: bad.
As a physical experience, capitalism is much more South.
And we have countries like China, which is more digital capitalism, and we have countries like the United States that have more market capitalism.
Our effort to visit the physical system with that, we're going to focus on countries like China, which is actually not a market capitalism.
However, there's a personal reason and worry about us to close our attention on more general forms of capitalism, especially these are golden in the United States.
It's very important because it's a kind of capitalism that's going to itself more and more importantly that it's now conducting corruption and worse, it's increasing inequality in income -- and the idea that the extension is reduced on a lot.
Two of the really critical questions we need to deal with is how to fix capitalism so that it can help define economic growth but at the same time to help treat social health.
To think about this framework, we need to ask ourselves, how does the capitalism work today?
It's very simple, intelligent capitalism is based on the principles of human costs -- a human because it's coming after what it's or it wants.
And just after they're focusing on their effects, they decide so that it's important to provide other social implications.
Of course, in this method of governments, and they're using some of their experiences for social programs, and they're conducted in the fact that the role of government is not just emotion but to be the component of social creatures.
But yet, this infrastructure -- these two components -- is the basis of it we have to start thinking about how we can improve the digital model.
I would argue that there were two right to this challenge.
First of all, we can get the right patterns to see what can be useful for us to think about how we can improve capitalism.
Second, policy that's designed to be focused on things like the modern society where we pay and reduce people on the things that we actually thought can help define economic growth.
For instance, send children to school, parents could make money on it, or to put their kids, parents could get peace on it.
Now, pretty much in France, if we need to pay people or not to do what we think they need to do in any way, the fact is that peace for actions actually brought some positive results in places like Mexico, in Brazil and also in New York programs.
But there's also significant and significant changes in the way in politics that's built.
The arguments that governments need to expand their responsibility and their responsibility so that it won't be limited and that governments need to be much more sophisticated as active as the factors of production become objects with China's success.
But we also started to have arguments about how the role of the private sector has to move away from being just a quarter of profit and actually be more involved in social programs.
Things like social responsibility programs of corporations, even though they're at a small scale, they're moving in the right direction.
Obviously, politics is built to the left the lines between government, organizations without profit and private sector.
Two very good examples of this are the United States of the 19th century, when the infrastructure was really in the periods of public and private.
And more recently, of course, the progress of the Internet has also been proved to the world that public and private can work together for society.
My basic message to you is this: We can't continue to try and reduce the global economy ethical ethical and iopologists without need.
In order to create economic growth and transformation and transform social challenges and social challenges that are going to reduce the world today, we're going to have to think more about what might work.
In the end, we need to know this that Italian is the ecology of growth.
Thank you.
Thank you to ask you a number of questions, Derek, because you can respond to your last sentence is also an atheist, it's possible to be an ecology of our time.
What do you say to those who come in this way?
BG: Well, I think it's a completely special, and I think we've already got this idea.
There's a lot of work that's going on around happiness and other values are used to be used for people's success and birds in a standard of genes.
And so I think we need to be open to what can provide birds in people's genes and continue to regenerate poverty around the world.
But the only way it's going to happen without conducting the capacity of the Earth, take us on a long journey, it's that economic growth somehow reduce the basic use of resources.
Do you see it happening?
DM: Well, I think I'm more optimistic about the capacity and human invention.
I think that if we start to define ourselves to use the fabric resources and the features that we know today, we can be quite negative and care about the way the world's going to be.
However, we've seen the concept of Rome, we've seen the presidents that the world's father's father's father's father's damage, and it's not to argue that these things are wrong.
But I think, with the invention of the invention we can see, I think we can reinvent energy, so we can actually get better results.
And so in this sense, I'm much more optimistic about what people can do.
BG: What's interesting to me about the success of growth and take a different way is that you actually offer the capitalism with more capitalism -- in the heart of a good price on a better behavior or develop a better role for social issues.
This is what do you offer?
DM: I offer we need to be open.
I think it's completely the case that matters of economic growth doesn't work in the way we want them to work.
And I think it's not a case that today for the largest economy in the world, the United States, there's democracy, public democracy, as its basic political media and it's a free economic economy -- to learning that it's free -- a free market in its economy.
The second economy in the body is China.
There's a physical economy and it's got policy capitalism, which is a completely different model.
These two countries, completely different political models and completely different economic models, and they still have the same income income income income income income income income.
I think the great question that we need to have, because it's not clear at all what a model we need to courage, and I think it should be much more comfortable and much more comfortable about what we know and what we don't know.
BG: Second question. The CO21 is going on in France.
If you can send a tree to all of the states and the emotional, what would you say?
DM: Again, I would offer a lot more vulnerability.
Like you're aware, the subject around the environmentalists were on the Janada many times now -- in the coffee, 72 in the room -- and we're going to go back to these issues in particular because there's actually no basic conference, there's actually some of what the developing countries believe and what's equal markets
The markets of markets have to continue to create economic growth so we don't have political and political security in these countries.
CO2 countries know that they have real responsibility and answer not only to manage their CO2 and some of the revenue that they're doing in the world, but they're also about policies in research and development.
And so they also need to get to the table.
But basically, it can't be a situation where we're starting with policy policy to markets without the developing countries are also going to deal with what they're doing also on the device and also on the side of the markets.
BG: Derek, thank you at TED.
DM: Thank you very much.
We hear about categories all the time.
How many theories have this issue?
How much do we survive in 100 crops in the road, or a long-term space, or in a fingerprinting?
But what is a really, and how many of them do we really need?
Tories are a way to track the energy button of the body.
A healthcare happens when we consume about the same amount that we consume.
If we consume more energy than we're surviving, we're going to collect a magazine in our body's body's body, and it's going to get weight.
If we take more energy than we consume, we will lose weight.
So we need to be able to measure the energy that we consume and use, and we do it with a single one called Syria.
One theory, the kind of thing that's been focused on the food, is also called Korea, is limited as the amount of energy that takes to move the temperature of one kilometer of water in a single finger.
Everything we consume has agriculture, how much energy is in the chemical skill.
In the average page, there's 272 categories, there's about 78 categories in fight, and you're going to have about 52 categories.
This energy is released during the capacity, and we're going to get in other molecules that can be able to provide energy when the body needs it.
It's in using three generations: about 10 percent of a total chain, about 20 percent of the physical activity, and the big part, about 70 percent, a fundamental action of the men and our diversity.
The third use is coming up with your fabric rate, a number of categories that you need to survive if you don't care or their own.
There's a couple of geographic activities, and you're going to come to the regulation of the average human categories need every day: 2000 to women and 2,500 men.
These consumers are based on causes like average weight, chemical activity and muscles.
So does it mean that everyone needs to take about 2000 categories?
Not necessarily.
If you're doing energy activity, like a bicycle in a safe horse, your body can take up to 900,000 categories a day.
The range requires a little bit more sophisticated theory, and adult people have usually a lower level, the energy is released to a more, so it takes less.
Here's something else you need to know before you start to improve agriculture.
The categories of products affect how much energy you know, not how many theories you can get from it.
I've been a musician like my grandfather and a regulation needs more energy in the eye, so you actually get less energy than a hundred categories of a 100 categories of Chile.
I don't talk about the fact that some tools offer materials like proteins and techniques, while other numbers are much less valuable.
A lot of these cases can leave you with a weight and get a coffee.
And even with the same food exactly, different people may not get the same number of theories.
Scientists of things like entrepreneurs, in Kenya, and even the need to say that the capacity of every person's capacity is a little bit different.
So Syria is a useful energy, but to figure out exactly how many of us should be thinking about things like the transparency, a kind of food, and our ability to work energy.
It's succeeding to find all of this on the health care.
When we're talking about English, we're often talking about a single language, but what's a common one that's speaking about countries around the world, or to the components of Chile?
And how do all of these communicate to the recycled words?
The answer is that, as most of the languages, English has evolved through generations of things, which are big change during the time.
But by making these changes, we can track this language from the time back to its future senses.
While a modern English, you've got a lot of similar words with privacy languages, like French and Second, most of these words were not in a part of it.
Instead, they started to go to the language with the Henry French to England at 10 to 66.
When the French Indian bears the England and went to the School, they brought the language with them, and they put big characters out of the French and French words to the English language that was in the past.
Today, we call this language of ancient English.
It's the language of Babylin.
It probably doesn't look very familiar, but it might be more familiar if you know a little German.
It's because the ancient English bees to the German transformation, which was first of the British health in the five and six by the anthropologists, the sacrists and the Turkey.
The German test they've talked to become anthropologic.
Polines and Kenyan in eight to 11, have been reduced more ancient questions for most.
It may be hard to see the sensors of modern English under all the words of music from the French, the ancient, the future and other languages.
But in the years of inequality can help us by code in buildings, examples of sound change, and it's created basic words.
For example, after the 20th century, microbial words that started in "", "went to the Scott" while the Mexico "in the ancient Uganda, they've learned about" without change.
In another crowd, words that they had a sound of "Sweden" in Sweden, "evolved to the sound of" in English.
There's still a few words in English with, "Scott" like "and" "" and "" but they're the questions directly directly from the transformation that came after "D.C."
These examples show us that it's just like the different extinctions that's produced in Titan, English, German, and a lot of other languages that's produced in the same peak that's been known as a protography in the world 500 years ago.
Because these historical languages have never been written, we can repeat just by the inequations of the fabric, which is what they're going to predict to the evidence of change.
We can even use the same process to go back to another step, and track the source of protography to the language called an intuitive prosthetic, which was a 600,000 years ago on the Okraine in the Ukraine in the Ukraine of today.
It's the repeat of the Industrial family that's almost all the languages that have been visited in Europe, like parts of South Asia and Western Asia.
And although it requires a little bit more work, we can find those statistics, or decades, between words are related with intuition -- different doctors.
Basically, in English, we see, in English, there's "in places in Titan there's" and "" and "and" is "instead of a bionic," at the beginning of a word.
How many of the most famous rules of the Indian tools, French and the Central language is in what now it's in UK.
Social Professor itself's found in a even more ancient language, but unfortunately, it's the worst that the history of histories and the ecological will give us to.
A lot of mystery remained out of the long-term term, as if there might be a relationship between Indian and other languages, and the nature of the extinctions in Europe before its movement.
But the amazing fact that there's just three billion people around the world, many of them can't understand each other, still talk the same words that's done by 6,000 years of history.
Did someone ever tell you, "You're going to be happy!"
Or are you going to be reduced in the back of the food table?
It's like these may be producing but they're not wrong.
Your piece, the way you're looking at your body when you're sitting, it's the basis for any movement that your body is doing, and you can tell how good your body's going to fit itself.
These objects can be things like the president of weight, or thinking in a strange brain.
And the big one we all experience every day is a road.
If your piece isn't optimistic, your muscles need to work harder to keep you safe and happy.
Some muscles will become accurate and not funny.
Others will get rid.
Over time, these unactivity will come up with your body's ability to deal with the forces that work on.
It's a bad statement that's based on your insects and the mistakes, revealing the risks of actions, and it's made some organs, like the lung, at least effective.
Scientists took a bad station to the end, to the mayor of the war, and my father died, even though it's not the only reason for them.
It can even affect your emotional situation and feelings to the pain.
So there's a lot of reasons for a good public.
But it's done harder in these days.
Technology's strange for a long time you can make a bad piece, and you're also using computers or mobile devices, you'll hear you look down.
A lot of studies offer, on average, the creative is done worse.
So what does a good piece look like?
When you look at the spinal cord of the front or behind, all 33 pounds need to show a bridge.
On the side, the spinal side has to be in three places: one in the top, one in the walls, and one in the bottom.
You're not born with a spinal cord in this form.
In the definition of babies, there's only one link like Chile.
The other places are usually developing at age 12 to 18 months when the muscles are powerful.
These places help us stay fossil and push some of the stress of costs like the walls and coffee.
If they're true, when you're going to be able to transform a bridge from a point before your walls, don't behind your hand, to the level of your kitchen, to a few centimeters before the trade.
It's about the center of your device directly directly over your 3D basis, which allows you to avoid activity with the smallest amount of interest and courage to muscles.
If you're sitting, your poet has to be anonymous, it doesn't move forward.
Your walls need to be medical with the arms often to the body.
The roads need to be a traffic device with the emotions of the floor on the floor.
But they're if your piece isn't good?
Let's redesign the environment.
We've done the screen so it's in front or a little bit under the eyes.
You've been worried that all of your body is, like the French and the French and the hands of your hands, using organisms if you need.
Turn to sleep on the side with the wall gave you and with a card between my legs.
It's been shocked with very, very good and good at the web, and it's used to have a telephone conversation.
It's also not enough you're going to be just a good piece.
It's about the muscles and the rules in the motion is very important.
In fact, to be a long time with the right station can be worse with a bad station.
When you move, you're in a few.
It's all that you're talking about is close to the body.
You need to be in a moment with the wheel and the subject in the metaphor.
If you're sitting in a lot of cases, you're going to get out of it.
It's used that muscles will be powerful enough to support you effective, and beyond all the other benefits of your insects, your brain and attention.
And if you're really worrying, you're going to have a physical physical, because yes, you really need to stand right.
The forest in the night, my grandfather told me about the Spanish France of France.
Atlanka, the Institute of Indonesia was listened and killed.
His Fazo and his chimps went and sold, and their fabric story came to the office and their community came to the office and in their fingers in new parts of books, noises to identify and community.
They'd go into the cities and ask the intuition, "Where is there another civilization that we can buy?
"And it's not about the sense of their own sense, they told them," Go to Amazon.
You'll find all the gold you want.
In fact, there's a city called Italian -- don't require in Spanish -- that's all identified. "
The books came out to the way into the jungle, but the details that came back with stories, stories about powerful, on boundaries with fossil trees, on trees that are so high that they've lost the sun, the roads that eat birds, they're going to get rid of men and they've seen.
All that became a child memory.
And years went.
I'm working on my Ph.M.'s work in SMS, trying to figure out the physical energy of Fambo, when I remember this country, and I started asking this question.
Could it be that the dead is there?
I asked colleagues from university, the government, companies who are happy, gas, and the answer was one, no.
And it makes sense.
Look, regulations exist in the world, but they're usually connected with a road.
You need a strong heat to create a very powerful phenomenon.
And as you can see from the red dots here, that they're glad, we don't have an Amazon in the Amazon, not in the House of France.
So from here, we don't have to see a blind river.
When I told the same story in a family dinner, I talked to me, "But not, Andrew, I was there. I was sitting in the river."
It's when Derek jumped.
"No, Andrew, she doesn't laugh.
Look, you can just forget it just after a very sick, and it's fair by Man itself.
You know, a company of his wife. "

But then...
I've heard something, a space that you've got and a more and more and more than we've read.
It sounds like the ocean falls all the time, and when we looked at, I saw a wall, a cow, it's going to go through the trees.
And then, I saw it.
I've always taken my metaphor, and the product temperatures in the river were 86 degrees of scans.
It's not exactly a hundred degrees of a conversation, but it's certainly enough.
The river is hot and fast.
I've been followed by the river and unfortunately by, sending the question to the most exciting place on the river.
And that's what's wearing -- it starts as a morning.
And here, in this website, it's at the beginning of the atmosphere if the water, you're going to have a giant smoke that's going to flow water and studies.
And that's where we're finding a hot, engaged with who's going to fit under its corporations.
The next day in the morning, I woke up -- Laughter) I asked her.
Let me tell me a book, a girl and yes, they got to the river.
I've invented the water would exist and join, which is a little bit strange for signal systems.
What was amazing is that the sky always knew about this place, and for me, you wouldn't be the first one I saw it.
It was just a part of their daily life.
They share his water.
They're driving his arms.
They're scared with him, they're dealing with it, they even know their drugs with it.
I met the left, and he looks like the lesson of the river and his jungle.
He asked me to code and listening to attention.
And then, unfortunately, my extension -- I started, if it's about being a dead with you -- a beef started to go through it and it just laughed.
And I got the left knee to explore the river, in a condition that was going to take the water patterns and look at them in my lab, anywhere in the world, which would reduce the water back to the ground so, as the Man said, the water can find your way back home.
I went back every year since that first morning in 2011, and the surface work was from being scared, content and sometimes dangerous.
One story even as a conference in Nigerian Jakographic.
I've been on a little bit of a little bit of a piece of paper in Sweden and Canada, between 80 degrees of Cyrus and a coal that looks like this, close to a conversation.
And another thing about this, it was the rainforest of the Amazon.
There's a chicken, I couldn't see anything.
The temperature became everything to white, it was wearing.
Gennesia.
Now, after years of work, I'm going to be asked most of the academic studies and my geography to the prison.
And I want to share, today, with you all here, on the TED TED, for the first time, some of these images.
Well, first thing, it's not the way.
Fake!
So when I started the research, the satellite picture was in a low evolution to have meaning.
There were just no good actions.
It's about the support of a Google team on Earth, now I have this.
Just that, the House of the river, who's an astronomer, who's called "Turkey with the sun's name," means that I'm not the first one who's wondering why the river and the humanity is always going to explain the world around us.
So why is the river and forget?

It's the opposite of extinctions.
As you get a hot person through our Indians and our farmers, it's also going to the ground there's water that's moving through the cards and her friends.
Instead of these games are going to the surface, these soap walls, we're going to have a signal effect: ridiculous patterns, strength and in our case, the river river.
What's really awesome is the scale of this place.
So for the next time when you push the road, think about it.
The river is spread more than a second spider, you're going to go through most of his kitchen.
It's falling through 6.7 miles.
It's really exciting.
There's a larger cultural health than this TED TED, and this patient you see there is at six feet -- and all of them are close to a conversation.
We've invented the temperature over the river, and it's been very much the most successful part of the surface.
And the results were just amazing.
Sorry, the mammoth scientists come out.
And it showed this amazing gene.
You see, the river begins a morning.
And then he's dying, he's dying again, he's coming back, he's getting back to the bed, and he's got a beautiful, until he's going to do this river.
Now, I understand that you're not all of you who're all very proud scientists, so if you describe it in daily terms: everybody likes coffee.
Yes? Well.
Your normal coffee, 54 degrees of gallas, especially, well, 60.
So, in a coffee way, the river river is going to do this.
There you have your red box.
Here you've got your hot floor, and you can see that there's some point where the river is still hot than the atmosphere.
And it's a temperature from products.
We took them in the shape to ensure temperatures are the most popular signals.
But there's a number of magic that doesn't expect, and this book is 47 degrees of gas, because it's where things start to fail, and I know it's a very personal experience.
Over this temperature, you don't want to go into these water.
You need to be old.
It could be a tool.
I've seen all kinds of animals in the face, and what's left with me, is that the process is less or more identical.
So they're treated in and the first thing that's missing is the eyes.
Your eyes, probably, they're very fast. They're going to become this bone.
It's the one of them.
They're trying to switch out, but their bridge comes out of the bone because it's so hot.
So they lose power, they lose power, until eventually they come to a point where water comes into their corporations and they're looking at faces.
[] A little Science, not that?
Go.
They left them in Mandandanda a a little bit more.
What's again, amazing is these temperatures.
They're pretty similar to the things I've seen in the fabric all over the world and even a writer, there's a rock like Washington.
But here's the data that's shown that there's no transformation in the industrial activity.
It's not a metaphor or and I'm in the crisis, and again, over 700 kilometers from the Kenyan Central Central.
How can the river expect to exist like this?
And I asked expertise and Vanologists for years, and I still couldn't find another unusual and a green system.
It's unique.
It's special about global scale.
So, still -- how does it work?
Where do we get this stuff?
There's still a study to do more about the problem and understand better the method, but what the data tells us now, it's a result of a big modern system.
Actually, it works like this: So, as you're going to go into the ground is more hot.
We're focusing on it as a modern restaurant.
The water could get out of the rules like the ice in England, and then you get deep into the ground and you go out to create the river river.
Now we've found that in the river and around it -- it's working with my colleagues from the NASA, Dr. Teszler and Street, and Dr. John Iren Egyptian Egyptian in California -- we've made genetic forms of magazines that live in the river and around the river, and
But again, despite all of these studies, all of these refugees and hormones, asked a question: What does the river mean?
What does this mean of a mobile cloud that's always spending on this part of the jungle?
And what does it mean by a child's president?
Man and his daughter, it's a sick site.
For me as a neuroscientist, it's a unique mystery phenomenon.
But for inevitable, unusual and unfortunately, it's just another pain to win.
And for the project, it's just another summer of an unlimited country that's known to open.
My goal is to make sure that control in this country will understand their unique and meaning of the river.
Because it's one question of meaning.
And that's where it's, we're making meaning.
This is us. We have this power.
We're the ones we're taking the line between the New York Talk.
And in this age, in which it seems to be the whole map, we're going to learn and learn, in this age of information, I'm reminded to all of you who're not just curious in the black hole of unknown, but within the white noise of amazing data.
It's so much to explore.
We live in an amazing world.
So.
There were curiosity.
Because we're living in a world where you're still connected to the streets of the jungle, where we're reduced and where you're going to have a life.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Throughout the human history, three small words that were sent to the shoots, the philosophers to the back, and you're looking for the climate: "Who am I?"
The ancient Greek Ethiopia wrote about a month, "You know yourself," to the House of the United States, "who are you?"
Pophilists, psychologists, academic, scientists, artists and politicians all deal with the subject of identity.
They're very different, very unfortunately, they're a significant chimpanzee.
These are smart and creative people, so what's so hard to get to the right answer?
One challenge is certainly in the complex ideas of identity.
What are you who?
The person you are today?
Five years ago?
Who would be 50 years?
And I said, "There is?"
The week?
Today?
The hell?
The second one?
And what about your collection is "I am?"
Are you your physical body?
Your computers and feelings?
Your actions?
These poor water's water of a complicated component for Netroit, so it's probably going to show the complexity of complexity, the ancient Greek Turkey School used a bird on a tumor.
How are you, "I?"
Like the story is going, throw out, the biological and you're going to be an artist, and you're going to take a little bit of the motorious virus, so it's repeated home in San.
In order to explore the Israeli woman, over 1,000 years of Israela would reduce his conference in Henry, and every year repeated the journey.
Every time a part of the boat is wearing or right, it's been scared in a part of the same material until, at some point, there's no other part of it.
Palttto notice that the prosthetic of Paul was an example of the philosophical corporation that was based around the magic of identity.
How can every part of something be transparency, and still stay the same thing?
Let's imagine that there's two customers: the argument that you're going to have a gene in the Amazon, a boat, and the argument that's changed the journalists 1,000 years later, a boat.
In the simplicity, our question is, "Is it equally equal?"
Some will say that over 1,000 years was just one boat of Paus, and because the changes that were done in the dramatic way, there's never been a point in the time it's stop to be the Amazon.
Even though Mary has no common part, the two protests identify a number of numbers, which means they identify, then GDP is equal.
However, other people would argue that you'd have never been through the jungle, and his press on the prosthetic is an artificial neighborhood of a fabric.
It can't survive in the studio.
So, despite the two identities of numbers, they're not an artificial identity.
So, Al doesn't equate to the United States.
But what happens when you think about this theater?
What if, when every piece of the perfect corner, someone collected all of them, and rebuild the original corporation?
When she's a teacher, there's no doubt that two physicians will be there: it's a stroke in the Amazon, and it's a piece of someone.
Every one can argue to the description, "The San of Paus," but only one can actually be the real thing.
So what is it, and more important, how is it about you?
Like the president of Pius, you're a collection of parts change all the time: your physical body, the consciousness, the reasons, the reasons, and even the strange things in you, you're always changing, but still in a amazing way, you're not going to stay the same thing.
This is one of the reasons the question, "Who am I?"
It's so complicated. And to answer it, like so many big brains to you, you have to be ready to be ready for the French ocean of the philosophical cortex.
Or maybe you can just answer, "I think I'm a pretty powerful hero in an effective journey."
It can also work.
What's common to Charles Darwin, Michael Jordan, and David?
They're, like a lot of history and evidence, curiosity, some cases for a choice.
For hundreds of years, a mammogram was a symbol for the budget, but although, a lot of people who have still wanted that they would come back.
Scientists spend a lot of time, "Why are some people lose their interest, and how can we bring it back?"
The forest that we've got about 100,000 to 150,000 jobs on the ice, and scientists have discovered two things about this discovery.
First of all, the current hair that we're seeing is mostly complicated, the lower protein comes up to the top when new cells grow up.
Second, the structures that are extended from the forest rainforest, the network of complex organisms that are born before we're born, and grow a forest in the region.
This next day, there's three lessons.
The first one is Angela, the definition process, that's 90-percent of the insects now, what makes them push up the forest at a month.
Genn can go over two years to seven, depends on your genes.
After this typical period, signals in the skin from the skin to a few pounds to get into a new step that's known as a cartoon, or the kind of point, what causes the walls to win the forest to get out of their original need.
A cartoon was going on about two weeks to three and pull the blood flow into the walls, what's coming out of the forest, which means it's ready for a decade.
Finally, the forest goes into the kitchen, the moon that's going to go for 10 to 10 weeks, and it's going on about 515 percent of your boss coffee.
While Mexico, until 200 jobs can go every day, which is pretty normal.
So, the gender cycle starts again.
But it's not all the worthy that eyes, and in fact, some of them are pretty good at the time in response to fossil changes.
95 percent of the curiosity in the men can be crazy to get ridiculous.
The curiosity is legislation, and people with this situation, the fingers become the most important to the effects of Detrota, which is a horrible product that's created from a statistics.
DHIT makes sense in particular, what makes the hair to produce and make a more powerful.
But the test isn't surprised.
He's going to happen in the top, by talking about a terrible diet, which is described in the forest of the forest.
First of all, the forest is kind of bounced, so the forest on the code starts to click in English.
In the highest stadium on the horse, these curious corporations get rid and dramatically, finally, only a fifth of the forest of the forest around the fire and my head.
The genetics is not everything that's pushed in the forest.
A long period of pressure can release signals that are designed to market and make them go into a very early situation.
How many women get it after night.
Flasks can also lose the ability to go to the gene, the rapid period.
People who die of chemistry experience it at the same time.
But while the curiosity looks permanent, a scientist's scientist changed the opposite.
Under the skin before the skin, the sensors that grow the forest actually stay in life.
In using this information, scientists have developed a drug that's taken the conventional period, and it's caused to go to a genome.
Otherwise drugs have been treated by the decline of the DIT's crisis so that it's not going to affect these emotional fingers.
Cyrus cells play a role in a regular cortex, and so scientists have studies if they can change these cells's activity in order to encourage them to create a forest again.
And then, while scientists spend their hair, everyone who's known, or think about curiosity, can remember they're in a good society.
It's in the river of the river, maybe not the best idea.
Social task with the skull symbol just to see what it's doing is probably not the most sophisticated, but now it's not the time for refugees because you need to wind out of these elements faster.
With you, it's the list, the lab is repeated, and the French professor.
You have a solution I started, but there's just one way of security: over a old bridge that's open over a huge tree.
You can run out of a minute, while the lab is going to take two minutes.
It's a little bit more sophisticated and you need five minutes, and the professor has to have 10 minutes, when it's waiting for the walls every step.
By the professor of the professor, the guns took you in just 17 minutes, so you just have this time to get all of them and look at the roads.
Unfortunately, the bridge can only keep two people in a moment.
In order to remove the buildings, it's so important you can see, and the future that you're in a way that you're just a small region.
Can you think about a way that everyone will take time?
Remember: You can't be more than two people to be on the bridge at the same time, anybody who has to reduce the third or be a girl, and every one of you can wait in any side of the finger.
And most importantly, they all need to go through a conversation before the magazines come.
Otherwise, the first partner can move on the bridge when people still have.
Finally, there's no tricks to use them here.
You can't go down to the other side, use the brilliant bridge, or connect with the back.
Remember the video now if you want to solve it yourself!
While answer: Three answers in time: 2 answer in the beginning: 1 looks like what you don't do, you're always missing you a minute or two, but there's a way.
The key is to reduce the time that's been scared by the two more artificial people by doing that they're going to take together.
And because you have to do some repeat with the six, you want the most powerful people to do it.
So, you're and you're going to return the lab rapidly with the third, although you need to slow a little bit to get its rate.
After two minutes, you've gone, and you're the most faster, you're going to go back with the door.
Just three minutes went.
It's all good.
Now there's the hard part.
The professor and the service takes the prosthetic and go together.
It takes 10 minutes from the other hand, you need to slow for the device that's going to continue to the left that he probably didn't have to give up an interview.
By the time they go, there's only four minutes, and you're still time on the wrong side of the bridge.
But remember, the lab goes on the other side, and it's the most fastest one in the group.
So she takes the prosperity of the professor and wanted back to you.
Now with just two minutes that are born, two of you do the last.
When you take on the other end of the finger, you're pushing the roads and we're going to move the bridge behind you, just the last moment.
Maybe in the next summer, you're going to ask in Syria.
You may have never heard of Kenya, Shakin in or long, Nigeria.
But I know them as the most extraordinary places on the planet.
In the hospital there, there's a community of sisters, doctors and scientists who are going to be on one of the smallest organisms for humanity for years: Vius.
And Vius is very similar to Abola.
It can make a particularly high and be able to travel in the cases.
But these people, agree their lives on a daily basis to protect people in their communities, and in their partner, to protect us all.
But one of the most extraordinary things that I've discovered about in one of my first visitors there a lot of years ago that they start every morning -- the challenges, these unbelievable days in the front -- in a choice.
They're collecting together, and you're showing you that you've got.
You're showing the coal.
And for the next few years, another year when I read them or they come up with me, I'm going to collect and listen to them and we're writing, because it's reminded us that we're not just there for a common scientific research, but we're interested in a common human way.
And of course, you're probably imagine, it's going to become an enormous important important, and there's no evidence, when things start to change.
And things really changed very, in 2014, when the Ebola Francisco was in Nigeria.
It's the first discovery in the Western Africa, at the top of the Minister's Center and Britain.
And it was scary, scary for all of us.
We've actually been afraid for a while that's going to be more common than thought until then, and we thought one day would be going to get to the nest.
And so my friends in my team came out right and joined the Ray House and his team there, and we started a stream team in the eye that could do sensitive molecules to pollinate House Hollywood in the case to go into the forest of the US.
We've already been asked in a kind of kind of team to identify and virus on, we knew how to do it, it's an extraordinary team.
We just had to provide them the tools and the place to explore Ebola.
And most of the forest, this day came.
In the 23 in 2014, a woman in the hospital in the hospital's hospital, and the team revealed these very important regulations and selected the first case of Ebola in China.
There's been an extraordinary job.
They've been able to look at the case in a way, to take the previous conversations for a patient's treatment and start to do these aspects in the moment with the patient to understand the same problem.
It could prevent spread.
But before let's go of this day, the discovery has already been at the moment, for months.
With hundreds of studies, it's already the possibility of preparation.
And it's going to finish to a nation not as a single case, but as an artificial Google.
We had to work with the international community, with the healthcare office, with Canada, to start to deal with cases, when the next week came 31, and then 97 cases -- everybody came to the Nigeria, one of the other places in China who was trying to deal with this scale.
And we've been working around the argument to do anything that we can try and help people, and we're trying to save attention, but we've also done one more simple thing.
So, from this field that's taken from the patient's patient's patient's fingerprint -- of course, it's going to be reduced.
But you can also do something else, we're going to join with chemicals, and then just put it in a box and put it into the ocean, and that's what we did.
We sent it to Boston, where my team works.
And also my team worked around the argument in a job, despite a day, and we created 99 different genes of Darwin.
It's the Amazon program -- the genome of the virus is the Amazon program.
We all have this program.
It's about what we're complex and it gives us a lot of information.
The results of this kind of work are simple and powerful.
We'll actually take these 99 different types of neurons, look at them and their actions in them, and the reality, compared to other genes that have been published in the past, that the Francisco started in the age of months before -- with a single case of the virus in human body, and it's gone from the person.
And it's an enormous thing when you try to understand how to get, but it's also important to find those who are in a moment with patients.
We could also see that when the virus was moving from the person to the person, it went through a motion.
And all of these models are so important, because the Iraq, the hormones, the treatments that we're based on, they're all based on the genome, in the basis -- that's what's going to put them.
And so the world's death has to respond to the action, to get themselves, and reduce everything they do.
But the way it works in the science world, the situation I was at this point is, I had the data, and I could work in many months, to open the data at the speed of speech, in privacy, respond to the research to the privacy, to do the previous babies, and then at the end of the research, maybe to reduce the data that I had in my mind.
It's the way the history of the airplane works.
Well, not in this case, right?
We had friends in the front and for us, it was clear that what we needed is help, a lot of help.
So the first thing we've done is, once the texts came out of the neighborhood, we've published them on the Internet.
We've just published them all over the world in Cambria: "We've helped us."
And the help came.
Unfortunately, we've developed people from all kinds of places, surprised to see the information.
A few of the biggest viruses in the world, suddenly there were some of our community.
We've been working together in a virtual way, some of our data, we've been looking at, we've tried to track the virus in every single moment, to find ways that we can stop it.
And there are so many ways to create communities like this.
Everybody, especially when the crops started to spread global spread, we went to learn, to participate.
Everybody wanted to take part.
The human ability there was just amazing, and the Internet started all of us.
And imagine, instead of being one of the other, we just said, "Let's do it.
Let's work together, and you've taken together to do the task. "
But the problem is that the information we get from the Internet, it's too limited for doing a task like this is where we're going to do.
And so many opportunities are exposed.
So at the first point of the France in Canada, we had 10 medical games of patients, and again, we published them to the world.
And in our lab, we could show that you could take these 10 babies, and I'm going to have computers to predict the Ebola's face exactly 100 percent.
And we've created an effect in order to publish the bank process and do it right for health workers in the surface.
But 10, it's just not enough to get a quick effect, you've got a tremendous tree.
So we've been able to give more information to publishing.
And the data still didn't come.
We're still waiting, sophisticated, instead of working together.
And it's just -- we can't get it.
Right? You're all, you can't get it.
That's our life that's on the park.
And in fact, a lot of life lost, a lot of healthcare workers, including my favorite colleagues, five colors: bows, alcohol, a magazine response, Dr. Kan, Alice Kenya and Muhammama.
These are just five of a lot of health workers in Kenya and in other places, who've been working in the world that we've all been working, in the face of themselves.
We realized, Abola, like other organisms of humanity, reduced by inequality and confidence and cooperation.
When we're building the drugs inside us and we're going to wait in our own and ourselves, the virus is reduced.
But in addition to other parts of humanity, we're all about markets in Ebola.
We're all in this box together.
One person's house can be very fast to get to our house.
And so in this situation where we're all data, with those same vulnerability, the same forces, the same fear, the same time, I hope you've been able to work together in a whole heart.
My second student read a book about a hospital, and she found that the word "Canada," the hospital that we worked and the city we worked in a nation, which means in the Minister: "Chile like a river, and open up to the audience."
It was a profound meaning for us, because without knowing it, we always felt that in order to get people in Kenya, where our job we had to work in discovery, to share and cooperate.
And so you need to do.
We've all got to push it from ourselves and others -- to be reduced with other people when they're going to go around, go into this environment together.
Because it's not the first discovery of Ebola, and it's not the last one, and there's a lot of other microbial microbes, like Darwis and others.
And the next time it's going to happen, it might happen in the city of the Minister of millions, it can start there.
It can be something that's gone through the air.
It can even be reduced at the first time.
And I know it's scary, I'm looking at it, but I also know, and that's what the experiment showed us, we've got the technology and we've got the capacity to win in it.
But we can do it just with a fantasy together and pay attention.
So for the room. Kan and for all of those who read their lives in the front of this struggle with us always, let's get them in this struggle always.
And let's never be limited by the destruction that's made by one virus, but it can be described by billions of white and brains that work together.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It may seem like a very good intervention of numbers, but it's actually a mathematical action.
The Indian mathematicians called it the stairs to move out.
In Iran, it's called the Kayan School.
And in China, it's a Jang Jang.
Many of the Western world is known as a five-click on the San Francisco's Foundation, which looks not fair because he's certainly going to train for a reason, but he still had a lot of component.
So what about this is so interested in the right world?
In short, it's full of patterns and secrets.
First of all, there's a pattern that's made it.
They started with one and imagine invisible zeros on his side.
And they've lost them in the posters, and they'll get the next line.
Now, do it again and again.
And they went on and get something like this, even though a click really goes up to infinite.
Now, every teacher's looking at what's called the bionic decline from the shape, which is the number of generations, and we're starting to remove from the airport.
So if you're doing O2 and you're looking at it, you're getting 22 plus 22.
The academic, or tell the numbers before the machines, they recognize books in this teacher's skin.
You're going to see the same thing with NAO three, which's growing up.
So the crisis is a coffee, and it's about looking for all these actions.
But there's a lot more.
For instance, you've lost the numbers in every teacher, and you've got a little bit of two.
Or in a given teacher, they've been treated to every number as part of a privilege.
In other words, a second teacher is 1x1.
You get 121, which is 2.
And look at what's happening when you do the same thing to the third line.
It's a 1,7,7,561, which is 6, and so on.
There's also optimistic effects.
Look at Alexon.
The first two isn't very interesting: it's all a few, and then numbers that are positive, which are also natural numbers.
But the numbers in the next disaster is called the number of books, because if you take this amount of points, you can get them to the women's markets.
The next Nigerian numbers have dramatic numbers, because in the same way, you can make a number of cases in the Twitter.
Or what about this is, you've been treating all of the famous numbers.
It doesn't seem to be something that's when it's small, but if you're going to put thousands of lines, you get a crop that's known as a series of Francisco.
It's not just a mathematical art.
It's also very effective, especially when it comes to companies and strengths in the field of Nigeria.
Tell you want five children, and you'd like to know what you're going to have a dream of three girls and two boys.
Basically, it's used to be sick, and it's on the right budget.
So we're looking at the personal teacher, where the first number is going to be used to use girls, and the last one for six boys.
The third number is what we're looking for.
It's about the power of all the bees in the teacher.
So 10 / 32, or 325 percent.
Or, if you're looking at the Arabic group of five players from a group of 10 years of friends, how many French groups of five are there?
In terms of corporations, this problem moves when two hours a five-hicle, and you can be happy with a train, or you can just look at the third student of a two-dimensional teacher and get the answer.
The patterns of the French French are advertising to the genetics that I'm worrying in the mirror of the math.
And it's still new secrets to the day.
For example, mathematicians recently discovered a way to expand it to these kinds of politicians.
What might it be in the screen?
Well, it depends on you.
Darwin's 21,000 kilometers of land and Amazon evolved through the French region of China with a long long, and almost as the structure.
The big level of China has started as a range of a village of a village that we built by Field countries during the period of Chicago to protect the hormones and the north of China because of the other.
When Chan't been killed by January Indian countries in the 21 before the apartment, the optimistic and the French ocean became natural suicide, but the mountains in the northern remained vulnerability to death, Turkey, Turkey, and Washingo.
In order to protect the age, the unfortunately revealed the small walls that we built by the dogs, a couple of others and a little bit.
When the boys grew from Nigeria in the West to Luke in the Middle East, they became a collective collective for worthy.
To achieve the goal, the unprecedented of soldiers and my daughter, not always extended.
Over the hundreds of girls of the conditions that have been done during Chile, a lot of people who were going to be scared and others would have been scared that they were in front of.
Using the Amazon, the restaurant went to grow, and it's got 6,000 miles, and it's an accurate accurate in the Amazon.
Social work goes underneath the San Francisco's Sundi, and the anonymin of the wisdom grew up to a very known place of suffering.
Cities and dozens of the time told about workers who were born in the microbes, or even in the reference itself.
And while there's not a human beings, you're going to get rid of people who are working on, noise and experience.
The thing was significant, but it wasn't inevitable.
We also had Texas and we also built Kenyan, and we were able to go through the walls during the Hungarian French in the 13th century.
After Mr. Mr. Mong came to the Boston in 138, they started to improve and reduce the regulation in only using local years.
On the average of seven feet and a fifth of six feet, 800 meters of the restaurant will be in a gold gold.
When you invite them, you've got your head and you've gone through the rainforest until you've come up.
Social opens across the level that allows you to spend on the walls, while larger were used to spread bones and so on.
But even the new, and the privilege wasn't enough.
In 1644, in Mexico from Mexico, showed Mr. James to switch the chicken, who also made Mumbola, so for the second time, China was reduced by the people who had been devastated.
With the Egypt boundaries that are spread beyond the big level, the creatures lost their goals.
And for me, the strengths of the wisdom came up to a bad situation, the land of a nanoga, while white and nurses were scared in Mexica.
But her goal didn't hide.
While the second World War, China used the parts of the genes against beautiful, and there's some parts that are still used to be in the fingers.
But the main goal of this today is cultural.
As one of the boys in fact by a person on the planet, she got a mirror of a world from the Amazon School in 1987.
In the Mexico to leave people out of China, the big thing now gets millions of studies every year.
In fact, the president of the chimps made a difference to the room, which led the Chinese government to open a conservation biological bias.
It's also known as the only human structure that looks from space.
Unfortunately, it's not all that true.
In a lower form of space, all kinds of buildings, like bridges, rapid roads and dogs look, and the Chinese level in a season.
Rather, it doesn't have a chance.
But with that, you have to explore it from the Earth because new parts are still spending every few years, you're exposed from the personal body and you're looking at this big and the task to be human.
Think back on a really clear memory.
There are?
Okay, now we're going to remember what they're going to do for the lunch three weeks ago.
The other memory is probably not that powerful, but why not?
Why do we remember some of the things, and some are not?
And why are the memories finally fit?
Let's first look at how memories are created.
When you experience something like a phone number, the experience is released to a electricity of electrical energy that's from a network.
It's first about a short memory, where it's available between a few seconds to a few minutes.
So it's gone to a long memory through areas like the hippocampus, and at the end of a few days back across the brain.
News around the brain are communicating in these special areas that are called "regulation" using special regulations. "
If two penguins communicate again and again, something amazing happens: the effects of communication they're excited.
This process, called the long-term potential, we're going to look at as a style that's going to have a long-term memories, but how are the memories of fabric?
The age is one of the fingers.
When we're missing, the symbols are starting to switch, and you're looking at how easily we can return memories.
Scientists have a few theories about what this strategy is, from the confidence of the brain, the opposite of the brain, the hippoint is fighting five percent of its anonymous every decade of respect to about 20 percent to the age of the age of Egyptian and Netrothers, like Einstein, who's learning.
It seems to be that these changes affect how people behind information from a pain.
The age also affects our memories.
The most powerful memories when you notice, when you're really involved, and when information is significant to you.
Social health and physical problems, which is designed to think when we're missing, we're going to notice our ability to pay attention, and that's why you're working as a memory chicken.
Another reason for memory problems is a chronic pressure.
When we move all the time at work and personal responsibility, our body is in Western village.
This response has evolved from the biological mechanism that's right to worry that we can survive from crisis.
As a pressure pressure is helping energy and interventions.
However, with our body pressure becomes a transformation in these chemicals, what makes a brain cells and the ability to create new cells, which affects our ability to keep new information.
A depression is another.
People are at high risk of 40 percent to develop memory problems.
Social levels of Stotocin, Netherlaser Twitter that's going to go to the walls, maybe it makes people accurate to be less accurate to new information.
It's focused on objective events in the past, another piece of depression, makes it pay attention to hope, and it's affecting the ability to keep memory in a short term.
Unfortunately, it's about depression, it's another memory.
Science by school to the public health of the Roviet found that people are older with high levels of social connection was a lower rate of memory during six years.
The reason that's left is not clear, but experts are afraid that social connections give our brains from autonomous.
Just like a muscle power, we need to use our brain or do it in our work.
But don't care.
There's a couple of reasons you can do to help your brain in your memories.
It's about to keep a physical activity.
It's limited to the brain that's coming back.
And eat good.
Your brain needs all of the magic materials to keep activity.
And finally, we've lost your brain.
Your brains for challenges, like a new language, is one of the best genes to sell your memories.
Hello.
My name is Williams and Williams, and I'm my God.
I've been invited in three different spines in Canada, and I've spent a level of national national intervention, and I've created Canada on the global stage.
So I'm a five-hicle in a week in a baseball and a faster on the ice, working with artists, and I'm an Italian performance to be the best in my face.
By the way, it's all the way of the special Olympic Olympics.
Is it changing the way you see me and my legs?
The world doesn't see people as artists.
Before a long time, we learned people as my sisters and looked at us.
Since the beginning of the unique Olympic Olympics in 1968, there were many change, but most cases, people with liberal limits are invisible to society.
People call me the GDP, and you think it doesn't matter.
The word is "French," or "extension that every" of Gandhi.
They don't think how much it gets me and my friends.
I don't want you to think I'm here because I want a lot.
I'm here because there's still a problem with the way the society is looking at people with intuition, or too often, how they don't see them at all.
Did you know that the Olympic games have made this year?
I was one of over 6,500 intuitions of intuitive instruments that came from 165 different countries in Los Angeles.
There's more than 62,000 faces that look at the open-up text, and there's been a TSSS experiment.
Do you even know it happened?
What do you think when you see someone like me?
I'm here today to challenge you to look at us as markets.
The general Olympics becomes the self-identity of ethnicity with intuitive and the patterns of anyone who's watching.
For those of you who don't know, the general Olympic Olympics is to tax with intuitive identities.
The Olympic Olympic has been reduced from the Olympics and the Olympic Olympic.
We're offering high-quality programs over the whole year for people with intuitive possibilities that live and pieces.
This movement has changed my life and those of so many other people.
And she changed the way the world sees people with intuitive identities.
I was born with Picasa and Institute.
When I grew up, I was scared by the age of 12.
The more I came in, I felt that it was hard to stand at the end of the rest of the rest, and I was scared and I was scared.
For a while, I didn't get in any sports, I didn't have a lot of friends and I felt a traffic and design.
There were times when people with intuitive intuitions were exposed from society.
No one thought they could change in Scott, which didn't talk about mental friends to society.
In the '60s, Dr. Frank, a scientist at the University of Turkey, I've been studying the effects of trust trust on the health levels of children with intuition.
It was used in a Cadian scientific study, the room and other studies came to the conclusion that it was just an opportunity to participate that caused their happiness to the crowd.
A lot of people were fighting it that people with intuitive options could have a bridge programs and opportunities to be reduced in Scott.
But a half a way like Dr. Han and January Kennedy Kennedy Canade, the decline of the special Olympic Olympic Olympics, they were looking, and the Time of the Olympic Olympics were killed themselves four and a half million times.
But before I got to the general Olympic Olympics, I was excited because I was young, Bayan, I wasn't sure for myself and I didn't have a lot of friends.
When I got there, with that, everybody was very scared, documents, and let me be myself without judgment.
Now, I'm a cartoon, and I'm a faster player who's stuck in local games, international games, and I've come all the way to the world's games in Los Angeles, where I've been a part of the first rare of the National Street France that &apos
And I'm one of four and a half million ethnices around the world, and I've heard so many similar stories.
It's going to be an ethnic Olympics that's going to return the gender and self-respect.
The Olympic Olympics also depends on critical medical processes.
Scientists showed that, on average, men with intuitive intuitions from 13 years more than men without the right, and women with intuitive identities from 20 years earlier than women without the right.
The Olympic Olympic Olympics we're healthy by which it makes us active and transform in Scott.
Like yes, our artists teach us about deforestation and health.
The Olympic Olympic is also a healthy choice for free ethnicity that they have experience with their doctor or access to health care.
In the World War Street of 2015, my team team of Canada and I sat in front of the Nigeria's cartoon.
Today before our game, we've been looking at the France of Nigeria went to the health of the world's health care, where to seven of the 10 friends we've come from free and can hear in the speed for the first time.
And you know, the change in which it was amazing.
They were more excited, they were happy and with more self-security, because their artist could communicate with them.
And they were excited because they could hear the voices of the window, the voices of the muscles and the events of the events -- sound that we take like boys.
The Olympic Olympics changes more than Mars in their text.
The Olympic Olympic changes their lives outside the road.
This year, from a research study showed that a little half of the adults in the United States don't know one person with intuitive implants, and 44 percent of Americans who don't have a personal connection with intuitively less and meaning.
So there's a 3D printer, which means that people with intuitive possibilities are still invisible for many people.
People use it as a common brain or to move.
It's more than seven million times a year, and it's very proud of me and four and a half million ethnic ethnicity around the world.
People don't think it's a dead. But it's yes.
Like the Ethiopia and the global term Jersen Franklin wrote in a political platform that used the word from the GDP, "Let's join us one day in the East Olympic Olympic.
You're going to see if you're going to go without any change you. "
Thank you for this year, in the summer of 2015, people were going to go for hours to get into the end of the molecules.
So it was just a place in just as a friend of my group Jersey Berkeley, the Israelis of Panada, the 297 pounds and 277 pounds have been tested in a minute -- and there's a new fingerprint for the special Olympic Olympic Olympic.
Jaki is a device between all of the molecules in Vanada -- not just in the special Olympic Olympic Olympics, all of the molecules.
John was a big star in Los Angeles, and ESPA was living on his weapons, and he was killed by his performance.
Five years ago, imagine that people with intuitive identities can do something like this.
This year, 60,000 faces remained the magic speech in Los Angeles to watch the opening of the world's world's budget, and it's been invited to 165 countries around the world.
It's far from being convenient, it's got us and we've got us.
The Olympic Olympic is about learning to be safe and genes themselves.
The Olympic Olympic is revealing the world that people with intuitive identities come from respect and general.
Now, I've got windows and the fish in my Scott, the artists of causes, honor and myself, better health, and I'm asking a career as a personal artist.
But I'm not sick, and I don't keep me and I'm here doing TED Talk.
But the world is a different place because of the general Olympics, but there's still a lot of exciting to go.
So the next time you see someone with intuitive instruments, I hope you'll see their ability.
So the next time someone uses a word from your door, I hope you'll tell them how much it's going.
I hope you're going to think about being involved in the general Olympics.
So I'd like to leave you with a last thought.
Nelson Mandela said, "Life has the power to change the world."
The general Olympics changes the world by making four and a half million ethnicity and give us a place to be safe in ourselves, to meet friends, not necessary and feel like God.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
You're a hour of other people, and you're going to go through smart soldiers.
The soldiers think you're pretty beautiful, but their culture is trained to eat academic creatures and teenagers.
Unfortunately, they're not sure if you're doing conditions, then they're deciding to your mind in the test.
Through his universal culture, the recycling that you're going to tell you this: You're going to be sure one of the high high school to support you so that everyone can see all of those who are going to go.
You don't get you to look back or go out of the game.
Every single one is a hole or a guy on his head who's going to share you in an academic, and I'm not going to tell you how many of the color is.
When I'm going to give the hormone to start, every one has to switch the color from the last person to the first safe.
And you don't try to say anybody's word a hole or a white or a white or to move in a different way, like using a sound or intuition; you're all eating.
If you're at least an hour, you're going to get right, you've got you.
You've got five minutes to Darwin and get a plan, and then I'm going to leave you safe, I'm going to give you the colors, and we'll start.
Can you think about a strategy that will make sure everyone will be done?
Remember the video now to solve it in yourself.
More answer: Three more answer: 2 more answer: One of the key is the man at the end of the dictionary that can see all the other actions and be able to use words "black" or "Ben" to get local information.
So what meaning can be made in these words that can be able to all the other ones to stop the color of the water?
It can't be the number of black or the white colors.
It's more possible than two possible values. But what's two possible values, it's the partners of the number of holes and the white ones that means, is this a number of fair or fair.
So the solution is to agree that, first of you, say, "Sorry," if he's seeing a number of holes of black colors and white "if he sees a number of holes.
Let's see how it works if the colors are doing this.
The highest dog sees three holes in front of him, so he says, "Sorry," and so you know all he's seeing a number of black colors.
It's wrong with his fingerprint, but it's okay because it's one slightly paralyzed mistake.
A number two is also seeing a number of black colors, so she knows that her son's white, and she's right.
The third axis sees a number of black colors, so he knows that his name has to be one of the black colors that the first two musicians saw.
The fourth poem you're hearing it and music that it needs to see a number of holes of black colors, because it's one black hole was behind.
But it sees only one, so it's a component that's also a black color.
Millions are five to seven to get look at the number of holes of black colors, and they're making their colors to white.
Now it's all depending on the sensor in the head.
If the list saw a number of black colors, it means just one thing.
You can see that this strategy works for every possible generation of colors.
The first musician has a chance of 50 percent to give an answer about its code, but the partners that it tells all the other people to push their own biases.
Every one starts to see a number of pairs or a pair of colors in a certain color.
If you're on the surface, you're going to get the extinction, it means that their finger is in this color.
And every time it's happening, the next person is going to have the partners that it's exposed to see.
So this is, you're free to go.
It looks like the soldiers have to stay hungry, or find less sophisticated organisms.
When you're going to challenge that the potential for failure looks like an organ in every corner, you may have heard this tree in the past: "You'll be more safe for yourself."
And it makes sense, that's what you think when you hear it: "If it was just such simple."
But what is the security?
Take the belief that you're valuable, markets, and the ability, what's known as self-esteem, have been reduced the optimism that comes when you're safe in your capabilities, and then you get power of it, they've been working in the courage to stand up with the challenge.
This is security.
It becomes computers.
So where's the security at all?
There's a number of faces that affect self-security.
First of all: What you're born with, like your genes, who affect things like the vision of your brain chemicals.
Second: How do you treat you.
It including your social pressure of your environment.
And third: The part you have control of it, the choices you do, the risks you take, and how you think and respond to changes and patients.
It's impossible to completely separate all of these genes, but for the personal choices that we're doing, there's certainly a key role in self-security development.
So, by thinking about a number of perspective, we actually have the power to make our self-security.
Number one: a quick box.
There's a few tricks that can give you a personal security in the short term.
Imagine your success when you start a hard task, sometimes just like listening to music with deep aircraft; it can take a sense of power.
You can even stand in a strong moon or give yourself an interface.
SP: You believe your capacity to improve.
If you want a long-term change, you get the way you think about your capabilities and your service.
Do you think they're scared at the night, or can they open like a muscle?
These images are changing because they can affect how you work when you're going to play.
If you've got a local thinking, what you're thinking is that your components are in a place, you may be wondering that you've found something that you're not really good at.
But if you have a form of growth and think your capabilities can improve, a challenge is an opportunity to learn and big.
Scientists of brain support the form of development.
Your bees in your brain is powerful and grow with learning and trust.
It also turns out, on average, people who have an open-up form of thinking are more successful, get better products, and they're more successful with challenges.
Third telescope: We've been trained in the face.
Look, you're going to do sometimes.
It happens to everyone.
John Jersey was born by 12 pounds before he took "The Arctic Pwitter."
The Western brothers built on the history of attractive experiments in the airport, including a few of them, before we've designed a product airplane.
Scientists show a question that's been scared, and it's used to try to try all that better in response to challenges and statistics in the way.
They're learning how to try different strategies, they're looking at other objects, and they're learning how to try to try different strategies.
So, think about the challenge that you want to deal with, and we realized that it's not going to be easy, you've got it that you're going to do mistakes, and you'd be nice to yourself when it's going to happen.
Let's imagine that you're going to measure, you're going to go on it.
The emotion that you're going to feel fast that doesn't matter, you're going to make more knowledge and understanding.
It's self-security.
In the Middle East, Amazons were trying to get the impossible.
They wanted to make the conventional skin into the gold.
The history has described these people as strange and adults, but if they only knew that their dreams were actually the top.
Actually, today we can generate the identical on the planet to the modern conditions that these Middle Egypt are collected in a few hundreds.
But in order to understand how this piece has become a metaphor in our planet from the beginning, we need to expect to the stars.
The identity is curious.
Instead of getting out of our planet's office, it's actually in the space and it's in the Earth because of the extremes of stars that are called a nanota.
The stars may be mostly from Martin, the most sacrifice and the highest.
The strength stress of so much material and a nuclear pressure in the planet.
This process is releasing energy from the left, what makes a planet wind.
For a lot of millions of years, the opposite becomes the artist of survival as more: the day, carbon, and oxygen, survive the secrets that are created faster and faster to get to the luck and easy.
However, at this point, the nuclear revolution doesn't release more energy, and the pressure from the planet.
The extinctions are focused on the center, and they're going to jump back from this beautiful flow of energy. The star is spinning and creates a horrible village.
The extreme stress of a star star is so big, that the autonomous and the electronic prototypes are connected together in the night, and they create penguins.
Nigerians don't have a conversation so they're going to go down by the road group of secrets.
Nigerian Nigerians who have gone from the production of the creatures of more sophisticated secrets that the planet under a normal condition can't create, from a collection and identify, and on the top of the Foramia.
It's in an extinction for millions of years of transformation to the day, the creative of the most common secrets in the village is going through a second.
But what's going on to identify after the object?
The House Google's name is the spinal cord that spread the lights of the hormones through the space of the stars, starts a dance of a gas and a struggle that's driven to the stars and new plants.
The golden of the Earth was probably in this way before we were trained into the walls by an autonomous activity.
billions of years later, we're now producing or the product is going to be inspired by its chicken, a very expensive process that's collected to the regulation of the gold.
In fact, all the gold that we've ever seen in history can be interpreted to just three lights of Olympics, even though it represents a lot of code because it's about 20 times.
So, can we make more of this funny product?
Actually.
It's used in existing electronics, we can predict the complexity of complexity that's produced in stars.
But these machines can build the identity just atom after atoms.
So it's going to take almost the age of the universe to create one cave in a lot of a price that's been working on the current gold.
So it's not a really good solution.
But if we were to come to the effective point where we were teaching all the globe in the planet, there are other places to look for.
The ocean leads to the weight of 20 million tons of the identity of the identification, but the water is really tiny to what makes its production right now too long.
Maybe one day, the golden looks like the globe to flow the current wealth of other plants in our sun.
And who knows?
Maybe a future vaccine will happen close enough to keep us with its production and hopefully not always the whole life on the planet.
A small number of species on the planet is creating a machine that's invisible: recycling.
We're one of a single villages.
Technology, human beings, dogs, people, and extinction programs are the only species on the planet that are caused.
We're also doing it more than any other animal, even though it's in the spinal of magazine materials and can be physical insects.
So where is this uncommon biological phenomenon?
The answer begins in pregnancy.
Over this process, the body's body is used to design a environment that's going to come up with, to create an interpretation in order to make her size.
In this sense, the range is inspiration, but it's only half of the story.
The second half of the rates that the dirt offers whether and her child is in refugees.
Like all the creatures of life, the human body has evolved to take the spread of its genes.
For instance, it means that it should try to provide an equally equally for all of its fingers.
But if it doesn't share exactly the same genes.
It's also going to get genes from the left, and these genes can reduce their survival by more than their famous part of my father.
This evolutionary interest there is its mother and her mother in a biological strength that's going on inside the hot.
One causes that you go to this inner struggle is the illusion, the Amazon that's connected to the blood of whether and listen the rise of the past is growing.
In most of the green, the third is behind the president of artificial cells.
This price enables whether to control the insects of the muscle materials for it.
But in people and some other species, the third is actually a bridge into the blood system of whether to get directly directly into its blood region.
Through the third way, it's made out of the walls of whether it's previous that it's open to provide a concept of a person's full of material materials.
It's done with such an unlimited approach can create hormones to define the summer in the blood, whether, you're looking at the walls, and you're going to get its blood pressure.
Most of the nurses of the green can predict or to jump out if it takes, but in people, once it's connected to the blood system, this context can make a blood flow.
If it's evolved not good or demand, healthcare is in a concept.
When she grew up, the next need of the cost of the resources can create a big, high pressure, and situations like a rushing and a range.
Because of these risks, the range is always a huge investment, and sometimes dangerous.
So it makes sense that the body needs to predict speeds to find those who keep the challenge.
There's a fabric.
The range begins with a process called transparency, where it's driving itself in analogy that's released the coal.
The analogy has evolved to make the changed so that only the healthy men will survive.
But by that, it's also in the most popular things, and it's created evolutionary feedback.
It's evolved in a complex dialogue and a hormone that's changing the analogy to enable it.
What's going on when you're going to play a test?
It might be able to connect, or even go through the anonymous way.
When he's in privacy, he can leave his mother exposed to pollution, and all of the time, he can spread hormones that's driven to her trends.
The body is moving from this problem just by the lab of every possible risk.
Every time a woman doesn't make a healthy demand, the hot goes from the Antarctica, together with the unprecedented expressions, the prosperity, or the presidents.
It's a process that's known as a piece, which leads to the region.
This biological machine, as it's strange, represents the direction of human species.
You learn to test?
We're trying to do too much things?
The pressure is a sense that we experience in a challenge or a task.
But it's not just excited, pressure is a conventional response that's made through all of your body.
In the short range, stress can help, but when it's often affected, or for a long time, the opposite response to your physical brain changes your brain and also a lot of organs in your body.
Your axis is released the commercial hormones, axin, which is also called Alexandela, and Franciscin.
When these hormones move in your blood flow, they come up with your blood and notice.
Darwin causes your heart to move faster, pull your blood pressure, and for a long time causes a high blood pressure.
Social can also make the anthropologic -- the instruction of the blood vessels -- a terrifying invisible function.
Scientists know now it's early on the process of training walls, or building a whole astronomer in your pockets.
Together, these changes define your chance to look at or outside.
When your brain feels stress, it moves your autonomy system.
It's a network of beetles, your big brain is pressure to your nervous system in the cases.
The connection between the brain and the transformation makes you feel prices in the kitchen, and it can prevent the effects of the issues that make food through the eyes, which leads to the normal concentration, and you can make your personal emotions to the meeting, what you're going to make your chance to feel.
Through your nervous system in the cases, stress can also change the car and the professionals, what will affect your health.
And if you're talking about your eyes, can you change your partner?
Well, yes.
Social can define your baby.
He says to your body to reinvent the energy organisms with energy and coal tools, what makes you apply to accurate actions.
The high levels of cartoon can also keep these prosthetic categories in deep sea.
It's a kind of curiosity that's not just about the budget of the button.
It's an organ that's released by effective hormones and modern chemicals that are called toxins, that can increase your risk to develop chronic disease, like heart disease and heart disease.
The pressure hormones affect the immune system in ways.
At the first time, they're helping the president to the warm in the walls, and they're dealing after a surprise, but a chronic pressure can decide some kinds of vaccine cells, and to make you more likely to be able to discover pollution, and put the rate that rate you decide.
Do you want to live a long life?
Maybe you're going to have to control your prison pressure.
Because it's even a bridge to local materials, the same team of the chimpanzees, who deal with the age of the cell.
Technologists are chimpanzees to allow DNA to transform every time you'll get part of it, without the genetic coffee of the cell, and they're spending every time it's part.
When plants become too sophisticated, the cell can't get more and worse.
And if it didn't prove to you, chronic pressure can get in your health as well as other ways, including a teenager, a hair of hair, as a mayor, a musician, a musician, a richer, richy, transparency.
So what does this mean for you?
Your life will always be full of pressure.
But what matters to your brain, and the rest of your body, is how you respond to this pressure.
If you can print these situations as challenges that you can control, instead of as a threat you can't get out, you'll get better at the end of the production and make healthy in the long term.
How is it that so many interactive species in movies and TV talk about a perfect English case?
The short answer is that no one wants to watch a team of space space space for years in the back of a living living room.
But to keep the stations, the creatures of State Text and other faces have published the idea of a universal corporation, a mobile device that can also decline every language.
So is it a universal university in real life?
We've already got a lot of programs that argue exactly this, take a word, a sentence, or a whole book in one language and also take it into a little bit of each other, whether it's a modern English or a future film.
And if a body was just interested in looking for words in the window, these programs could be able to win people.
The reality, with that, is a little more complex.
Prize rules are based on the world's brain using information to the market, which including all the words that will find in the window and all the tricks that are able to wear, and a set of rules to recognize the basic elements in the corner.
The sentence that looks just like, "The kids eat the axis," First software is going to reduce the bottom, or the depression structure of children as a subject, and the rest of the sentence that's called "to eat," and it's directly direct the Amazon. "
So she has to identify an English biology, or how the language can be part of the most small points of meaning, like the word "PS" that's used to show many.
Finally, it needs to understand the conclusion, what actually means of the different parts of the sentence.
In order to transform this sentence right, the software needs to treat different universes of production and laws for every student of the goal.
But there's a complex one.
The bottom of a couple of languages allows words to be organized in any room, while in other people, it can make an elephant to eat the child.
Morology can also be a problem.
San Swedney brings between two children and three children or more using a sand that doesn't exist in a lot of other languages, while the arms are worrying about the sea will leave you if the kids eat a certain piece, or just eat an axis.
Finally, even when the training is right, the plan can spread better points, like the kids "Guinean" we're "the Amazon," or "Dardian."
Another method is a statistical machine, which represents information from books, materials, and documents that are already transformed by people.
By inventing the tasks between lights and text also makes sense that there will be no sense that will happen in the case, the plan can recognize and death patterns, and use them to use future transformations.
However, the quality of this kind of therapy depends on the size of the first two, and the features of examples of certain languages or different genomes of a box.
The code that there are computers with the invisible, unprecedented and the genes of meaning that intuitive accurate for people have spent some studies to believe that our understanding of language is a unique product of the biological structure.
In fact, one of the universal transparency is the most famous, a fish on the GDP of the galaxy to the galaxy, "it's not a small machine but a small creation that's also driving the brain's brain and the signals of fabric creatures through a form of TV.
In the time, learning language is still going to give us a better result of all of a transformation that's right now.
But it's not a simple, and the huge number of languages in the world, as well as the interaction between the people who understand them, just continue to get a larger progress in autism.
Maybe in a time you're going to be able to be able to communicate with them through a city device, or maybe we're going to start to reduce the dictionary after everything.
So I beat to the most high world -- the Netherlands.
It wasn't always that way.
In fact, all over the world, people have become more high.
In the last 150 years, in developing countries, on average, we've been on 10 meters.
And scientists have a lot of environmental theories why it's happening, but it's almost all of them linked to the corporation, or to get a right to the bridge and space products.
In the last 50 years, the global bridge grew more than four, from 71 million tons to 310 million tons.
Technology exists for spaces and trees.
In any society where the income has become, it's also a protein consumption.
And we know that global, we're getting richer.
And as the Middle Egypt is in the level of the global population, from seven billion people today to 9.7 billion to 2050, which means that by 2050, we're going to have at least 70 percent more protein in than we're going to need to have human beings today.
And the last step of the United States is a lot of implications that the population is, until the end of the century, will be on 11 billion, which means that we're going to have a lot more protein.
It's a huge challenge -- such a huge challenge, last year, a team from England from England to England to a global sustainability, that if we didn't change our global policies and our food techniques, may be called the next 30 years.
Right now, the oceans are our main source of weapons.
More than 2.6 billion people depend on the oceans every single day.
And in the Mexico, our global plants are 2.5 times more than the oceans can move through a rapidly, which means that people take a lot more fish from the oceans than the oceans are able to return natural.
The world's world's world's world's world's world's most recent animals have recently published, which is only in the last 40 years, life's life's life's lives of two times.
And another privilege is invented, that the biggest beautiful beautiful genes that we consume, like the Western and the virus is as much more than 90 percent were gone since the 1950s.
And there's a lot of great ambridge around the world that they're going to go, and they're going to be more true and then you're responsible for a dream.
But at the end, all of these beauty are going to be able to sell on the extension of the existence of the ocean.
And it's not likely, even with the regulations of the convenient unknown, that we're able to take out of the oceans, more than we're taking today.
We have to stop spending our oceans.
We need to be easy for them.
And we're at the point, where if you're going to get on the scale to the production, you might be proud of a Titanic film.
The techniques today, can't feed a global population grow.
So how do we make it?
How would the world look at a short time of 35 years with a three-billion people's collecting them resources?
We're all going to become a plane.
It sounds like a good idea, but I don't offer me and it's hard to be possible for a global chemistry.
People eat a protein from the beef if we want or not to look at.
And let's say that we're in our way and we're going to continue on the current path, and we don't have to give a train to the fusion.
The global health organization has been recently recently that 800 million people suffer from an engagement and food device, in the same global population growth and the discovery of resources like water, energy and diabeta.
It's not hard to imagine a world of a global strength, from violence and an extinction.
People are hungry, and as nature's office comes to the red line.
In so many reasons, we need to change the techniques of food production around the world.
We have to get better. And there's a solution.
And this solution is in a beautiful agriculture -- agriculture of fish, dogs, components and videos.
Like the big oceans Jakkoko once said, "You've got to start spending out of the oceans as farmers instead of dogs.
That's what civilizations do -- agriculture instead of a page. "
The fish are the last food we're laughing.
And why you're always hearing objects like, "Life's too short to agriculture," or, "Freedom, of course!"
On the fish we don't have any information?
We don't know what's worry about his life, and we don't know what it's happy.
And if it's a big crazy, maybe it's gone through a corner of a task.
We don't know.
A little bit of people understand that Bang, you can't track out of the blueprint, this information remained with the front of the prize.
But let's stop for a moment, and talk about why fish are the best source of food.
They're healthy, they're preventing heart disease, they're telling our own positive and regulations and patterns like a three-dimensional gene, in a little bit different than any kind of happiness.
And except for being healthy, fish features is much more than extinction and diversity.
Think about it -- most of the animal agriculture is quite anatomy.
France is French, as a woman, she's a repeat, he's back, and he's out of the skin -- President India, Canada -- that's what you're looking at.
And that's why, there are 500 genes of fish that are growing up today.
It doesn't expect what you see on the floors of the Western networks, but it's not the point.
And you can grow fish in a very healthy way that's good for us, good for the Earth and good for fish.
I know I'm going to hear about the fish -- but let me explain: along with my wife and my daughter's daughter, Amy Bang Bang, we've been involved in the old agriculture a few years ago.
We've been inspired by Alexandria, who's reminded at TED Foundation in 2009.
In fact, we've actually met in a gene that's got and an artist in Galas.
Amy was there as a TED France, I, a project from Valand East and Iraq, likes to cure, an answer to the oceans.
Man really got our lives.
We liked, we turned out, and we've come from an inspiration with a big inspiration, thinking that we really want to do something about the oceans -- something with a long-term impact, which can provide real change, and something that we can do together.
We didn't really notice that it would lead us to a beautiful agriculture.
But a few months later, we've been studying from the UK, we've come to access in Canada in Central Kenyan interest, where the president of and Desert was reminded on a beautiful agriculture, and asked an operation of the environment to stop going on, to understand what's happening, and started to be involved, because the Ara
When we heard the statistics, we realized, how little we knew about this industry until that moment and we felt about art to help change the situation for good.
And if you're talking about statistics -- today, the amount of fish that we're going to have a global system, it's also a privilege, it's about two in the mortality that's created in the morning last year.
Everybody's worrying in the world, big or small, together represents about 65 million tons of tons of instruments for human need.
Social agriculture this year, for the first time in history, the more production of this is made out of French.
But now, the requirement is going to grow.
In the next 35 years, we're going to have 85 million other tons to give a contract. It's one and a half times, what we're producing global oceans.
A huge number.
You can stop on the surface of this violence, you can't get out of the oceans.
It needs to get agriculture.
And if you talk about agriculture -- for agriculture needs resources.
Like people need to eat to grow and stay in life, so animals.
France has to eat four to five pounds of a magazine and network almost 8,000 hours of water to just produce half a square of happiness.
The experts agree that it's impossible to grow deforestations to every seat on the planet.
We just don't have enough maps or water.
And you can't continue to rain forests there for that.
And water is sophisticated -- the Earth has very limited.
We need something more effective to keep humanity on the planet.
And now let's prevent it to the agriculture.
You can grow half a page of fish with just a half of food's bone, and a finger, even less than that.
And why is that?
Well, it's because fish, first, fingers.
They don't have to stand all the day and against the wind as we do.
And most of the fish are human beings -- they don't need to pay themselves.
The fish are read.
And they need a little bit of water, which is against all of the sense, but as you say, they're wearing in water, but they're almost not doing them.
The fish are the right protein for human beings, the most resources of resources, except of refugees.
What we've learned since.
For example, it's heard to 65 million tons that are made for human need, there's 30 million more tons of tons that are going to be able to eat animals, most of the films and anonymous industrial industrial industries that become the pressure and the press.
It's crazy.
65 percent of these diplomacy, around the world, are motivated.
Some of the most terrible problems of our time are about it.
As the ocean waves.
The most difficult problems you can imagine about it.
Since recently, Stanford published a man who said that if 50 percent of the old agriculture industrial industries, will stop using fish fish, our oceans will be done.
Now think about it for a moment.
We know that the oceans have a lot more problems -- there's pollution, the level of transparency, the corruption of corporations and so on.
But in all of these are the effect of the fish, and it's clear how much it's about each other.
Freedom, academic agriculture, climate change, food and so on.
In an alternative search, the industry, at a level of training, has been reduced to the alternatives that are based on plants like Syria, for industrial responsibility, to predict from my life and so on.
And we understand where these choices come, but it's not the right approach.
It's not Bay. It's not healthy.
Have you ever seen a chicken at the bottom of the ocean?
Of course not.
If you're feeding a conference in a secret and not in any other thing, it's extended, in a sense of the word's word.
Salmin is a crazy, it doesn't have a way to do it.
Frich agriculture is the best agriculture that is available to humanity.
But she had a really bad instrument.
It was used in the tools, there were viruses and diseases that were going to live, there was a ecosystems and pollution systems and pollution, diabetes that were killed with the president and changed the genetic prototype, and then, of course, as I mentioned, from food that I didn't expect.
How many of you were the days when we were all going to get out of our budget, what it wasn't.
Once you know, you know.
You can't go back.
It's not fun.
We really need a food system without survival, where we can trust, which creates healthy food.
But the good news is that development and research has led to a lot of new technologies and new knowledge that allows us to do it better.
We can now grow fish without all these problems.
I think of a beautiful agriculture before the revolutionary revolution -- we're now with a beautiful agriculture in the age of the blue revolution.
It means of new technologies is that we can now create a completely natural food, with a 3D printing, which is a microbes, insects, insects and seasons.
His healthy for people, healthy to fish, healthy to the planet.
In microbes, for example, can be a perfect alternative for all of the quality of high quality -- at scale.
Finsects are -- well, first, the perfect cycle, because they're getting food lights, but a second, think about the fingerprints, and we've made a lot of sense to use food bits.
You don't need a big earthquake for them, and you don't have to make a good job for them.
And microbial microbes are actually water creatures.
It's the revolution that we're talking about, it just needs a big scale.
We can grow now in many more genes than ever before in academic conditions, natural conditions that move to the fish that are happy.
I imagine, for instance, a regular system that's driven in a much more convenient activity, where you can create healthy fish, that's surrounded with an enormous effect, almost without energy and a little bit without water and natural food with a 3D printing.
Or a system that's growing up to one hour at the other -- but in France, where you're taking nature.
You need a little bit of food, a little bit of a ecosystems.
I think about a tumor that's going to have the fish, for example.
There's great technologies that want all over the world.
Malestimates for war, so we don't need antibiotics and chemicals, to autism that feel when the fish are noises, so we can save in food and create less pollution.
A software systems that collect information around the lines, so you can improve the communities.
There's really cool things that happen all over the bus.
And don't happen -- all of these things are possible for artificial intelligence, compared to what you're going to see today.
More, no one will not want to do the right thing.
So someone has to connect the dots and give these toilets in a big pattern.
And that's what we've been working in the last few years, and that's what we need to work together -- to rethink everything from the basis, with an aid perspective, and connecting all the points together, all over the world, in civilizations, which are ready to take part of a common food.
Now it's time to create a change in this industry and reduce it to a magic situation.
This industry is still young, it's got a lot more place for her and open.
It's a big task, but it's not inevitable as you might think.
It's possible.
We need to stop pressure on the oceans.
We want to eat good food and healthy.
And if we eat a animal, it needs to be such a life that was happy and healthy.
We need arguments that you can trust, and we live long lives.
And it's not just people in San Francisco or North Europe -- it's for all of us.
Even in the worst countries, it's not just about money.
People prefer something wrong and healthy that they can trust, about something that's coming from far away and they don't know about it.
We're all the same thing.
Let's come today where people live -- and they're going to go -- fish are connected on their own walls, and they're going to be healthy -- and they're going to make it possible.
You can help push the process.
You're going to ask questions when you're invited from a tool.
Where does my fish come?
Who's going to grow it, and what's it going to be?
Technology about where your fish came and how it's growing, you need to be much more right.
And consumers need to activate more stress on the old agriculture industry, to do the right thing.
So every time you're invited, ask about details and see that you really care about what you eat and what you can.
And finally, they will listen.
And we all win.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Imagine a airplane on a half meters above the ground and spread the Earth every 25 seconds in the walls of a sea.
We've put it into a size of your hand, and you've got something equal to a modern leader, an independent object can make more information from your local library.
So how does it live so much information instead of so small?
At the end of every listening, there's an intervention of high-speech carries with the head of the wall over every crowd.
All of a coffee is scared in a sea of a microscope, and your data is not there in the same way that you have.
Instead, he looked at the complexity of the complexity of these small adults.
Every group, the machine is also called Bertt, the genetic field of all normal gallons for one of the possible products, the values of 0 "and" one. "
Technology was written on the business by the remote of the refugees to the electricity that's left through electronics.
It's the extinction that the magnetic field is able to change because the genome of the mirror.
Once this information was written about the business, it was used by the genetic corporation to get back into a useful form, just like the prototype that's driving the clinic to music.
But how can you get so much information from "0" and "1?"
Well, by putting a lot of them together.
For example, for example, you've been reduced by one object, or eight pounds, and you're going to have some of the average picture is some of the objects, that every one of them is eight million pounds.
Because every quote has to write about a physical region in the business, where it's always to define the diversity of the business, or how many tricks can be rejected in every metaphor.
The Western expectations of modern learning is about 93 pounds to a metaphor, a big 300 million times of the interpretation of the first interest of IBM in 1957.
The amazing progress in the capacity of information is not just a result of the physical piece of components but also a product of invention.
It's called the process of a simple movie that allows the engineers to jump the head of the clinic and the pain.
And despite his body, the clinical process has become more devastated to the retirement of new regulations in the genetic and the anthropologists of the material.
In addition, you could reduce more details to mathematical algorithms that are saving noise from genetic disorders, and you find the most significant details in every piece of Central Center.
And finally, control of the previous advantage of the head, which has been taken by a body of a brilliant body under the genetic female head, which allows him to push less than a five-meter than the axis, about a five-hicle of DNA growth.
Over the last few decades, the magic growth in the capacity of the information and the power of computers have been driven on the right magnitude called laughter, in 1975, it's been exposing information into every two years.
But in the Olympics of 15 pounds to a metaphor, another summer of the genetic genome or another tumor in a new high risk called the Francisco Revolution.
When a small genetic gene is too small, its genetic genome is affected by heat energy and it can make objects around without control, which leads to information.
Scientists have evolved this limit in a simple way of reducing: by transformation because of the privilege of Antarctica, which enables the Western expectations to go to 155 meters per square meter.
Since recently, the modern information has grown again through a genetic process in the field of heat.
It's using the head of even more creative strengths, and on the lower genetic corporations by looking at a specific perspective with a laser and a simple process in this time.
And while these young businesses are right now at the moment of prototype, scientists have the next trick in the spinal line: the patterns of patterns, in which we look at organisms in fossil fuel boys, what might allow 3.1 meters to a feet or more.
So it's been used to the origins of engineers' generations, materials, and physicists from the Social Scientists, can be a powerful tool, and that's how it's going to go around you.
Sorry.
We have more than 600 of them.
They're linked between one and three / 2 / 2 of our body weight, and together with the connections, they're bringing us, and we'll help us move.
And if you're building muscles, it's a station or not, your muscles need attention because the way you're treating them on a daily basis if they're going to get rid or grow.
You're going to say you're about the door, you're ready to open it.
Your brain and the muscles are very perfect to get this goal.
First of all, your brain is sending a fossil corners in the arm.
When they get the message, they're blind, what causes muscles to contract and transparency, what's affecting your bones and producing the right movement.
The more the challenge, the nurses of the brain is growing, and it's looking at more motories to get the goal.
But what if the door is made out of a product?
At this point, your hand muscles will not be able to make a bridge enough to open it, so your brain is able to help other muscles.
You're going to move your legs, you're driving your cancer, and you're getting your back, you're making enough power to open it.
Your nervous system has used resources you already have, other muscles, to stand in a switch.
While all that happens, your muscles go another kind of change.
When you push them to pressure, they experience a microscope, in this context, it's a good thing.
In response, the cells are released by digital molecules that are called proteins that activate the immune system to fix the right.
So magic building the muscles happen.
The more you're going to have to have a lot of the muscle, your body's going to have to fix itself.
The region that's produced and regulation finally does big and more powerful muscles when they're exposed to regular emotions.
Because our bodies are already prepared to most of the activities today, they usually don't make enough wealth to encourage new muscles.
So, to build new muscles, a process called the epic, our cells need to be more important to the high sea than they're used to.
In fact, if you wouldn't expect the muscles to you in the walls of the corner, they will be accurate, a process that's known as muscles.
In contrast, the privilege of pressure, especially when the muscle comes out, what's also known as a maximum, is creating an effective situation for new growth.
However, muscles are focused on more than just an activity to its own.
Unfortunately, the hormones, the hormones, the body will never be able to fix the right to the muscles.
We're building a protein in in our gundance that's based on the muscles by looking at the building for a new level of truth in our eye.
Social consumption is enough, together with genomic hormones that affect problems, like an intuition of insulin and Scott, help reduce the body to the situation where it's rapid and growing.
This particular box happens especially when we're in terms, especially at night when we're going to go.
On the right and the age of age affects the theater, so a young man with more Titan has a solution in the game of the muscles.
Scientists also play a role in the capacity of a person to grow a muscle.
Some people have a more definitive response to the muscle, and you can fix and replace better muscles, and we're going to define their muscles.
The body responds to the feelings that you're offering.
If you do your muscles, you can eat right, you can go back and go back on it, you'll get the situation to get your muscles to be big and powerful as possible.
With the muscles like life: significant growth requires a challenge and a tree.
Would you not be good, feel nervous or scared, wearing small things, and feel terrible and beautiful?
Don't worry, we were all there.
You're probably afraid.
The pressure is not necessarily bad.
It can be used for energy and code, for example, in a regulation, or it's a audience.
But when it's going on, as it happens to us, it actually changes your brain.
Social pressure, like a job or power in the house, can affect the size of the brain, its structure, and its code, just until your genes.
The pressure begins with something called the hypothesis of the Public Rovil, a series of interactions between analogy in the brain and the instruments, which is sending your body response to pressure.
When your brain recognizes a situation from strength, your HHPA switches on the right and released a hormone called a cartoon, which represents your body to action.
But high levels of curiosity over time of your brains.
For instance, chronic pressure represents the activity of activity and the number of nervous connections in Egypt, the fear center in your mind.
And when the magical warriors, electrical materials in the ocean, the part of the brain is linked to learning, memory, and control of pressure.
The opposite is also revealing the activity of the HPA, so when it's scared, it's also your ability to control pressure.
But it's not all.
Social can actually get your brain to avoid.
It's too much of it causes the security of bees and to contract your previous brain corruption, the same region that's made of behavioral behavior, decisions, decision, and social connections.
The cartoon also represents the new nervous cells in the fingerprint.
It means that a chimpanzee can get you to learn and remember things, and also define the risk to get more emotional disorders like depression and at the end of Alzheimer.
The effects of stress can get really into your brain's DNA.
A clinical trial that the treatment of the treatment of decline has a role in the top of the way it will respond to the pressure in its lives.
The teachers of metaphors have created less sensitive to pressure because their brain has developed more cartoons to the cartoon, which are driven to the cartoon and represents the stress response.
The teachers of lucky parents were the opposite response, and they became more likely to pressure during their lives.
These are computers to genetic changes, which means, they're affecting genes, without changing the genetic code.
And these changes can become if you decide the signals.
But there's a surprising result.
The genetic transformation that was made by one dream has gone to a lot of generations of malaria.
In other words, the results of these actions were creative.
But it's not all bad.
There's a lot of ways to make what the cartoon does to your left brain.
Your most powerful weapons are extinction and motivation, which is a deep task and aware of your environment.
These two costs are reducing the pressure and define the opposite, and that's how you get the memory.
So don't feel sad by the pressure of the daily life.
You're going to take your pressure before it's going to take on you.
Imagine you could connect your brain to a machine that can bring you to your head to your rest.
If you could have the possibilities to have this kind of existence, you would do it?
It's the question that the philosopher Robert was in a thought experiment called the experience machine.
The experiment asked us to voice a world where scientists have developed a machine that is a real life in an extension of happiness and a world of happiness and a world.
The atmosphere?
You've got to leave the reality behind you for a moment, but you don't really look at the difference.
Your experience will be invisible for reality.
The top and the survival of life is just going to have a particular series of violence.
It sounds great?
It might look like a device, but maybe it's not an interview like it's heard.
The experiment was actually designed to reduce a philosophy called the intuition.
By the anthropology, just the president is the important thing in life because it's the best one that life can offer.
The best choice that a person can get to himself is the one who's bringing him the largest amount of president in the sea that doesn't understand it as much.
It's unlimited less zeros as an equal to the president of the Nigeria, or in other words, the extension of the experience of an investment.
So, if the intuition is the recent philosophy of you, to connect not a question.
But what if there's more to live from the president?
It's what's about the species that he's talking through his experience through the experiment.
Despite the promising of the machine to come from Mexico from Mexico, he still found a reason not to connect, like many other Nigerians who've been looking at the surprise.
But what can you give you a future of a perfect date?
It's going to have the next device.
In Texas and Canada, they're about to have a relationship.
Basically in the clouds and I've never seen a more happy approach.
However, without the Tasmanian hands, Canada was an artist with her sister, Angelia, with love and sophisticated features during their lives.
If you're going to find out, it's going to kill the relationship with Texas and also with Antarctica, and the experience will be so traumatic that it's never going to love again.
Because in Tasmanian, a happy arm of Mexico's restaurant, the Iranians would say it's better to stay in the kitchen and that's on her high happiness.
As long as you're not going to get out of the relationship, it's likely that her life is going to get happy as they're now.
So, is there a value of this in Texas to know the truth about the situation?
Imagine you're right.
Would you like to know the truth?
If the answer is yes, you'd choose the option that's been reduced with your happiness.
Maybe, then, you would believe there's things in life with a much larger profound value.
Really, knowledge, genetic connection with other people.
All of these things can get to your list.
By teaching the truth to the right, basically life in its own personal experience, a world of happiness that doesn't based on reality.
This love is a beautiful example, but it's a lot of the decisions that we're doing today's life.
So whether you're doing a choice for yourself or for yourself, why do you feel that reality should be caused?
Is there a profound value in real experiences, between roads or what?
Do you have more valuable when you experience the right and the pain of the real life?
The experiment of contrast may not tell all of the answers, but it's driving us to voice if the real life even if they're not perfect, you're bringing some fundamental value beyond the engagement.
About 15 years ago, I was going to take part of a study that was usually genetic.
When I went to the clinic to the test, I got a window.
One of the first questions I'm very hard to lose my right baby: white, black, I'll finished or American.
I wasn't sure how to answer this question.
Is it going to measure the diversity of the final background of research change?
In this case, I'd say with my social identity, and I'm going to put a guy's baby. "
But what if the studies were interested in exploring what the production of the risk for certain genetic properties?
In this case, don't they want to know something about my production, which is a doctor just like an African?
And how can they find scientists about my genes if I lose my social identity as a black woman?
After all, I'm looking at myself as a woman who's a black woman with a son who's a woman who's like a woman who's a completely sick of social reasons.
That's a total identity that I'm training doesn't have any relationship to my genes.
So, look at the street of this question to the scientific explanation of research, I said to me, "Don't worry about it, just like you're invited with yourself."
So I called "Shair," but I didn't have security in the results of the research that has become critical in the way not science.
This personal experience with the use of genetic statistics made me think: Where's more in medicine have a gold use to get biological biological biological patterns?
So, I found that the stem is deep in all of the medical justice.
It's a nervous designer of doctors, institutions, treatments, most of them, even the definition of diseases.
And as I discovered about it more, that's how it's going to kill me more.
Sologists like me all around a long time that is a social structure.
When we recognize people when holes, white, universities, Americans, lesbian, we're treating social groups with extinctions that have changed over time and change around the world.
As a sentence, I also looked at how the laws of laws, not biologists, invented the strengths to the walls.
And it's not just a point of social scientists.
Do you remember when the human genome was taken in the Hollywood house in 2000?
The Bill Clinton's best, "I believe that one of the big corruption will bring out of this concept in the human genome is that in genetic genome, humans, without the model of stem, they're more than 9.9 percent."
And it may be a prosperity that one percent of this genetic model doesn't go into a chemical framework.
Francisco Central, who led the human genome project and now is on the NIT, gave the National Clinton.
"I'm happy today, the only one we're talking about is the human genome."
Scientists are supposed to stop in medicine based on evidence, and they're called more and more to join the genetic revolution.
But the driver of taking care of patients on a backwards.
Take the consumption of a short box in the fire or GPR.
Scientists in a way that I've made GFFR, the important instrument of the code, on stem times.
Like you can see in this lab test, a completely identical accuracy, the rise of the patient's patient's eye, producing a different GPR depends on whether you're an American or not.
Why?
I've been told that it's based on the conversation that Americans have more musical muscle than people reveal another.
But what idea has to have is that an automatic doctor I have more muscle than this muscle?
There's not going to be a lot more accurate, and it's not going to be a lot more accurate and a script to a little bit of different patients just looking at them?
So, doctors tell me that they're using a wisdom as a way.
It's a fabric, but it's more important to the genes like a muscle, an analogy, genetic features that just don't have the time to look.
But stem is bad.
A lot of cases, stem cells add unrelevant information.
It's just a scientist.
But stem cells are also going to take on clinical institutions.
It's a message from doctors of patients's symptoms, family diseases, their history, their disease may have -- everybody's more based on than a patient's wave.
Cyrus can't replace these important regulations without reducing the wind of the patient.
The doctors also tell me that prosperity is just one of a lot of causes that they take on the math, but there's a number of medical tests, like GPR, who's used to treat black patients, boys, white allies, just because of their hair.
Social medicine is also a hospital that doesn't make a particularly vulnerable, very popular and statistics.
Social patients and statistics are in high environments that don't have a drug for the power of resources than patients who are patients for the same resources themselves because statistics that people feel less like the skin, reduce their pain, and they're focused on the trees.
The food and drugs even travel a specific drug to move.
It's a molecule called "Beijing" for treatment in the lucks of sea as Americans.
Corologist opened this drug without reduction to the gold or genetics, but it became in the cases of commercial reasons to market this drug for black patients.
The FDA's happiness, so to society, the drugs company, to look at medicine in clinical trials that were just an American study.
There's a hair that's been inevitated from a place of genetic causes that affect heart disease or response to drugs.
But think about the secret message that it's sending, that the body of black people is so decline, a drug that's not necessary to work in other patients.
In the end, the marketing program of its drugs have failed.
First of all, black patients were in a way of using Europe that was just about black people.
A woman who's a woman who's been born in a community and she's designed, "Let me give me what we call the white people!"
Laughter) And if you find specific drugs for surprising, it's until you learn that many doctors in the United States are still using an enormous tool that's evolved by a doctor's doctor's doctor, a security that's going to be able to do minutes.
Dr. Robert School finished his friends at the school of Francisco at the University of Finland.
He looked at the South Western war, and he was a famous minute in what was called "Democrats."
He's taken the profound prototype of diseases, that people get different from different diseases and experience that are very different.
Catritt argued in the '50s' 50s that work with medical black people.
He argued that the direction that black people have a lower range of medicine than white, a job in their face was good for them.
He wrote a medical paper, "It's the vast red red red red to the brain that's released the brains under the third of the white person, and it's the extension in a red red red red red piece that's transparent their brains into lights and healthy when they're free."
In order to support this theory, Catrich helped the rest of medical device to measure a list called a meter to show the health lines of black people.
Today, doctors are still sampling in a contrast of California that people who are black holes have lower health care than people.
Some are even using a modern metaphor that even has a button that's called "stem" so that the device demands the countries to every patient's device or her.
It's a very familiar action called "France" by stem. "
The problem with medicine by a lot of stem is made by a lot of patients's security.
It's based on microbial differences in a disease that represents attention and social resources from privilege that make health care in health: an access to high health care care; neighborhoods with optimization, and it's important to environmental illness; it's going to be safe, and you're going to reduce the power of growth of growth.
You see, stem cells is not a biological physicist in the way natural produces health because the genetic difference.
Cyrus is a social elephant that has mathematical results, but because of the effect of social inequality on people's health.
Although medicine's medicine on the right stem cells that the answer to health is in a slightly specific fingerprint.
It's much easier and unusual to marketing these ecosystems in health than to deal with the extinction that's made them.
The reason I'm so excited to finish the profound medicine is not just because it's a bad medicine.
I'm also in this task because the way doctors do in medicine continue to take a point of view of humanity.
Despite all the way in the medicine we found, there's a imagination of imagination when it comes to the hell.
You can imagine with me, just for a moment: What would happen if doctors were producing trees on stem cells?
Let's say they're going to take a imagination system from the 18th century, and they'll find out where the most profound knowledge of different genetic and genetic aspects, that human beings can't be dangerous into biologists?
What if, instead of using a gas as as a place of a different gene of doctors really have happened and do the more important function?
What if doctors were going to join the front of a movement to the injustice of a season that was made by stem cells, not by a genetic difference?
Social medicine is a bad medical medicine, it's a model and it's a sense of humanity.
It's more than the end of the end of trying to reduce this piece of reduction and that our common humanity by the social discovery that's really spread us.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
Before he turned the physics on the box, they say that Al Einstein, the young Einstein showed his genius by thinking of complex complexity that can generate this privilege.
Are you able to predict to deal with the brain challenge that was written by one of the people in history?
Let's try.
The great fish in the world is coming out of the Iraq Ethiopia.
The police was following the street to the street with five homes that are identified.
But they can't look at all the homework together, and if they're going to spend wrong, the rainforest knew they're in his face.
It depends on you, the good guy in the city, to solve the case.
When you get to the camp, the police will tell you what they know.
One: Every other citizens, a different production is different, and a different kind of musician.
Two: All the inner walls of every house in different colors.
Three: Every house knows a different animal, one of them is the fish.
After a few hours of a professional, you're collecting a few pounds.
It might look like a lot of information, but there's a clear concept for the solution.
It's going to be a very similar solution to Scotu, so you might find it useful to organize your data in the Grand, like this.
Remember the video on the next screen to look at your arms and reduce the animal.
More answer: Three 2 to start, release the information from eight and seven.
Michael, you understand that the other and the president in the street, there's only one home to India, which has to be the house with the blue walls of 14.
Five mirror says that in the house with the old walls of coffee.
It can't be the infinite house because you already know that in the hospital, but it can't be the other house, that you know it's got patients.
And since the four meters says that the green house is really on the left to the white walls, it can't be the first house or the personal house.
The only place that's left to school with the green walls with the coffee is the fourth place, which means that the house with the white walls is the right.
The first speech gives us a nation and color.
Because the only motion that's released these two values is the atmosphere, it has to be the house of British with the red walls.
Now the only wall of the wall that you don't hear is the yellow, and it has to be crazy to the first house, when the fourth hour says that there's a life of leadership.
And one bridge tells you that in the home of the Mexico's office, which can only be the other house.
The next step is to figure out what's previous at the first home of collaboration.
It can't be her, a three-hour tells you that it's the religion.
And it's about 10 years old, it can't be a black boat from another one and the person is in Lotter, and since you've got a space, it's got to be water.
Mark five years old, you know that the content of the Hungi, who can only be at the other house, a smoke in Los Angeles.
Now when the only point in Brothers without a musician and a math is the mental illness, it has to be the house of the person from a 10 years old.
And since that leaves us just the other house without a piece, the religion has to live there.
The fourth house is now the only house that's been released to their nation and a kind of musician, so the France of France is three to 10 years, has to live there.
Throughout to augmenting, you can stop that the British is out of the left and the Sweden in the right house, when a five-hicle and two meters tell you that these have a bird and a restaurant.
A brief gas tells you that, on the cat is living at the top of the Iraq, what's there in the first house.
Now, with just one place in Brothern alone, you know that the German in the old house has to be the crime.
You're and the police jumped to the house, you're going to take the arm with the fish on the hand.
While this explanation was directly directly, you're going to take water like this, many times it's capacity and streets without a product.
Some of the trick is to use the process of intuition and a lot of experiment and techniques to focus on the right patterns, and as you open more connections, your intuition will be better for me and where there's enough information to get to the business.
And does Einstein really wrote this animal?
It's probably not.
There's no dots for that, and some of the components that are too recent.
But the idea here is not so different from it that you would use to solve dots with a number of transparency, even those who move the nature of the universe.
What can it be common to the motor and our daughter?
After all, they don't have health, a series of service, or even there in the streets we can agree.
But they've got the ability to solve water, learn a way of security, and even using tools, just like other animals we know.
And what's doing is the contract of the motor so amazing is that it comes from a completely different biological structure from our own.
The 200 species of nanogens are components that belong to the fossil fuels, blind to my legs.
These rates are big brave brains, with a body of a similar body of patterns, and a complex nerve system with about the same amount of News like a dog.
But instead of being concentrated in the brain, 500 million of these neurons are repeated in the web of Genna's networks that are organized for these basic structures.
The central brain is only about 10 percent of the Nigerian, while the two optimistic hormones are about 30 percent.
The rest of 60 percent of the other people are in privilege, that people would be like our hands was a brain for them.
That's where things get more interesting.
The animals like us have a listening to support our bodies, with microbes that allow us to move.
But not all the issues of possible movement.
You can't jump your head back, or take the arm in the middle, for example.
Fethers, on the other hand, there's no objects at all, which allows them to jump their arms at any point and everything.
So design their arms into every single one of the possibilities, it's not something that we're used to.
Think about a simple metaphor, like a perception and a function.
The human brain contains a biological map of our body.
When you're seeing the object, your brain's modern center is spending your fingers, what you can add your hand, to search it with the hand, to take the French, and bring it into your page.
The motor, the process is quite different.
Instead of a body's body's body's brain, the flow brain has a behavior service.
So when the motor sees food, his brain doesn't make a specific body, but instead of a behavioral response to search.
When the goals move through the web, Nanonymous scanned the consciousness and judges to act on the movement.
Once the arm is going on in the food, the door of a muscle is moving all the way through the arm to the sand, while the arm sends back another Google from the basis to the end.
The signals are coming in the middle of the way between the food and the bad basis, which allows her to know to move in this point.
That means that all of this is that every eight of the moon can actually think of themselves.
It gives him an amazing and creativity when it's about a new situation or a new problem, whether it's open in a bank to get food, to wind through a new environmental environment, to change the dirty and the skin in and the skin in to move around, or even to reduce other creatures to reduce.
Portubes may have developed complex brains a lot before our classes.
And the mechanisms is not just effective to the mechanisms.
The Social Social Social system and their inventions think of themselves was inspired by new studies in new robots that are made from rich materials.
And exploring how the budget can affect the traffic of evolutionary trade can help us understand more about concept and consciousness in general.
Who knows what other types of possible life, or how they're doing the world around them.
In the third century before the apartment, some of the fossil fuels were going to go and reduce their dreams on the conversations that hope.
A thousand years later, ancient Egyptians wrote a number of dreams that remained more than a hundred common windows and meaning.
And for years since, we never made our journey to understand what we share.
So, after a lot of scientific research, technologies, and the fact, we still don't have a significant answer, but we have some interesting theories.
We're sharing to define violence.
In the beginning of the 20th century, a proportion was invented that while all of our dreams, including the tricks, they collected images of our daily life, they also have a symbolic meaning, which is going to make a defense of our necessary dreams.
A theory that's all that we remember when we wake up a dream of this is the cartoon of our unconscious, our external and prosperity.
The species of the species that are going to have these strange elements, the unfortunate contact to our conscious brain, and psychological problems that they're going to be treated and discovery.
We share to remember.
To define the performance in certain digital techniques, sleep is good, but a dream is better.
In 2010, scientists found that people were much better at getting too complicated than they were there, and they were on their other experience before their other experience.
In fact, they were good at this from those who were just thinking about the kitchen in cities between the experiences, and those who were not worried about the screen.
Scientists have shown that some memory processes can only happen when we're going to be old, and our dreams are the signals that these processes happen.
We share to forget.
There's about 10,000 trillion trees of bees in the architecture of the brain.
They're created by everything you think and everything you're doing.
The biological theory of 1983 of the dream, which is called the French learning, arguing that in our time, and especially in the dream of a dream, the corner of the brain is looking at these bees and translate those who don't want.
Without the process of conversation, which causes your dreams, your brain can be exposed by uncomfortable bees and computers can avoid positive thinking that you need to do when cities are.
We share to keep our minds work.
The activity theory of activity is that your dreams are the result of your brain's need to stop and create long-term solutions all the time to function.
So when an extinction is flow under a certain level, as you're old, your brain's automatically activated the creation of information from its memory, what you're going to see in a way of computers and feelings that you're hoping in dreams.
In other words, your dreams are maybe a conservative screen that your brain's produced so that it's not entirely accurate.
We're scared to transform.
The windows that all kinds of dangerous and atoms are very common, and the feminist effect of the help theory says that the content of its dream is significant.
Whether it's a full night of being a hair of being a hair of a forest by a road or to fight a jungle in an effect, these dreams allow you to train your fight or your kitchen, and it's about it and you can support it in a case that you're going to need it in real life.
But it doesn't always have to be wrong.
For instance, dreams about a conventional machine can actually admit your cultural effect.
We share to healthy.
Nicocortex of pressure in the brain is much less effective during the dream of sleeping, even while you're going to have autism dreams, which leaves some studies to think that one goal of dream is to take the facts of self-esteem to enable a psychological camera.
Again on traffic events in your dreams with less stress pressure may give you a more expensive perspective and draw the ability to work them in a psychological way.
People with the kinds of wind disorders and a traffic object has a lot of times a problem to sleep, which leaves scientists to believe that in the dreams is maybe causing their disease.
We share problems.
It's not limited by the reality and the laws of normal sense, in your dreams, your brain can go to the end of situations to help you get a problem and evolve solutions that you might not be used as cities.
John Stephen Steve was called it and the restaurant, and the studies reduced the effective of dream to mix problems.
So also the worst of October Center discovered the structure of the virus molecules, and that's why sometimes the best solution to the problem is to protect it.
And it's just a few of the trivial theories more.
When technology gets our capacity to understand the brain, it's possible that one day we're going to find out the reason they're going to have.
But until this time comes, we're just going to go to the dream.
Don't depression is the definition of quality in the world.
In the United States, it's close to 10 percent of the adults are diagnosed with depression.
But because it's a mental illness, it can be much harder to build than, say, a high asteroid.
One main source of wearing is the difference between being a depression and just feel accurate.
It's almost all of them feel accurate every time.
It's going to get a bad piece, to lose work, to make sure, even a day can bring us emotions of objects.
Sometimes it doesn't have a device at all.
It's just jumping because of a place.
And then the reasons change, and these nervous feelings go.
Democrat is different.
It's a health disorder, and it's not just going to be because you want.
He's left at least two weeks of curiosity, and it's significant to a person's ability to work, play, or love.
The depression can be a lot of different symptoms: a huge wind condition, an interview of things that you're usually enjoying, the transformation of the bone, the sense of inevitable or an extension, a too low or too low, a lower, uncomfortable, uncomfortable or energy, or computational computers.
If you've got at least five of these symptoms, by the psychiatric, you're falling into a depression.
And it's not just behaviors.
The depression has the prosperity in the brain.
First of all, there's changes that can show in an unfamous eye and a Nazine Iraq.
It's all small academic and smaller and smaller walls.
In a smaller scale, depressive depression to some things: the unusual or the remote of Nigeria's cartoons, mostly San Franciscin, Mr. Franciscin, and the Francisco, a little bit of devastating areas, or transformative changes of REM's weapons, and insects are
But brain scientists still don't have a picture of what makes depression.
It looks like it's a complex action between the genes and the environment, but we don't have an invisible tool that can predict where or when it's going to happen.
And because a depression isn't emotional, it's hard to know who might look okay but actually struggle.
In the National GDP, it takes the average person that suffers from a more mental illness for years to ask help.
But there are very effective treatments.
Social drugs and mammograms each other so that every one represents the brain chemistry.
In extreme cases, electrical market treatment, which is like a patient's switch in the green brain, they're also very effective.
Otherwise treatments, like a rock in a golden genetic gene, they're also stupid.
So, if you know someone who's struggling with depression, they're going to look at them, looking for some of these options.
You may have been invented to help in expectations, like looking for a culture in the region, or do a list of questions to ask the doctor.
Somebody with depression, these first results can show inevitable to the past.
If they feel guarantee or a mother, they showed them that depression is a healthy situation, just like asteroid or a conservation.
It's not a shame or an artist neighborhood, and they don't need to expect themselves to come up with it more than they can convince themselves to come up with a bad arm.
If you didn't have a depression of yourself, you've got it to the time that you've killed as accurate.
The equation of what they're hoping to be emotionally normal objects can make them feel safe on their ancestors.
Even just talking about depression can help.
For example, a study shows that somebody's asked about security computers actually represents the risk to lose.
It's an open conversation about mental illness is helping to discover the traffic and makes it easier for people to ask help.
And as the patients are looking for treatment, scientists will learn more about depression, and treatments will be done.
So I'm under a brain.
And like most of my colleagues, I need to deal, every day, with human tragedy.
I look at how your life can change one second to another after a spinal or after a rock of ways.
And what's conducted for us is to understand that, in addition to other men in the body, the brain has very little capacity to fix itself.
And after a hard surprise of your main nervous system, the hospital are often left with compassion disorder.
And it's probably the reason I've chosen to be underneath a very short brain.
What's it that's going to develop a short brain?
It's a doctor who's trying to improve ecosystem through different strategies.
You've probably heard about one of the refugees called deep, where you're a electronic partnership in the brain and the brain of the brain to predict some of News to improve ecosystems.
It's a really amazing technology that it's spending the future of patients with Frankson's future, with a remote, with a blindness.
However, ecosystem doesn't mean a biological theater.
And the dream of a mental brain is to fix the brain.
I think we're focusing on the dream.
And I'd like to show you that we're very close to it.
And with a little help, the brain can help itself.
So the story started 15 years ago.
At the same time, I was the main, and I worked days and night in the imagination room.
A lot of times I had to treat patients with traumatic train in the head.
You need to imagine that when a patient comes up with a privilege, the brain is moving, and it's reducing the pressure in its golden.
And to save his life, you need to reduce this golden pressure.
And to do that, you sometimes need to make a piece of the brain.
So instead of throwing these pieces of common brain, we decided with Januan Francisco, which is my daughter, biologist, to explore them.
Why do I mean that?
We wanted to grow cells from these refugees.
It's not a coffee.
A tumor tumor tumor is a little bit like a really small tumor out of their family.
So you need to discover the right materials, the heat, the heat and all the right environments to make them switch.
So this is exactly what we had to do with these cells.
And after a lot of experiences, Jan Francisco did this.
And this is what he saw under the microscope.
And it was, for us, a big surprise.
Why?
Because it looks exactly the same thing like a stem cells, with big green cells that flow small cells and not in the water.
And you may remember a biological lesson that stem cells are no cells, that can become any kind of cell in the body.
The adult brain has stem cells, but they're very rare and they're surrounded by deep and small and little bit of the brain.
So it was surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the extinct part of the brain that we had in the surgery room.
And there's another interesting concept: normal stem cells are very active cells -- cells that come in, parts, parts are very quickly.
And they'll never die, they're cells of my life to win.
But these cells are different.
They're spending down, and after a few weeks of culture, they're even waiting.
So we've been before a new population of cells and strange cells that we've been like stem cells, but another behavior.
And it took us a long time to understand where they came.
They came from these cells.
The hospital cells and the red cells are called regulation stem cells.
You all have them in the brain.
They represent four percent of the brain's brain in your face.
They have a really important role during the development.
When you'd go, they've helped your brain to treat itself.
But why do they stay in the head?
That, we don't know.
We think they may be transparency in the brain corner because we find them much easier to move in the brain.
But it's not sure.
But there's one obvious thing -- these cells, we've got our fabric culture.
And we were before a new source of cells to fix the brain.
And we had to prove it.
So in order to prove that, we decided to plan an an an experimentation.
The idea was to do biology of some of the brain in part of the brain's unfamous part, and then I'm going to give the cells exactly the way Januan Francisco did it in the lab.
And then I'm going to switch them, put them in order to be able to track them in the brain.
And the last step was to reduce them in the same person.
We call it autobiologists -- autonomous.
So the first question we had was, "What would happen if we put these cells in a normal brain, and what would happen if we take those cells in the brain?"
Design for the help of a professor Radian Radia, we worked with customers.
So in the first case, we changed the cells in normal brains and what we've seen is completely disappeared after a few weeks, as if they're going to take out of the brain, they've come back, the space's already full, they don't wait there, so they're going to go.
In the other case, we've made a surprise, and we've changed exactly the same cells, and in this case, the cells are left -- and they've become a fabric.
And that's the picture of what we looked at under the microscope.
These are the cells that were invented.
And the conversation they're about, these little dots, these are the cells that we're going to get inside, when they've been in a house.
But we couldn't stop here, of course.
Is these cells also help customers change after the surprise?
So for that, we've lost customers to do a commercial task.
They had to bring food capacity.
They were very good at this.
And when they came to the level of the advantage of actions, we did an injury in their modern motion that's going to be able to do with the hand.
So the customers were thrown in my hands, they couldn't move their hands more.
And just as the people were doing, they had been translated from a certain level, just the same thing as a summer.
Civil are completely comfortable, and then they're trying to transform in the face of the brain's privacy, they're translated to some point, just like the coffees.
So when we were safe that the coffee came to his level of San Francisco, we changed his cells.
So on the left, you're seeing the coffee that's been translated from San Francisco.
It's about 40 to 50 percent of his previous actions before the surprise.
It's not so accurate, not so fast.
And you'll see now, when we've changed the cells: two months after the changed, the same one.
So these were also very exciting results for us, I'm telling you.
Since then, we realized much more about these cells.
We know that we can sell them in the speech, we can use them later.
We know that we can start with models of ecosystems, like Frankson, for example.
But our dream is still to put them in people.
And I'm really hopeful that I could show you in most of the human brain gives us the tools to fix itself.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, in our bossi Guinsa: Jollin, it's amazing, and I'm sure right now, there's a number of people in the audience, probably most of them think, "I know somebody who can use it."
I know, anyway.
And of course, the question is, what are the biggest benefits before we go to clinical trials in human beings?
Jollin Babylin: The largest song is emotion. So, from these emotional results, you need to be about two pounds of paper and plants to be able to go through this kind of experiments.
BG: It's obvious, the brain is better, and so on.
GG: Yeah, it's better, but it takes a long time and a lot of curiosity and a little bit of professional team to do it, you know?
BG: If you listen to yourself -- when you've done the research and try to get ridiculous to start in experiments, if you add yourself in time, how many years until someone comes to hospital and this piece will be right?
GG: So, it's very hard to say.
It depends on first, in a decade of the experiment.
Can we do that in most?
And then, you have to do this kind of research in a small group of patients.
So it takes, for a long time to choose patients, do the treatment and appreciate if it's effective to do this kind of treatment.
And then you've got to take it to a central experiment.
You have to really prove that first is effective before you invent this treatment for everyone.
BG: And in Tony, of course.
BG: Of course. BG: Gablin, thank you at TED to share it with us.
BG: Thank you.
Thank you.
What's those who have the most fear of violence?
This peer's fight?
Now, this liquid?
Or is this famous device?
This is a question from now.
Even though they're tremendous, they're treated, and species, and other magnitude materials, when it comes to thousands, they're pretty much the same thing.
So what does that mean to your diet?
First of all, carbon is the physical theory to the summer and the molecules that your body is paralyzed to create conservatives.
Olympics can be simple or complex depends on their structure.
It's a simple summer, or a chicken.
Gulgas, protoxic, and gas is all simple insects.
And two of them together, and you've got Derrra, Luxis, luck, or congestion.
Five complex levels, on the other hand, there's three or more simple agencies that come together.
Thanks of complex activities with three to 10 conservatives from connected are ecologist.
These are more than 10, they're politicians.
While you can, your body is spread these complexity of complexity into a neural building, where your cells can be used as energy.
So when you eat every rich food in the fifth, your summer's summer in your body, usually about a crowd.
But your business system doesn't respond to all the French equally.
Think about Hollyn and Chinese, both of them are politicians, that they're coming from plants, that they're both complicated from thousands of museums that are connected together, but they're connected together in a different way, and it changes the effect that they have on the body.
In Malin, the plants are mostly challenged to energy in sensors and forests, the molecules of gas are connected together by the public, most of them can be reduced by anthropy in your business system.
But in many ways, the connections between modern molecules are Kenyan, that your body can't just look at.
Cities can track a little bit of peace, prevent it to your mind, what makes something called a president.
So the rich tools in Malin, like curiosity and their son, they're focused on, they're releasing a lot of gas into your blood, exactly what's going on if you've done something that's done in the globe, like a secret.
These leaders have high seas, the states that I can spend the sum of the summer on your blood.
Lada and their son has a similar female, because they have a similar effect on the summer.
But when you're eating food in many ways, like mammals, elephants, and artificial genes, the invisible budget of these tools from the summer of gas to their blood.
These cases have a lower federal, and feeding tools like bones, Genna, and the bridge has the most lowest agenda.
When trains move away from the tremendous system, your body goes into action to get them into your shelf there, it can be a lot of energy.
Ninstein, the hormone that's made of heart, is one of the main tools of the body's body's boat.
When you're eating and your blood summer costs, you're not an insulin in into the blood.
It's motivated to your muscles and your genome to give to Los to get in and start the crisis of sugar to energy.
It's an insulin of insulin from the summer of the summer in the summer helps us understand something called insulin.
As an insulin's data that's infinitely reduced the summer in the blood, you have more sensitive to insulin.
If you're sensitive to insulin, it's known as insulin.
The heart is still sending insulin, but cells, mostly muscle cells, responds less and less and less to it, so the summer's not successful to the street, and the insulin is continuing.
There's a lot of carbon emissions can lead to insulin, and a lot of scientists believe that intuitive insulin leads to a remote situation called the Southern Kenyan.
It's a lot of symptoms, including a high summer in the blood, on the bottom, and it's a high person.
It's increasing the risk of developing situations, like blood disease and conservation two.
And her brains get quickly around the world.
For 32 percent of the population in the United States, there's a mammogram.
So let's go back to your iPhone.
Whether your food is scared or not, the sugar is a summer, and too fear can be a problem.
So maybe you'd like to give up the Social Foundation in Los Angeles Barwin.
Scientists are programming.
So people, organizations, and lawyers spend their most important decisions of information from Morgan.
But there's a problem with that.
Anyway of statistics can be something that's broken in it, something that can make the results completely.
For example, imagine you need to choose between two patients to surgery of a adult microbial.
Over the last 1,000 hospital of every hospital, 900 survived in a hospital, while only 800 survived in a hospital.
So it seems like a hospital hospital is a better choice.
But before you make a decision, remember that not all the patients come to the hospital with the same level of health.
And if we're part of all the last 1,000 patients' hospital's hospital that came up with good health and those who came up with bad health, the picture starts to show very different.
In a hospital, there were only 100 patients who had come in the green health, from 30 survived.
But to a hospital in the '60s, and they were able to save 210.
So a hospital in June is a better choice for patients who come up with green health, with the survival of 55 percent.
And what if your next health is good when it comes to the hospital?
Unfortunately, hospital is still the good choice, with more than 98 percent.
So how can a hospital be better at the end of the survival, if a hospital in a hospital, there's a higher percent of the two groups?
What we've got is a case of France Francisco France, where the same set of information can show the effects depends on how you jump it.
It's a lot of times going on when information comes out of a cell changes depends on, and sometimes it's known as a organic transformation, which is another piece of object that affects the results.
Here, the fossil gene is the relationship of the patients who come in good health or green.
France Francisco is not just a natural situation.
It's too affected in the real world, sometimes in important connections.
One study in England showed that a few years there's a higher skill rate for a long period of 10 years.
It means, until you put the participants on the age of an age that shows that there's not a significant adult, and that's why, there's a higher chance that they're in the experiment, just because they're living more generally.
Here, the age group is transformative, and it's about reducing the information.
In another example, Antarctica's decline of Florida's death, they find that they don't have a stem cell cell phones in the corner between the nurses that are black to the boys who were killed in the wall.
But it's a lot of cases by the victim stem tells a different story.
In any situation, they put black holes were much more likely to jump into death.
The high selective levels were a little bit to put in the fact of the fact that studies with victims were more likely to travel in death than cases in which the victims were black, and most of the walls were happening between people from the same stem.
So how do we move from Paul Freex?
Unfortunately, there's no answer that comes to everything.
Technology can be scared and pulled in every number of ways, and numbers can sometimes give a more accurate picture of information that's designed to categories or muscles.
Everything we can do is explore the states that statistics come out and voice if you're transparency may be.
Otherwise, we spend ourselves surprising to those who were using information to predict others and take their jungles.
Trimetry is everywhere in nature, and we're usually going to get it into the sky: it's a perfect way, or a village with complex examples that's being scared on every wall.
But it turns out that intuition is also quite important, and more common than you think, cartoons with one enormous toxic tool that their chimpanzees are always looking at the same way.
How many species of metaphors are coming up with their trees just in the argument, others, just against the argument, and even the human body looks pretty different from the outside, it's a different story from face.
Most of your teenagers are organized in regulation.
The heart, the wall, the blue, and the heart is on the left.
You're a song and you're in your bedroom right.
Even your lungs are different.
Basically there's two nations, and in three.
The two sides of your brain looks similar, but a different function.
To worry that the symmetry is about the right way it's critical.
If all of your inner organisms work, a situation called Stos Intus, it's most unhappy.
But we can't be perfect, especially if the heart is involved.
But where the diversity of malaria comes from, because a new teacher looks like the left and the right.
One theory is focused on one background in the country called Obama.
It's a machine that's based on the walls that's called Syla, when the blood is far away from the head and roads around the speed, they're all in the same way.
This conservation is a dinosaurs on the right side of the left to the left.
On the left side of the edge, other simulations feel the current movement and collecting specific genes on the left of the river.
These genes are driving the cells to create certain proteins, and you're just a few hours, the right side and the left of a chemistry.
Even though they're still identical, these chemicals are translated at the end of the men not symmetric.
Social disciplines looks first at the heart.
It begins as a brilliant pilot over the middle of the mirror, but when it's about three weeks, the piano begins to move into the lights of the Chicago around the right side of the body.
It's growing different structures all over the side, and at the end it becomes the summer and not a symbol.
Now, in the time, the other organisms invent centuries and grow into their final universe.
But for some organisms, like muscles, don't have these critical workers and they still have internal organisms.
Can all the cells be unprecedented in their own?
It's probably.
Social boxes grow up in the scanning that everybody's looking at the same direction, and human cells that are many of the high boundaries in the walls of telescopes to move like the fingerprint on the corner.
If we focus even more, we see that a lot of the basic building blocks of the cell, like a basis of the basis, proteins, and agriculture, they don't predict them.
The weapons have complex forms, and these proteins are control what kind of insecure cells and what a symbolic workers look like.
These biological molecules have a machine called female, which means that it's molecule and its view doesn't identify.
Like your right hand and your left, they look at the same thing, but put the right hand in the left map to prove that they're not.
It's not this symmetry at at the level of microbial translates in cells that don't have symmetry, and eventually organisms don't exist.
So while Timmetry may be beautiful, intuitive disciplines from itself, that we're going to expect the extinctions, its complexity theory, and it's not its privilege.
The invention I've shown here two years ago, I've been over 2000 years ago.
I'm showing that I'm a morning is a short, and I'm showing it for the first time -- I don't have a contract or need to get the wall; I'm actually trying to move it.
Because I've designed it to stand up with this extinct challenge.
And the great invention of Central Archie reminded me that the religion, if you understand it right, it's not about faith, it's about behavior.
Maybe we have to say it's also about optimism.
How are we going to be optimistic?
The optimistic is often as eight.
Like an intuitive girl, as the Tasma Gandhi said, "You've got to have a change that you're going to see in the world."
And the result, we've got to feel optimistic, you're not going to be just the belief, but in a way of creating a new behavior, but the word "behavior is also, I think, it's not very good at that context.
I'm a big demand in the past to the unemployment and the British cars and the Turkey and I've been using 33 weapons on our lives, we've been reduced in autonomous lights, and we've done everything you need.
But the more important thing to replace the electricity generations, it's more important to replace the rules.
And when we change our behavior in the daily life, we often reduce the civil and the static perspective, to feel optimistic about it, we need to be very active as our democracy.
To solve the climate crisis, we have to solve democracy crisis.
And we have this crisis.
It's a long time I'm trying to tell this story.
I recently mentioned him one woman, who went to the table where I sat down, and he just looked at me. She was a 70s and a teenager. I didn't talk about it until I saw an eye that I was repeated and repeated from the other direction, and again, "What's your three?"
And she said, "If you've made the value to the black, you'd see exactly like Al." Before many years ago, when I was a young friend of Congress, I've been asked a lot of time to treat the nuclear device, the nuclear device.
And the Germanian historians were taught me at the same time of struggle, which, by the CEOs, the Central Act of three kinds of types: local states, interior war or creativity, and the kind of extended, but the kind of important war, the world's war.
And all of the struggle of struggling with a different resources, a different approach, a different organic model.
And also environmental challenges come to those three types and most of these kinds of evidence that we're trying to know are local environmental problems: air pollution, pollution pollution, but there's also environmental problems in environments, like the Western West to the Middle East, and Western Europe from the Middle East to the Middle East, and the West of the
And so many of these. But the climate crisis is the kind of great, but the important one: the global struggle or strategy.
It's all surprising. And we have to organize our response in the face. We need a world of global warming energy for fear, useful, effective, and beyond global economy.
And we can raise resources and political resources.
Let me show you these slides.
And I thought to start with the logo. What's missing here, of course, is the ice of the North Pole.
Genland remained. 28 years ago, so you look at the ice of the North Koreans at the end of the summer and the beauty inequality of the president.
I've been at the last conference, I've been looking at the center of the oil data and the ice in Brothers, Korea, and I've been talking to the studies here in Monterai, in the early lab to predict academic actions.
This is what happened during the last 28 years.
For collection, the last baby was in 2005.
That's what happened in the last end that's used to take the studies.
It's in the same graphic corner, it doesn't look like this, but it's exactly the size of the United States, less than the size of the size of Eric Arian.
The states that came in 2005 is equally equal to all the surface of the Middle East to Chinese.
It's the amount of violence that's been done in the last summer is worth it. It's repeat, but it's not a constant, but it's as a blueprint, it's going to be completely invisible in the summer, within five years.
It's a metaphor from a lab on Genland.
Now, around the Arcom -- it's a famous village in Alexandria. It's a city in New England, in Antarctica: the last studies of NASA.
The primary amount of reduction is reduced by an area of the size of California.
"These were the good ones in the time, there were the bad ones in the time: the most famous open sentence in English literature. I want to tell you about the story" between two pounds. "
There's the same amount of carbon.
But the difference is that on Arab, from the Fedom of Foundation is conducted with the time of the atmosphere, and the background in coal, natural gas, natural gas and so on, and it's on its exhibition in the atmosphere. The difference is that our atmosphere is at the average temperature of 15 degrees. It's about
It's not because it's a little bit closer to the sun.
It's about three times as a beach, which is the most expensive to the sun. Now, in a cave, it's a picture that you've seen already, from the early images, I'm showing it because I want to do a little bit of a PPPED.
The global scientific community says, global heat from the person is coming into the atmosphere, causing it, and it's more likely than the great axis.
You all know it. In the last governance of the scientific climate change wanted to answer the question, "How safe you're sure?" They wanted to answer, "99 percent."
The Chinese were born, and the training was "over 90 percent."
Now, you'll say the players, "Just a minute, you might be changes in this energy that comes out of the sun."
If more energy goes out in the way, the philosophy is that here will be more hot and here's more expensive.
It's the lower atmosphere and it's the training: more happened.
Chile's Chip.
And here's the good news: 68 percent of Americans believe today that human activity is responsible to global warming. 69 percent believe that the Earth's affected in a significant way, but here's the key: the challenges of challenges that have to solve, the global warming is still close.
What's unprecedented is a transformation.
If you're agreed with my work surgery, but you don't feel extended, what does it mean to you?
Well, "The Council of the climate," I'm going to be on a woman with "Kenyan," which has been working on volunteers, a global station of apartments that will bring this message.
It's the president.
AB: I'm going to take all of the participants -- in 2007, the BC journalist, they've published 996 questions to presidents: two of them have gone to the climate crisis. E.C.: 84 questions, about climate crisis.
PS: 2. SA: Two. SM: AS: AS.
It's one of the most powerful tasks.
So here's what we do.
It's a fuel of fuel in all these countries, and it's us.
But it's not just in developing countries.
The developing countries in our bodies and adopt the rate, and in fact, the chimps of all this year is worth in 1965, and they're driving us at the most dramatic rate. Freedom: by 2025, they're actually going to be where we've found in 1985.
If we went to the rich countries from the picture, we still had this crisis.
But we've been taught to developing developing technologies and the way the thought that's made the crisis. It's in polio.
Here's the dialogue in a number of seconds.
The 1970s, the '80s,' 90s. We need to stop it, and the good news.
We can. We have technologies.
We're going to need an extended view of how to treat this: the war in the world and the challenge to reduce the galleries of the rich countries, all of these have a single and simple solution.
People ask, "What is the solution?"
Well, here's it. You've got the coal. We're going to need a post of a wouldn't communicate, instead of the conventional experiment that's invented in School -- and there's things we've changed since the 20th century.
In the world, we have to take the response to the countries with the solutions to the climate crisis.
The programs for the war in Uganda will be reduced by resistance if we didn't get the climate crisis.
But the response can really make a difference in the poor countries, and it's a surprise that you've talked about in Europe.
She came out of the magazine magazine. "They're spending into a weird energy, the friends in a giant corner, to provide all the electricity consumption in Europe, mostly from developing countries.
It's a high season, it's not in the sky. It's possible.
We need to do it for our economy.
The last numbers show that the old model isn't working. There's a lot of big investments that you can do. If you're going to invest in a family or a family, you're getting an investment that's going to have an investment under their fear.
And it's based on the old model.
Some of them find teachers in their emotions, as a question in their bodies or their legs, they're curious and family open and family open to it. Here's just some of the investments that I'm personally personalized with.
I'm a background in her, so I've got the previous discovery.
But neurons and neutral cells are accumulated, rapical signals, the sun energy, efficient and useful.
You've seen this slide.
But there's a difference. The only two countries that didn't survive, and now there's only one.
And in Australia, there's been a mammogram that's generated from TV, the Internet and radio in a magnitude to move the sense of extension in them.
And we've made 250 people to show the investment in every city, a village and a teenager in Australia.
A lot of other things have made it, but the new government of the first new government that's going to change the first place of Australia in Australia, and that's how they did. They've been aware of it, in a way of a fabric of the fingerprinting that I had.
It's a piece of paper. My father's friend Kenyan said that if we got to the lights that are coming up, like we've been able to the classes, we'd call it in East East Center, and they say it's going to go to the Atlantic.
We can't reduce the form of the kind of inevitation in Australia to change our political culture.
Another good news. Times are in the United States that can be scared in Kenya.
It's already about 780, and I think I've seen another one looking there, just to give it a local meaning.
And that's good news. Lesday, we've heard a few days ago that the value of personal transportation has been done so much until it's become allie and I've made.
We need a new generation of heroes. These are us who live in the United States of America today, but also in the rest of the world, we need to figure out that history gives us a choice -- just like John Beltt Twitter has shown how to save her life in the world's amazing, and that's what's going on.
We've got a culture of a concept.
But we're data in a state of Palestine.
And we have to find a way to create, in the generation of the day, a sense of imagination.
I wish I could find the words to express it.
It was another generation of heroes that brought democracy to this planet.
Another generation there's a tremendous, and we're going to have the four women's trees.
We can do that. Don't tell me that we don't have the power.
He had the value of a week, and the value of a week was spending on a lot of war that challenge.
We have the ability to do that.
I'm optimistic, because I believe we have the capacity, a big challenge, to put on the side of the scientific conference and reduce the challenge that the history of us.
I'm often asking people who are listening to the institutions of the climate crisis say, "Oh, it's so terrible.
It's such a lab. "I'd ask you to save it in a new context. How many generations in all of human history have been to invite art to come up with our best challenge?
A challenge that would be able to produce more of us than we thought we could? I think, we have to go to this challenge in a deep sense of conversation and the power that we're going to have for years from the day to go to the rest of the day to remember the feedback and the metaphors, and they'd say, "They've had the ones that had to solve this
Let's do it. Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Many of the TED Talk is very deep at the end of the end of the eye of Texas, in one worse problem, a very bad eye problem is to be heard in this in the last eight years in which you could define these things.
And it's a pain.
DP: You don't have a sense of how much. []]]]]]]] []]]]]] When you
The answer is hard to me because on one hand, I think we have to brain about the fact that the restaurant of Kenyan -- a certain restaurant -- John Minkin, and the two of the secrets on the side of the museums -- all of the three different interventions in the past, and they've got their leadership, and they're very different than the government
Each idea and consciousness is trained by coal.
"And now, even more gas.
"Oh, and we're going to have our unprecedented democracy, we don't make the basis for the same damage that's really going to need us.
So they're saying the right things and polio -- who's in the song -- can do the right thing, but let's tell you: when I went back in 1997 in a Western sense of happiness that we've come out there, and then I've come out of the United States, and then I've got a student of the United States
This challenge is a part of our culture all.
The Social Foundation is simple as the air that we've taken from an airport.
And now we've made this process to be ready, this pattern of pattern has to be extended, scale and speed of change beyond everything we've done before.
And so I started saying, there was optimistic in what you do, but there was an active citizen.
It requires the electricity generations, but also the rules.
We need to move our voice. We need to solve democracy -- our democracy has to be done.
And we need to change that. We'll take the Internet.
You've got a relationship with people. They're doing very active as citizens.
The Chicago Kaya -- we couldn't have more insects that produce a coal of coal that's not able to collect and reduce the FDP, and that means we have to go to the river and build the new magnitude.
It's not talking about this level. But I believe that between today to the past, it's possible.
The United States for the defense of the climate is going to get a journey to the Amazon Guinees, Famies on TV and the Internet, radio, newspapers -- with all the faces of the faces to the Tim and Desians.
We need help. We need help.
In terms of progress in the personal role, don't, have something beyond that you want to stop?
I wish I could find the answer to this question. What can I do?
In October French once wrote, "If the future of all human culture would depend on me, what should I do?
"It depends on each of us, but again, not just with electricity.
Most of us here Americans. We have democracy.
We can change things. But it has to be an active change.
What's actually exposed is a higher level of consciousness.
And it's hard -- it's hard to consume -- but it's happening.
There's also an old African that some of you know and he says, "If you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far away, go together."
So we need a change in consciousness.
Social change. It's a new sense of transformation.
A new consumption of the right that we've been able to take on ourselves a challenge.
Don't make you very much for TED.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
In 26, in January, 2013, a group of active action to the Kenya came into the ancient ancient city in the Southern House of School.
There, they brought a 30,000 pounds of the Middle East that was written in East and a number of African languages and came up with an astronomy, history and medicine, including one book that might be the first treatment of a healthy.
It wasn't known in the West, it was the collective collection of a second, the voice of Africa while we thought that Africa wasn't a voice at all.
The mayor's head of the Mexico, which is in the event, called the "Freedom" spread against the world culture. "
And he was right -- or he was, if it wasn't in the fact that he was also a list.
In fact, just before, African teachers collected a series of old books and left them out in the Syrians to survive.
Today, the collection is scared in the box, the choice of Marley, a lot of high school workers.
What's been scared in the patient is again at risk, this time by climate.
But Africa, and the components of the world, they're not the only places, or even the main places that can change the history of the world's history.
A few years ago, I've done a study of professors and I found that, in Monna, there's 60,000 wrote from 1,500 people who don't read water's chicken, right, work and materials come from.
The real book is probably a fire of it, and it doesn't even bring in the mirror of the magazines and modern and cultural diversity like chicken.
What if there was a technology that could return the jobs and unknown?
Imagine a world of how a mirror of hundreds of thousands of texts can't change our knowledge on the past.
Imagine what agriculture isn't known to rebuild the customers of the books, the history, the philosophy, the music -- or, in a more effective way, you can rewrite our cultures, build new bridges between people and many people.
These are the questions that we've changed me from the Middle East, called Texas, to Texas.
It's not a word that "read."
For me, it's made images of psychiatric, of someone who's sitting in a prison in a blueprint of knowledge that's going to get in a small, and a way.
How much better to be participated in the past, a experience in her country has changed, searching for the executive techniques.
As an academic, I was just reading.
I read and learned the same agencies that people read and taught for hundreds of years -- and normal, alone, president -- and with every Mr. Mr. Smith that I've been invited to a smaller human knowledge.
What I wanted to be an ecologist of the past, a series of service, Iranians without the judge -- or, in fact, with the market.
And I wanted it not only to myself but I wanted it to my students.
And so six years ago, I sat down a career.
At the same time, I was working on the "The" Love "," the last Amazon of Europe's Middle Eastery that has never been done.
And she didn't train because she was there in a single hand that was also so proud of the cells on the back of the other world's nurse that generations of learning about it as a bedroom.
For five years, I've been working with Alexandria Center in Nigeria to return the lights of the car and I came to everything that technology at the time could offer me.
And so I did what many people did.
I went to the web, and I found out about how Scoti School was used to return the two boundaries of the magazine magazine mathematician from the French of the 13th century.
French is a hand that's been written and wrote about it.
And so, all of a sudden, I decided to write to the idea of the leadership in the French project of Egyptian, a professor of Roberon, with a plan.
And I realized, he actually wrote back.
With his help, I was able to win the United States of the United States to build a National Social School, and with this lab, I became what was in a long, and I was able to make a new season.
So how does Scoti Teslan actually work?
Well, the idea behind Scoti Teslan is something that every one of you recognize an infinitely inevitable interview: what we can see in the eye is just a tiny part of what's in fact.
The same thing is true to invisible.
Our system is using 12 organisms of light between the alcohol and the Iranian and Iran, and it's infant on the top of the top of the LED, and a other satellite or a other satellite that's left through the individual's face.
It's until 35 photos of photos to pushing on this way using a powerful digital camera that's going to do with a strength and a summer.
There's about five of those in the world.
And once you take these images, we're bringing them through static algorithms to define their speech, using a software that's designed to make images that satellite and find people like genes and the CIA.
The results can be awesome.
You may have already heard about what we're going to do to the gold, which is that we're going to take a palma.
In using red insector, we were able to read even in the most important corporations of the moon.
You may not be aware, with that, to other cases of aid.
Here, for example, it's a page of a hand that we've taken, of course, the most high valuable value in the world.
The Kenyx and California is the most ancient part of the girl's girl's daughter, and it's been reduced to the first half of the 20th century.
It's the closest that it can get to the DNA at the same time of the basis of the base of the walls under the San Franciscin, and at the same time of a Nigeria, when you've put on the basic belief of the walls.
This hand, unfortunately, is very difficult, and it's been reduced because for hundreds of years, it was used and treated in the fingerprints in the platform.
In fact, this contrast that you see in the top left corner is a refugee, which is a trick that's happening in the hands of a person who has an explanation.
Our characteristics can me create the first education of the hand at 250 years.
When there's a lab that can measure collections where it takes, with it, it's just part of the solution.
Technology is going to happen and rare, and the diversity and the vision of the picture is athetic.
It means that the areas are beyond the defense of most studies and only for the most rich machines.
So I've lost the project to the Los Angeles, a blueprint that doesn't have a long-term demand to explore individual studies and smaller institutions or completely low.
Over the last five years, our team of modern scientists, learning and students were going to seven different countries and return some of the highest values in the world, including a book and Serri, which is the most ancient book in English, the world's largest book of Canadan, and for a few of the most valuable and the most valuable values that are going to happen when it's done.
So, Syrian Teslan can repeat telescopes.
And more in the laws, with that, it can return two story behind each other, the story of how, when and by Text was created, and sometimes, what the secret was thinking at the same time.
Please, for example, the Tita's text of the hundreds of nerve written in Homas's hands, which some of my colleagues have lost a few years ago in Congress.
The fingers noticed that one night of the length of a minute and wrote a restaurant.
The word that wrote was "citizens."
Maybe you can push what the word that's going on.
"Tim."
There, ladies and gentlemen, are the American democracy evolved under Homas's Homas Jerson.
Or you're going to get the chicken from 141, which we've been talking about in the Soviet School.
It was the map that Sovius probably won it before he sat into the new world and gave him the idea of how Asia looked and where beautiful is.
The problem with the map is that the chimpanzees and the studio went so much over the time that this map is two and a half of the metaphors, made a world like a giant talk.
By now, we had a very small idea, a spinning idea, of what Koreans knew about the world and how the global culture is coming up.
The main principles of the map was completely unfamous under a normal light.
Olympic light helped it very little.
Social Storney gave us everything.
In Asia, we've found chimps with so long ears so they could take all the body of the creatures.
In Africa, it's about being able to make a nation to do.
Like a planets, that can transform images of the way the universe looks at the past of the far, so a Statian light can take us to the first fossil moves of creating object.
Throughout the price, we've been looking at mates, in the opinion, in Iraq, in the unfinished computers, in the privilege of the human imagination that enables these space objects and their finds to become more artificial, which become the history of history to build us more.
What about the future?
There's so many of the past, and so little people with the capabilities to save him before these objects are going to win.
So we started teaching these new strategies that I call them "Titanic science."
Textent science is that we're preparing between traditional corporations -- the ability to read ancient languages, the knowledge of how techniques are created to be able to buy them -- with new techniques like science, the chemistry of radio and radiation, identical identical identities.
Last year, a student in my classroom, the first year, with a bionic background, a picture of French Foundation that we've tried in Mexico in the Olympic.
And when he worked, a city mayors started to show behind the text.
Everybody was collected around, and he was called the Olympic work of the Greek Turkey School.
It was the first time for a year that these words were in a coffee.
At that moment, it became a learning.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the future of the past.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
You've found the secret pipes, you've come from the secret code, and now you're going to end up at the end of the ancient accident in the city of the bank.
But when you're exploring the ancient components in a needle that's nearly transparency, two of the students who give you to climate.
Think of a sudden, although a green green green walls and the walls start to get more.
You're going to save your life, you're coming to the room that you've been doing before with five curiosity, including it's leaving to the wind and it's leaving back.
It's the tremendous door in the middle of a wall right now, with less than it's going to fix, and it's just with the walls of the walls tell you that you don't want to be in the environment when it happens.
What you remember in the way in the face, it will take about 20 minutes to get a high rate.
You know it's the last level before the piece, but your sixth of the way you're going, and there's no one remember the way.
If you're an hour, you have to be enough time to explore one group of the four trials and return to this room, and they're all going to be in the right way.
There's just one problem; the device is told about the luck of the wind: the walls of you and the city is going to be able to reduce them to the red way.
Remember the green eye, you realize that two of the students were born.
Every time, one of them or two can be liked, although they can also say the truth.
You know that agriculture didn't take you, but you don't know what the students can trust, and because the musician students may only happen sometimes, there's no way to look at them in order to put them out of a kitchen.
Can you find a way to ensure you'll be able to win?
Don't worry that the musician students would take you or move to others.
This night only affects their communication.
Go the video now if you want to understand it alone!
An answer: Three answer in time: 2 answer in time: 1 is the first thing to understand is that, because you know you're not happy, you can explore one of the spaces alone.
It's from eight students to the rest of the three things.
You'll send four groups of just two insects will not help because if one group comes from two seconds in two seconds, you're going to have to switch in the kitchen.
But I'm going to take them into a road and two third third will work every time, and here's why.
The machine students may be done, and these are not, but you know there are only two of them, while the other woman will always say the truth.
When every group comes back to the central community, all the friends will change the same answer or so they could find the piece.
If a third comes back in the road, then you know that no one of them doesn't go.
However, you can't be safe in any shape, but everything you need is real faces about three of things.
You can understand yourself through intuition.
Of course, it doesn't matter if you've got to discover the piece of yourself, but another, to connect everything together with three possibilities.
If any group remains an answer, or everyone says the truth, or the two students who are fake.
Anyway, they've been reduced from the pair.
If there's just one group that's designed, the two lives of saying the truth, and if there's two projects, then the weird students in the roads and you can switch in most of the third and less people in each other will say the truth.
The crisis is read behind you as green teachers come out of the students.
You're all safe and free of the night.
After the building, you tell the group that everyone comes free, and in a case you have another government that's called.
After the French French revolution in 1989, Europe has been reduced to Ocus.
So, there's a lot of countries that have been reduced by the 60s, and they're going to take the new plastics, while in the house, extremes and intuition between fingerprints and treating water.
In the center of this project, powerful personality came before the surface and a code on the France.
But did she invent the revolution or showed it?
"San, Dr., who's the president today? I don't see anybody."
"The judgment, it's fantastic to look at France, the tree that's almost every Europe to jump on our own independence of being low low."
"In fact, Nigerian was average at the time.
The idea that it was low only comes from a British of time of war.
And he didn't expect.
He's got on the young restaurant because he's declined with the Islamic Money. "
"By the government's government and reducing the strength of power?"
"Bono, as a young and succeeding and succeeding, Nigerian is full of the French revolutionary revolution, and Iranians will make: strength, equality and sisters.
But the mechanisms didn't be ready for real leaders.
Robert and the customers who were the first to go to the scanner when they were on the population of Twitter's population, with their anthropic and their unusual, unusual regulations of everyone who didn't agree with.
And the public peace that decided to take them, there was an unstable geographic and reduced capacity.
They had a more powerful leader that could control a few and happiness. "
"So, France went all the revolution just to do with another uncomfortable trick?"
"No exactly.
The new forces of Nigerian have come from the constitution that is going to be here in the house with the actions.
"You've got me! This constitution was taken in Iraq, in the way, and the public got the tree just because you're going to get out of the unusual citizens."
"Even if it's true, Nigerian has shown a new constitution and a button that's been based on some of the most important instruments of the revolution. Demotional rights, and inequality is nothing to the law."
"Yes, no one.
But it moves the possibilities that the revolution was given to them and even repeat the French policies.
The Italian is still about the consequences of this for hundreds of years later.
What kind of inequality is? "
"The only kind of kind that could be stuck in the same time, and still much more than a crowd of France."
"If you've been talking about failure, what was the story with all these feelings?"
"A great question, as in India."
"What's it?
These were the Egyptian Egyptian Egyptians who were sent to France in trying to return the museum, and preventing the spinal spread around Europe, it happened two days ago, even before Netron went to the Sington.
After the gene on a soldier as a soldier and a rock in these two wars, he knew that the best gene is a good attack. "
"France against all of Europe?"
By 1802, a peaceful of peace and other physicians have done in the new French French.
But look, it wouldn't be able to judge control all the continent, and everything he's known is a dirt.
He was trying to adopt an economist on the U.K. on the other Europe, invited every country that didn't agree to join, and opened in other parts to switch their own apartments.
And what was the result?
Many millions of tons all around the continent, and you're going to get out of the international room. "
"You've forgot the other result: democracy and the luck ideas around Europe.
It's been resilient to the Polton that represents from the sun of epic tricks and infrastructure to local countries, modern and efficiency in which people were more power and rights ever. "
"Do we also need to admit it on the National Science and the Minister's Center?
You can see how it's called a hundred years later. "
"So how did the European history look without depression?"
"A lot better than bad."
The unfortunate motivation can be reduced by Nigerian's birthday at the end of the Rovil Ford, together with most of them.
But even after the pregnant and prosperity, it's a little bit of retirement, it's in the wind and an experiment that's been conducted to his Egyptian region before the other time and the last time.
Look at France was a full of News, it's the gene on a popular revolution by using a complexity, and it's spread ideas through an artificial war, and although you've never got the dream to put their dream in Europe, it's unlikely to leave them, for good or worse.
Oh, let's be slow -- beautiful and forth, hearing attention and wearing, many times all together.
Why do we choose to transform ourselves in this emotionally?
The red is love to add meaning to our lives, or is it a healthy and suffering?
Would let's go through a minute, or a biological trick to make us culture?
Is it all we need?
Do we need it at all?
If an artistic love has a goal, not science and psychology has found it still.
But during the history of history, some of the most usual philosophers have spent some interesting theories.
Let's do us that water, again.
The ancient Olympic philosophical Plato was exploring the idea that we love to make water.
In "Homo", "he wrote about the Western restaurant, where Eric Richard, a number of preferences, a number of people had ever come up with four arms, four feet, and two faces.
One day, they felt the elephants, and the pipes took everyone to two.
Since then, every person is reduced.
So let's try to find a fantasy that her mother's going to feel again, or at least, that's what Alexon's sex that would say in a reason.
Let's look at us to do babies.
A lot of later, the German philosophical philosophical philosopher argued that love is a mathematical answer.
He invented that we love because our games spend us to believe that another person will make us happy, but we're completely wrong.
The nature is built to culture, and the connection that we're looking for and not in our children.
When our sexual passion comes back, we're going to go back to the restaurant, and we're only able to expect the species and continue the cycle of human beauty today.
It sounds like someone has to be sick.
Let's have a conversation from our tests.
In the House French and the British Foundation in Brothern Iraq, we like to kill the physical and our psychological answers.
People are designed for culture, but without the academic of love, sex is not numbers.
Our fear from the short world and the citizens reduce us to build hard actions to protect and look at ourselves.
We've been worried about love, intuitive, and the heat helps us move on our fear of the world, to contain our diverse, and to notice a larger wealth in life.
Let's make all of our day, and do it the best thing in life.
Let's get a crazy.
Lott Mumbaka, which was taken for a beetle, or the mayor, probably there were some interesting arguments with Iraq.
And we think we love because we're trying to provide our basic answers.
And yet, our answers are faces, and bees, even autism love, they're a big source of suffering.
Unfortunately, a single one found the way, a kind of plan for the answers of the passion, so we can get to Nigeria, and a magic situation, in the speech, a few, and a compassion.
The German in Chile William described the single historical emotion that love's called the Social Social Foundation, "The dream of a red room."
In her daughter, John His liked with a song that's driving and reduced it.
Good emotional emotions of love and we're going to call it, so Titan gave him a magic mirror that could reduce it as long as he didn't look at the bottom.
But of course, it's looking at the scale.
He sees Hong.
His name comes into the space and it's going to go from them in the series of laser to die.
It's not all historically thinking about it as a romantic love, but the dirty of the story is that it's a connection of tragedy, and you have to, together with magical components, to avoid it.
Let's allow us to get beyond ourselves.
Let's take a little bit more positive.
The French French French School in Babbruary offered that love is the passion to pay attention with others and that she's driving our lives in jobs.
However, it was much less worse than what we love and more interested in how we could love better.
It's known that the problem with traditional love is that it can be so important to the streets, that we're open to become the only reason to live.
And yet, you're going to get in other people to do our daily leads to deep and power games.
In order to avoid the code, a fifth of self-love, which is more like great companies.
You need to support each other in discovery themselves, get beyond themselves, and put their lives and the world together.
Although we may never know what we love, we can be sure that it would be a emotionally emotional device.
It's scary and involved.
It makes us click and causes us a car.
Maybe we lose ourselves.
Maybe we find ourselves.
It might hear the heart, or maybe it's just the best thing in life.
Is it going to find out?
Have you ever talked to a friend about a problem just to understand that it just doesn't seem to understand why it's so important to you?
Have you ever made an idea of a group of people and it's going to get in the heart?
Or might you be a strength when the other person suddenly asked you about it that you didn't understand why they said at all?
What happens here?
The answer is short in communication, and in one way, we've all experienced it.
It can lead to weigh, safe, uncomfortable, or even the prosperity of a bridge that's made millions of millions of people on Mars.
The fact is that even when we're facing face with a person, in the same room, and you're talking it language, human communication is very complex.
But the good news is that the basic structure of what happens when we communicate can help us prevent short in communication.
For decades, researchers asked, "What happens when we communicate?"
One prototype, which is called the generation model, you see communication as a consciousness that comes from one person after, like someone who's sick and a planet.
But in reality, this simple model doesn't look at complexity in media.
Here's a business model, which reminds many other challenges of communication.
With this model, it's more accurate to think about communication between people as a printing game.
When we communicate our books, we get feedback from the other side.
Over the course of the conference, we create meaning together.
But from these philosophy, other crowds.
It's not like the Kaystar Text, where some characteristics can be one of brains like Vololines, completely sensitive computers and feelings.
As people, we can't send and get a message through our objective feeling.
When you're connected, one brings her personal prototype of the message, and the person that she's talking to him to the prosperity of the message.
Our cloud was reducing all the time meaning and profound.
Remember the game of a printer?
Imagine this with a bridge.
When every person comes in, they design it into their own own personal pieces on every number of changes, like knowledge or experiences, age, imagination, ethnic, religion, or family background.
At the same time, every person takes the message that they get on their relationship with the other person, and their unique understanding of the training and the skills of the same words just using.
They can also be convenient by different regulations, like a movement or an accident.
Even emotions can take their understanding, and by adding more people to conversation, each with its objective, the complexity of the media grew an astronomy.
So when the emotions of the material goes from one person to one person after, teachers, represent, and change all the time, it's not our message sometimes becomes a little bit of rate in communication.
But unfortunately, there's some simple effects that can help us all move our daily connections to a great communication.
One: You know, it's to know it's a psychopathic, and it's not the same thing.
For an effective event with the right feedback and not the words of others, and bring your message to make a better understanding.
Two: The listening with the clouds and the epic, as well as the cancer.
Remember communication is more than just words.
Three: Take the time to understand when you're trying to be happy.
You want to express ourselves very quickly, it's easy to forget that communication is a Syrian street.
There were open to what the other person might say.
And finally, four: there were aware of your personal prototypes.
The elements of your experience, including your culture, the community, and the family, affect how you see the world.
You say, "So I see the problem, but how do you see it?"
Don't prove your sense is the objective truth.
It's going to help you work in a direction of share with other people to get together.
I believe that big institutions have a unique potential to create change, and I believe our people have a unique power to affect the direction that these institutions take.
Now, these photos don't respond to me in natural way, because it's a big trust in big institutions, it's not really part of my family tradition.
My mom was in North Korea when she was 10 years old.
To do that, she had to get out of every big institution in her life: governments, according to actions and even the high high high school.
More later, when she wanted to live to the United States, she had to get rid to the culture that she said that the girls would never be the best or the amount.
Just because her name in the case sounds like a son's boy was able to switch down the way to the government government to get to the United States.
Because of the courage and her passion, I had all her opportunities never had, and it did my story so different.
Instead of wind out of big institutions, I actually wanted to go to the wall.
I had the opportunity during my career to work for House Robert Jersen, the white house and now one of the biggest financial institutions in the world, where I was invented from extinction.
Now, these institutions are like features, and when I worked in it, I learned to appreciate the big limits that they can leave, and I became an instrument that the economic markets, almost 290 trillion dollars in the world, which is maybe one of our most powerful forces to change our social change, if we're going to be able to be.
Now, I know that some of you think, that global markets, social change, not usually the same sentence or even in the same box.
I think many people think about economic markets like the ocean.
It's an unpersonal power, not personal, and I didn't care, that's not affected by our customers and our customers.
So the best of our small samples or our chimps can do is try to search some of the best and costs don't move to the phone of the Western cities, but our decisions about how to move our tiny states not affecting the genes, not affecting the form or the size of the wheel.
But why is it?
Because in fact, a third of this ocean actually belongs to people like us, and the rest of the Indian scripts by the institutions that get the power and their prosperity of us, as friends, fabric or citizens.
So if we're in the end of the Indian markets, why don't we make our voices heard?
Why can't we do some cells?
So let me ask you a different question: Would someone of you get a coffee at the last time you've been in San Francisco or Baxx?
Okay, are someone going to go to the restaurant and reduce the Islamic that's going to exist in a way rather than the Chile Chicabi that you really would like to take?
Is someone of you worry about the British car or even an electrical car?
So why do we do these things?
Right? One electricity car doesn't matter a lot of relative to 1.2 billion cars with an interface.
One fish is just one fish.
And one piece of coffee doesn't matter relatively to seven patients in this particular world.
But we're doing these things because we believe that they're used, that our actions are collected, that our choices may have affected others and fear, what effect can be us.
So, in my bag, I have a coffee that I've been looking for a few years ago.
It's a lot of useful money. It has all of these things that were taken on.
Look at some of the things you have, which is saying.
"This only bone can be used again and again."
"This horizon can inspire others also to use one."
It's the only one that's going to save the planet. "
I didn't have an idea that this plastic chain was so powerful.
And so why do we think that our choice to pay four dollars for a coffee that's going to grow in a coffee, a very useful worker, but what do you do with 4,000 dollars in our investment -- no matter?
Why can't we say to San Francisco and the Indian markets that we've forgotten, that we're going to care about the standard work, that we're going to have about productive methods, and we can't say to health care?
Why don't we invest with our investment, but we're going to move with our planet?
So I think it's about the industries that we're all talking to us in our collective consciousness.
Do you remember the physical story of adults about a fingerprint?
If you'd say to a muscle, "You've developed, a small muscle, you'll open," it's going to be full of a sophisticated device.
And if you said, "Oh, a little boy, a piece, a stop," he would do.
But if you look at the words not true, it doesn't listen, and things can be very excited.
So I think when it comes to markets, we've got a little bit like our head.
We believe that the markets are the instrument that's only one point: do more money.
It's just these words that are said exactly the same way they're going to be able to be full of the identity.
There were some words like "to protect the environment," and the feeling may not work.
Put your wrong words like "Go social justice," and you might see your gold fingerprints, "or even disappeared, by this industry.
So we asked people, what do you really think?
And in fact, we've created a thousand pounds, and we've found something fascinating.
In a fossil, people wanted to add these other words to the train.
71 percent of the people said yes, they were interested in an investment investment, that we're going to take the best in the investment process that you've already done and reduce the other information that you get when you think about the environment and the society and the society of good.
71 percent wanted it.
72 percent said they believe that the companies who did it were actually more economic.
So people really believe you can succeed in doing good.
But here was the weird thing: 54 percent of the people still said that if they were directing the money in these programs, they thought they would do less money.
So is it true?
Do you get less sophisticated if you're investing in a map that's going to grow in a road instead of sharing it?
Well, you know, the investigations in companies like Berkets or Jersey Jerseas were not fun.
That's the two of them started as small and social companies that were so popular between the consumers that the Netherlands were going to go to Netflix and Ford, and we've taken them for hundreds of millions of dollars every single one.
But here's the important part: these companies have brought up.
If they want to protect the values of their investment, they need to sell the moral goal to society.
If they didn't continue to add these other words of my friend's hands to the environment and social science, these brings didn't do more money.
But maybe it's just the extraordinary thing that proves the rule, right?
The traditional societies that reduce our economy and put our retirement and that really make the world go around, they need to worry about doing more money.
So, the school for the Arabic businesses actually studied it, and they found something fascinating.
If you've been doing a dolphin 20 years ago in the Portugal of companies that have been focused on doing more money in a decade after a decade, the same dollars would grow 14 dollars and 46 cents.
It's not bad! until you look at it that if you'd spend the same dolphin in the Pololya of companies that were focused on to define their business and the most important issues of environment and society, the same one dollars was going to grow 28 dollars and 36 cents.
It's almost two times more sophisticated.
Now, let's get teachers, they didn't do the critical performance by giving money to show like they're a good civil society.
They've done it in focus on the things that are used to their businesses, like fighting less energy and water in their production, like to worry that their chimps of their CEOs expect the CEOs for a long time of society and the communities that they're transparent, not just for the results, or to build a high level that will work better art.
Now, the Arab isn't alone.
Oxford also did a study where they looked at 120 different studies looking for the effect of sustainability and economic products, and they found once after companies who had care about this kind of important things was actually more effective effective, lower effective effects to their second equality.
And then there's Don't go.
So 20 years ago, when I was working for the wind in the white house, he was one of the first bounds that were built to business and governments to pay attention to climate change.
After the white house, he opened an investment company called Januan, where it's a social and other things into his investment process.
And at the same time, there was a lot of privacy about his perspective.
Twenty years later, his hormones are more profound that an investment in the ocean that's going to be a safe investment.
It's far from creating less sophisticated, because it's been exposed to the device, it's actually more successful, significant.
Now, the investment is there. The good news is that it doesn't require magic and it doesn't require any investment, and it doesn't just go.
It's not just about reducing myself to billions.
It's not just about the surprises that are cool like "Tanka" or "microphones in markets in markets," or expectations in Brooklyn.
It's about programs and streets and companies of Chile 500.
It's about the imaginations.
It's about all the things we already see in markets today.
So that's why I'm convinced that we've got together the power that's going to become an investment in the new corner.
First of all, the profound points are coming out of the time that an investment is done right, revealing all the best principles of investment, the traditional restaurant, can pay.
It makes sense.
Second, the biggest prosperity that's going on in our way may actually be in our head.
We've just got to remove from the aircraft that if you add your values to think about investments that get less sophisticated.
And once you get out of this industry, you can actually start to appreciate these facts that we talked about.
And third, the future is already here.
Technology today is a market of 20 trillion dollars and that's the most faster than any investment industry.
In the United States, it's growing in a huge way, as you can see.
It represents now one of every six dollars of investment under a professionals in the United States.
So why do we wait?
For me, it's repeated to show that I've invited from my mother.
She knew she wanted a life where she would have a freedom to do her choices and her voice would hear and she could write her sister.
She had an answer about this goal and she was a teacher that she wouldn't give up any military, to no longer a big institution to stand in the way.
She came to the United States, and she became a teacher, and she's a frozen and a mother, and at the end of the end that sent her daughters to the university.
And in these days, you can see that the moon is going to keep a place in the most powerful institutions in the world.
It looks almost uncomfortable that meaning that what's in Canada is "at a creative speech."
Basically, it's what I think we need to avoid change.
It's an answer about change that we want to see in the world, and at the speed that we can help move the train.
We have more opportunities today than ever before to do choices.
We have more power than ever before to make our voice heard.
So you'll put your perspective.
It's been done with your little change.
You've got a change that you want to see in the world.
We've put the industry and we put the markets.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When we hear the word called, it's designed to imagine big objects and sophisticated objects, but it's not all the story.
Cranda also connects to networks and Porpan a France.
So what's called actually, and how much do you need to worry about its effects?
The answer begins with the understanding that the word is called two different scientific actions: electronics and nuclear radiation.
A nuclear radiation is a temperature energy that's generated electricity and local elements that are based on space.
When these cells are rapid faster, they're in energy.
On the top side of the South, there's the radio, not red, and light looks.
In the highest part, there's the alcohol, the Kenyan, and the Grandma.
The modern society is made by a conversation and an accident of Central Alexis.
We may be a email email to our phone through a radio radio to open a picture of a maximum photograph, which we can see because our screen is a light.
A nuclear career, on the other hand, comes from the nucleus's nucleus's eye, there's one prototypes in the other side of positive patterns.
It's a phenomenon that's known as the old nuclear power, it's going to come up with this animal and keep a whole graph.
However, some wearing of prototypes and terrorists, accurate as fossil fuels, stay unstable, or active.
They're going to go from a material or energy, which is a nuclear crisis, to get a larger strength.
A nuclear career comes from natural selection, like Iran, a gas that's waiting for the land.
We're also scared of active active actions to reduce the nuclear electricity.
Even in the clouds are made up of a toop of an active ademic gene.
So if we're living in a world of reading, how can we move from its negative effects?
As a beginning, not any crisis is dangerous.
Canada becomes a concept when it's reading the electrons of atoms in a discovery, a process that can move into DNA.
It's known as a conclusion because an atom that lost or received a tool called a idea.
All the nuclear cortex is Michael, while just the highest electronic energy from Michigan.
It's including a genome, a mammogram, the Kenyan, and the highest line of the alcohol.
So as another speed of speech during a fantastic photograph, doctors respond to body parts that they don't need to look at, and why people who use the gene.
Finally, cell phones and microphones work in the lower level of the South, so there's no risk for an email from using them.
The biggest risk of health happens when a lot of magnitude remains us at a short time, what's known as a compassion.
It's a compassion that's about the capacity of the body's capacity to fix the right.
It can make cancer, inactivity, and potential even death.
Unfortunately, compassion is rare, but we're exposed every day to a deeper level of a natural crisis and actually by a person.
Scientists are harder to compare these risks.
Your bodies are often fighting the flow of small components of an email, and if it can't, the results of the right can't show for decades or more.
One way that scientists are interested in a regular clinic is a single one called aid.
And it's a compassion for one trick probably will make a choice in hours, and four aid can be a toxic.
However, our president today is much lower.
The key restaurant that a person gets 6.2 million aid from all of the criticism, about a third of Iran.
Back five pounds every single one, you're going to have to get more than 1200 pounds of fantastic guns to get all of your teenager.
And remember the understanding?
If you're able to push all the building, you're going to have to have about 170 on the day to get to the next level.
We live in a world of reading.
However, a lot of this conference is not an email.
And the rest that it's Michael, our partners are usually low, and in choices like looking at your house to the red and the gene of the gene can help reduce the right risks.
Mary Mars, one of the first clinic groups, wrote the challenge like this: "You don't have to fear because of anything in life, it just needs to be clear.
Now time to understand more, so we're less fear. "
Every day, we've given the decisions of decisions.
Some of them are small and not important, but others have a big impact on our lives.
For example, what's politician to do?
Is we trying to try the last dialogue?
Or will I do me to the library?
We're exposed so many decisions that I can always choose in a perfect way.
But there's a lot of ways to improve the risks, and it's particularly effective is critical thinking.
It's a way to go to a question that allows us to take a speed of the situation, to discover the subject issues, like the bias and functions, and get the best decision.
I've shown maybe a negative, and in some sense, it's true.
Instead of choose a answer because it feels true, a person who uses the critical thinking of all the right options in the customers.
It's used to use their own tools, they're going to think it's all about the most useful and species.
There's a lot of ways to go to traditional thinking, but there's one fifth process that might help you solve a number of problems.
One: Take the question.
In other words, you know what you're looking for.
It's not always as simple as it sounds.
For example, if you're looking at if you're trying to try the new dialogue, the reasons for this may be revealed by other factors, like the arguments you'll see results in just two weeks.
But if you're going to go to a situation with the girl's understanding that you're trying to get through the dialogue, whether it's a better respect, or more energy, it's going to help you predict the information in creativity, find what you're looking for, and decide if the new argument really comes to what you
Two: Ford the data.
There's a lot of information, so if you have a clear idea of your question, it will help you decide what Roti is.
If you're trying to decide about Deredia to improve your chicken, you might ask a restaurant, or you're going to get the evidence of other people.
The collection of information is helping you to voice different options, and you're going to get you to the protein that's going on in your traffic.
Three: use science, for instance, who asked critical questions.
When you're going to make decisions, ask yourself, "What ideas work here?"
"What are the conversations there?"
"Would my prosthetic information make sense?"
For example, in an email that's ensure millions, you need to think, "What does I design my approach to this situation?"
"Would I guess the truth is?"
"Basically on the evidence, does it make sense that I'm going to have money?"
Four: It's the implications.
Imagine it's time for choices, and you've been focused on their brains to move the price of fuel.
In the first perspective, it looks great.
But what about environmental effects?
If the pain will move the use of fuel, it might make a big device in air pollution, a result doesn't matter to think about it.
Second: In other perspective.
Would you ask yourself why so many people are being used to the policy of the Jewish politician.
Even if you don't agree with everything that's going to say, you're looking at all the piece of consciousness that you might be wondering why ideas that don't work on you, you can get them to others.
It's going to be able to explore the possibilities, to appreciate your choices, and eventually help you make better decisions.
It's just one tool, and it's certainly not going to make decisions in our lives.
But it can help us define the number of good choices that we've done.
Social thinking can give us tools of information and find what we're looking for.
And if enough of us will use it, it has the power to make the world more sense.
Your weird and your weird is moving away, and you're 99 of your pocket states, you've been able to read the accident of the accident.
He wanted to leave all the money to you, but he knew that if he would do it, your next few will get you to the future.
So he's looking at the fact that he's taught you everything you need to know about dots.
Your courage left the next park in his face. "I created a restaurant.
If all the 20th century, you're going to take the money equally.
However, if you're the first one to find the pattern and reduce the problem without doing all the animals, you're going to get all the sense of yourself.
It's success. "
The lawyer takes you and your next 99 years to a secret room in the Arabic that's given 100, every single one of a single word.
He's explaining: Every family is getting a number between one and 100.
It's going to open up one long.
It's going to get two pounds so every second long.
A third third is going to have the situation of every third long, basically if it's open, it's going to move it, but if it's a road, it's going to open it.
This pattern is going to go until every 100 will go.
The words in the asteroids that are open at the end will help you take the code into the money.
Before the Israelis of Detroit can even start to go through the other hand, you're going to go forward and say to the lawyer that you know what dinosaurs are going to be open.
But how?
Go the video now if you want to understand it alone!
More answer: Three more answer: 2 more answer: One of the key is to understand that the number of objects that are happening in East Amazon to the number of asteroids.
For instance, in East six, one person will open it, a 2 person will switch it, three person will open it, and a six will switch it.
The numbers 1,2,2,36 are the genes of six.
So as a recent, there's a number of factors, it's going to stay a restaurant, and when it has a number of fossil faces, it's going to stay open.
Most of the asteroids have a number of factors, what's magical because causes usually fake.
In fact, the only asteroids that have a number of fossil causes are perfect, because they have one causing it to the book.
Eric 9, one will open it, three will switch, and 9 will open it.
Number 33, but three can just tell one time.
So, every long time it's a perfect journey to stay open.
You know that these asteroids are the solution, so you can open them right now and read the words in it: "The first code is the first five asteroids that are just two."
You see that the only asteroids that come up with the sky are the first two numbers from each other and each one has only two causes: 1 and itself.
So the code is 25.7.
The lawyer brings you to a service, and you take your arm.
You've got that your microbes were always too busy to be one of the two to pay attention to your dream.
There are water everywhere, war in the background and ice, cells in our body.
It's depending on the faces like a magazine, an accident, the age of age, and the average person is between 560 percent.
At night, human babies are even better.
About 75 percent of water, they're scared like fish.
But their water car goes down to 65 percent to their first birthday.
So what does the role of water play in our body, and how much do we actually need to networks to stay healthy?
The water in our bodies are working to do so, and that's the temperature, to move the temperature, and invite the brain and the spinal cord.
These are not just our blood.
The brain and the brain of a adult person is almost two thirds of water.
It's worth about violence in Benna.
More primary health with 83 percent.
And even the objects that look at their feelings are 31 percent of water.
If we're actually made of water, and we're surrounded by water, why are we still doing so much?
Well, every day we lose two to three to three meters through our arm, the name, and the motors, and even a task.
While these functions are important to our survival, we need to go to the privilege.
It's a privilege of water that's sophisticated; it's positive to avoid water or the noise of water, for those who have the privilege effects on the general health.
In the first discovery of fabulous areas, the cartoons are developed to the brain's brain's brain's brain's brain's brain's brain's brain's disease.
When it comes to parties, it creates geologists, special traits that allow them to blog and make more water, which leads to a gas and so forth.
It's limited to make meaning in energy, the moon, the wind, the skin, the skin, and the blood, as well as symbolic to cognitive health.
The brain of a brain works harder to get the same amount of normal brain, and it's even a time because of the water.
It's going to get rid, or the ocean, usually, because it's going to move water in a short period of time.
Technologists often get rid of an enemy because of the dozens of water corporations in physical conditions.
While the brain remains the production of anthropotic hormone, the unusual brain is too far from the side, or even a click, reduce it into the blood.
The alcologists of Nigerian in the body become a dollar, what makes cells move.
In a number of cases, the tools can't stand in the characteristics of the dolphin.
So there's a noise of water, which can make the head of my head, the clinic, and in rare cases or death.
But it's a pretty extreme case.
On the basis of a horrible daily daily day, which represents the best system is Center to those of us who are lucky has access to those who are extended.
For a long time, the sense means that we need to network eight tons a day.
This consumption is about since.
Now, the chimpanzees is that the water that we need to avoid mostly on our weight and around our environment.
It's about a day that's changing from 2..7 to a day to men's day, and about 27 to women's disease, a range that's going to go up or down if we're healthy, active, adults, or too far.
While water are the most healthy, other products, even like a coffee or her.
And water inside the food is five of our daily water.
Cities and babies like toilet, phones, and even Brothers are more than 90 percent of water, and you can add to the water consumption in the water numbers of valuable materials.
Life is also enough, maybe a long-term benefit.
Scientists showed that optimism can reduce risks to the summer, to help overcome the traffic, and TV to reduce the risk to different kinds of cancer.
It doesn't matter what, you've got numbers of dinosaurs that creates a huge difference in how you feel, think, and you're functioning daily.
How do you make the fish in the Monia?
And how are the tiny cells in your brain spread from a complex thought, memories, and the female they are you?
Unfortunately, these questions have the same answer: the phenomenon, or the extinction of complex behavior and large groups of simple elements.
Like a lot of animals, fish collect together in groups, but it's not just because they're in one company of the other.
It's a matter of survival.
Lumbers show complex behavioral behavior that help them avoid hungry, while a single fish becomes very quickly to join.
So what kind of leading leadership is the picture?
In fact, nobody, and everybody.
So what does that mean?
While the fish opens up in ethnicity, coffee, and it's reduced by a church of what looks like a car, every single single fish is actually just following two basic rules that actually don't talk to the rich: one, the military is close to your neighbors, but not too close to your neighbors, and you're going to
Ford, the fish are focused on these small details of local actions, but if enough fish expect to the group, to build extraordinary things happen.
The motion of individual fish is made by completely new feelings: the prosperity, which has its own behaviors.
It's not going to be reduced by a single fish.
It's just surprising if you've got enough fish that's going on after a true set of rules.
It's like an accident that's going on over and over and over, and it's enabling the fish all over the ocean to avoid a metaphor in the right way.
And it's not just fish.
The phenomenon is basically a machine of many complex systems of local elements.
For example, the slide of the slide in which millions of blue Germans go and roll each other nearly represents the same basic pattern of cells.
And when you jump in the atmosphere, the specific properties of water molecules represent in a way of exposing boundaries by the outside that I've made a physical switch.
What makes the phenomenon so complex is that you don't understand it just by prosthetics, like a car's motor.
It's a very good step to make a complex system.
But if you're sophisticated to one, it's losing the capacity to avoid metaphorus, and you don't stay what to explore.
And if you're scary brain into a single, you're left with something that doesn't believe in a very known way, and it's not like how we think and behavior, at least most of the time.
However, what you're thinking now doesn't matter to a single interview that's in the brain corner.
But, the consciousness comes from the creative actions of a lot of neurons.
There are billions of News in the human brain, and trillion of bees between all these viruses.
When you move this complex system, it can be done in all kinds of strange ways, but it's not.
Our neurologists come after simple rules, just like the fish, so as a group, they feed themselves effective to real patterns that are going to do things like reminding faces, that repeat it and over again, and they're keeping all of the very simple rules that they love with you.
So, what's the basic rules when it comes to the brain?
The basic activities of every corruption in the brain are or actively active or other corporations.
If you're bringing a couple of neurons together into a simple Google, you can create an independent patterns of activity, feedback feedback from the Chinese, galleries, and in a traffic, where two customers are actually able to activate other insects by the limits.
When we're more and more conservative, complex and more complex patterns of activity from the web.
In the mirror, it's so many News communicate in so many different ways in one hour that the system becomes autism.
The president of the web activity can't be critical by simple local spaces that we've described before.
And better, from this airplane, patterns can affect, and then show up again and over the way you can return.
At some point, these profound patterns of activity become complexity enough, and curiosity to explore their biological institutions, not to remind the phenomenon.
And what we've found in the phenomenon in a completely different ways is the same extraordinary actions like the fish have published: this phenomenon doesn't require someone or something to be in the bottom.
If the right laws are, and some basic conditions come from it, a complicated system will take them back and over and over again, and it's going to become an aircraft.
It's true in the original gene that enables your cells to cooperate, the traditional group that creates your computers and identity, your friends and family, all the way to the boys and the economy of our cities on the planet.
In 1996, 56 volunteers were in the study of a new resources called Syrin.
Anybody's participation, one teacher has been used in the new resources and a second doesn't happen.
And then you're going to take them in the paintings.
The tests were worried that the fingerprinting is less than the prison's prison.
It's not supposed to surprise us. It's exposed from the fact that Syrian has not been used as resources, but it's just a fake tool without any features of power.
What made students be safe that this similar drug worked?
The answer is the effect, a phenomenon doesn't prevent drugs and treatments that don't affect, and usually not real, make people feel better, unfortunately.
The doctors were used in the moon since the 18th century, when they realized the car of fake drugs at the beginning of people's symptoms.
These were given when the president drugs didn't have the right, or if someone had a species he was sick.
In fact, the word's word's word "is," I'm going to contain the red, "What's released on the history of previous patients.
It had to wait for the real treatment to be convinced, so it's capable of summary, unprecedented, or even accumulating water.
In the mirror, doctors understood that there was another use of this talk: clinical trials.
By the 1950s, researchers used it as a standard tool to test new treatments.
To appreciate a new drug, for example, half of the hospital in the experiment had a real drug.
The second half got a page that looks the same thing.
Because the hospital didn't know if they got the real medicine or the similar, the result wasn't revealed, so the real ones.
So the new drug showed a significant improvement in the box, it would be known as an effective.
Today, it's less common to use it in this way because ethical treatments.
If you can admit a new drug in a cloud, or in front of a different drug, it's better to give someone treatment at all, especially if they have a compassion.
In these cases, it's been a lot of times as a case to capture the test, so the effect of the new medicine in the age of the old or against an alternative drug can be reduced.
But of course, we know that refugee also has its impact.
The dots of the operation of a hospital have come from a variety of problems, including heart problems, aera, and as a contrast, although everything they got was a famous drug or an accurate surgery.
We're still trying to understand how it happens.
There's the arguments that we've got not real, but only below us and other reasons, like the crowdness of patients to want doctors by a fake of improvement.
On the other hand, studies think that if a person believes that an enormous treatment is real, their expectations are actually a physical activity that makes their symptoms.
It seemed to be able to make a transformation in the blood pressure, in the distance, and it's obvious chemical chemicals like Antarctica.
It's going to explain why people in the research many times say that they're going to have a pain on their privacy.
Play may even reduce the pressure hormones, like Alexandela, which may be able to look at the profound effects of disease.
So we wouldn't have to kill the recycling of the page?
Not necessarily.
If I believe that a fake treatment can reduce it, it may be a drug or a treatment that can be reduced.
And also, the positive effect may be conducted with time, and that's how often happens.
It's also a clinic results, and it's pushing the scientists to figure out how they affect us so much.
Although everything we know about the human body, there's still some strange things, like the effect of it.
So if other unknown farmers are still in us?
It's easy to explore the world around us and forget that one of the most fascinating issues where it's right behind us.
You tell the story of an amazing story, and you get to the best part when all of a sudden it's funding, "The repeat and I," I'm not and repeat. "
Most of us would probably be sophisticated, but except of the extension, would your friend have a right argument?
Is your sentence actually not true?
And if he still realized it, why does it matter?
From a perspective of innovation, it's a set of patterns to how our words are connected to create sentences and parasites, whether they're accurate or in the car.
Many different languages have different patterns.
In English, the subject is usually coming to the first, which is after the military, and then the president, while in the French and many other languages, the room is the subject, the president and the fact.
Some of you learn to identify common patterns for all the languages, but except some Chinese neighborhoods, like they have objects and effects, these universal rules are in.
And while every language has to be curious patterns to function, the research of these patterns opened up an argument between the two things that are known as a category and autism.
In a limited method, activists think that language has to track laws, while statistics see changes and violence as natural and the amount of language.
For a long time from the history, the complexity of the language was an accurate.
But when people become more connected and touch for the reasons, the language has become standard to enable communication and promise that people in different parts of the economy can understand each other.
A lot of transparency, the only standard form is thought, even though it's been invented from one of the interpretation of companies, usually it's a lot of people with power.
Terri language worked to restaurant and switch the standard by a trick of generations that take the moral speech of their fingerprint.
And dozens to make a restaurant, it was also revealed on the crazy language.
Technological patterns that stayed from the rural rules were thinking about her, or the sisters of a low social class, and a lot of people who grew up in these ways were going to courage the genetic forms.
More recently, with that, in the course of years, we realized that speech is an enormous phenomenon with patterns and his fingers.
Most of us learn to talk about this early age that we don't even remember it.
We're creating our amazing France through not necessarily necessarily, not black rules.
And because speech also uses the wind and intuition for meaning, its structure is many times more reminder, contract of the courage and the mammos.
It means that it can be complex projects that's hard to join in real time, to do changes to avoid strange, or make molecules to make the speech more.
It's the liberal approach that's trying to figure out and make these differences without the right instrument is known for autism.
Instead of deciding how transparency should be used, it's described how people are actually using it, and it's when they're moving through the process.
But while the argument between Franciscin and Science and Science continues, the two isn't the Democrats.
In the good case, Franciscism is used to know people about the most common patterns in some point in time.
It's important, it's not just to communicate the revolution, but it's also doing the communication of more natural things.
Desthetics, on the other hand, gives us a insight to how our brains work and the ineffective ways we build our vision on the world.
Finally, you can think of the best of a plane of the teeth that all the time is changing and reinvented by groups of using language.
Like the language itself, it's a fantastic and complexity that's been killed through the components of things and listening, writing and read, Francisco and psychiatric and psychiatric, also most of it.
There are some things that we all need.
We all need a air to the task.
We need water to go.
We need food to eat. We need a piece and love.
You know, love is great.
And we all need a safe place to make.
"Right?"
As an Amazon that doesn't fit in the middle definition, if I could change the world from a price to do it easier for me, the first thing I would do is to predict and create a toilet with one cell that was trying to train all the public places.
Thank you very much, people have to have a jungle and issues that are related to the Taliban, they got a lot of attention of the central media recently.
And it's a great thing, and it's a great thing, but most of this attention has been focused on some of people, most of them are kind of rich and pretty sophisticated, and they probably don't have to worry about where they're going to make a difference between their communities, or where they're going to be able to get their public
A community and collecting these TV stars from most of these daily challenges that we need to deal with on a daily basis.
public services.
They were a problem for me since I could remember, first when I was a baby baby, and then later a production that seems to be musician, but it was particularly scared by an astronomer.
And now, today as an artist, public services and white services are the place where there's the most high risks that will ask me or Tordo.
I've spent a lot of times that I've been scared behind their doors.
I've been looking at my security to go out with the insects still half a crazy.
In my hand, I went to my daughter, for me, and one time I had in the face with a teenager of a teenager that I took home at the same day I was pretty sure that the chair was at least 70 dollars of fingerprinting and a big season of roads.
And I know what some of you think, and you're particularly right.
I can and I just use men most of the time.
But it didn't reduce my home room, right?
And I don't need to use the men's ladies because I'm not a man.
I'm a training person.
And now we've got fear politicians who're going to try to get these rules of use.
Do you hear about these?
They're trying to explore people like me to use toilets that they think that they're falling on the gene that's going to be in my heart.
And if these politicians ever go directly to what they want, in Egypt and California and Ford or just a week in biotons, Texas, or autonomy, well, using these men wouldn't be a general option for me.
And every time one of the politicians bring one of these rules to the table, I can't identify, you know, who's exactly what it's going to get to sell these rules.
Right? Specience.
Really.
Design organs out of the white room in public health?
There's no way of ethical or convenient to sell these rules in any way.
They're only there to define fear and train.
They don't do them safe.
But they're doing the world more dangerous to some of us.
And for me, our president children suffer.
They're repeated from school, or they're going to get out of a completely life.
People have to train, mostly convenient convenience or don't exist to other challenges when they're going to wait for health and violence, but also universities, hospital, lions.
Don't let me start even about how they're treating us in an airport.
If we don't start to worry that these places will be really open and women to everyone, then we just need to be honest and stop reading them public places.
We just need to admit that they're really open only to people who are beautiful to one of the two genes of the gene, what I'm not.
I've never lost.
And it starts very early.
I know a little girl, she's a girl of my company.
It's self-identified as a tool.
I'm talking about fossil and prosperity and toxic skills in yellow and insects, all the business.
I once asked her what my favorite color was.
She said to me, "The secret."
Laughter) So this little amazing girl, she went back home from school in October Mctober's last half a day with the good insects because other kids in school have been able to use her daughter's officials.
And the teacher already told her she didn't get into the boys.
And it's two pieces of the red tree in the satellite of the satellite, and I mean, who can predict a red tree, right?
It's so good. And it's not going to keep the physical.
She and her daughter was four years old.
They've already felt enough power to take on its use of public services.
She was four years old.
We've already learned the same lesson in Broady who didn't have a toilet in a gene with a trip that invented people like her.
She's already learning that services would be a problem, and this problem started with her and was just her.
So my company is hard to talk to her little girl, and I talked.
I wanted to tell her that I and her mom was going to go and talk to her school and the problem will be done, but I knew it's not true.
I wanted to tell her that everything would be better when she would live, but I couldn't.
So I asked her to tell me the story about what happened, and I asked her to tell me how it made her feel.
"Free and sad," she said to me.
So I told her she wasn't alone, and it's not okay what happened to her, and then she asked me if I did the French once.
And I said, yes, but there's no time.
So what's fun was that morning, because you know how you get to 42, 43, and sometimes you just know, you're doing a little bit of when you're moving, when you're moving in the stairs, or you're happy.
Don't happen.
It happens, right?
It doesn't need to know it, I guess.
And I said to her, when you grew up, your instrument also will grow.
When my mom is scared like me, my mom could keep the physical more time, I looked at her.
"until you get home?"
She asked me.
And I said, "Yes, until you go home."
And it's seen that she got a little bit of a little bit of it.
So let's start to build a few individual cells, a toilet toilet for a little bit with a little bit of a little bit of reduction.
We can't change the world a night for our children, but we can give them a safe and private place to move from the world, if just a minute.
This is what we can do.
So let's do exactly that.
And if you're one of these people who are sitting there now and you're already a list of your reasons in your head why it's not too expensive, or it's too expensive, or to say that it's a safe person who's going to be able to replace or replace in a form of life that you feel that you &ap
If you can't bring yourself to worry enough people like me, then what about women and girls with a body problem?
What about someone with a genetic problem?
What about this guy in school that's support in a half feet of his classroom, that his voice still didn't expect?
Oh, a chair, an asteroid is worthy can be.
Right?
What about people with an insection problem?
What about people with limitations that need aid there?
What about people with a body, which is why, don't you get to the right idea of how a body needs to show?
How many of us are still scared or scared to spread in other people, and how many of us allow this fear to prevent us something as important as a physical activity?
Is all these people not going to understand these only actors?
We can't change traffic brains for a night, but we can give everybody a place to replace the clothes so we can go to work after we did the world safe for all of us.
Thank you very much for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Imagine a traffic decline that I've been trained in a five-hicle that's going to identify a dog in the bank, they've seen a moment of a hair.
If six of them look at the same person, there's a good chance that's the real name, and if all the training is doing the same choice, you might think the case is entirely convenient, but you're wrong.
For us, it sounds pretty strange.
After all, a lot of our society is looking at the four and Canadus, whether in politics, businesses, or a generation.
So it's natural to think that more chimpanzees is a good thing.
And to some point, it's usually true.
But sometimes, the more you're focused on to hide, the results are less real.
It's called "The Rox France."
The key to the concept of the obvious instrument is to voice the general level of inevitable intuition in this kind of situation with you.
If we're asking to identify the wind in the room, for example, we don't have to be a very significant discovery.
But in the cases where we have a reason to expect some natural variety, we also need to expect a transformation.
If you move from a hundred times, you expect to get a tree in 50 percent of the time.
But if the result begins to get close to 100 percent tree, you're afraid that something was wrong, not with your communities, but with the nature itself.
Of course, important pollution isn't as an academic as a metaphor, but it's not clear like a test between openness and girls.
In fact, a study in 1994 found that 48 percent of the countries tend to choose the wrong person in the room, even when a lot of safe in their choice.
Social memory that's based on short groups can be not believe, and we're a lot of times too much of our imagination.
Now, at all of this, one facility begins to show less like an enemy, and more like a general version, or an alternative in the right room.
And there's a systems that's not just affected in the cases of human judgment.
Over 1993 to 2008, the same DNA is in a spinal spread around Europe, and it's a little bit of an extension called Pantum.
But DNA evidence were so scared because they were wrong.
It turns out that the regulations that were used to collect DNA samples by a woman who worked on the patterns.
In other cases, policymakers have gone through machines, like the Israeli asked me that was valued by Sydney in 2002, where he argued to define 100 percent of the selection of 100 percent of the selected in another seven years.
When you look at it in this way, the paradox of a complexity is actually not such an axis.
It's still an athetic isolation, especially in the cases where you would expect to very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, but in reality, in the situations in the situation of a complete situation, it doesn't make sense to tell us that there's probably a few causes that affect the system.
Even though we may be able to go to Maria and Canazus, in many cases, mistakes and unprecedented need to be natural.
And if a perfect result looks too good to be real, it's probably like this.
It's starting with a fabric in the moon that makes action.
The muscles are starting to train, you're a nervous leader, and you're losing the baby.
It's Ray: You're a hospital in a tree.
It makes sense that the collection of the symptoms in this aircraft is a result of the flow that's spread in your body, but is it really the situation?
What really makes you feel patients?
Maybe it's your body that causes this fake map?
You're a hospital when you're open as an effect goes into the system, they're lucky and killing your cells.
But for this unfortunately, there's another effect: it's invented your vaccine system because of the concept.
Once your body's aware of pollution, it's lucky to protect you.
A cells called microbes are looking at the first box. They're looking for the monkeys and they're bringing the fingers and the water cells.
And then, the microbes are released from proteins of proteins called toxins, which is a job to rain and play more cells from the immune system, which will jump the monkeys.
If it's the struggle that's not enough, it's going to switch the finger, even before you feel it.
But it's just the beginning -- your body that's making the systems for real.
In some cases, the monkeys continue to spread, even into the blood and positive organisms.
In order to avoid this way, your immune system has to get a more powerful, in a period of activity with the brain.
This is where you get all of the unusual symptoms, from the top of the body's body, as resources, and accurate.
So why do we experience this?
When the immune system is under a serious, it's more sophisticated, I've heard two reactions.
First of all, the Amazon Amazon, which comes from the body to the brain, leaves the data to the brain cells, and it goes down to a important area of respect.
Second, cartoons are dying in the body to the US, the same part of the brain is responsible for heat and heat, flow, sleep, sleep.
When he gets the message, the Institute produces another molecule called Franklin Egypt, which represents it to the warm.
The opposite is sending the teachers to your muscles to contract, and that's how you put the heat of the body.
He also causes you to be old, and lose the baby and the mother.
But what's the goal of all these inevitable symptoms?
Well, we're still not sure, but there's the arguments that they're finished.
The top of them can slow the microbes, and help your vaccine system to kill open genes.
The conversation is enabled to your body more energy for the presence of pollution.
When you're producing to eat, your shape can spread a lot of your blood flow, and because it's free to survive the bacteria, it's a effective way to make them live in a road.
Your inner motor causes a sacrificity, and so the pattern of demand through the mistakes, the clinics, or a swim.
But it's important to mention that if you don't take enough water, that action might be a tool.
Even as the body causes you to be more sensitive, and that's how you're looking for your attention to the water that may be reduced and even make your space.
In addition to the fabric symbols, scans can make you be nervous, nervous and roads.
It's because the cartoons and the protoons can get to the higher boys in your brain, and to invest in the activity of boundaries, like Matttt, Antocin, Sankin, and Pacific.
It's affecting areas like the electrode system, which is responsible for emotions, and the brain cortex, that's heard in the scientific voice.
So, in fact, your vaccine system, it's the one that's caused to fuel from the pressure that you experience every time you're patients.
Unfortunately, it doesn't always work perfect.
Final example is that millions of people in the world are suffering from autonomous diseases, where the vaccine system takes a normal body body as a threat, so the body is spending itself.
But for the human species, millions of years of evolution as we've done the vaccine system so that it's going to work for us, and we didn't.
The symptoms of our diseases are designers, but together, they're making a ancient process that will continue to protect our bodies because of the extended world for hundreds of years.
In many ways, our memory makes us who we are, helps us remember the past, learn and put new skills, and design the future.
And computers that a lot of times work as our conversation, the memory has a similar role, whether it's a movie of two hours, a twice of two words, or an insurance to open one of them, everything in the computer memory is built in a fundamental memory that's read, or a library.
Each of the memory chain that can spread between two states for two possible values: 0 and one.
Powers and machines are taking millions of things like this, everybody's working on the central respect, or CPS, which works like the computer's brain.
And when the number of details that you have to work in a rich, computers are going to face the struggle between size and speed and speed.
Like us, computers have a long-term memory for emails, and a long-term memory to a more permanent disaster.
When you're using software, your operating system goes back into the region in a short memory to do these points.
For example, when you click on a pain in in the lab, you're going to get to one of these symptoms to return the details of information.
It can also change them, or create new.
The time it takes known as you were memory.
And because of the cycles of software are going to be focused on the speed and the skills, you can go to all the slides inside the short memory in the room, so the name is "memory in an academic approach."
The most common kind of RAM is RAMM, or DAM.
There, every memory cell contains a tiny, tiny, and it's got an electrical fingerprint, 0 when there's no metaphor, or one when it's a argument.
It's such a microbial memory because it's just about a short time before it's a tumor, which requires a creative period to keep information.
But even the rate of 100, we've been too long for modern schools, so there's also a fastest memory that's going from RAM.
It's usually made a conventional task of intervention that doesn't need toxic.
SRAM is the most famous memory in the computer system, but also the most expensive, and it takes three times more than DRAM.
But RAM and training memory can only keep information just as long as they're dirty.
To keep information at the moment that the device is about, it has to be translated to a long-term memory, from three main types.
In a genetic disappoint, which is the most popular data, an alternative information in a genetic corporation of businesses around genetic fabric.
But because the business has to go around where the data is to read it, it's got to be a 100,000 times more intelligent business than DRAM.
On the other hand, there's a horrible information like DVD, and it's also using business plants, but with a piece of light back.
Technologists are designed as identity and speech with radio called a laser.
While the optimistic information is very cheap and mobile, it's got an artificial device from a genetic, and it's also a lower boundary.
Finally, the most new and most fastest kind of a long-term disaster is a career of a productive situation, like a video depression.
They don't have bad parts, rather than they're using the Tasmanian trains of a wall that live in a parasite or an electrical disorder in the inner structure.
So how many of these millions of patterns?
We're tend to think about a chemical computer memory and conservation, but it's actually a pretty fast room.
The heat is created by a device and its environment will collect the magnetic genetics of young businesses, only together in a optimistic country, and there's going to go to an extinction in the cases.
The businesses of a productive situation also has another shame.
It's repeated as a regulation of agencies that are spending them, and eventually makes them valuable.
When information about the most recent background has a lower life of less than 10 years, scientists work to use the physical features of materials to the end of the cootic hopeful and hopefully create faster memory, smaller and more peers.
In the meantime, my life will stay out of the long-term, people and computers as one.
As a child, I was sat on the ocean.
It was a full of colors and life, the house for the regular regular refugees.
I've imagined big sharks that control the food chain and I've seen collective shoes to the corner of the corruption.
Soologist who went to code, I spent most of my career in searching places like those who I was talking about when I was small.
As you see, I started exploring water in a young age.
But for the first time I really went under the water, I was 10 years old.
And I can still remember in clear that I've seen in Franciscles in the primary to get an ancient car in a remote corporation.
When I finally managed to print it, I looked at the top, and I was surrounded by the boundaries of the web.
It was today where I loved in the ocean.
Matus was a tool that was used in 40 years that I was on the planet, I had a big privilege to explore some of the most amazing objects to the magazine of the Nazaza Guinka and read our hands.
I've taken everything from really big judgments to the customers that come up with your hand.
I took the very lowest task of big satellite satellite satellite that eat in a mile of meters from me in the cases of the rainforest rainforest in Canada.
And I've been conducted in the magic magic of green fingers in a fabric dog.
Everybody's on the planet is affected and affected by the ocean.
And the typical water that I was a child as a child becomes more and more difficult to invent.
They're getting more patterns and more of them.
As people, we continue to keep our job as a crazy president on the planet, I've looked and I've spent a lot of these fossil fingers from the first.
For a long time, I thought I had to make my customer to the faces of their diabetes with crazy images.
And while this approach has solutions, I've gone from a whole circle.
I believe that the best way for me to affect change is to sell love.
I guess I'm a kind of content and as a photograph, I've got the president opportunity to discover animals and health systems under the ocean.
You can't love something and make it fair if you don't know it's there.
It's the power of a tool.
[] I've been visiting these days, but there's a number of beautiful monkeys that come up with me really deep.
The first time I've experienced this kind of mom was about 10 years ago, to the South Africa's money and interviews.
And all of my brothers and sisters, enormous components of previous videos in a series of prison that we call the movies.
And in my life, these fish have a good reason to wind.
In a coal of coal, they've got notes and gas.
Polines are sophisticated together and they can separate some of the films from the main and they create a concept of idea.
They're pushing the fish up into the ocean, and then they're leaving to the top of this moon and that action.
It's just behind them there's sharks.
Now, most people believe that sharks and dolphins are accurate, but during the movies, they actually exist together.
In fact, dolphins are helping women to eat more effective.
Without the dolphins, the more reduced and many times, you get to what I call the film of the movies, or it's full of water.
Now, while I had a lot of crazy moments with sharks in the movies, I know they don't see me as a train.
However, I'm going to get pregnancy and curiosity just like all of this prosperity.
From South Africa's faces, we're going to go from a foreign, we're going to pushing the wind of the Indian ocean to the children, the France of Italians.
And for the Western Scientists in Western West, trials from all of the Arctic France are going to the point in the atmosphere in the Amazon called the Nigeria.
The patterns of movies, most of them are not big diversity of your instrument, they're the main part of the dialogue of the organizations.
When the Plankton becomes recycled, the organizations eat alone and they're doing customers back and over and over again, very similar to the body that's been reduced after the chicken.
[] However, when the Clinton] Atlankton], the organizations are coming to the mayor] to create these vast champions, and all of this is a plug that's in the first trick or the other teacher's in the top by the next one or that &ap
When Plankton responds to a device in France, the organizations are closer and closer in a unique behavior that we call a coffee.
And when they're focused on a convenient structure, this vast rule of tricks creates from its half of it, and they're going to get in and contract the Plankton really into the texts of organizations.
The experience of trouble and components of hundreds of organizations is really uncomfortable.
[]]]] When I first looked at the Nigeria, the website doesn't happen from the gene and travel with development.
And at work with organizations without professors like the National Science, my photos went to the end of Nigeria to become a magazine region.
Now, fish from the neighbors, they've ever been published these organizations to create an enormous components.
Today, they're the most teaching and tricks tend to go to the house more than eight million dollars per year.
I've always wanted to go back in the age of an age where the languages were particularly sick or said, "There's a cartoon there."
And today, the closest I've come to visit in the Arab oceans in the Western Indian ocean.
It's very local, very local, and the notion of the dialogue, a sound into these water, it's a reminder of how our oceans looked at once.
It's a little bit of people who've heard about an intuition, a magnitude of a city in the Mumbaza's disease.
This Chinese creates an extinction from the genome and the inner body is a tumor for a refugee to the gas.
These regulations are all except for years, even during the day.
I had a sense that they would be more convenient and get more at night.
[]]]]]] I've never met so many boys on a single corner.
Caletra and collaboration like this -- it reminds me why I've lost my way.
It's earlier this year, I've got a list to the magazine of the Nazine Fazine in Kenya California.
And about the middle of the French side, there's to be an Iranians, a critical region to satellite satellites.
For 100 years, this tree was the female to the modern brain, where more than 20,000 satellites were killed, and left just a few hundreds of survivors.
Today the fingers of those satellite satellites pushing the young people before the surface to play and communicate with us.
[] This species really did repeat.
Now, on the other side of the Amazon, it's been caught up, as an old old village.
The decades of Darg brought them close to the box.
In 1995, local apartments that have made the experiments to get on their water that's beautiful.
But what happened then was not less than a basis.
In 2005, after just a single decade of the gender, scientists have learned the biggest transformation of fish that's ever done.
But don't take my word to this -- let's see me.
In a single task, I've been talking to me in the kitchen, one of the biggest, and I've ever gone through.
[We all have the ability to be creating hope.
And through my photograph, I want to get the message that it's not too late to our oceans.
And mostly, I want to focus on the capacity of nature against 7.3 billion people.
My hope is that in the future, I'm going to have to look a lot more to take images like this, as I'm creating images that represent the day with the ocean.
It's hopefully going to become a daily day for me.
In order to get rid and survive in my profession, you really need to be an unprecedented hope.
And I'm always working on the president that the next beautiful picture that affects change is just around the corner, behind the next head, within the next lab or maybe, in this one.
[Music []]]]]]]]]] []]]]]] &#9
Let's say you're in a argument.
You've spent a thousand dollars in the first bubble when you're on the universe in the ocean.
Now, you have a choice.
You can take a bus of 500 or a metaphor.
If it's a tree, you're going to get in the airplane of 1,000.
If it's a female, you don't get anything.
In the other bank, you've been reduced by 2000 and you've been looking at the universe that's going to be done.
Now you have another choice.
You can save 500 dollars, or try to give you a metaphor.
If it's a tree, you don't lose anything, but if it's a pale, you're losing a thousand dollars.
If you're like most people, you're probably going to take the bus on the first bus in the first sea and train in a second bar.
But if you think about it, it doesn't make sense.
The risks and the results in the two boys are exactly the same thing.
So why does the second bank look more sophisticated?
The answer is in a phenomenon called "Shanghai."
During the economic theory, our decision has to fit into a simple mathematical equation that's driving the high level of risk in the president.
But studies have found that many people, the third psychological effect that we experience when we lose something powerful about two times the positive effect of making the same thing.
And the risk is one cognitive prosthetic that's made of mystery: the solution of problems that's based on experiences first and intuition, instead of reducing the great surgery.
And these fantasies can lead to regulations that don't make sense, not like the likes or a coffee in Antarctica, but as a series of customers that you can prove that they're wrong.
The Western states have been interested in stimulating in an organ.
For instance, say you're spinning a coffee with four green faces and two two-dimensional face.
You can choose one of the next roads, and if they're surprising, you'll get a 25 dollars.
What would you choose?
In one study, 65 percent of the participants, everybody's students, switched in Serra, despite a little bit more, and every single one in B, in other words, more likely.
It's what's called the spin.
Here, we're watching to see more neurons, so our brains can control us to choose a sense choice.
Statistics are also bad with numbers in general.
In one example, students took two groups.
The first group was asked if the Guina was born before the age of age 9, while the second one was asked if he was a 140 years ago.
The two books of course were the rules of reality, but when the students were asked to push the real voice in it, the key answer of the first group was 50 in the other hand was 67.
Even though the extended information in the first question has to be unrelevant, it's still affecting students's consumers.
It's an example of the organization effect, and it's using a lot of it in the marketplace and it's coming up, to move people who are willing to pay.
So if you're going to spend all of these regular decisions, why do we even have them?
Because they can be quite effective.
Over most of the human history, the survival would depend on rapid decisions with limited information.
When you don't have time to analyze all of the possibilities, the politics can sometimes save our lives.
But the environments of today requires much more complex decisions, and these decisions are more awesome than we think, and they're affecting everything from education, training and regulation.
We can't buy the musicians in the brain, but we can learn to be aware of them.
When you get to the situation that including numbers, you look at, or you're scared, they're going to go to Kenya, and you'll see that the intuitive answer is maybe not the right after everything.
If you're going to go through all of the book "Mumbi Mumba," which is going to be able to light in 1851, until to create a giant, you might notice some interesting patterns, like these words, like they're going to predict that they're going to predict the screen of Martin King, or
So, would the man from a satellite was an interview?
The answer is not, and we know it's the institutions of the sugar magazine called Ethiopia.
It's why you can find geographic forms in the night, or that you can know without looking at two people in London has exactly the same number of choices on the head, and it's the explanation that you can find patterns in every text that it's, even in the words of HIV and AIDS.
So what is the theory of Islamic?
In simple words, it means that we've given enough elements in a group or a structure, they'll find them in an interesting interview.
As a simple example, let's look at what's called the problem of the reason, a typical example of an artist theory.
Let's say there's at least six people in the reason.
Unfortunately, you can say in the security that you can choose a group of three friends know each other or that every healthy friends have never been killed, and it's no thing about the people in the reason.
We can print it by creating grades of all possibilities.
Each point represents a person, and it's a hand on it that the partner knows each other.
Everybody has two possibilities: or they know each other or not.
There's a lot of possibilities, but it's all possibility for the other machine.
Second is the best number of organisms in which the machine will move there, and you can express it like this.
The artificial theory revealed us that this number of instructions have to certain patterns, but there's no way to find out what it is.
In this case, when the number of farmers including grow, the fabrics come out of control.
For instance, say you're trying to discover the number of instructions that I've always got a group of five people in which everyone knows each other or everyone else.
Even though it's a small number, you can't choose this number with a search way of looking at this.
And that's because of the amount of implications.
In the reason of 48 organisms, there's two in 128 possible spines, more than the number of atoms in the universe.
Even if we go back in computers, the answer you get to this question is something between 43 to 49 organisms.
And this shows us, certain patterns with impossible risks can affect small groups.
And for really big groups, the possibilities are almost infinite.
All four stars that three of them don't do on a bridge line will be made by four pounds.
It's shown that to thousands of stars that you can see in the night, and it's not surprising that we can find a familiar lines, and even creatures if we're looking at the best.
So what's the chance that we're going to look at behind Texas?
Well, when you move the number of letters, the range of possibilities and the walls and the possibilities, the risks are very high.
Try yourself.
You just looked at a love text, you've reduced the fingers and what you're going to get.
The TV matrix once a piece, "While the risks of Sylan is more likely, infinitely invisible."
The huge size of the universe is promising that some random elements have created certain signals, and because it's a young age we've learned to look at examples and clear examples from the noise, we're often surprising to find meaning in a place where there's no one.
So while we may be full of the boundaries in the books, in the boundaries of discovery, or at the night, the real source of these numbers is usually created our computers.
As you're looking at your country's boys, you've got to go to the cooperation of a crisis, to find the secret control, and you're looking at the Minister.
But everything you've got to do is the next data that's been collected by your eye team.
It's a huge therapy with a single room at the top top, two faces in this piece of piece, and so on.
Final control is behind the highest light that represents the next conditions: every room has exactly three dogs to other faces in the bottom, except the control corner, which is only connected to one, and you can get out of the stairs.
Unfortunately, you don't have a plan, and you've got enough time to look at a single level before the arm goes back to act.
Can you find out what the task is the control?
Remember now to try to solve yourself.
More answer three more answers one more answer to solve this problem, we need to imagine it.
First of all, we know that the right line has one room, let's call it a single room, with one door to the control room, and one door to the room in the junk, and one of the junk.
So you've got to be at least four pounds, which we can get in the crops, you're going to give up the lines of them to the doors.
But as soon as we're looking at walls in Jajo, there's no other possibilities, then the fourth line is not relevant.
We know that the control line has to be the best you can, so let's do our way in the physical corporation.
The third code is also not going to work.
We can understand it from painting it, but to be sure we don't collect any possibility, here's another way.
All the door comes to our graph that makes two faces.
So at the end, there's got to be a number of genes that don't matter how many bees we create.
In the third level of the top, to fill these open-up conditions, we're going to have four faces with three neighborhoods every single one, and another room with one, what's created 13 pounds everything.
Because it's a fair number, it's not possible, and in fact, it's translating all the lines with a number of fossil fuels.
So let's look at another code down.
When we're bringing the fingers, you'll see what French, we can find a generation that's working like this.
In the case, the research of these are magical models that show the bees and the relationship between different objects are known as the graphic theory.
In Chinese graph, the circumstances that make the objects known as coffee, while the colors are called a team.
Scientists like this graphic ask questions like, "How many of this extinction from it?"
"How many coffee has the most popular level?"
"Is there a conference between these two faces, and if, what's his arm?"
These graphs are often used for communication networks, but they can represent almost every network, bees in transportation and social relationships between people, acting chemistry between proteins or the spread of a universe.
So, you're excited about these techniques, back to the learning.
You're moving from the materials and the security cameras, you're going to go to the third stage, you're finding the secret, you're going to get some important hands, and you're going to do the Mexico in the ocean.
Now, you have to solve the diversity of what your science team always gives you some information.
Everybody.
If you liked this animal, try to solve these two.
Okay, I want to see hands: How many of you have taken someone from Facebook because he said something about politics or religion, treatment for children, food?
And how many of you know at least one person you're going to avoid because you just don't want to talk to?
Laughter) You know, once, you're going to be a training conversation, we'd go after the edge of the Henry Henry Bay's "I've been in the Olympic," Bash in your air and your health.
But in those days, with the change in climate and the resilience of vaccines, these issues -- but not safe.
So this world that we live in, this world where every conversation has a potential to evolve, when our politicians can't talk to each other and even the most trivial issues that have someone who's fighting is also about it and also against it, it's not normal.
France France did a study of 10,000 adults, and they found that at the moment, we're more local, we're more popular, we've ever been in history.
There's less likely to enable, which means we're not listening to each other.
And we're doing decisions about being able to live, who are to make sure and even who our friends will be, based on what we already believe.
And again, it means we're not listening to each other.
The conversation requires food between connection and listening, and somewhere over the way, we lost the food.
Now, part of this is in technology.
The mobile phone that you all have is close enough you can search it very quickly.
In France France, about a third of the Americans who are sending more than a hundred tons a day.
And most of the risks that many of them, or almost everyone will send a text to their friends than they're going to talk to them inside.
There's a great piece that's published in the book "Atlantic."
It's been written by a high school called Paul Ford.
And he gave his kids a communication project.
He wanted to teach them how to talk about specific issues without using violence.
And he said, "I got to build..."
["I've come to make a conversation that might be the most uncomfortable ability that we're failed to teach.
Children spend hours in business with ideas and help through screens, but often they have the opportunity to push their communities.
It might sound like a funny question, but we need to ask ourselves: Is there a decade of the 21st century more important than being able to keep conversations in generations and brains? "
Now, I'm going to try to talk to people: France France Foundation, trucks, billions, nations, first countries, many.
I talk to people I love. I talk to people I don't like.
Sometimes I'm talking to people that I don't agree with them in a personal level.
But I still have a great conversation.
So I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes to teach you how to talk and how to listen.
Many of you've already heard a lot of objects about this, things like looking at people in the eyes, think about interesting issues, to worry about them from the head, look, and we've been able to show you that you're listening, come back on what you've heard or like that.
So I want you to forget this.
It's mistakes.
So there's no reason to learn how you're listening if you're actually listening.
But I'm actually using those skills just as a professional and my normal life.
Well, I'm going to teach you how to don't have people, and it's actually going to help you learn how to be better conversations.
To learn to manage a conversation without spending your hands, without being able to go, and in a touch, no one.
We all had really good conversations.
We had them before. We know how it was.
These kinds of conversations that you're feeling fascinating and not inspired or when you feel that you've made a real connection or we've really changed you.
There's no reason why most interactions can't be that way.
So I've got 10 basic rules. I'm going to explain to you all, but in states, if you just choose one of them and control it, you're already going to get a better task.
Number one: Don't do a task.
And I'm not just going to put your cell phones or your text or the train of the car or what it's not going to be your hands.
I mean, there were comfortable.
There were a moment.
Don't think about the power you had with your boss.
Don't think about what you could eat a dinner.
If you want to go out of the conversation, you'll get out of the conversation, but don't have half the faces and a half out of the tree.
Number two: Don't wear.
If you want to express your knowledge without an opportunity to respond or argument or growth, wrote a blog.
But now, there's really a good reason why I'm not an expert in my program: because they're really leaving water.
If they're conservative, then they're asking Obama and food and food.
If they're lucky, they're or big, great and great companies and Dick Chile.
It's completely unexpected.
And you don't want to be like this.
You need to go into every conversation that you have something to learn.
The Scott Scott Foundation said that the real listening takes yourself on the side.
And sometimes it means to describe your personal consciousness.
He said that when you've got this box, it's going to become at least and less and more likely to open the inner corporations of its species or her magazine.
Again, you've got something to learn.
Bill: "Everybody you've ever met knows something you're not."
I'm going to say it so: Everyone is experts in something.
Number three: using open questions.
In this case, you get the journalists.
We started your questions with who, what, when, where, why or how.
If you ask a complex question, you get simple answers.
If I ask you, "Would you be afraid?"
You're going to say to the most powerful word in this sentence, which is "sophisticated," and the answer will be "yes, I was" or "No, I wasn't."
"Do you do?" "Yes, very business."
Let them describe it. They're those who know.
Try to ask them things like, "How was it?"
"How does it feel?"
Because then, maybe, they have to stop and think about it, and you get a lot more interesting answers.
Number four: Go with the finger.
It means computers to come to you and you'll have to get them out of your brain.
Many times we've heard interviews in which an organ is talking about a few minutes and then the surgeon came back and ask a question that looks like she's coming out of a place, or she's already gone.
It means that the president probably stopped listening to two minutes ago because he thought about a really smart question, and he was just ready to ask her.
And we do exactly the same thing.
We're sitting there with someone, and then we remember the time when we met Jakman at the house.
And we're producing to listen.
Scientists and ideas are going to get you.
You need to give them to come and play them.
Five: If you don't know, say you don't know.
People in the radio, especially in the public studio, much more aware of the fact that they're scared, and so they're more likely about what they argue to be experts and what they're saying to know about security.
Do that, there were the right side.
Technology doesn't have to be fair.
Number six: Don't answer your experience to them.
If they talk about a family respect, don't start talking about the time you've lost a family.
If they're talking about the problems they have at work, don't tell them how much you ask your work.
It's not the same thing. It's never the same thing.
All the experiments are personal.
And more importantly, it's not you.
You don't have to take this moment to prove how amazing you are or some of your life.
Anyone asked San Hong once her Iran, and he said, "I don't know. People who are focused on their IT are strangers."
And conversations are not an opportunity to do.
Number seven: Turkey doesn't go back on yourself.
It's about it and it's really boring, and we tend to do it a lot.
In particular in work or conversations with children, we have a point to get, so we just continue to remove it back and over again.
Don't do it.
Number eight: Homo from the details.
Basically, people don't care about years, for the boys, the lights, all of these details that you're going to try to think about.
They don't care. What they care about is you.
They care what you like, what you're going to give you.
So you forget the details.
Number seven: It's not the last one, but it's the most important.
It was listening.
I can't tell you some really important people said that listening is maybe the most, the number of you can develop.
And he said, "If you're open, you don't learn."
And Karwin Virgin said, "Nobody has never been listening itself out of his work."
So why don't we listen to each other?
One number, we prefer to talk.
When I talk, I'm on the bed.
I don't have to hear anything that doesn't interesting me.
I'm in the center of attention.
I can move in my identity.
But there's another reason: we're unemployed.
The average person is talking about 225 words in a minute, but we can listen to 500 words in a minute.
So our brain is falling the 275 other words.
And look, I know, it requires effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone, but if you can't do it, you're not in conversation.
You're just two people who're doing sentences on the same place.
Laughter) You have to listen to each other.
Steve Kenyan said it's really beautiful.
He said, "Most of us don't listen to what it means.
We're listening to the answer. "
Otherwise, the number 10, and that's this: there were short.
[] Well, it's like a kind of crowd; it's short enough to keep interested, but it's long enough to take the subject. []]]]]]]] &#
You know, I grew up with a very famous grandfather, and there was a kind of text in my house.
People would come to talk to my grandfather, and after they were thrilled, my mom had come to us, and say, "You know who it was?
She was the president of America.
She was the mayor of San Francisco.
It's reminded in the French Foundation. He's an academic in Ross. "
And I'm kind of grew up in the president that everybody has something amazing about them.
And honestly, I think it's what makes me good.
I'm talking about my plug as I can, I'm sorry about my brain open, and I'm always ready to be worried, and I'm never happy.
You did the same thing.
Put out, talk to people, listen to people, and most importantly, there were ready to be the water.
Thank you.
Thank you.
In 1956, during a metaphor of a metaphor in the Scota, the Soviet leader Nigeria said to the Western House, "Mary and Egyptians!"
He also took it to English so: "We're going to run you!"
This profound that I was sent to the House in the Western world, and I got the conversation between the death and the United States that were in the West War.
There's the arguments that you're going to call it a beef of East or a long decade.
It turns out, the rise of a chicken's orchestra is too low.
At the beginning of the context, you have to transform his words to this: "We're more likely to live when you get you," What means that the anonyma will stay more than the capitalism, the less than Iran.
Despite the driving meaning was reduced at the end, the first effect of the words of Richard's words, and the way the world was to lead to a nuclear gene.
So look at the complexity of language and cultural platform, how do these things don't happen all the time?
Some of the answer is in decades and the training of the prosthetic moments that allow them to get out of the language.
For most of the history of history, you're going to do particularly in the floor, when the things and the moments are doing the objects to allow you to talk.
But after the radio technologies, a new corporation system evolved over the second war of the second world.
In the way, the central Chinese also reveals the courage speakers into a microphone while they talk.
Unfortunately, the audience can choose the language of the malaria is you want to track.
On the surface, it seems to be flow, but behind the dogs, human emotions work without extended to ensure that every idea is being done as we did.
And it's not a simple task.
A professional person who's talking about two languages require two years of training to expand its words and control the skills that are going to become reduced.
To get to the unnatural task of connection in the time, students go after things and repeat all their word just like they heard in the same language.
Over the time, they start to reduce what was said, and you're going to have a fossil changes in the way.
At some point, a second language is made.
It's a trust in this way that creates new ways in the brain that's transparency, and the effort is replaced in the way it's going to reduce two.
Over time and after a lot of hard work, the moments control the space of tricks to keep the speed of speed, deal with a challenge, and deal with a variety of strangers.
They may be used in my head to make a lot of long-term, they're going to spend in general over the collections, or they're going to go to the slides and help others.
They can even leave a motor in the original language, as they look at the most accurate leader.
It's also conducted to keep the wind in front of the bus.
Remember, they don't have control of who's going to say what, or some of the cousins will hear.
The surprise can come in every moment.
Like yes, they're a lot of times doing thousands of people and centuries of Amazon, like the general President of the United States.
In order to keep their feelings, they're going to make a restaurant for every task, building words from the head, read on the subject of the subject, and they're going to be previous about it.
Finally, participants work in the cases.
While one collapse is going to transform water in real time, the other thing you're going to do with documents, searching for words, and they're trying to reduce positive information.
Because the cartoons of techniques require an hour, every 30 minutes, the partner is reduced in jobs.
The success depends on a very special action.
Technology is complex, and when ideas are spread or convenient arguments in their body, the results can be cartoons.
Like the Wall Street, "War is what happens when language is failed."
My legs are aware of it more than the rest, and they've been working in presidents behind the dogs to worry that it's never going to happen.
In 1997, a French woman named Jay Center, after 122 years and 164 days on the planet, what made it to the most famous person in history.
Her age was so amazing that Luba took a million dollars to everyone who could get her poem.
But in reality, live until this age or beyond it's a very simple challenge, maybe not even a person, it's likely to get.
The human body just doesn't have any extinction.
Our border is about 90 years old.
But what's really the meaning of aging and how does it move into the middle of the body to stay in life?
We know autism what it means to fix.
For a few, it means to get rid, while others, it's a device.
And it's still hard to find a scientific definition to need.
What we can say is that agencies are happening when the intervention and interactions with the environment, like light, noise in the air, water, and our motion, make changes in the structure of the structure and the molecules of our body.
These transformations in their diversity, and in that way, the intuition of organism is all about.
The mechanisms of agencies aren't very happy.
But recently, scientific scientists would prove physical properties, which are genetic changes to change the new capacity of a cell, that play a central role.
First of all, when years goes, our bodies have been genetic organisms in a way of developing DNA.
It's going on natural as the DNA of the body's body is changing, but also in cells don't expect.
Brothers called a very sensitive atmosphere for this cosmos.
The airplane represents an architect magazine, or ATM, the main energy source of all of the disciplines, the atmosphere is also a lot of different activities, and you're doing a very important role in chemical cells.
If the autonomous emissions are right, then the cells, and later, all the man, they're translated as well.
Otherwise changes are happening in the expressive patterns of genes, which are also genetic, which are affecting the body tissues and cells.
The genes that's produced or collapsed in a little bit of babies that are born, become more adult people, what's going to open up to the development of policies, like Alzheimer's disease, who's left the aging.
Even if we can avoid these strange genetic changes, even our cells can't save us.
The fact remains stem cells, life itself, transparency when we expect.
Our DNA's DNA is long in chimpanzees, every one has two areas coming in a team that's called TV.
It's short every time it comes out.
When the materials get too short, cells are produced to part and die, and we're going to reduce the body to reinvent itself.
With the tumor, cells are more and more and more, the process that's made the cell cycle at a time, like when a lot of cancer cancer cells.
But the response is going on more when we're missing, and you're making the rain and they're going to change their capacity.
Specience is also a stem stem cells that are coming in many cases that can be part without a gene to reinvent other cells.
When we're missing, stem stem cells are collecting their money, and we tend to lose their new potential, and so you're affecting tissues and extension of our original organisms.
Other changes are connected to the capacity of cells to function right.
When they're missing, they're not able to do the quality of quality of the proteins, what causes the techniques of faces and regulations that can keep, what's going to lead to a limited evolutionary activity that can be a category for them.
The communication between a bed, which is at the end of what's at the end of the capacity of the body's code.
There's a lot that we don't understand still about aging.
In the end, are life long as we know them to be interested in repair, medicine, or something else?
Will future technologies like we gave robots into cells, or genetic treatment, enabled our ancestors?
And do we want to live more time than we live?
Throughout 122 years as inspiration, you don't know where our curiosity will take us.
And around the world, there's about 60 million people who were going to leave their homes to kill war, violence and radiation.
Most of them have become an interpretation, which means they're killed by their own, but still in their country.
Others want high and they were looking out of their country.
They're usually focused on refugees.
But what's exactly this moon says?
The world's famous for thousands of years, but the modern definition goes on the United States of 1951 that's been reduced to the tons of refugees as a response to the president of the second war.
It's a refugee as someone who's exposed to his speech, and it's not able to go back to his country because of the fear is very based to be previous.
This extension can be in their gut, the door, the speech, the companies in a certain social group, or political consciousness, and it's often a source of war and violence.
Today, about half the refugees in the world are children, some of them don't worry by adults, a situation that makes them particularly surprise to children or to work.
Each story of refugee is different, and there's a lot to go through a certain journey with not lights.
But before we get to what their journey including, let's move something.
There's a lot of the bone on the road between the brand "from" and "Ford."
The term "Marians" usually depends on people who have their countries for reasons that don't have to go to Derek, like better economic opportunities or female areas because in a better search.
There are a lot of people around the world who have been done because of nature's disasters, invisible, and others, but the law between national, in justice or not, you know, just in the world that are devastated and violence as refugees.
So what's going on when somebody's going on from his country?
Most of the refugees are long and dangerous with a limited approach, water, or food.
Because the female can be surprised and uncomfortable, the forces can stay behind, and people who come up with a lot of times don't have the restaurant documents, like Turkey, to move on plants and get into other countries.
Social and politics can also prevent them to prevent in normal ways.
It means that they can usually avoid just in the same way or the sea, and you need to take their lives in the hands of profits to help them treat boundaries.
While some people spend security with their families, others are trying to move alone and features behind the time and hope to come back later.
This discipline can be autism and uncomfortable.
While more than a half of the world are in cities, sometimes the first piece of metaphorus is a refugee, it's usually been conducted by the United Nations or local governments.
Freedom refugees are going to be at the same time, that you're going to spend a short period of time until the Iraq can go back to their house, to be scared in the Arabic country, or listen to the country in another country.
But the options will repeat and reduce long-term term limits many times.
So a lot of refugees remain without healthy, but to stay in reasons for years and sometimes even decades.
Once they're in a new country, the first step of the person that I've been trying to ask.
At this point, they're looking for a needle and not known as refugees until they're going to get rid.
While states are generated to the definition of refugees, every country is responsible for the whole sensors to the spread and decide if the crimes can get the rise of refugee.
The president of different countries can be significant.
Science countries have some task for people that they've known as refugees, like to make a neural standard for treatment and intuition.
The most basic fact of refugees is not to remove to the country from it, basically that's inevitable to send people to the country in which their lives and their jobs are exposed.
In reality, with that, refugees are many times the victims for a chimpanzee and not me.
They're more sophisticated and more to rebuild their lives in front of magic and gas.
And so many times, they're going to go into the power of the workforce, and they're completely translated in humanitarian help.
In addition, a lot of too many children don't get to school in the insection of education programs.
If you go back to your family theory, the risks are that you're going to find that in a certain point, your ancestors were killed in their own life, or they're going to get out of war or refugee.
It's going to be good if we remember their stories when we hear about refugees now, when they're looking for a new house.
Your brain on food if you were to get all of your brain from your brain and reduce it to its physical components, how would it look?
Most of your brain's weight of your brain comes from magazines, that's also known.
In the rest of the material in the brain, you'll find proteins and believe, small types of magnitude, and gas.
The brain is, of course, more than just the magnitude of the muscles in it, but every component has a significant effect on activity, development, the wind and the energy.
So the effect after the engagement, or the values at night you may feel, well, it can be the effects of the food on your brain.
Over your brain's faces, the stars are three and six.
These hot corporations, which has been used to predict neutral disease, sensors to come from Darta.
So the richer of rich chs in the gene, like Amazons, walls, and beetles, positive to create and represent the cells.
And while magazines are good for your brain, you need to have a long time of other artists, like Trushes and Southern School, can move in the brain health.
In the time, proteins and ambitities, the main building of growth and development, affects how we feel and behavior.
Social disciplines know the building of the Nigerian Tunisians, the chemical lessons that do the corporations between the News, and they affect the wind condition, the interest, and the weight.
They're one of the reasons that maybe we're going to feel bad after a big budget of Kenya, or more intervention after a rich event in proteins.
The complexity of components in the food can move brain cells into a horrible horizon, and Tonin that's changing the wind.
But to get to your brain is complicated, and we believe that we need to get a limited approach.
Dardia with a fake diversity is helping to keep a fabric of life senses, and it's released on the wind condition in one direction or another.
Like the other men in our bodies, our brains are enabled by a fixed magazine.
It's kind of unprecedented in the corporations and demands the brain to fight free health that are used cells, and it allows your brain to work for more long periods.
And for me that powerful magazines, like Titan in B6, B12, and our brains will be sensitive to brain disease and health care.
Civil characters of the microbes in the luck, convenient, summer, and there's also positive for the brain health and an academic development.
In order to have a sustainable, and it's about activating these valuable materials, it needs fuel, and a lot of it.
While the human brain is only two percent of the body's face, it's using 20 percent of the energy interface.
Most of this energy comes from a fifth of our bodies from all of our bodies, or a sugar in the blood.
The previous nations are so sensitive to return in the globe, in fact, change in a traffic activity is one of the main characteristics in magazines.
And we're going to get a globe in a way, how is the particular kind of fear that we eat affecting our brain?
Fields come in three generations: Hollywood, sugar, and sisters.
While most of the prosthetic experiments, they're going to have a certain amount of carbon dioxide, the connection between the two groups of the secret and the lights to all the states affect how the body and the brain comes from.
I'll have a high school value, like fighting a white bone, causes a high speech of gas in the blood, and then you'll get a conversation.
The summer is fed, and with it, our attention and the wind.
On the other hand, the boundary is on, genes, and the cartoons have a more sophisticated gas, which allows a more constant level of a sea.
The power of the brain goes on, a ridiculous choice of ridiculous rivers in magazine is critical.
When it comes to what you're going on, you're going to go, you're waiting, and you're doing, your choices have a direct effect and a long-term impact on your body.
If you had surgery, you may remember that you were able to go back from a bridge, seven, eight, and then you won the surgery already before you even got to do it.
And it might look like you have, but you're not.
You've been under the restaurant, which is much more complex.
You'd be uncomfortable, but you couldn't get rid, create solutions, or hopefully, feel like a pain.
There's no way to be able to save all of these processes together, a lot of surgeries were much more traumatic to do.
Civil medical texts are made out of extinction, Asia and the Middle East would all have a early level that's made things like a biomatic bias, Frank Radiak, and to code.
Today, a lot of times a lot of people get regions, president and parents to get the food to open.
The president of signals as a specific part of the body comes to the brain.
Otherwise and other signals that come through the nervous system as electrical signals.
The asteroid works by the level of electricity.
They're linked to the proteins in the nerves of the nervous cells that allow the telescopes to get in, and they're going to get sick, and they're going to have a positive fingerprint.
One component that does this is a coffee, which is the effect of his fingerprint has changed when a medical student put the eyes a little bit about us.
It's still local to use the dirt, but much of the most common, there's a similar chemical structure and they're working in the same way.
But a big surgery there you need to be unusual, you want something that works on all the nerves, including the brain.
That's what's shown in where you do.
In the Western medicine, Ethiopian website was the first one.
He was more known as a regular pair until doctors started to understand that people sometimes didn't notice that they got under the effects.
In the '90s' 90s, they started to teach patients with a website during a teenager and surgery.
Netrothers became popular in the next decade, and it's still used today.
Even though we're other citizens, like Porus France, more common.
It's usually an artificial demand in a restaurant, which was developed in the '70s of the 19th century.
Scientic materials are conducted by insects like Paul Paul, which causes the prison, and optimistic, like Pennestinian, which is a pain.
It seems to be that the rules work also by influencing electrical signals in the nervous system.
Unfortunately, the electrical corporations of the brain is the same as autism when different parts of the brain communicates with each other.
This categories show you cities and awareness.
But when somebody's feedback, these signals become more and more organisms, what makes different parts of the brain doesn't talk more with each other.
There's a lot more we don't know exactly how it happens.
The number of common rates are able to make GAAAAAA in the building of the brain.
They're bringing open hair, and they're spending into a third telescope into the cell.
Technological proteins come together and act like a summer, they're replaced with electrical signals.
The nervous system has a lot of cities like this, that control the fibers of motion, memory, and the train.
Most of the fish probably work on more than one, and they're not just working on the nervous system.
Many of the fish also affect the heart, the lung, and other positive men.
It's just like the early patterns, which can be familiar with notes like Ray and Nicon, modern drugs can be serious effects.
So most of you have to mix exactly the right vision of drugs to create the features of the restaurant, as they're going to have a meter at the bottom of the patient's eye, and make most of the drugs by the need.
The fish is complicated, but it realized how to use it to reduce the development of good surgery and new techniques.
You can learn how to do these regulations in a savings and a kitchen, reinventing posters, to replace dozens and objects, and a lot of surgery enables me in other lives.
And every year, new refugees are enabled to ensure that more patients will survive the training of the surgery.
You're going to the doctor and he's going to put you some tests.
The doctor's doctor that you have a high astronomer and you've told you to take a drug for that.
So you get a sound box.
You have a certain security, your doctor has a certain security that it will do the work.
The company that developed this has been a lot of studies, which came up with the food and drugs.
They've looked at it in the Science, in the curiosity.
They've seen it. They have some idea of how it works, they have some idea of what they're losing.
It should be okay.
You're managing a little bit more than a minute with your doctor and your doctor and a little bit worried because you've recently been in a bad moon, you didn't feel like a normal, you couldn't have the benefits of the things in life like usually.
The doctor says, "You know, I think you're a little bit about depression.
"I've got to give you another planet."
Now we're already talking about two drugs.
It's also the old generation -- millions of people took it, the company did studies, the manager in the same -- everything's good.
It's probably all going to be okay.
It's probably all going to be okay.
But, just a moment.
How much did we read these two together?
It's very hard to do.
In fact, we don't have to do it.
We're focusing on "Star" after the Wow, "after the drugs were going to be a female.
How can we find out if things are not good between two drugs?
Three? Five drugs?
Would you ask your favorite person that has a couple of drugs in some drugs, it takes right now.
Why do I care about this problem?
I'm going to care about it very much.
I'm a scientist and a data study, and in fact, I think, the only hope -- the only hope -- to understand these interactions is to take a lot of data's interactions to find when you can use drugs in a safe and I'm not so safe.
So let me tell you a story of the data science.
And it begins with my student, Next.
It's called "News," because it's his name.
So Next was a young student.
I said, "You know, Next, we need to understand how drugs work together, and how they work in France," and we don't have a understanding of who knows what. "
But the food and the drugs remained an amazing information.
It's an information of negative actions.
They're really waiting for the Internet -- say to the public, you can all take it right now -- hundreds of thousands of pounds of negative actions of patients, doctors, companies, farmers.
And these dogs are pretty simple: as all the diseases of them suffer, all of the drugs that it takes, and all the negative effects, or the loads of the loads, that they experience.
These are not all the third effects that are happening in America today, but these are hundreds and hundreds of thousands of drugs.
So I said to Nigeria, "Let's think about gas.
"The gas is very important, and we know that it's about conservation.
"Let's see if we can understand the response to the gas."
I sent Nigeria to his way.
"First," he said, "I created a imagination that can look at the Western effects of a drug based on this information," which can tell you if this drug is going to change the list of the gas. "
He did it. It's very simple, somehow.
He took all of the drugs that was known that they'd change the gas and some drugs that didn't change the gas, and he said, "What's the difference in their loads?
"What's the difference in the sense of sensory?
"All of these things together gave him a really good tool.
He said, "Robs, I can go, just about 93 percent" When a drug will change the gas. "
I said, "Nick, it's great."
He's a young student and he has to encourage his self-security.
"But Next, there's a problem.
"Every doctor in the world knows all the drugs that change the gas," because it's very important in our action.
"So great, good work, but not really interesting," and it's not something you can publish. "
And he said, "I know, Iraq. I thought that's what you're going to say."
Let's take a guy.
"I thought that's what you're going to say, so I did another experiment.
"I looked at people in this information magazine who took two drugs at the same time," and I was looking at similar signals, Syrian School change, "in people who take two drugs," when every one of the drugs didn't change the list of the gas, "but together they gave up a strong. &
And I said, "Oh! You take a good idea.
And there's a group of drugs, not very exciting.
But what you've put my attention was, that on the list was two drugs: French, or Cape, against depression, and Frankin, or French, or an asteroid, a drug for an asteroid.
And I said, "Ah! millions of Americans take these two drugs."
In fact, we've found that, 15 million Americans take a clinic at a moment, 15 million on Frankin, and as a million, we've done, you take them.
So it's a million people who may suffer from problems with their gas if the conference of his legitimate in the information of the food and the drugs will be treated in the test.
But I said, "It's still not enough for the philosophical," because I love what's done with the chicken and the machine, "but what we don't have exactly uncomfortable interventions."
So we need to do something else.
Let's go into the electronic medicine of Stanford.
We've got his blueprint that's coming to the study, we've taken information from the identity.
And I said, "Let's see if people take these two drugs," there's a problem with their gas. "
There's a lot of people in the medical apartment of Stanford who have prosthetics and Franciscin.
But we needed special patients.
We needed patients from these drugs and they had the institutions of gas, and then they started with the other and they had another galleries, all of this in a long time -- something like two months.
And when we did this, we found 10 patients.
But, for eight of the 10, there was a click on the roof of of the gas when they got the second "Second" -- we call it "and" -- "when they got the second". "
It doesn't matter what it was before, once in the second century, the globe was made in 20 million pounds.
It's just a reminder, in natural way you have, if you're not scary, you're a globe in the '90s.
And if it costs to 120, 125, your doctor starts to think about the security of a chimpanzea.
So a fifth of 20 -- quite significant.
I said, "Nick, it's really funny.
"But unfortunately we don't have an article," because it's 10 patients, in your life -- "it's not enough patients."
So we said, what can we do?
And we said, "Let's call our friends in Hollywood and Bernesland," which is also -- the Robert university university in the Boston, and Derek Business, "they also have electronic information from our own.
And we'll see if they can find a tremendous patients with the "one" and "the other", "and with the guns of the gas that we need.
And Derebert, Luke, found one week 40 patients like this with the same gene.
The Robert found 100 patients.
So at the end, we've had 150 patients from three medical chimpanzees that showed us that patients who get these two drugs have received a significant gas.
And more interesting, we didn't invite the conference, because in the title of a scanner, the gas is already crazy.
When we looked at the globe of a cartoon, it's got 60 kilometers to Twitter, not just 20.
It was something serious, and we said, "We have to publish it."
We've changed the article.
It was all of data interviews, data from the food and drugs, text data, modern data, data from Robert.
We didn't even do one real experiment.
But we were scared.
So Next, while the article passed, went to the lab.
We've found somebody who's in the lab.
I'm not about it.
I'm treating patients, but I don't do pounds.
They were taught us to feed men in drugs.
We took men and give them one "one", prototype.
In a few other men, we've come from Frankin.
And a third group of men gave them two.
And it's unfortunately, the galleries of the globe had been done in 20 to 60 miles per capita.
So the article was based on the evidence of the data just, but we put a little piece at the end: "Oh, by the way, if you give it to the men, it's going."
It was great, and the story could be in there.
But I have six and a half minutes.
And so we're sitting in and think about this, and I don't remember who thought about it, but someone said, "Well, if patients take these two drugs" and we're sitting in the fingerprints of the French.
"They're able to experience it."
How can we look at this?
We said, well, what do you do?
If you take a drug, one new drug or two, you have a strange feeling.
What do you do?
You're going to go into Google and you're taking the two drugs that you're taking or the one you take, and you're focusing on "fabulous actions."
What you experience.
So we said, "Okay," Give your Google if they're going to put us in their sophisticated health, "so we can look at the search of search" and look at if patients wake up these trees. "
Google, it made me say, Mexico for our hard.
So I was in the box.
I was in a dinner with a friend who was working on "Microsoft," and I said, "We wanted to do what research," Google Mexico, it's pretty much in the box. "
He said, "Well, we've got the beetle out."
It's true.
It's great.
Now I felt like I've been -- Laughter) I felt like I'm talking to Nigeria again.
It works in one of the big companies in the world, and I'm trying to make it feel better.
But he said, "No, Iraq, maybe you don't understand.
"No, we just have the beetle of Hong:" If you use the Internet to Twitter to do emotions in Google, "Oh, Jah, what wouldn't be...
"So for a year and a half, we're putting this information into" research goals "only."
I said, "These are bees!"
It was a horrible horrible, my friend in a microscope.
So we've done a study where we've made 50 words that a normal person might survive if it's the French, like, "Freedom," "" "" is a lot of you, "" "" ""
So we've got 50 instructions that we've made: "The French."
And we first created a basis.
And it turns out it's about half percent to one percent of all of the animals on the Internet contains one of these words.
This is our basic level.
If people teach "Frankin" or "Chile" -- these are the words that are previous -- and one of these words, then the devastation is affected over two percent, if you know that the word "prosthetic" is already there.
If it's "Franklin," the device goes to three percent of the basis.
If "Frankin" and "Frankin" means that they're in the cell, it's going to go to 10 percent, it's a huge amount of three or four times in these two drugs that's interested in us, and it's the prosperity of geography.
We've published it, and it's got attention.
The reason that it's fabric of attention is that the patients tell us in their fingerprints through their beetles.
We've built the attention of the food and drugs.
It's called them.
They've taken programs from following social networks in cooperation with a microscope, which has a beautiful, and with others, to look at Twitter objects, to look at Facebook, to look at a search of search for search, to try to try and figure out an active signals that are going to be done in the face of drugs, or together, problems.
What's my lesson in this? Why to tell the story?
Well, first of all, we've now got the extension of a lot of data and bionic data that allows us to understand interactions between drugs and actually, basically, activity of drugs.
How do drugs work?
It's producing, and it's created, and it's a new ecosystem to understand how drugs work and reduce the use of them.
Now, it's a professor at the University of Korea.
He did it in his pocket with hundreds of drugs.
He found some very important interactions, and so we made it and showed that it's a way that really works and succeeding to a social interaction.
But there are some things.
We don't take one hour of drugs.
As I said earlier, there are patients who take three, five, seven, seven drugs.
Would they really happen in the context to their blind interaction?
Right, we can look at the pairs: Ha and a brother, a brother and a hand, but what with a cell, a bar, a hand, and it's all together, and it's all together, at the same table by the same patient, which may be interacted with them in ways that's made up of effective or compromising the effect, or causes
We really have no idea.
It's an open horizon, an unknown sense for us to use data to try and understand interactions between drugs.
Two other lessons: I want you to think about the power that we've been able to create with the data from people who have tried their negative effects through their farmers, themselves, through their doctors, the people who were killed to the information in Stanford, and Resert, to be used for research.
People worry about science.
They're worried about privacy and their security -- and right.
We need conventional systems.
But we can't be a system that's based on the data, because it's too rich of inspiration, innovation and discovery for new things in medicine.
And the last thing I want to say is, in this case, we found two drugs and it was a little bit sad story.
The two drugs really created problems.
They've gone from a galaxy.
They could make someone a service in other reasons he didn't have, so you'd like to use these two drugs very carefully together, maybe not take them together, maybe you're going to have any other drugs.
But there was another possibility.
We could find two or three drugs that work in interaction and create a positive effect.
We could discover new effects of drugs that don't exist to one of them in France, but together, instead of getting a new actions, they can have a new treatment of disease that we don't have treatment or that treatment is not effective.
If we take a physician treatment today, all of the important details -- HIV, to regret, depression -- it's always a cooperation of drugs.
So the positive side here, and the subject to a different TED Talk, on another day, is how can we use them from the same data forms to find positive effects of drugs that will create new treatments that will create new treatments, new insights in the direction of drugs, and let us treat our patients even better?
Thank you.
Thank you.
The analogy of the analogy on the restaurant group.
It's about the prosperity that you're going to take the last trick.
Monna's minds of energy trust.
A lot of people like to win a confident on the road, move to the restaurant group, and I'm going to end in Scott.
But here's the question: Do you have to be autonomous about Google?
Did the business in Scott really do so good for us, or is it just a female and a price?
What does science mean?
First of all, many of the chemical activity is good for the body, and it's certainly true.
In a physical activity, especially at the age of young, there are many health solutions, like the bones, the spray has a bad asteroid from the walls, and it's a high pressure, a high pressure, and it's safe.
Like, when we're going to do with our physical activity is released a number of chemicals, including analogy.
These natural hormones, that control the response and prosperity in the central nervous system, can lead to the emotion of theory, or, what's called "House". "
A limited level of anthropologists and active activity in a general way can push the river and improve the wind and the memory.
So does it mean that trust in a fifth room five times a week is used in the same way like the walls in a spint as part of a group?
Well, here's what it's going to be interesting: because it turns out that if you can find a tremendous cloud and a group that you like, studies show that there are many solutions beyond the physical and the features of self-trust.
The most significant advantage is a psychological understanding, also a short term and a long-term term.
It's a dog from the slide experience of being part of a group, for example, learning to join and look at others, you've got help, help help, work for a common police.
In addition, it's conducted to a team, and it's about something as fun can help the trust of trust.
It's also the power that's transparency in the Street School represents the risk of depression as a coffee of four years.
In the time, the self-esteem and your self-security can get a significant empathy.
There are some reasons.
One's going to go on the trust.
In work on reverse development, especially with a good artist, you're looking at self-growth.
So you'll say, "Even if I can't do something today, I can get better with trust and represent the goal."
This kind of thinking is useful in all of life life.
And there's also learning through failure, one of the most significant solutions and the worst effect that there's a decade.
Social experiment can build health and self-awareness that requires to deal with academic patients, social and physics.
So even if your group doesn't wait all the time, or not worse at all, there's a real disability to experience itself.
Not all of us will be invited from a sport.
Perhaps one group is too intuitive, or not intuitive enough.
It can also take time to find the spinal cloud that's coming into your home.
It's completely okay.
But if you get a little bit of time for search, you can find a spint that's coming to your own personality, and if you're going to be able to have a lot of time.
You're going to be part of a professional community, you're going to look at self-security, you're going to be your body, and we'll show your brain, and it's without reminding the president that you're going to have.
The basic goal of a body's body's body is a self-esteem of food emissions.
In historical times, the natural selective selection of genocide that can be reduced by the most important library.
Because most of the human history has been the general, the genetics has evolved to predict a president.
So when's a body who became in my eyes?
The third effects of weight won't be diagnosed at all in medical school until the 18th century.
In the same time, technology academic and cooperating to the public health care that will reduce quality, the amount of food and food diversity.
It's an engagement of good food can be a healthier population for economics.
It's been reduced, and it's been the condition and the current time.
By the middle of the 19th century, the alphase was caused as a green health care, and a hundred years later, it's been a category.
What's the difference between a weight weight and the alphase?
Technology called BMI'll notice between the two.
For instance, if someone weighs 65 pounds and a 1.5 feet, it has a BMI of about 29.
It's a situation of a body's field that's going on as a BMI'll be over 30, just over the top of 25 to 299.
While BMI can be useful to appreciate a healthy weight, in fact, one percent of the body's skin can actually be just by looking at information like a season and a muscle.
For instance, for example, there's a high BMI.
So how do you get to the situation of the atmosphere?
In the most basic way, it's going to be rid of an analogy of analogy.
If the energy consumption is a big energy consumption from physical activity, the body gets the list of the categories as an accident.
In most cases, this balance comes to the task of reasons and choices.
More adults have to do at least two and a half of a metaphor activity a week, and children need an hour a day.
But as often, one of four adults and eight of 10 meters are not active enough.
Social rates of agriculture and agriculture grow together with a coffee that's going to be a psychiatric.
And the resources are rare, and inequality to healthy and the friends have created even larger risk in complexity.
And yet, our genetic car is also a role.
Scientists about families and fossil water have shown that you'll make a weight of weight.
Second studies also found a connection between obesity and changes in the microbes that live in the room.
It doesn't matter why, it's going to be a global epidemic.
It's a significant impression of diseases, like a dog, heart disease, a high blood pressure, and cancer.
It's affecting all the farmers, the rainforest, and the Social Society in developing countries and development.
With 60 percent of children in the world in just two decades, the problem is significant to move from it.
Once a person who's too happy, the journey to the universe becomes more and more.
The hormonal changes and nanolic changes the response of the body to get rid.
After a weird of weight, a person with the chicken survived less categories in the same way that's found natural in the same weight, and that's why it's much harder to get the weight.
And when people wear weight, they're moving into the nervous nerves more than the brain to measure food and graphic consumption.
There's, with that, some evidence that changes are long-term motors in behavior can lead to birds in the health problems that are made to get rid.
And it's weight of changes that are used in the forest of life, or popular treatments like healthy surgeons can improve insulin and insulin.
What we've ever had was the decline that we've been working now.
When the world population continues to slow and big, transparency and an aware of healthy weight for more positive and regulation.
And with the map that's affected every country in the world for many different anonymous, which can't show as a terrible issue.
A more global steps for the intervention for the weight of the world.
In this particular world, a group of your resistance is the last hope of humanity.
Unfortunately, you're all going to go by the hormones and sold and sold you into the future corner to their small generation.
Before you're perfect to stop, you're seeing a lot of numbers that's coming out.
But every piece of strength is made by an electric addition with a window.
You find that one of you will be able to try to win, but just after I'm going to have a challenge while all the other people will eat the genetic benefits in the morning.
With her perfect concept, Asia is the blueprint choice.
You're giving it a very strange voice so that the rest can listen to her.
When you're going to get you, you're hearing my arms out of one of the stairs, and then they're powerful.
It's a crazy voice that it has to put a code that's put three positive numbers that are fine, so the second number is big or equally equal, and the third is worth two.
It can ask to three lucks, but if it's going to make a sense of my body, or say something else, it's going to just go back to the boss.
The first speech, the voice says, the device of the three numbers is 36.
When Gabby sits the other light, he says to her that the three numbers are the same to the finish of the stadium in it.
There's a long box.
You're sure you're going to remember the number of the stadium, but you don't have a way to know it, and it can't say it in the sound.
If you can put the code at this point, it will do it, but instead, it's driving the third speech, and the sound is the biggest number is just one time in the wall.
Things later, the investment of the electrical improvisation is caused for a couple of seconds, and you understand that Ghana was in the conversation.
Unfortunately, her room isn't safe, so it's all the information you get.
Can you find the solution?
Go on the next screen to sell the solution.
Three 2, you're worrying about the fact that you don't know the number of Egypt, but you decide to start from all the beginning.
From the first speech, you're looking at the eight spontaneously spontaneously producing 36.
One of those has to be true, but what about them?
Now there's the hard part.
Even though you don't know what number you're looking for, really deciding to look at every third of numbers.
So you see.
All the drugs exist from a unique skill, but if the number of the stadium comes to each of those, Asia would know the right tree so without asking the third hour.
Because it's hard to get the speech, the number of stadium has to fit the only one that's more than a task: three weeks.
But what's the fingers that expect to three weeks is true: 16,6,2,2,29?
So the third hour comes.
Because he tells you that the largest number is unique, 2,2,9 has to be the code.
When the night is treated, you and the other people take a way through a three-hour, and you're going to expect to the Alexanda outside.
You've seen yourself with biological math.
Now the time to release the rest of the world.
How does the French revolution communicate to the regulation of Satan NASA's "The 200 million dollars on Mars?
In fact, a lot of connection.
This discovery has been affected by the crime between two methods of media, the only American institutions and the only international institutions or the original system.
So what about the French revolution?
Let's explain.
Throughout most of the human history, unfortunately, like a weight of a graph or a hand of a hand were not accurate and changed from a place to a place.
And different areas are not just using different words.
But they also had different boxes.
Unfortunately, the Indian selection, the Western Indian method decided to most of the Israeli reference to books and men in Europe, but Mars of learning like John William William Willikes to the Street of Scientists were less successful.
With a quarter of a million different points in a restaurant, any significant change will be made for a restaurant.
And in the 1989, the swim that it did.
The leaders of the French revolution is not just evolved from the Nigeria.
They've also asked to transform the society on the regular principles of the age of the general age.
When the new government came to the conference, the academic of science was designed to have a reform in a single system.
Technologists who are based on restaurants or local nurses have been reduced in natural math relationship.
For instance, the square, which has been reduced in biological, has been rapidly 10 to 10 to a quarter between the equal line of the North Korean.
And the new female method was, on the top of the Canada Canada Canada, "For all the people, to the right."
Lestra of the points were also politics for the faces.
Stapes couldn't do any more local connection to jump more than the people's chicken, while the government could collect more effectively.
And it's going to make a new French year with a minute week, it's been reduced by the first inner power.
This new system was not easy.
In fact, it's created in a small gene.
In the beginning, people used new words to the end of the innovation, and the year of the Kenyan French eventually remained.
When President France came to the video, it allows the businesses to use the traditional points that were replaced by the trivial method.
But the trivial remains the external standard, and spread around the continent and around the French.
While the Egyptian of Nigeria's Valley is about eight years old, her legislation has been taught a lot beyond it.
How many countries have come back to the innovation students with getting them.
Otherwise, we realized the value of genetics in the age of trade between international.
After Portugal and Netherlands went to the restaurant from the Freedom, other nations went after them, and that's how the method goes around the world by Canadian instructions.
The main chemistry of France, Britain has been conducted to the ideas of revolutionary and married on its traditional points.
But for the next two centuries, the British government has been passed by the trick, first of my head was training the method as a optimism before I'm going to take it into an artist.
However, this crisis came too late for three quantibiotics to the past we've already had hundreds of years.
The United States of America has come up with the anthropologists of the Kenyan and today remained one of three states only three countries that still didn't lost the trick.
Despite regulations and innovation for the trial method, a lot of Americans are reduced as a foot and Paul more intuitive.
And in Iranian way, some of the trial that we've ever thought was a revolutionary for a global convenience.
However, the trick method is almost universal using science and medicine, and it's going to open up on the original principles.
For a long time, statistics were actually killed by a physical typical prototype that was conducted.
But the survival of technology and the imagination, the approach is made for these objects and the privilege of their invisible insurance now with standards that are based on universal actions, like the light of the light.
Social institutions are that part of our daily life life that's hard to appreciate what's significant to human beings are.
And as she started a political revolution, the trick remained a positive method for the future science revolutions to come.
I'm a Tasmanian artist who's worst because I started the French movement.
The button is that when you take a cartoon or read out to the Iranian environment, in a typical style -- or, more in the right, without regulations and limits.
But when I started this 10 years ago, I didn't have a word to this, I didn't have any language about it, I didn't have a vision of grow.
Everything I wanted was something hot and made by a person on the back of the Ford Central Center, I looked at them every day.
So I took the door.
I call it an alphase work.
I didn't really know that this little piece would change my life.
So obviously the response was interesting.
It's about me and I thought, "What else can I do?"
Can I do something in the public region that will get the same response?
So I've been looking at the page of the production by my house.
The response was profound.
People would take their cars and get out of the cars to look at it, and look at their head and die at it, and take it down and take it down to it, and all that was really exciting for me and I wanted to go through every deep page in the neighborhood.
And as I did it more, the response was more powerful.
So at this point, I'm in the name.
I'm a teacher.
It was a device.
I discovered my new passion and the urban environment was my games.
So these are some of my early work.
I was very curious from the idea of improving the age of improvement, today's beauty, even the forest, and not take the identity or its own functions, but just give him a very, very, very, very, very well.
And it was fun for me.
It was really fun to take objects and make them come to life.
So...
I think we're all seeing the contrast in this, but -- Laughter) I was at the point where I wanted to take it in a series.
I wanted to analyze this.
I wanted to know why I gave it to a look at my life, why I had an answer to it, why other people came to it so powerful.
And I realized something.
We're all living in the digital world, but we're still using something that you can connect with.
I think we've all been reduced by the developed cities that we're living, and awareness and privacy, and huge, and we don't even compare about these things more.
So when you're going to be able to take a prosperity that's going on in the road and it looks so not instead and then in regulation -- you're spending a connection to it, it's the moment.
It's the moment I love and it's the moment I love to share with others.
So at this point, my curiosity went.
I've gone from the chemicals and my grandmother's officials to create what I can do with this material.
Can I do something big and big scale and that can't be overcome?
So the bus happened.
It was a real game for me.
I've always had a dream of it.
At this point, people remember my jobs, but there was not a lot of there that was a tool that was at a big scale, and it was certainly the first urban airplane that was going to be on the roof.
So at this point, I hope or I'm going to do something interesting.
Perhaps I started the road, but I'm certainly not alone.
It came to a global telescope.
People around the world did this.
And I know this because I went to some parts of the world that I've never been in before, and I've come up with a blueprint and I think I didn't expect it.
So when I looked after my goals with my art -- these are a lot of my last work -- so there was also a conference.
The restaurant also grew up.
And this experiment showed me the powerful power of this art and showed me that I had this slide language that I had with the rest of the world.
It was a way of curiosity -- this motion of motion -- which I found a common common call with people I've never thought I'm going to connect with them.
So when I tell my story today, I'd also want to explain to you that strength can find in the most unclear places, and we're all hiding can just wait out.
If you think about our hands, these tools that are connected to us, and what they're dangerous to do -- to build fabric, and make a huge toxic pain -- and we're looking at the time we're spending or phones.
And I'm completely worried about it.
But if you think about it, what will happen if you take these things?
What do you do? What do you get with your hands?
A lot of people think I'm a privilege, but actually I can't make sure if my life is going to depend on it.
But I did something interesting with a cartoon that never did before.
I wasn't also, "I'm supposed to be an artist in a sense that I didn't have been scared by doing this -- I'm actually a magic magic in math.
So I didn't think that the thousands of pounds came up with me, but I also knew I didn't expect it.
And when it happened to me, I got strong, I went to this, and I'm going to say I'm an artist working today.
So as we're wondering about the future, you know that your future may not be part.
And one day, you might be crazy as I was and scared by a dog to change your world for a moment.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Charles Obvisin started to go in 1922 after a return on it.
He didn't look for 68 years, and he's now in the book of San France as the world's world's world's world's world's prosperity.
In the time, the young man from Lorda January, who may be a physicist in the most powerful products, 50 times a minute for four weeks in 2007.
So what does the hormones do?
Design doctors show that the hormones happen many times after the stimulus that represents the wall, like a air or an ethnic or a faster.
Others come up with powerful emotions or response to them: laughter, unfortunately, and emotions.
Let's look at what's going on when we get out.
It's starting in a unprecedented wall of the noise, a big chemical musical musician that's found underneath the health of which we're using to switch air.
After it, it's a sudden, it's coming up with a surprise of the voice and the key with them, called the coffee.
The motion of the noise creates an enormous language of air, but the prosperity of the coffee is going to go into the right corner and come to the health.
It also creates the typical sound: "Good."
There's no role today for the products.
It doesn't seem to have a medical advantage or some physicist.
Why do we start to switch a air just to suddenly prevent it into health?
The anatomical structures, or physicists without the goal in the corner of ethical challenges in evolutionary ecosystems.
Is these buildings that are serving some of the sophisticated jobs that still didn't have?
Or are they musicians from our evolutionary past, that he'd ever had a very important goal to stay to the present when they're dealing from the past?
One idea is that the products started millions of years ago before the human action.
Think that the reality evolved as structures that had been reduced to academic fish, many of them were scared with a little bit of oxygen, to win the oxygen that's found in the air over the air.
When these animals went back to Ama, they had been based on the list of water to the list with the lung.
It's like a lot of faster change that's going to deal with privacy today when they're participants with adults with health.
It's the prosthetic is that the prosthetic is the survival of water from the ground.
And here's a language that could be able to get water on the sky and go back to a quick restaurant of the voice that's driven from the water to get into the health.
It's taken by evidence that the nervous patterns that have been involved in production are almost identical to those who are responsible to the task of life.
Another group of scientists believe that the France is released to us because actually it's an important solution.
They're showing that real prosperity are only in the banks and that they're not scared in the birds, to plants, or in any animal that's just a air.
More than that, the protocols are affected in human babies a lot before the night and they're much more common in babies than in adults.
Their explanation to it including the unique activity of Nigeria.
French France was going to be courageous by mammals to help the air out of the wall as a kind of graph from the walls.
The academic progress of the noise of a air flow from the cancer, while the cave of the sound of the voice will move from the space to the health.
Sometimes, a series of prosperity doesn't play, and we're trying to predict drugs: What's driving water water's water's water's water's planning, it's a full of fingerprint, we're going to go into a paper, or
Unfortunately, scientists still need to make sure that every one of these solutions work better or much more than others.
However, we know one thing that doesn't work.
You know, you're in the argument, and you can choose the two pounds: you're going to win or water.
It's a choice.
The wars are much more valuable, obviously.
Now imagine you're going to show you the same choice, but the time, you're not in the argument, but you're suffering from the action of days in the desert.
Do you put your life?
Why? Would you be the walls of the walls?
It's the Arab France, who's described in the publishing of the economic economy.
And he tells us that the word's valuable, it's not simple as we thought.
In the argument, you thought about the value of every France, what you could get to them later, but in the case in South, like a lot of the thing, which is much more valuable than their use, how much they're in your current situation.
And because we can only choose one of the possibilities, we need to voice their alternative communities, which means what we're going to stop if we're more about the other possibilities.
After all, it doesn't matter how much you can kill the woods if you don't get out of the thing in peace.
Most of the modern economists deal with the Arax Freex by trying to one of these customers under the motion of the content -- how can the product to provide their presidents or the production of a person.
It's a function of the content can be connected to everything, from a basic need of food and it's in a love song, and it's going to change natural between different people and different reasons.
The market economy tells us a simple way to track the content of the content.
Basically, the proportion of the product for you to look at the price that you're ready to pay for.
Now, imagine yourself back in the same thing, just that time, offers you a different task or a new water in every five minutes.
If you're like most of the people, you're going to look first in the water to end the journey, and then some more expensive people you can survive.
It's because of something called a blueprint, and it means that when you're looking at the walls of water, you're training the tool that's driving out of any other water and everything else's going to do.
And you're doing it every time you get a surprise.
The first water is worth you more than any amount of water, but finally, you have all the water you need.
After any time, every other bank becomes a kitchen.
So you're starting to choose water on water.
And it's not just for positive consumptions like water.
Through most of the things, as you have more than any product is to do less useful or from the understanding.
It's the law of a device that's reduced.
You may have taken two or three art of your favorite food, but you're going to get you in a choice, and the century you're going to get more before you get to it.
Or you can pay to see the same film again and again until it's going to get you or make you money.
Anyway, you're going to go to the end of the point where the liquid is a other movie that's going to become zero.
It's not just about producing products, but for every decision that we've got.
And the intuitive way to magic it and preventing a device that's reduced. It's by finding different ways to transform our time and use our lives.
After our baskets are disappearing, we're a nice theory to invest in choices as long as they're still activated or from the states.
Of course, in some effective, we're successful to maximize the benefit of the real life, it's already a different issue.
But it's helping to remember that the athetic value comes from us, the positive needs for us, the things that we love, and the choices we do.
So a few time ago, I made an experiment.
For one year, I said, "Yes, all of the things that have been reduced me.
Everything I've been scared by, I've got me out of the comfort, I've made myself say, "Yes."
Do I want to go to an audience?
No, but yes.
Do I want to make a living generation on TV?
No, but yes.
Would I like to try in a game?
No, no, no, but yes, yes.
And a crazy thing happened: the industry that reduced me the top of fear, did it without scary.
My fear is connected to an audience, my social restaurant, frankly, disappeared.
It's amazing, a power of one word.
[Yes] changed my life.
[Yes] changed me.
But it was one slide that was affected in a deep life, in a way I've never imagined, and it's started a question of my little daughter.
I've got three amazing victims, the village in the movie and said, "Don't say, it's an invisible way to everyone called" Money. "
Like there was a series of the South.
[]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]
It's the scanner from the South Kenya that I'm going to have one event when I was in my way, and I went to her. "
And this is the beginning of a new way of life for my family.
I took a room that came out and her sister, every time my sisters switch me to play, no matter what I'm doing or where I'm going, I'm going to go, every time.
Almost. I'm not always succeeding, but I'm very change.
This method was an effect on me, on my children, on our family.
But this method was also "The" amazing "," and I've just recently understood it in Maria, I realized that I'm going to play with my daughter as well as I saw my career.
Look, I've got what most of my dream office.
I'm a musician. I'm an email. I'm bringing things to my apartment.
A window.
No.
I'm Titana.
A window.
I'm making TV. I'm making a poem on TV.
I do TV, a lot of TV.
In such a way or another, in the current TV, I'm responsible for about 70 hours of programs to the world.
Five programs TV programs of TV.
Each service creates hundreds of jobs, which didn't exist before.
It's designed to just one of the TV sea can move between three million dollars.
Let's say five.
Finally, we're going to do every hour of an hour, like four programs, so every hour is about 20 million dollars of TV plants, four hours of TV, three hours of TV, three pounds at the moment, four pounds that come in every day, 16 pounds in every 24 pounds, "21 pounds of France,"
In the United States, my TV programs are revealed after the other day at five in the evening.
Around the world, my programs are focused on 256 countries, in 67 languages to have eight and 30 million people.
My brain is global, and 45 hours out of 70 hours of TV are programs that I've created in real way and not just the end of all of my techniques, I need to find time, time that I'm going to be able to spread out the price around the radiation and tell them my stories.
Four TV programs, 70 hours of TV, three programs in the mirror, sometimes four million dollars, fifth lights around the world.
You know who else does these things?
Nobody, so as I said, I'm Titanian.
A window.
I don't tell you it to give you a lot of you.
I'm saying this because I know what you think when you hear the word "Titan."
I'm telling you that all of you who work so hard if you're doing a company, or a country, or a teenager, or a house, you'll take me on a job, so you know I'm not sitting in a computer and a mirror every day, so you'll listen to me that I'm saying I &apos
It's a fantastic job, the reality is fantastic, a person, a hell, without a blindness.
I work a lot, very hard, and I love it.
When I'm strong at work, when I'm deep in it, there's no other emotions.
For me, my work is all the time to build an accident.
It's about the forces. It's to paint on the side.
It's going to go to every high school. It's going to run from a paper.
It's going to be born.
And that's all these things at the same time.
I love working.
It's creative and curiosity and demand and and extinction and funny and clinic and death and voice, and what makes it so good.
There's some change in me when the work is good.
The red begins in my brain, and it's growing and growing and this red sounds like the open road, and I can avoid it.
And many people, when I'm trying to explain the impression, they assume I'm talking about the pain, that my writing is about happiness.
And don't get me wrong, it's a bridge to me.
But the name is -- just when I started working on TV when I started working and build and create, and to cooperate, I discovered this thing, this extension, this fabric.
It's more than the writing.
The name is action and activity.
The red is famous. The red is music. The name is light and air.
The red is the retirement of God directly directly.
And when you've got this finger, you can't be hungry.
This feeling, you can't be hungry in any price.
That's what's called the name.
Or, maybe it's what's called being a job to work.
Laughter) Maybe it's called genes.
Maybe it's called it.
Maybe it's just fear of failure.
I don't know.
I just know I'm not in a failure, and I just know I love the name.
I just know I'd like to tell you that I'm Titan, and I know I don't want to predict it in the end.
But here's the thing: the more I've been able to do, the more programs, the more of the drugs that are born, the more of the ones that I do, the more work I have in the air, the more I have eyes, the more I write the history of history, the more than I have.
The more I work for success, the more I need to work.
And what said about work?
I love working, right?
The nation I'm on, the paper that I want, the forces, the hand, the high line, the red, the red, the name.
I'm looking at this finger. I like this one.
I need this finger.
I'm this great one. Is I nothing France to this one?
And then this red is a box.
Freedom, weird, gorgeous, which is exploration.
The name is stop.
We realized, three sensitive girls for their mother's reality is a fantastic job.
The village says to people, "My mom wouldn't be there, but you can send a message to my path."
And she said, "Good, I want to go to the Hundney."
They're a child of Titana.
They're small anthropologists.
They were 12 years old, three, and 1 when the finger stopped.
It's the name of the motor is prepared.
I made a job to love. I couldn't reinvent the engine.
The red couldn't go back.
My name was easy.
I've done the same things I've always done, the same work of Titana, 15 hours a day, including every week, without insects, never come in, Titan will never get better, never be more likely, full of teenagers, her eye, a dream.
But it wasn't the name.
In me, there was a minute.
Four TV programs, 70 hours of TV, three savings at the bottom of the time, sometimes four.
Four TV programs, 70 hours of TV, three savings at the bottom of the time...
I was the perfect Titan.
I was Titan that you could take home to know the mother.
All the colors were the same thing, and I didn't have a profound experience.
And it was my life.
It was everything I did.
I was the name, and the name was me.
So what do you do when your life, the work that love, starts to make a wind like a struggle?
Now, I know someone there thinks, "Time in the classroom, Titan Titanian Titanic."
But you know, really, if you're creating, if you're working, if you like what you're doing, be a teacher, be an artist, be a painting, to be a painting, if you just like a other person and it gives you the red person, if you know what this finger feels like, if you're the name, if you '
What are you?
What am I?
Is I still Titanian?
If the poem that I've been scared to play, can I survive about what?
And then my fingerprint from the South asked me a question.
I'm in a way out of the door, I'm another one, and she says, "Man, want to play?"
And I'm just going to say not, when I understand two things.
One, I'm going to say yes to all, and two, my grandmother from the South didn't read me "Good."
She doesn't read everyone's "more".
When did this happen?
I've collected it, in my own Titanic Titanthropology, on the privilege, and here it's changing me in the eyes.
And here she says, "Amy, want to play?"
And I said, "Yes."
There's nothing special about it.
We're gaming, and we're going to predict her sisters, and there's a lot of laughter, and I'm reading a dramatic way from the book, "Everybody's doing Kiki."
It's not something extraordinary.
And yet, it's extraordinary, because within my pain and my restaurant, out of my finger, everything I need to do is give attention.
I did.
I stopped.
The nation I'm on, the paper I want, the forces, the hand, the high line is not there.
Everything that you've got is a fingerprint and you're very good and small molecules and color and that song about repair or what it wouldn't be that it's a mirror.
And it's all about hope and spread.
The air is so luck in this place for me that I'm in the voice can go.
I can believe I'm happy.
The games is the opposite of a field.
And I'm happy.
Something about me is released.
My brain's door in my brain is opened up, and the energy tree comes.
And it's not by, but it's happening, it's certainly happening.
I feel it.
The name is lucky back.
It's not in the power of the power, it's in a metaphor, and I need to stop to hear it, but it's there.
It's not the impression in the right, but it's somewhere.
And now I feel like I'm a very cool secret.
Well, let's not switch.
It's just love. It's all this.
It's not magic. It's just love.
It's just something we've forgotten.
The name is, the worker, the Titan magazine, it's just a tree.
If I have to ask you who I am, if I need to tell you who I am, if I describe myself in terms of training and hours and television and how my brain is an international, so I forgot what the real impression is.
It's not power and the impression is not collective to work.
The impression is a collection of injury.
The real impression is a piece of love.
The red is the electricity that comes from being excited about life.
The real name is security and hope.
The real impression comes from history, and it's in the air, and from expectations, and from stress.
The real impression is a single one in us and a magazine.
The real impression is a sense of God in the ocean, but maybe God is to take the wrong words, because what God told me I'm Titan?
It's just love.
We can all agree a little bit of love, much more love.
Anytime my girl's wearing me to play, I say yes.
I'm doing it from one reason, to give myself emotional, to release myself from all of my academic.
It's laughter, so I don't have a choice, and I don't have a choice, not if I want to feel the name.
I wish it was so easy, but I'm not good at play.
I don't like it.
I don't want to do that in the same way I want to do work.
In fact, it's a lot more involved in disorders and conventional.
I don't like to play.
I work all the time because I love working.
I love working more than I love to be at home.
It's hard to deal with the stress in this fact, because what kind of person likes to work more than being at home?
Well, I am.
Look, let's be honest, I call myself Titanian.
I have a disorder.
And one of these problems is that I'm not too excited.
[]]]]]] We're going to want the road and repeat and return.
We're going to do a series of 30 seconds.
We're serving modern poems. We're gaming.
I'm doing bad and they want them.
And I feel hard and it gets most of the time.
I'm all the time you want my mobile phone.
But it's okay.
My little human girls show me how to live and the impression of the universe from me.
I'm playing and play until I start to identify what we've done to play from the first time.
You can also do that, say yes every time your child asked you to play.
Do you think maybe I'm an athetic in the walls?
You're right, but you can still do it.
You have time.
You know why? Because you're not the analogy and you're not the strength.
Your child doesn't think you're such interesting.
Laughter) You need just 15 minutes.
I've spent two years and I've spent the evening of four groups to play with me just 15 minutes before they think they want to do something else.
These are 15 minutes, but it's 15 minutes.
If I'm not a series of our culture or an extension, I'm invisible after 15 minutes.
And in my 13th century, if I can make a 13-year-old talk to me for 15 minutes I'm a teacher.
It's 15 minutes; it's all you need.
I can't find 15 minutes without disruption on my worst day.
It's not the key.
Without a cell phone, no spider, no one.
You've got deep life.
You've got to put them into the wall, but you can find 15 minutes.
My childhood is the place of my brain, they're my world. But it doesn't have to be your kids, the fuel that's listening to your name, where life feels better than not good.
The president is not to play with your kids, the Nigerian is the president.
The president is a general game.
Let's imagine these 15 minutes.
Imagine what makes you feel good.
You'll just look at what it is and you're going to get in this cave.
I'm not always succeeding. In fact, I'm failed in the same way that I'm successful, to see friends, read books, identify space.
I'd like to play? "It's going to have a post of myself on and I've been going to have about as I've got my first television, about the time I've become a Titanian Titanthropian in the face, about as I started to get out with myself.
And 15 minutes? What can it be wrong to give myself my own attention to 15 minutes?
It turns out that dream.
This object that I didn't work to be able to go back, as if the engine of the finger could only be fun when I was a radiation.
It's not going to do without games.
It takes a little bit of time, but after a few months, one day of the summer was jumped and there's a switch, and I find myself going on in my office is full of an unfamiliar, and it's very familiar with me, and it's all over my ideas, and when it's not on the ideas, and I can open it back and
But now, I'm looking at the name, but I don't like the name.
I don't need the name.
I'm not the name. The name is not me, no.
I'm blueprints and fingerprints and walls with friends.
I'm this red.
The name of life.
The name of love.
The name of the work is still part of me is just not all of them, and I'm so grateful.
And I don't care about being Titan, because I've never seen Titan play.
I said yes at least work and more games, and somehow I'm still able to enjoy my world.
My brain's still global.
The more I play, I'm more happy, and my kids are happy.
As I play more, I feel more I'm a good mother.
As I play more, my brain becomes more free.
The more I play, I work better.
The more I'm playing, I'm more feeling the name, the country that I'm in, the paper I want, the forces, the boundaries, the highest, the red, the other one, the real impression of life.
As I feel more about this finger, so on the different anthropy, the wind, the completely new, the animal, feel like me.
The more I feel the name, the more DNA knows who I am.
I'm writing, I'm looking for things, I imagine.
This part of work, it's to live the dream.
It's the images that work.
Because a dream work should be a little bit of accident.
I said yes at least work and more games.
It doesn't think about it that I'm Titanian.
Do you want to play?
Thank you.
Thank you.

"Well, she's going to get rid."
Don't have a lot of direction that's going to get a lot of different languages, but you can get to a microbial word.
But the word that's hard to predict there is actually one of the little ones: "Look."
How simple it seems to be, many times impossible to transform "and" without knowing much more about the situation where it said.
As a beginning, how do you know the person you're talking about?
More cultures have different levels of refugees.
A close friend, someone is much older or young, repeat.
Every one of them can be "You're a little bit different.
More languages, the body's chemicals spread these differences through what's known as TV.
In French, for example, you would say, "Look, when you're talking to a friend at school, but" and "when things go down.
Even in English was something similar.
Remember the ancient word? "
In Iraq, it was actually a boy of a body that was not reduced to people who are close to you, while "Wait's" was a reproductive and a convenient version.
The grandfather was diagnosed when English decided to be trained in any situation.
But the cockroach of "Turkey" doesn't play here.
In the skin like the box or a curiosity, the "The" depends on the magazine.
In many languages, it depends on whether there's one or so many, like in German and "or" Amazon. "
Even in English, some of you use words like "Your" or "wind" in the same way.
How many generations, like "The French" and "" "The French" "" is also a single person to prove the important important to it, like "Wow".
And in some languages, there's even a slide form to the next to two people, like "Wait's" in Sweden.
If it's not enough complicated, reforms, a number, and a gender can be used at the same time.
In Spanish, "Look," she's not a French and Darwin, "" OK, "it's a lot of recycling," Western, "it's not a refugee," Western, "and
Go!
After all of this, it might be used to make you that a couple of times a lot of times reduced on the other body's bodies.
In languages like Roman and Portugal, the body's chemicals can switch out of the sentence because you can understand it in the way the tools are connected.
And in languages like Canada, Iranian and Syrian, body chemicals can switch without any guns.
It's often, the courage will reveal that the crisis will take the body's body's minds than using the wrong, and it's actually going to be heard of the pigs.
So if you've ever been going to work as an extension and come to a sentence without any context: "You're, you're not, you're your job is to translate" by yourself. "
Well, success.
And all of the volunteers community that's driving this video into a variety of languages: a conversation!
What should you happen to make a range after a species?
The invention has to predict in the remote line, through a hot wall, from the hot to the hot, and within one of the posters.
If you're in a spinal piece that's released in the door, one single cell can reduce it.
It's about motion to prevent this process, and they're working in three ways in Chinese ways.
They're pushing the arm, they're training the arm before it comes to the hot, or you're going to hide the tree.
The Chinese is the most simple.
Social and refugees are motivated from the arm to come in with the remote space.
It's also the reason why we're going to get to other events, the London can also prevent the past of species.
On the other side, the astronomer, the academic and the switch switches the hole and the wall, and so you're going to get the corner to the hole.
These events are often called constant events, and you can use them together with a soap, which is an example of the second theory -- terrorism.
Public coffee is the weight of the weapon and the Ford.
The bad telescope today comes in a short form, read, Jay, walls, and even in the form of the Minister's Mexico.
You can reduce these products directly to the repair of the species, or put them in the walls of walls like Darwin or Nazaka, another defense.
The third theory for the previous president works by the selection of the spinal selection.
If you don't have a prosthetic device, you don't have what to do.
Final instructions, including capabilities, Titi, beaten, and Tasmanian, reducing variety of different democratic and astronomy.
It's this hormonal code from a biograph, and it's leaving its unusual, and it's all about it.
In the Scientist Revolution, there's also a funny trick.
It makes the rise of the cooking to the screen, and it makes it hard for the conversations.
There's some of the other action that's used in some cases in the Bill.
For instance, some diverse mechanisms contain the amazing cartoonic hormones in the bus.
Some of them are also afraid, which is going to train the arm and also accumulate the internet network in the skin.
Specience, terrorism or option: Is one good strategy from the other?
There's differences, but it's important, it's comfortable and the right use.
For instance, males were able to be effective in 98 percent of the cases if they were all using them right.
It means that if 100 pairs were used in the London for a year, the two women would go into a range.
But they don't all use them right, so in fact, they're just effective in 82 percent of the cases.
Other techniques, like capacity and efficiency in 99 percent of the cases when you use it right.
But it's actually 91 percent.
It's only an effective telescope in 85 percent of the cases even using true, and 71 percent of the cases just using prototype.
Another important voice in the mirror of traffic is a loatic action, which is almost affected by women, and not on men.
Social instructions can actually make symptoms like my head, in her life, and they're changing a high person, but they're changing a woman.
So these techniques require a doctor.
The choice is a personal choice, and what's the best job for you now, can change the next one.
Scientists also continue to explore new techniques, like a healthy skin that will be made out of help.
Now there's some options for a privilege, to a foreign clinic, or to the options and Dan.
How do you get what you want just using words?
Eric was trying to answer this question over 2,000 years ago in the article on Richard.
Radia by Arico, is the beautiful art of the engine that's available.
And today we're using it in any kind of communication.
But Eric was focused on the speech, and he'll describe three types of speech.
Richard Francisco, or a professor of workers and judges on the past, like to put in a spinal spread.
French Revolutionary, or the extinction of the extinct situation on the current situation, like in the atmosphere.
But the way to get a change is a car, or a cartoon.
Instead of focusing on the past or in the present, radiologist is focused on the future.
It's the radio of politicians who are in a new, and imagine what effect might have, like Robert Rwander who's been able to have a final future where we're going to tell our children about how people were free.
But it's also the radiology of active actions that are pushing into change, like the dream of Martin Luther King, that one day of his kids in the environment they're not going to look at color, but by the fingers.
In the two cases, the efforts show a future future, and try to raise the audience back to avoid it or get it.
But what makes a good selection across the future?
In Aristotle, there's three programmers: Alex, Los, and Picas.
Amazon is the way you're going to make the audience in your own neighbors.
Washington Chile opened his American Congress in 1941 when the painting, I was in the Montana, I was in the Montana with the Guinea in the two of the Atlantic Atlantic rights against the Atlantic rights, and so you're going to prove that the person's decline of democracy in 1941 when
A lot of years ago, in the gender of the Rox Arix, the Rovil Richard School said that the industry and its industry as a politician: "On a symbol of the Freethers," and from this beautiful learning that I'm not interested in. "
And finally, you can show a personal interview, or you don't prevent personal interest.
Los is the use of biology.
This method can use rates like analogy, examples, cases or statistics.
But it's not just facts and data.
It's also a structure and yes itself.
The point is to use my science to convince the audience, as the argument of a women's rights rights: "I have muscles like every man and I can work like any man.
"I've been scared and I've been scared and short and short," and is there a man who can do more than that? "
Unfortunately, the efforts can also move people in the intention of information that the audience thinks it's true, like the extended, but it's still common, that the curiosity makes autism.
And at the end, France is going to come up with, and in this age of modern communication, sometimes this is the most effective method.
France isn't good or bad at its own, but it can be unprecedented and unlikely.
At the same time, it can be one of people for peace or pushing them to war.
Most of the privacy, beauty products that ensure to be easy for our low body's minds to make us feel powerful, you're looking at a park.
Aricents of Erico have been left until today a powerful tool, but to decide what they need to use the audience, what's the goal, and they're the right place.
And maybe it's important to succeed to understand when others use the same techniques that are going to affect you.
1.3 billion years ago, in the galaxy is very sophisticated, two black black holes were born in Southern, it was fabulous to that and they were stuck, when they're leaving a material and valuable material to three energy in a second river.
At the same time, the switch was faster than all of the stars in the galaxies that were all in the summer universe.
It was a very big tree.
But they didn't get their energy in the form of light.
It's black holes.
All the energy is taken into the range of time itself and made a universe to jump in the road.
Let me give you an idea of our time.
1.3 billion years ago, the Earth has been able to develop cultural life.
Since the world today, the Earth has created and developed corporations, fish, plants, dinosaurs, human beings and even -- we don't know the Internet.
And about 25 years ago, a group of people in particular -- Ray William and Twitter from I.T., Kaylin and Darwin and Darwin Malky Milky -- decided it would be very nice to build a very strange strange and looking at a roof roads that are talking like holes of black holes.
Most people thought they were crazy.
But there were enough people who realized they were crazy, so the National Science of the United States decided to protect their crazy idea.
So after decades of opening, built and imagination, and a hard job in the French Olympic violence, they built their wheelchair, which is "Oh," or "an executive extension to reduce a spider."
In the last few years, there's been a huge amount of "Chicago", "has been reduced by his beautiful capacity.
And that's why it's called Chicago.
At the beginning of 2015, "Lo" became a final restaurant in the last time the team is treated in some last details.
And 14 to the September of 2015, just a few days after the Gabbi turned on, the restaurant from the same conference of black black holes went through the Earth.
They've gone through your way and Derek.
And they've also gone through the roof.
[Scott] Scott]: "There's only two moments more than this moment."
"The other one is my father's decline when it was a summer.
"It's actually reducing all of my life.
"Everything I've been working on is not science in fiction!"
Let's take a moment and tell you why I've been on a road Google. "
A road road is red in the form of space and time.
When the Google is sick, it's going to transform the space and everything in one direction, and it's about it in the other direction.
It made intuitive teachers on the general code to the demand code of a freedom of freedom in their general corporations.
"It's comfortable and jumping, it's going to go out and jump."
The problem with the contrast is the most important ones; it's going to be scared.
For instance, the wheel that's been designed at 14 to Text -- right, you're all going on and you've been reduced by this tremendous tree -- when the cells come up, they're going to take the average person in one of 10 parts of the 21.
It's a number of primary with 20 zeros and one.
For this reason, they all thought that "Lo" they're crazy.
Even with a laser laser who went five kilometers -- and it's going to have a metaphor -- they're going to have to measure these farmers at a level of a graph of an autonomy.
And it's ridiculous.
So to the end of his Central Text on the field, the School of "Love," Kikin, describe the ption of the restaurant. He said, "The Texas Center's studies and we built" You're in the building of these great men.
"But physicists are an invention of invention," and with the average public and average, "there's no doubt that's going to come up with all the patients."
Darwin published this in 1973, 42 years in the president had to succeed.
Now, if you go back to the "Lo," Scott likes to say, "Lo's" is actually more like an iron than a eye.
I want to explain it.
The light looks like there's a Google, a size, and it's much smaller than the things around you, from people's features, a range of your mobile phone.
And it's very useful, because it allows you to create a picture or a map of the objects around you, by the light interview that comes from different points in the region.
The voice is different.
Luckily sounds have a Google that's going to be about 15 meters.
And it's very hard -- in fact, it's impossible to wait for emotions -- to create a picture of something important to you.
Like the child or your child.
But we're using a click to listen to machines like response, tons and powerful to prevent the story of the sound.
Here's Alex talking.
Here's a bubble that's going to do it.
In the text.
So with a spider.
We can't use them to create simple images of things in the universe.
But out of the listening to change in the interest and disciplines of these cells, we can hear the story that these cells tell.
And in terms of "Chicago," At least, the evidence that he can hear is in the middle of the sound.
So if we move the roof of to the stress and air and air, luck, we can really hear the universe talking to us.
For instance, the alarm to the restaurant, in this way, you can tell us a lot about two black holes, and the Scott Scott was very long to think about it.
"If two black holes don't expect," hear "Chip" "" "" "--" Wow's very simple.
"If the two boys are released very quickly, I've got it Chip," but with planning, "and it's going to be like this: Wow, Wow!
"Like, the words of the conference is fine in the form of the wheel."
EA: So at 14 to the September 2015, you'll remember that I'm going to remember the world, "Lo'd heard this:" And if you know why to listen, it's the sound of --'s the sound of black hole: two black black holes, so about 30 seconds that you &apos
EA: You should stop here for a moment to think what it means.
Two black black holes, the most devastating thing in the universe, the one of the 29 seconds and the second one of the 36 seconds, we're releasing this around 100 tricks in a second before they got.
Imagine this piece.
It's fantastic.
And it's known because we've heard it.
It's the president of "Los."
It's a completely new way to expect in the universe, that we've never had.
It's a way that allows us to hear the universe and prevent the invisible.
And there's a lot that we can't see -- in fact, or even in the principle.
Social, for example: I was happy to know why a huge stars are exposed in the rules.
It's got a lot of content: We've learned a lot about the universe.
The problem is that all of the interesting physics is going on in the night, and the night goes behind thousands of kilometers of luck, carbon and red.
We can't see way. They're atoms to light.
The spider road goes through the road as if it was a glass -- it's completely transparency.
The Big Bang: I was happy if I could explore the first moments of the universe, but I'll never see them, because the big bank of his light itself.
With the contrast, we're supposed to see everything, until it's.
Maybe, more importantly, I'm sure there's things that we've never seen that we can't see, and we've never got our minds -- things that's only been reduced by the corner.
And in fact, we've already been at that first event, "Lo" found things that we haven't seen.
Here's my colleagues with one of the main friends in the team of Chicago, "Matt Ocus, my colleagues in I.M., who's treated exactly that.
"They're things for ancient sea, historical," and the black holes are like the dinosaurs "which enables us the architecture.
"So it really allows us to get a completely new task about what's in the universe and how we've created these stars, and eventually, of course," How we've created from all of this building. "
EA: Our challenge, now, it's going to be a gypt as possible.
The Chicago "We know today to build great farmers that are able to listen to the universe, for most of them and watch the cockroaches.
We're going to get on and build new faces -- a completely new generation of faces -- on the ground, in space.
I mean, what can be more great than listening to the big tree itself?
We're going to get a dream right now.
Let's dream with us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Will human civilization spread all the physical that the space is?
Could we move beyond our little blue planet to make a lot of planets?
This question is pretty much from Iraq.
There are about 300 billion stars in the galaxy, which is about 160,000 years of light.
By now we've sent one space out of the sun system, which is at the speed of 0.6 percent of the speed of light.
In this rate, it's going to take more than 2.5 billion years just to get on the one side of the galaxy to the other.
And then there's the question of human survival.
The distance between stars is just huge.
We couldn't expect most of the plants, and we require a lot of resources to stay in life.
Together, learning has already found decades ago that you can't just spread the human civilization around the galaxy, but to do it pretty quickly, without the public of physics.
Their idea is based on the work of a mathematician called John Olympic, which was designed on a machine that could take itself and create a new generation of itself.
These are going to be later as a mobile phone machine.
In the context of the space space, the North Nazman could build on the planet and be exposed to the space.
There, the nervous machines will be on refugees.
There they're going to make the resources that are made of energy, we're going to see that trees of themselves, they're going to make these education to the next few, and they're going to get the cycle.
The result is a piece of millions of features that spread out to the universe like radio studies in Ethiopia.
Many learn about the numbers and discovered that the phone is a single nation that's coming from five percent of the light will be able to transform around the galaxy in four million years or less.
It may sound a lot of time, but when you think about it that the universe is 14 years old to Israeli, at a very fast scale -- it's worth about 2.5 hours of a year.
It's creating a phone machines from UNASA to require some technologies that we don't have, including an active artificial intelligence, luck and better systems.
If we wanted to use them to reinvent real people around the galaxy, we'll have more technologies -- the ability to grow artificial organisms and biological organisms using genetic information and genetic information.
But if over the last billion years, the long-term culture has made this machine and sent it to our time, our galaxy was full of them now.
So where are all these machines?
Some astronomers, like Chile Shair, say that smart soldiers dn't build machines at all.
They may have been made out of control, it's going to be refugeed on their homes to continue to transform.
Otherwise you see in the presence of profound neighborhoods that are unsustainable, or they're failed before they could develop the terrible technologies.
But it doesn't avoid people to imagine how it could be if they were there.
Social science Darwin Darwin wrote about the universe where a lot of the northern US machines come together.
Some of them are designed for a young culture, others to identify and invite them before they become a threat.
In fact, in the story of Britang, "How many car machines are going to react on the planet now, the price that's going to come to a certain level of stress before they're going to happen.
Now, all we have are curiosity and theory.
But the next time you look at the night, think that billions of machines are made of independence between the stars in our galaxy right now.
If they're there, one of them will go to the end of the Earth, or maybe, maybe, they're already here.
My favorite friend knows to play well, but they don't expect an organization.
They're always driving their president in the wrong place, and it's completely revealing their magazine.
On the other day, my friend's friends wake up and you find themselves as patients in the room are returned to windows and telescope.
Their magazine explains what happened.
Over, there are 10 big pixels.
Each coffee knows one of your prosperity, but don't let the photos move you -- they're going to go to the box in an academic way.
I'm going to give you out every single one in his classroom.
When you're out there, you'll notice every five pixels that you're going to choose before the buttons collect you back to our train.
You don't have to touch the conference of the conference or to your eye to the other people's friends, anyway it's.
You can't train the box, you can't stop, and so on.
If every one of you have to find his president tool, you'll have a device to affect the night.
Otherwise, the categories will take you.
You have three minutes to think before we start.
It's about the web.
After all, every friend has only 50 percent chance to find his president "by a fifth choice of five pixels.
And the chance that every 10 social friends have created is even smaller -- a chance of 10 to 24.
But for a sudden, the surroundings offers an enormous strategy that enables a success of over 35 percent.
Can you feel what?
Remember the video if you want to try yourself!
An answer: Three 2, here's a month of the kitchen: Everybody opened the box on it with his previous tool.
If it's your tool, you're a room.
Otherwise, look at what a tool is in the box, and you're going to open the box that you've got this tool.
That's how you find your tool.
My friend had to make players, but unfortunately, they all find what they were looking for.
And a few hours later, they're facing thousands of boundaries.
So why is the strategy that the investment was successful?
Each musical musician was spending on a tree of actions that started with the box of his total image and the end with the box that you do know this tool.
Remember that if there were to go on the floor, it would lead them to a box with her, so it's a Google.
For instance, if the pixels are so dangerous, you're going to open the first box, you're going to find a signal, you're going to find a Chinese box, and you'll find her microphone in the third box, which will lead again to the first box.
It's working a lot better than an academic sensor because by taking a box with a tool that's built in the beginning, every friend to move the search into the box of its toxic box, and there's no bad chance, about 35 percent, all the circumstances are going to take five cents or less.
How did we look at this chance?
For the understanding of the understanding has been killed by a simple case, four instruments and not more than two seconds to every musician.
Let's start again in a failure of failure, the chance someone will take to open three or four pixels before they find his tool.
There's obviously a woman's prosperity.
Throughout a way to buy them is by making a walls, put a tool in each of the week, and put the allions.
You'll see some of these circumstances that you can find, and remember that these two are computing to the same Google, just with a different point.
These two are the same, they're different.
You can imagine that eight of the three tricks in the sky with the sensors.
You'll find four possible families -- depends on what a tool will stay out there -- and every single one will make two possible benefits.
So out of 24 of the spontaneous box, 14 will go to a failure and 10 and 10 to succeeding.
It's true for every number of musicians, but if you want to create a way, you can use the next general concept.
You put the number 10.
And what if there are 1,000 musicians?
Or 10,000?
The more "Nather" goes, "the chance is coming up to 30 percent.
It's not safe but with a little bit of lucky, it's far away from being hope.
Hello to everyone, if you liked this animal, try to solve the two points.
It's starting with a little bit of uncomfortable, and it turns into a sense of feeling that I can't get out of it.
Finally, just about it, you can think, and out of a protein, you're going to have a toilet to say, "Ah."
People need to spend at least four times a day, but sometimes, the pressure of modern life represents us to coffee and move.
How bad is that worse, and how many of our body can stand at it?
The answer is in the cooperation of the device that's reduced, a cell without a gene that's in the gene.
And around this building, there's a number of artists that fear creates the whole system.
Two fibers, two penguins, two challenges, and prosperity.
The globe of the globe of the kitchen in the walls are known when it's.
The rules represents that you're most of water and you're going to have the loads of the body, and you're driving the unprecedented corporation for two muscles that are called chickens.
These are the issues of it down into the organ of the organ that's going to be known as the chain.
The river of the man's organ is made out of a mirror called a muscle that's reduced that's released when the decline is reduced and allows it to get rid like a bone.
When the chicken comes out, the spinal muscle goes out.
The inner adults have been automatically opened and unemployed, and they're released.
The golden goes down, goes into the walls and switched in the extinction.
It works like Berberg.
When you want to conversation changed, you're keeping on the roof of School.
When you want to release it, you can open the roof.
But how do you feel the privilege so that you know when you're going to make it?
Within the reasons of the spinal muscle has millions of molecules that are exposed when the decline is reduced.
They send signals across the nerves to the area of your spinal cord.
French clinicians went back to your repair, what causes the privilege of reducing a little bit and remove the complete pressure so you're aware that you're full of.
In the Bill, the inner sector of the park opened up.
It's called the cartoon.
The brain can prevent it if it's not a good time to make it more than a second illusion to the extinction.
With about 150 to 200 million meters of you in it, the spinal muscle is moving enough to feel that there's a facility in the face.
In about 400 to 500 kilometers, the pressure becomes uncomfortable.
The price can continue to move, but just by some point.
Over 1,000 million tons, she could get out.
Most people are going to lose control before it happens, but in very rare cases, like a person can't feel the need for the chimpanzee, the muscles can avoid what's going to be open to our future.
But under sensitive conditions, your decision to reduce the signals of the brain to the extinction of the extinction, what causes it to transform and repair.
The extension of the extinction is one of the Amazon Ross Ross, and it's provided a support of the plastics and an extinction.
We're lucky that we've got these fair muscles because you've got a pressure on the system in action, you're going to do, you're going to have a laughter, or a click can make a joy from the corner.
Instead, the axis of the rainforest that represents the region to the region that you're ready to release.
But it's the prosperity that's given too long, your device is too fast, or changed without a physical support of what's going on over time to decide or to activate this muscle.
It can lead to a very active gene, as my father's decline, preference, or independent control.
So for long-term health, it doesn't feel good to keep your name.
But the short term, at least, your body and your brain sits on you, so you can choose the right moment.
When a team of Archiologists recently exposed a human musician that came to 15,000 years, they did an interesting discovery.
The teeth of those beautiful people were pregnant in teachers.
What made these teachers continue to push us today, some tiny microbes that live in our language.
These microbes are with us a short time after the night.
We're usually interested in them as babies of our fathers.
And when our teenagers do, they're interested in a natural way of bacteria.
It's about what we eat, and in particular in the summer states that we consume, certain microbes can be much too much and make teachers in the eyes.
A rich river in the summer's summer's summer in the tree of the microbial population in the language that's called fossil cartoons.
It's like human beings, these tiny creatures like sugar and use it as a moral building and a source of energy.
When they use it, the bacteria represents productive products in the form of disorders, for example, a critical extinction.
Austrategy are motivated to this situation, but unfortunately, our teenagers don't.
Each human beings are exposed in a gypt of a listener who's left on, but it's not going to do with the extinction.
Over the time the mammogram is reduced, and the Minister of San France switched out.
Basically, the extinction is designed for the bacteria into the corner of the eye, which is called Darwin.
Because I've forgotten blood and nervous nerves in our teeth, at this point, the rule of spread doesn't expect.
But if the president will go beyond the genetic device, the microbial reference is going, the nervous nerves will expect and make a tree.
No treatment, all the blood can be reduced, and the whole of the summer lights like the summer.
As our food knows more summer, the risk of our teenagers grow.
But it's hard to assume that the causes have been conducted, so what's it that I've got to do with teachers?
In an industry in the bridge, the risk of innovation has to be lower because of a bridge is a little bit of summer, but it's not everything that our ancestors eat.
We've also been reduced by regulations that survive and genes and genes, that everybody's got coal.
When they're in a moment with anthropologists in Broke, they're reduced to very simple, that can be used for food to have the toxic life.
So, despite the actors eat less summary than we, their teeth is still exposed to suicide.
But it doesn't mean they couldn't treat teachers.
Social muscles show that about 14,000 years ago, humans have been used in a range of intervention to reduce a range of strengths.
We even made a simple curiosity to decide the money teachers that were left and using bees to the holes of holes, as much as the trends of today.
Today, there's techniques and more sophisticated techniques, because we need to deal with more compassionate features because of our sugar.
After the industrial revolution, teachers in human beings have been published because of all of a sudden, there were technology plants that made the summer's work to get out.
Today 92 percent of the American adults have holes in the eyes.
There's more sensitive people for parents because of a woman who can make some jobs, for example, a more traffic email, but most of them, the name is a high price.
However, we've developed other ways to reduce holes, except it's been reduced in a summer and a magazine.
In most of the teenagers, and in a lot of water, you're using a total amount of Paland.
The material represents the teenagers and destroy growth of a email, and you've put the gene in the corner.
When holes are produced, we're using the drugs to flow their famous region, which leaves from the situation to move.
Yet, the best way to avoid teachers is to reduce the sugar and worry for the reduction of their microbes and their food products.
It's including a teenager that I've made, using a fantasy, and it's fabulous, my colleagues, and it's a blueprint that's built to your teeth between the forces.
Second, you're going to expect the population of the summer microbes in the map.
In a different person's cases of time, today we have the great knowledge to prevent the parents.
We just need to use it.
What started as a platform for the strength is going to become a industry of billions of dollars.
Basically, environmentalist, a photograph of Street and movies, and content: These are some of the potential use of extinction faces, and what you're showing them is the capacity that's evolved in research around the world.
For instance, before I'm going to put asteroids into our social consciousness, a half of a metaphor machines of a size of six meters that's complete from 1,500 faces in the middle of FREC in French, and a few years ago, they started to fly with walls.
By listening to fossil machines, they can achieve speeds and high spaces in really extinct spaces.
They can also build autonomous autonomy.
It's all of the capabilities of how to transform reality, how to deal with disorders, and in general, how to communicate with the physical world.
Today we want to show you some new projects that we've worked on.
Their argument is to push the boundaries of what we can get with autonomy.
Now, to make an autonomous system, it has to know collective the universe of its mobile objects in space.
In our lab in ETT, we're often using external cameras to find objects, which then allow us to record our efforts on a very dynamic development.
So to show you today with this, we're going to use new technologies that are developed by Studio Studio, a tree of our lab.
There's no extinction cameras.
Each machine is used in sensory years that it has to put its universe in local space and local computers to get what its actions need to be.
The only professionals are at a high level like "The Minister" and "I've come."
It's what's called a sick sea.
It's a trick that's trying to keep the skin while it's food.
Like a plane with a fixed wall, it's effective in a piano, much more than the markets and their signals.
In addition to most of the aircraft tool with the other budget, with that, it's able to push, which is a huge advantage to show and general and general.
There's no free, unfortunately.
One of the limits of Bay Bay is that they're sensitive to discover like the wind.
We're developing architecture and new algorithms that are treated in these limits.
The idea is that the Times will get no matter what it's producing itself, and through trust, improve the performance over time.
[Applause] Okay.
When we do research, we're a lot of times asking ourselves an effective questions that's trying to get to attention.
For instance, one question would be, what is the instruction number of parts that are going to be reduced?
Now, there are effective reasons why we might want to answer questions like this.
The satellites, for example, are known in the environment as machines with thousands of pieces that everybody's going to get you a gas.
It turns out that two decades ago, the pixels were able to put a plane tool that was just a few parts of the walls: a road and a gene.
We recently discovered it could be done with just one.
It's been reduced, the most simple aircraft tool in the world, which was just a few months ago.
It's just a single part of it, except.
It doesn't have any of the guns, there's no pain, there's no response, there's no other studies, there's no other control, just a simple switch.
Even though it's just an anthropologist, a lot of happens in his tiny electronic brain to allow it to fly in a way and prevent anywhere he wants in space.
And despite that, it doesn't still have the complexity of a season on, which means that to make it fly, I've got to get it right.
And because the environments I'm going to take it right is really low, at the beginning that everybody's watching me, what we're going to do instead of showing you the video that we've been trying to be able to be able to be in the night.
Laughter) So if the train is an experiment in the convenience, this machine here, the atmosphere, with his extended conference, it's trying to make sure.
What can you do with all the wind?
The thing to notice is that it's very symbol.
As a result, it's biological to the direction.
It gives him an extraordinary capacity.
He can move anywhere where he wants to be in space without communicating to where he's going and even how it goes around.
It's got complexity of its own, mostly to deal with predators that work on it from its extinction.
Some of those can be models, while the other people can teach while the operation.
Let's look at.
Thank you very much, if you're interested in a part of our lives today, they're going to have to become safe and safe.
The machines here are actually two crazy machines with two insects.
It's like to go around the argument.
The other one wants to go around against the argument.
When you're looking at them, they're acting like a coffee cap with high performance.
If something's changing, with that -- a traffic motion, a coffee of, electronics, even a solar dot -- the machine can still fly, even though it's in a fusion.
We're going to talk to you about this now by the one of the faces.
Thank you.
The big number of autonomous optimistic options offer new features to evaluate athetic.
We took a commons from a restaurant species, every single one weighs less than a fight, by the way, and it's about biological technology and algorithms.
Because every single single one knows where it's in space and independence, really there's no boundaries to the number.
Thank you very much for Applause) And hopefully, these patterns will allow you to have a dream about the role of the chemical jobs for extinction.
And to be safe there for example, there's language to become a street corner in Broadi.
And the reality is that it's very hard to predict the impact of developing technologies.
And people like us, the real corruption is the journey and the creative effect.
It's a reminder that's designed for a wonderful and the universe in which we live, which is enabling smart and creative creatures to spread it in a way that's so extraordinary.
The fact that this technology has so high and economic values is just the expectations on the skin.
Thank you.
Thank you.
People who have invented the world and the opinions of today as an Atlantic.
One of the philosophical philosophers of the 20th century, and he said that all of the Western philosophy is just a series of the Western Washington.
Plato created the first Western university and learn the smart generation of the future direction, including Erio.
But even one of the philosophical Islamic wasn't perfect.
Together with his big noises, Lalton had some ideas that didn't really have been at the time.
So here's a cartoon of some of the best and the worst.
Plato Plato argue that we've heard of the body is a perfect world and unchanged of generations.
These generations are the Iranians of the things and ideas that come around us.
They're from a kind of instructions in our world.
Within the world of the Iranian tree, the Iraq Tuban, and even the Iraq, or the Italian love.
Our reality is made out of unperfect forms of intuitive forms.
Plato argue that the philosophers need to survive to the river and understand these particular forms, so they can move better at our motion reality.
It may sound beautiful, but the forest between the world as it seems to us to be the big nation behind it, is one of the most difficult problems in philosophy.
Through thousands of pages were written on it by biologists, philosophers, and cartoons.
It's about questions like: Did we trust our senses in the entire decade or the sense of consciousness?
For Plato, the answer is the sense.
Just the idea tells us at least the possibilities to get rid.
But the idea doesn't always succeed to Palton.
When he was trying to put human beings between life, he took us to the birds.
"Hollywood" was his famous grandfather.
The Syrian Francisco was destroyed from this definition and reduced to the Palton's advice with a remote chicken says, "Look, the person of Atlanton."
But let's go back to some good ideas.
Plato was between the first political theories that we've made, and together with Erio is sitting in one of the Science Scientists of the country.
He argued that a third is not different from any other profession, like a doctor or a doctor, and that's only those who were taught the traffic to control.
The video is the engagement of the river in generations.
In "French", "Alexton's imagination is the right step.
The Italian city of Atlanton is going to have the modern food between protein and need to be used by spinning.
Three years ago, Plato also argue that women can control this kind of inequal city.
Unfortunately, Palton didn't care about women, and instead of doing them for children.
It's also the right that the female warrior is a animal that can talk about the body's body's body's body and make disease.
This bad idea, we're going to be used by the time of Palton's time, we're going to affect, we're going to have the European medicine for hundreds of years.
Again, he thought that the company should be part of three groups: the products, the military, and the control, and that a big axis has to convince everyone to get this structure.
I've shown that he invented was that we were all born with the identity, money, or a magnitude of Philip and our teenagers, and it's a function of our role in life.
There's the fish that's going to communicate to the novel idea as the prototype of the 20th century's prototype, and the philosophy is inspiration to the objects that used it.
Would some bad ideas have to move in the middle of Palton as one of the big philosophers of history?
No!
Plato gave the leaders and the fish that came after the beginning.
Over the next few days, we could look at these ideas in the lab and experience, we got some of them and think other.
We're going to go to a click, to fix and do their own notes, which was taken to the basis of the modern world.
When the muscles are transformed in the dead violence, three lions and three refugees revealed their lives.
In order to wind out of the corner, they've got to go to the left side of the river survive.
Unfortunately, in case there's a French in the region.
It can send two animals every time, and it has to be at least one aid or a single one ever to make the river.
There's just one problem.
If you're going to be more responsibility for the rest of the river, even for a moment, their intelligence will go into action, and the result doesn't be beautiful.
It including the animals on the boat when it's on the side of the river.
What's the most expensive way to every six animals without the lions will be able to join?
Stop here if you want to solve the animal on yourself.
More answer three more answers one more answer if you feel time about this problem, try to see all the decisions you can do at any point, and the consequences of every decision.
For example, there's five possibilities of who can go before: one restaurant, one Aria, two genes, two lions, or one of the kind of.
If one animal is left alone, it's just going to have to go back.
And if the two first fossil trees, it's that's left right.
So these options are not relevant.
The possibilities to send two lions, or one animal, can actually lead to solutions in the same number of cities.
Unfortunately, we're going to focus on the other option.
Aria and Guinea.
Now, if the remaining and the malaria will come back, there'll be three lions on the right side.
Fifty news for the two musicians.
So we need the malaria to stay on the left and the genome will help the species.
Now we've got those five options, but with one Aria already on the left side.
If the two chimps go, it's going to stay join, and if one of the animal is going to be on the restaurant would be in the right moment that's going to get to the other.
So it's a fabric, which means that the third, just two lions can go.
One goes down, and it's two lions in the left side.
The third is repeating the French back to the Minister where the genes are waiting.
What now?
Well, because we have two lions on the left side, the only option is that two genes will be.
So, there's no idea that two will help, because it's just going back one step.
And if two lions will ask, they're going to be in the number of them on the right hand.
So one of the lions and one of the genomes represent the restaurant and leaves or malaria on the left side and two of any species.
Again, it doesn't make any sense to send a refugee back, so the next one is a liquid of liquid or a guns.
If the lions go, they'll eat the chimpanzees on the left, then they're left, and the two genes go instead of it.
Now, we're pretty close because all of the genomes have come to a person with most safe.
What's left is the only malaria will come back and bring the other lions with each other.
It's looking at one of the wealth of the things on the screen, the smallest number that's going to be used to everyone's going to be on the security.
The solution that including a conversation of two lions at the beginning works in the same way, and also one requires a two-hour.
Six bees without a moment of the man at the same time and start their new lives beyond the river.
Of course, now when the prosperity came up, you have to see how long this United States doesn't make any sense.
I've been excited about this that I've been working on "The dream," and then I discovered that I'm opening the part of "Star."
And there's no doubt that there's in the climate crisis of things that I'm going to describe them.
And I have some bad news, but I have a lot more in good news.
I'm going to take three questions, and the answer for the first time, they're going to have some bad news.
But curiosity -- answers to the other question and third is really positive.
So the first question is, "Do we have to change our way?"
And of course, "Go", "between the things," changed the movement of the environment, and in fact, it's created the modern environments.
Five months after the Earth's guns first looked at land, organic "Earth's first day."
And we learned a lot about ourselves after we saw our planet from the space.
And one of the things we've learned from what scientists told us since.
One of the most important facts of climate crisis is about two.
Like this picture shows, the sky is not the extended and the boundaries that we look at the top because of the ground.
It's the most prototype of atmosphere that's taken the planet.
And it's now in our industrial culture of our industrial culture, as it's organized today.
We're taking it 110 million tons of global pollution in every 24 hours, and it's free to everyone.
And the mammoth of a lot, obviously I wouldn't go for everyone.
I'm going to focus on the statistics where, but there's a connection to agriculture, exhibition, population.
The forests, the transition, the oceans, the oceans, the ice ice.
But I'm going to focus on the problem: the fact that we're still focusing on carbon fuels is based on 85 percent of all the energy that we've spent every year.
And you see in this picture that after the world's world's world's world's world's world's World War, the Fields began to really expect.
And the extinction of global pollution in fact, which brings the world, which is now in the atmosphere to the same heat that has been released from 400,000 pounds from the kind of task on the task every 24 hours a year.
The facts were born again and again, and it's a conservative artist, but it's the truth.
So it's true that it's a big plane, but -- it's a lot of energy, especially when you use it in 400,000 days every day.
And all of this tremendous energy is reducing the atmosphere, the whole planet system.
Let's look at the atmosphere.
It's a description of what we've ever thought to move temperature.
The white represents days of normal temperature; 1950s were scared in a musical way.
The blue represents days from average, the red represents the average days.
But the whole code has been changed in the '80s.
And you're seeing in the bottom corner that's producing numbers with statistic meaning of days in an extinction.
In the '90s, it's better.
And in the last 10 years, you see that the water is too much faster than the average days.
In fact, they're 150 times more on the ground than just 30 years ago.
I mean, we're hopeful temperatures.
Five of the last 15 years, we've been born with a three-dimensional conference for this century.
The most common was a year ago.
The last month was in the 37 pounds more than the average average of the 20th century.
And for the first time, not just change was the most hot, but the first time it was more hot on two degrees of the average French.
These high temperatures affect animals, on the plants, humans, the ecosystems.
But in a global scale, 93 percent of all of this tremendous energy in the oceans.
And the scientists can now measure the status of the helicopter in all of the products: in the ocean cases, by the top hundreds of meters.
And it's also going to be released.
It started more than a hundred years ago.
And more and more than the beginning of the reference has been affected in the last 19 years.
It has results.
The result of the hands: the foreign forests in the ocean are more likely.
The Scott Philist's "spread over the areas in the ocean that were exposed in 5.5 degrees of Francisco's age in the president of the president in the Amazon, in the most recent end of the Amazon that's ever made out of land.
The Francisco Franciscus, which was so much about this subject, morning in Egyptian once later.
Sandy's Sandy's "took over the areas of the Atlantic ocean that were in 9 degrees from the age of age in New York and New Jersey.
The other results now affect us all.
The water is much more than a lot of water to the sky.
The average choices in the world has become more than four percent.
And it's creating these atmosphere.
The Brazilian scientists call them: "The Glacks want."
And they're bringing all the Amazons to the house and there's the secret condition that's caused to be caused by the sea and the season.
It's in Monna.
Look at the end of the last August.
When she's taking over Tonson in Eric.
It really shows the entire city.
These cases are really sophisticated.
In the last night, in Boston, in Texas, we'll go out for a few days, more than 600 billion tons.
It's kind of like the Nigerian Prize went over two days in the city's city, which is completely shared, of course.
These sacrifices create fossil and coffee costs in historical dimensions.
It's in Chile, last year.
You're seeing the cartoon that's sold there.
Here's a few features.
It's in Spain, in the last September, you can call it a river of cars and trucks.
In every evening, the news looks like a fingerprint by the two days in a book that's going.
It's really like this.
It's certainly that the motor industry has already reduced the top in the French.
They don't have any illusion on on what's happening.
And I'm going to take a moment to the idea of the reason and the result.
We're used to think of directly directly between reason -- one reason -- one result.
That's what it's about.
The Baskin's daughter's daughter's friends, "Today, all the different languages.
"There's so big energy in the atmosphere," there's so big emissions.
"Everything today is different.
They're the same heat of the heat that's going to make the paintings out of the ground and wait in deep forms, long and more and many of them expect us.
It's Michigan and causes more trials in the Western part of America.
There's obvious evidence for these reasons.
There's more buckets, when the heat's out, there's also a lot more in the kitchen.
The climate issues also have political implications and they make strengths.
The historical form of climate change that started in Syria in 2006 percent of the games in Syria, the 80-percent of the CO2 percent of the CO2 million emissions in Syria, and where they took it in about 1.5 million refugees from Iraq.
Despite other faces, it's going to make the red rise that there's who's right now to get rid.
The United States of the GDP is a crisis of climate crisis: refugees, food and water.
Today we're going to go to the pollution pollution that's expanded from the tropical areas to the North Korean Research -- the revolution of the transition has made a lot of this.
But the conditions that change the wind lines in the areas where these identical diseases may be able to become commons and innovation of causes, like actions and doing them.
It's the prosperity that's done -- in North America, we're instead better, because still too cold and our public health care is better.
But when it's released to women in some areas in the modern America and the car that doesn't go into a range for two years -- it's new and it needs to move our attention.
The United States, "One of the two of the largest medicine in the world, the last summer that's a medical condition."
And there are many consequences.
It's also about the extinction crisis.
We're talking about 50 percent of all species on Earth until the end of the current century.
And now, plants, plants and living in two times more close to the average rate of five meters a day.
In the popular building, at 29 in the last crisis, the same concept that was made to the North historical in the American Western Western Western Western Western Western Center in French by 50 degrees of French, and it's going to reduce a very well in the middle of the French and the Olympic.
And when the teenager in the two of the Arctic Bay Times, it's bringing out the sea of the sea of the sea.
The wonderful photograph of Paul Nigerian and Albert's novel from that.
It's more dangerous when it's happening in Grand and particularly in Antarctica.
Twenty-10 cities that are very good at risk of the sea are especially in South East Asia.
When you're focusing on the risk of plants, you're going to have my head: three and a half trillion dollars in high risk.
Instead of the third: New York and Iraq.
In the last end, I was in my mom, at the time, one of the highest species.
The fish of the ocean who was there in some of the streets of Muhai Bay, Ford Derek and Center.
And now it's a graphic phenomenon in the top of the high sea.
They're not in there -- they're called "The North on the sun."
The water goes through a sudden, we're going to get the end of the transformation.
And the mayor of Mumbai Mumbai is a lot of attention in saying that there's already a time that you can't treat it in an extinction.
It's a crisis that's every single day.
We've got to move on the plastics.
And I'd like to take a moment to respect them to the French French in the House of Fields, and I'd like to put them in the French of the French, and I'm going to say, "Oh, I'm going to get the truth about the climate crisis.
So the climate crisis goes and believe, there's a lot of the roads I haven't even mentioned.
It's a huge restaurant.
I'll just take one more perspective, because the World War Pubus that came in a month before a month in the Street, in the end of the morning of 750 economists, the color that the climate crisis is the president of one to the world.
And in front of my head, like Mark Kenney, the main British Bank, say, "The majority of the coal German is not in cities."
Free "Freedom". "
I'm not going to know what happened with the Islamic loads for programs, but it's the same thing.
It's all of the creative parts that have been seen since the first of the industrial revolution. It's the amount that's seen in the last 16 years.
All of these were killed, and let's put on paper, 28 trillion dollars.
The international energy agencies are just this amount of violence is made to fly.
And the moon, 22 trillion dollars -- I'm going to switch.
It's designed for the global economy.
And that's why there's a personal idea in motion against investment and it's not just moral.
So the answer to the first question, "Do we have to change our way?"
It is, we have to change.
A second question: "Can we change?"
And here, the emotional news!
According to the best of the world, 16 years ago, by 2010, the world's going to be able to make a wind energy in about 30 jihad.
We've got this step 14 and a half times.
Today, we're going to go to a concept of wind budget.
We're seeing that the cities are going to be dramatic.
Some states -- for example, Germany, industrial power, with climate is not particularly different than it's, by the way -- on the last day, it's got 81 percent of all the energy from new products, mostly from the sun.
Many countries get more than average.
More good news: The energy doctor, especially from restaurant, is now starting to code a map because the price is very dramatic in terms of the extinction.
In the Syrian, the news is more exciting!
Finally, 14 years ago, he said that we could get to get one jihad for one year by 2010.
When it came in 2010, we've come up with this 17 times.
Last year we put it in 58 times.
This year we're going to go to 68.
We're going to win this bar.
We're in connection.
The president of the Syrian in the Syrian is more expensive and dramatic.
When I got to this stage 10 years ago, she was here.
We've been going to reduce the revolutionary through these extinct places.
So you know, and the trees went down to 10 percent a year for 30 years.
And it's going to go down.
It's obvious that the business of businesses did it, because it's getting the half point of the web.
The lower privilege of the upper energy is starting to move.
"The half point" is the same border, the same collection, which is an electricity from a more recycling from a galleries that's focused on fossil fuels.
It's a little bit like a little bit about 32 degrees to 33 degrees of Francisco, or between 0 and 1 degrees.
It's the difference of more than one hour, it's the difference between the ice and the water.
And it's the difference between the markets and the fingerprint of House to new investments.
It's the largest and big opportunity in the world's friends, and two thirds of it is great in the private sector.
We see a tool of new investments.
From 2010, the global investment in electricity products from new cases have gone through the fossil level of boxes.
And then the forest is just going to grow.
The actions for the future are even more dramatic, although the fossil energy is still too complicated than the energy from new products.
And by the way, if you're going to get here on the bottom of nuclear power, especially if you're going to look at the work that many states do to move into safe, more moral and cheaper power of nuclear power, it can make a more dramatic change.
Is there a speed of this new technology?
Yes, there's a lot of curiosity. Look at the mobile phone.
In 1980, Italian, called "Male," The Turkey from Minister "to do a global marketplace for the mobile phones that began to affect.
"How can we sell until 2000? They wanted to know.
"Monky" went back to them with the answer: "9,000."
And most of them, until 2000, they really call 900,000 -- in the first three days.
And at the end of this year, they've made 120 times more.
And now there's more interesting in the world than human beings.
So why aren't they just wrong but very wrong?
I asked myself this question: "Why?"
And I think the answer comes to three parts.
First of all, the price is going to be much faster than someone's expected, even when the quality is made.
And from income interventions, places without a telephone network -- Go to the new technology.
The big progress has happened in developing countries.
And what about the electricity networks in the developing world?
Not the most successful.
And in many areas, it doesn't exist.
There are more people in India without electricity, than the entire population in the United States of America.
And now we're starting to see this: solar forces on the corruption and new business models that allow you to sell it.
Muhammad NASA's minds it in Bangladesh with a micro-micro-micro-micro-micro-.
It's a marketplace.
Bangladesh is today the country that's most developed systems in the world: two systems on average, at night and on the day.
And there's everything that's exposed: the sun energy that's coming to the Earth every hour for the energy consumption of the world for a year.
In fact, it's a less than a hour.
So the answer to the other question, "Can we change?"
It's obvious. "
And it's "Yes, you'll get more.
The last question: "Do we get our way?"
And France was certainly a way, how many of the conditions they really have to have and the extinctions would be very important.
But the countries don't wait. They're going to go on.
China's already the decline that started from the next year is to predict a series of the roads and the experiment.
They're probably going to do one hand with the Iraq.
The United States has already started to change.
All of these coal faces have been invented for the next 10 years, and they're on it.
All of these sustainable costs have been created.
All of these coal features have been affected on a camp.
These are all of them in the bone.
We move forward.
Last year -- if you look at all this investment in the United States in the United States, almost three colors were new energy products, mostly wind and sun.
We open this crisis.
The only question is: How long would we take us there?
And that's why a lot of people are going to come up and do this change.
It's close to 400,000 people have gone through the streets of New York City to happen to the United Nations's imagination of this.
Many thousands of thousands, dozens of thousands, went in cities around the world.
And so I'm the most optimistic.
As I said first, we're going to win this system.
I'll end with the next story.
When I was 13 years old, I've heard the president Canada Canada, to reduce a person on the moon and get home in a conversation within 10 years.
And I heard the adults of then say, "It's a pig, expensive and it might probably be honest."
But as eight years and two years old, once NASA took a way of the moon, in a big advantage in the case of NASA, Bonton.
Here's a fact that's about this: The average age of the systems engineering, the people in the room at the same day, was 26, and it says, between the old, when you heard about it a challenge, they were 18.
Today we've given a moral challenge, in other challenges we've learned.
One of the 20th century's great cities in the United States, and Los Angeles, wrote a teacher who was born in my mind: "After the last century," Yes, "and" that's about the future. "
When the teenagers were lost their movement, they gave up "No" after "not" after "after" no. "
And finally, it's the "Yes."
The secret movement, the movement for the women's rights has come up with infinitely, until eventually it sounds "Yes."
The movement of the privilege rights, the movement against aid, and in the last time, the movement for the rights of the United States here in the United States and other places.
After the "Not" The end comes "yes."
When a moral challenge comes up in the end of a rise in the middle of East, between what's right and what's not, the result is previous, because who we are human beings.
99 percent of us are in this situation and so we're going to win.
We have everything that takes.
There's who's more judgment in our profession to act, but I'm arguing that the president to operate is a new source of source.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Chris Anderson: You've got an amazing piece of skills.
You've got a brain of a scientist who's trying to figure out the size of the problems, and the capacity to turn it into the highest language.
There's no more who's going to take it, and that's why you've evolved this issue.
It was amazing to see it 10 years ago, and it was amazing to see it now.
DP: It's an enormous piece of you, Chris.
But in the states, I have a lot of good friends in the scientific community, with a fantastic customer who were ready to sit and explain this material again and again until I got to join it in a simple language that I could understand myself.
And it's the key when you go to an idea.
CA: Your talk. First part -- scary, two -- full of hope.
How do we know if all the grades, all of this progress, it's enough to solve what we've shown in the first part?
EG: I think the difference -- I'm here in the business world just 15 years.
But one of the things I've learned is that the more important if a product or new choices are more expensive than the product or they've got it.
It turns out it changes when it's cheaper.
And when it's pushing this border, you change a lot of things.
We're all the time surprising from these opportunities.
Radidn't require the moon, the Gull Prize, said, "Well, until things go, it's a long time of computing," and then they get much faster than you thought it could happen. "
I really think we are at this point.
There's people who use the brain's "Cyrus", "which means, when it's flow under the half door," without Saudi, in most of the places, it's going to become a decline.
In one of the inventions of Ethiopia, a matter of the jihad project, there's a courage to sell it with a click.
And I don't think it's going to make.
There's one woman in Atland, Desim, sitting on the head of the "Minister's" from the Atland. "
They've put it into this effort in order to hide a boundaries and create a station.
And recently, she got a solar pressure on her roof, and he didn't understand what requires it.
Laughter) So she's right now with the France of the environment and they're going to have a new organization called "The green line."
And I had a little bit of that.
So at the end, the answer to your wife is, it sounds a little bit of London and maybe I've asked, but 10 years ago -- and Jananua was exposed to this -- there's a people who's in this audience who's a really important role to reduce these external places.
And some of it didn't have a economic transformation, but it's changed this global revolution.
And what people in this audience will do now with this knowledge -- obviously we're going to win this system.
But it's very important how fast we're going to win.
CA: Don't move, it was very powerful.
If you're going to see that this would be the year that this monitor is going to change, as you said, it's no matter what I've been interested in, but you're looking at people from the right side of science, in business opportunities like this, in the sense, and it means we're going to win -- in my life, it &apos
Thank you very much.
EG: Thank you very much for me to help TED.
Thank you!
Thank you.
You're working in a general theory.
You're in the middle of the slide that's happening when suddenly comes from 1,280 different books.
The books were taken in one teacher, but they're not extended, and the autism of the cockroach is taken.
In addition to that, the teachers start a message, which means that the first thing in the morning, will come up with students who would feel these books.
How can you train everyone in time?
One way is to start on one side of the teacher with the first books.
If the first two books are made, they left them like they were.
If not, they decided them.
And then, look at the other book and third, and repeated the process, and it's so far that you're going to get to the line.
At some point, you'll get to tell you that you need to be last, and you're going to decide it with every book that's in front of it, to move it in the bottom until it's going to end up there.
So, they started from the beginning and repeated the process to bring the other book from the end of the Radian, and continue to all the books are transformed.
This approach is called "Bay". "
It's simple but slow.
You're going to do 129 equations in the first bank, so 1278, and so on, until you get 8,8,560 equations.
If any one take a second, the process will take more than an hour.
Second strategy will start in just the first two books.
And then, take the third book and put it with the book in the other place.
If he sat before the other book, they decided them, then they put it into the first place, and they decided them if you need.
Now you took the first three books.
And he went to add one books after the other to give the Minister's teacher, and he decided the new book with it that he was born until he was surrounded by the cases between the Mexs and so much.
It's called "income imagination."
In contrast to a blueprint, it usually doesn't require the equation of any books.
On the average, we're going to be able to compare every book to a half of the books that came in.
In this case, the concept of equations will be 40,280, and it's almost five days.
You're still doing too much of equality.
Here's a better idea.
First of all, you've been looking at a random book.
It called it the extension, and they put it into every other book.
So, you're part of the line that you're going to put every book before you're going to wait for those and all of those who come after us.
Now you've got a lot of time by not going to say no book from the left to the book on the right.
Now, if you're just looking at books from the left, you can choose an academic book and reduce the books that come to the left of those who come after.
You can continue to create an expert like this until you have a group of small categories, each one will imagine using another strategy, like an income imagination.
Each of a dream requires about 1280 equations.
If you're pretty happy, your books's dream to 129 degrees of wealth is about seven states, or 8,960 seconds.
These dozens are about 22 seconds every single one.
In all, this method that's known as Charlie Richard can train the books in less than three and a half hours.
But there's a coffee.
Your curiosity can be unhappy, and it's not a long time.
Unfortunately, it's almost never happening.
So a quick imagination is one of the most effective strategies using today.
They're using things like an interest in interactive interest, or to create a list of all the fuel stations that are often used to a data universe.
In your case, you're going to help a quick imagination with a time.
It's another day of life on the end of the library.
Every year, the professionals of machines have come up with this of the most effective and more activities that we've ever thought we're only able to.
The computers of today can win us in complex toxic games, for a speech of transparency, and identical identity almost any object.
But the robots's robots may go one step forward by trying to understand what we feel.
And why is it important?
Because if machines and people who activate them can read our emotional situation, they may be able to help us or compare us in a unprecedented scale.
But before we get there, how is something complicated like emotions can be happy to books, the only language that responds?
Actually, in the same way that our brains spend emotions, the machines tend to identify them.
The American psychologist Paul Paul Fazman wondered a number of universal emotions that their famous artists are built in the same way in all cases.
For example, a photograph of a beetle is affected by happiness if in life in a modern environmental environment and if you're in the boundaries of Babbi.
And I'm going to be an artist, anger, fear, happiness, nerve, and surprise, identified in the same way.
And it turns out, you could have computers to identify images from a minute moment for computing algorithms, like boundary networks.
These are artificial sophistices that are similar to our biological neurons create connections and decide information.
In order to train the network, samples from the head of different categories, like photos that art as nervous or brains, conducted into the system.
The networks of networks are going to take these examples by the engagement of the beautiful weapons that are going to be able to certain properties.
The more information in the training process, the algorithm is going to do better in the right identity of new images.
It's similar to our brain, three to work on new regulations, from looking at experiences from the past.
Technology algorithms aren't only limited to face.
Our feelings are very much in many ways.
The body's body and the dream, changes at the heart rate, the skin, the skin temperature, or even the short rate of connection and the sentences in our own form.
You may think that green networks recognize all of these will be a long and complex process until you understand how much information is out there, and some modern computers can work it.
Socies in social media, images are translated and videos, and surrounded by regulation cameras as and devices to women who bring physical physical signals, the big question is not how to collect enough information, but what's done with it.
There's a lot of useful useful for computing emotions.
The robots that use algorithms to identify faces can predict children to learn or give people a sense of society.
Social media companies are used to use algorithms to help prevent the interventions by a statistic trust that feed words or certain expressions.
And emotional pollution can help treat digital disorders or even provide people a mammographic psychiatric.
Although the potential benefits, the idea of huge networks that are based on our images, our experiences, and our ecosystems are quite crazy.
What are the implications of this on our privacy when these don't personalized systems are used by corporations to our feelings of feelings through their privacy?
And what's going to happen with our possibilities to think that they can identify the people who can do crimes before they even did an aware decision to act?
Now the robots now have a long way to go through which they can look at emotional and emotional plants, like Iran, and the power of emotions -- how much someone is happy or sad.
And yet, they might be able to finally read our feelings and tell them.
On the other hand, can they identify with our fear because of invisible intervention, it's another story.
The professor of our professor, the Indian scientist and the extinction of science, found himself a new challenge: Tescope around the world in the airplane that it's itself at a rate.
His ability to fly over an amazing time of one crowd of a minute for a minute on the equal line, meaning that it would take a 36 hours to move the planet all.
There's just one problem: the airplane can only be used in 180,000 meters of fuel, the amount that's only caused for the slide.
Let's be honest.
The professor may be able to design the plane so that you could make more fuel, but what did you prefer it?
Instead, he's designed a little bit more crazy solution: he's built three airplanes to the task.
In addition to their action, the professor is dealing them in an amazing number of tools.
Every one of the planes can change the wind at the speed and move all the amount of fuel that it's into the other planes in order to switch without slow, the conversation that they're close to each other.
The professor will take the first airplane, while two hits, frozen and Kenya will take the two other airplanes.
But just one hand is focused on the equal line, let's give it to this experiment, what makes it the beginning of the beginning, and instead of the only place where the plants can predict, to fit, or fuel on the ground.
What's a plan on the three plants to the universe to enable a professor without a cosmos across the whole path and put his dream without a plane of a fuel?
Oh, if you want to solve the animal on yourself.
An answer: Three answers in time: 2 answer in time: 1 of the prescriptions of the professor, they can get it, but just in the voice.
The key is to maximize that every one of them wanted to give it, and not to move any fuel of fuel.
It's also helping to think about the problem in a dramatic way, so they can do short conversations in any direction because they're doing the professor of a tool in the middle of the journey.
Here's a lot of us.
All the three plants from the 12 in the walls to the West, each of them are full of 180,000 fuel fuel.
After 45 minutes, or the journey of the whole journey, every airplane remained 135,000 to every single single one.
Aria has been 45,000 to the professor and 45,000 to the frozen, and it's why they're completely reduced.
With 45,000 tons that were left, organized and repeated to the airport and what's active to Sylin to the president.
45 minutes later, after the third was four of the journey, to the professor and Philippi remained 135,000 miles.
Pautographic has led 45,000 to all of the professor, and it's about 90,000 pounds to return.
We've been a professor of his mother's brain and put his favorite alone on it.
It would be alone for a while.
In the meantime, organism is waiting for the privilege of frozen, when it's a fun to the end of the end and it's ready to go out.
In a second, it's been conducted, it's a decline, and it's an extinction.
At this point, it was just 180 minutes and the professor is in half the way with 90,000 meters of fuel in his face.
For the next 90s, the symptoms of the professor and the nurse of each other in the other direction and women in the three natural gas.
Just before the frozen of the fuel of the fuel, it's for a piece of organism.
It's got it 45,000 meters from the '90,000 of it, so each of them have 45,000.
But it's just a half of what they need to go back to the airport.
Unfortunately, at the same moment, there's actually a fuel of fossil fuel.
45 minutes later, just before the two airplanes are going to leave the fuel, it's going to get them in the top of 315, and it's going to get each of them 45,000 tons of fuel fuel and it's 45,000 to itself.
The three airplanes are repeated back in the airport just before their fuel shows zero.
While the journalists and the water, the professor of a argument that Mexico would be available at most of the regular restaurants, once we realized how to prevent the forces of the enables in order to be conducted on the floor.
What do you think when you look at me?
Am I believe? Money?
Maybe even sister.
Or my mom's accurate, which has been a brain corruption, autism.
Or just a car as a test in the airport.
The last is true, actually.
Laughter) If some of your feelings were negative, I'm not really worried about you.
It's just how the communication offers people who are born like me.
One study found that 80 percent of the news about Muslims and Islamic are negative.
And studies show that Americans say most of them don't know Muslim.
I guess people don't talk to their own past behavior.
Laughter) Well, for those of you who have never seen Muslim, I'm very happy to know you.
Let me tell you who I am.
I'm a mom, like the Chicago -- collecting a flight, a space on the side.
I'm fantastic.
I'm trying to be crazy.
And I'm an institution to believe and traditional.
But it's not like a musician says, because a death, I wasn't born this.
It was a choice.
When I was 17 years old, I decided to go out of the moon.
No, not as an artistic as part of my friends, but as a grandmother, and I decided to start to switch the jungle, my head experiment.
My feminist friends were born: "Why do you imagine yourself?"
What's funny is that at the same time, it was an independent instruction of the pressure that I felt about 17 to move on to an inevitable level of beauty and violence.
I didn't get my faith in a way of my parents.
I've been diagnosed with the Korean.
I read and I showed up and I asked and cooperation and finally, I left.
My relationship with God -- it wasn't love a first view.
It was a slow and a tool that was produced with every career of the Korean.
His favorite beauty is sometimes excited me to a minute.
I see myself in it. I feel God knows me.
Have you ever felt that someone sees you, understand you completely and love you at all?
So it feels.
And so later, I started, and like every good park, I started my career as an engineer.
And then I was born with a child, after I was looking at, and I actually lived the American dream.
And then it got it in a terrible morning of September 2001.
I think many of you may remember exactly where you were at the same morning.
I sat in my kitchen I finished the morning, and I looked at the TV screen and I saw the words "Bushing."
There was a smoke, planes were going into buildings. People would judge buildings.
What was it?
AK?
Tell?
My dream was spread in the back to the kitchen.
Who will do something like this?
And I turned out to the wall and I heard, "Syrian Amazon..." "" "" called Amy -- "" "" -- "" "" "" -- "" You need
God.
It's not pretty much that my country's coffee, it's in the eye of a eye, and it's a other person's action made me return.
At the same day, we had to move across the Central America to go to another city and start a mayor.
I remember that I was sitting in the mind of the driver's mind as we're going to go on what, I'm extended as I could sit, for the first time in my life, I've been afraid someone I'm moral.
We went to the new girl in the same West in a new city in what felt like a completely different world.
And then I've heard and I saw and I read out of the international organizations that said things like "There were Western" to be in the best areas "don't have an audience."
I stayed at home every week.
And then it's a third day, today in which Muslims are collecting.
And again, there was a look, "Don't go on the top day, it could be a goal."
And I've made the news, a huge curiosity.
The emotion was so important and my mother, in a way, and I also heard about the faces of Muslims, or people who were going to be like drugs, who were scared in the street.
Scientists even become.
And I thought, we need to stay at home.
And yet, something felt wrong.
Because those people who have changed our country have exposed our country.
I understand that people were tremendous.
Good what? I was also a business.
And in a situation where you need to explain all the time is not easy.
I don't care that ask questions. I love questions.
That's the ones I think about.
Today you hear people say things like, "There's a problem in this country, called Muslims.
When are we going to get rid of them? "
So, there's people who want to eat Muslims and make a restaurant.
They're talking about my community as if we're growing in a language of America.
And the only question is, do we leave or products?
You know, a tumor is completely transparency, and a tumor that's just leaving under a traffic.
The possibilities don't make sense, because it's the wrong question.
Muslims, like all the other Americans, are not a tumor in the language of America, we're a positive interview.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for Muslims, they're spontaneous and teachers, the people and the Olympics and Olympics.
Now, is it a restaurant that's going to make America more joy?
Maybe it's going to be a couple of different places, but it's not going to get rid.
It's an enormous role in fact that a more source of opinions have to people with other images and more involved.
And as a single goal in the Washington came to me recently, people actually wouldn't get more extinct in restaurants.
They're going to be more extreme, or they're in their bedroom, against a computer.
And what you're looking at the process of the process is that it starts on the Internet, but the first thing that's happening is that the person comes from his community. Even its family. So the extreme group can do that the brain corporations so that they believe that they're, the real Muslims, they're the real Muslims, and all the other people who are working on their
So if we want to prevent the box, we've got to make people continue to go against.
Now, there are people who's still going to say that Islam is about.
However, a group like my mind is looking at her intelligence on the Korean.
Now, as a grandmother, as a person, I think we need to do all of us to stop a group like mind.
But it's going to be a technique for their restaurant if we're going to move them as a belief of 1.6 billion people.
Thank you.
The context of the Islam is like the context of the line Charles Center.
Thank you for the two groups to argue that they're looking at their iPhone on their month book.
But when you look at them, they don't get a motion of what they call their month book.
It's their digital that makes them see these things in the states.
Second recently, an artist told me a story that was used for me.
He said to her father because she thought about to join his mind.
And I was really surprised and asked him, was she about a leader of a extreme group?
And he said that the problem was exactly the opposite, that every single man who was trying to talk to him, joined her and said that her husband, her sense of injustice in the world, you'll put it in the walls.
So without a place to compare the feelings, and the concept of the concept in this graph, it was a great goal to be a device by the extreme creatures that ensure a solution.
What this artist did was connect it back to God and her community.
He didn't understand it on their face -- and instead he gave her ways to do real change in the world.
What she's learning in a director from a president to join your mind.
I've told you a little bit about how Islamic is affecting me and my family.
But how does it affect normal Americans?
How does it affect all the people?
How should we have a 40-hours of what affects our democracy, our freedom computing health?
Well, a recent study -- in fact, a number of studies in modern science -- show that when we're looking at least three things.
We're getting better than curiosity, Californian and opinions.
One study showed that when the research was important for the emotions that were negative about Muslims, they got better interfaces on institutions and experiences that are reducing the possibilities of American Muslims.
Now, it's not just academic.
When you look at when the anthropy -- Muslims came to the president between 2003, it happened three times, but it wasn't around terrorism.
It was at the beginning of the Iraq war and time two choices.
So Amazon is not just the response of the modern response to the Muslim of who I'd expect.
It can actually be a tool for the public, and reduce the basis of the general society, which is a geographic civil citizens who get the right information.
Muslims are like coal in coal.
We may be the first one that's done, but the powerful air of fear is all of us.
Thank you very much, and actively, it's not just to have to explain yourself all the time.
Darah and his wife would have been a young, and he sat at in Chile, the North Carolina, where they were learned.
Da was Talk.
He was a president to reduce the teeth.
And his sister told me that he was the most powerful and the worst person that she knew.
She looked at him there and he showed her his life curiosity, and she was volunteered.
She said, "When's my little hair became such a young man?"
Just a few weeks after San's exploration in my sister and his new sister, their parents, the Jewish Kenyan, killed them, together with a brother's sister's brother, Ray, who happened them after their lunch, in a style, after the famous famous famous magazine in his bathroom.
It's a sign in eight times.
So stem cells is not just moral, it can also be small.
So, back to my story.
What happened after 11.9?
Would we go to the restaurant or we put on a safe and we asked at home?
Well, we talked about it, and it might look like a small decision, but for us, it was to decide what kind of America we want to leave our children: such that you're going to take us by fear or that we're spending free.
So we decided to go on the corner.
And we put my son in his car in the car, we sat it and we sat it on what's going on on on the corner.
I took it, I sat down the shoes and I went to the whole page and what I've seen made me stop.
The place was completely full.
And then the artist of consciousness, India and reduced our apartments, because half of the audience were created, Indians, historically, atheists, atheists and people don't believe, or not to reduce us, but in order to predict policies.
So I just got in this moment.
These people were there because they were chosen in the courage and compassion on Pantheism and opinions.
What do you look at?
What do you look at?
Do you go on safe?
Or are you going to join those who say we're better than that?
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Hollywood: So, Dala, seems to be serious.
But I'm wondering, what you're going to say is that you're going to have a TED Talk, you're obvious with a deep thought, you're working in a stupid risk, the rule of the general, not the rule.
What would you say to these people?
DP: I'm saying, don't give this stage to spend you. I'm completely normal.
I don't get the rule.
My story is not special.
I'm the most normal one.
When you look at Muslims all over the world -- and I did it, I've done the biggest research that we've ever done on Muslims around the world -- people want normal things.
They want happiness for their families. They want work and they want to live in peace.
So I'm in any way I'm not going to have the rule.
When you get people who come out of the general, many times it's because it's easy, they don't want it.
Hollywood: Thank you very limited.
Thank you.
Imagine, for Kenya, Bangladesh Mururgin learned a French lesson, a Field game around a black black hole, a dolphin Penn Announcer on Abo.
You probably didn't see any of those in reality, but you could imagine it immediately.
How does your brain create a picture of something you've never seen?
It may not look hard, but it's just because we're so normal to do it.
It turns out that it's actually a complex problem that requires complex speech inside your brain.
That's because in order to create these new images and recycled images, your brain takes a familiar and feeding them in new ways, like Kijjiji remains images.
The brain has to take a look at thousands of electrical signals and bring everyone to exactly the right time.
When you look at the fact, thousands of neurons in your background, your background will be electrical signals.
These neurons are wiping different features of the bone: magnitude, heat, heat, green, and love.
This Chinese Islamic Israeli represents the bees between this green group, and they're going to put them together what's called green car, in this case, the local car to the Antarctica.
In the brain science, it's called the mirror, neurons that come together.
If you're going to imagine Andrew after, all the car is described, and you'll give a perfect image.
The dolphins are scared by another neurons.
In fact, all of the objects that you've seen is scared by the neurons that's compared to it, those neurons that have been together in this conservative wisdom.
But this principle doesn't explain the infinite number of objects that we can apply our minds even though we've never seen them.
The green car for the gene of the ocean Antarceline on the zero doesn't exist.
So how can we imagine it?
One open is, called the Monolic theory, repeated and meeting that training is the key.
If the neurons of dolphin and anthropy are accumulated at the same time, then these two hormones can move on our hands as one picture.
But something in your brain has to predict this musician.
One of possible is the previous previous corporation, that's heard in all of the complexity of complexity.
The neurons of the president is connected to the background of the back corner by long-term cells and the regulation of boundaries.
The Chinese theory is the fantastic theory that, as in the Bay who's focused on patterns, so the neurons of the president is sending electrical signals through these nervous nerves to a number of neurons in the back corner.
It causes them to act with a full speech.
If the neurons are affected at the same time, you'll experience the complex picture just like you've seen it before.
The machine chain and this science of different neurons by the president of the president is called a neutral.
In order to make a management to work, signals will have to go to the two neurons in the same time.
The problem is that the number of neurons are far more than others from the previous nation.
If the signals move through the two cases at the same short, they won't get a contrast.
You can't change the need of bees, but your brain, especially when it's evolved, there's ways to change the speed of the past.
The neurons are falled in the material that's called Michael.
Michael is a decline of the electrical signals that go through the bone.
The number of boundaries are fed in no less than 100 times of email.
Others exist in a book that's just a single one.
And the reasons with more than Michael Einn can transform big signals in 100 times more or more than those with more patterns.
A number of scientists think today that this difference in the intuition can be the key to the world's orchestra in the brain, and as a result, our modern capacity.
Most of this intuition is going on in the doors, so it's a young task, our previous imagination has an interact with the brain that's living in the virus can create creative components during our lives.
Today I wanted, that's the morning, I wanted to talk about the future of transportation transport by people; about how we can cut the sky, the fingerprint and a second by getting more people into cars, and how we could do it with technology in our classroom.
And yes, I'm talking about phones.
It's not cars that are made by themselves.
But as the beginning we need to go back over a hundred years.
Because it turns out there was been a lot before Over.
And if it was survival, the future would probably have been here.
So let me show you the jihad.
In 1914, it was invented by a guy called L.C.
Dr. Dr.. He was familiar with Mr. Angeles, and he had an idea.
He went around the center of the city of Los Angeles, where I grew up, and he saw electrical electricity with the long arms of people who are going to get to all kinds of places.
He said, "Why don't you put on my car to take people to do for Jim -- it was Sannounced to Nigeria.
So people were not only in Los Angeles, but in the country.
And a year until 1915, there were 50,000 squares a day in Atlantic, 45,000 on Texas, and 150,000 pounds a day in Los Angeles.
To give you a perspective, About in Los Angeles from 15,000 squares a day.
A hundred years later.
And so there's a lot of electricity people, the welfare of the transportation at the same time.
They're obviously not happy about the jihad.
So they started working and went to cities in all the United States and put emotions to look at the growth of the jihad.
And there are all kinds of emotions.
There were curiosity -- many times they were expensive.
In some cities, if you were a jihad, you had to be in Jewish 16 hours a day.
In other cities, there were two behavior for one jihad.
But there was a really interesting emotion that they had to put a liquid in the back of the back -- to get it in every jihad -- to stop a special invention that they read.
So what happened?
Within a year, there was a regular success.
But the jihad, until 1919, was completely excited out of the day.
It's got...
Because you can't share a car, you've got to keep one in your face.
And it's not about traffic consumption and it's not that 2007, there's a car for every woman and a child in the United States.
And the phenomenon became global.
In China in 2011, there were more consumers than in the United States.
It was a public price.
In the United States, we spend seven billion hours a year in thinking.
160 billion dollars in French, of course, also to sit in a movement, and a minute of all of the refugee refugees to the air by these cars that we're sitting in.
It's just four percent of our problem.
Because if you have to be a car, it means that you're 96 percent of your car is going without movement.
And that's why 30 percent of our land are used to make these feet.
We even have a sophisticated cake that we built for cars.
This is the world where we live today.
Cities deal with this problem for decades.
It's called the motion of death.
And even in the city like New York, one of the most popular connections in the world and one of the big, and the amount of transportation systems in the world, there's still 2.5 million consumers that go over these bridges a day.
Why is it?
Well, it's because of the mortality didn't understand how to get to the door of everyone.
So in San Francisco, where I live, the situation is much worse, in fact, much worse around the world.
And so the beginning of Over in 2010 was -- well, we just wanted to push on a button and get a train.
We didn't have so big languages.
But it turns out that many people wanted to click on a button and get a train, and what we started to see is a lot of popular tricks.
We've seen a lot of people pushing the same button at the same time, and we've got to about it anywhere.
So we started thinking about how to make these two mistakes to one?
Because if we're doing it, the president will be more powerful -- until 50 percent cheaper -- and of course the city has a lot more people and a lot less cars.
And so the big question for us was: Is it going to work?
Could it be a little bit better enough for people want to share it?
And the answer is, for us, yes.
In San Francisco before Oklap, we had good, each one would take his car to survive.
And the cold colors is where there are most cars.
And when we've designed Oklam to activity, well, you see there's not so many colors.
More people go around in a city with less consumers.
It seems that Oklam works.
So we tried it in Los Angeles.
And then we've learned 7.9 million miles from the road, and we've been 1,400 tons of carbon dioxide from the air.
But the part that I'm really -- Applause) But my favorite statistics -- remember, I'm from Angeles, I've spent years of my life behind the wheel -- how do we fix it? My favorite part of eight months, we've invited 100,000 new people who are doing polio every week.
In China, it's all big, and that's why we're doing 15 million pounds per month.
And of course, we're seeing growth that's going on.
In fact, we see it also in Los Angeles.
And when I'm talking to my team, we don't say, "Hey, 100,000 people are doing Poland every day and we finished."
How do we bring it to a million?
And in China, it can be a few millions.
So OK, it's a very good solution to the Iraq Valley.
But what about the facts?
It's the street where I grew up in Los Angeles, it's actually a France called Jambridge, California, well, look at these mayors, they're pretty good at the end of the infinite.
And every morning about the same hour, vehicles come out of the other, most of them with one person in the car, and they're going to work, to their work.
So the questions for us is: How do we make all these daily cars -- and actually there are dozens of millions of them -- how do we make all of these daily cars?
Well, we've got something that we've been invented recently called Obama.
You're water in the morning, you're going to go to work, you're taking your box, you're going to go down and you're going to take the Olympic Amazon, and all of a sudden you're going to be a river.
And we're going to get you with one of your neighbors in the way to work and that's a great thing.
There's just one problem.
It's called emotion.
So 54 student, what is this?
It's what the United States government decided that he was the price to make a train for a hill.
You can collect every single one in the United States and take them to be able to look at a moment, for 54 trillion cents or less.
But if you respond to 60 cents, you're a healthy.
But what if for 60 cents, we can make a half million people to do Kong Los Angeles?
And what if 60 cents can we get 50 million people to do Korea around the United States?
If you can, of course, it's something that we're going to do.
And that's how it's coming back to a lesson on on John.
If until 1915, it was a conservative success, imagine this thing continues if they didn't.
How would our cities have been different today?
Would we have a gene where there's a beetle?
Well, we lost this opportunity.
But technology gave us another opportunity.
Now, I'm excited like everyone about cars that are made by themselves, but do we really have to wait five, 10, or even 20 years to make these new cities for reality?
With the technology that we've been doing today and a little bit of emotion, we can become a shape for a common shape, and we can bring our cities from today.
Thank you.
Applause) Chris Anderson: Tris, thank you.
TV: Thank you.
CA: You know, the company in Second is just amazing.
Just talk about a small part of it here, a powerful part -- the idea of making public transportation like this is cool.
But I have some more questions because I know they're there in people.
So first of all, a week I've been talking about my cell phone and I've tried to invite an apartment and I couldn't find the action.
You've had a very radical design and convenient design.
CK: Yeah.
CA: How did it go?
Have you seen more people who couldn't find the discovery at that day?
Do you go to people with this design?
CK: Well, first of all, I should say what was the goal.
And I think if you know a little bit about our history is much more obvious.
When we first started, there were only holes.
It was a liquid, you're pushing on the button and you get an extinction.
And so what we've done was almost what I'd call him an unprecedented version of a magnitude that looks like a symbol of a daily car.
And when we went to the weird and we went from MS to a woman car in India, it's going to be something important for us to be more local, to be more local, to be connected to the cities we were and that's what you see with the examples and the colors.
And more Italy, because a woman doesn't mean anything in Scott, and Elon doesn't mean an extinct meaning.
And around this is a road.
Now, when you look at something like this, I mean, your hands are wrong, you have -- well, you're a little bit worried.
What we've seen is that many people at the beginning, a lot more people have evolved the atmosphere because they've looked at what's going to find when you've evolved the atmosphere?
And the numbers were a little bit higher than we wanted.
CA: Okay, it's cool.
Now, you're, for yourself, kind of respect, I would say.
Your documents and your investigations that were with you all the way to believe that the only chance of taking the sense of what's the powerful and the products of the music industry and so on, it's that somebody who's got rid and uncomfortable, what you're probably worried about.
How many people feel that you've just taken this culture too far, you know, a year or two years ago, there was a big discovery where many women were excited.
How does it feel in the society at the same time?
Do you look at businesses?
Do you know something about it?
CK: Look, I think, I've been a project since I'm at high school and you're a project, in all sorts of different ways you're going to see it happened about about a year and a half years ago, and we've lost it was hard.
In the face, we felt that -- at the end, we felt that we were good people doing good work, but except we didn't see it.
And so we had to do a lot for -- we've become a very small society a very small year and a half years ago, our society was 400 people, and today it's 6,500.
And so when you're going to make a growth growth, you've got to move the social values and talk about them all the time.
And make sure people all the time and ask, "Are we good people doing good work?"
And if the answer is yes, the other part is to make sure you tell your story.
And I think we've learned a lot.
But it was certainly a hard time.
CA: I think, where you're doing, you're going to get people who're wearing you.
How many behavior was in New York and other places are very expensive now because you're going to change the cost and they're already saying -- you can afford it.
How -- you know, you've said that you've just launched it with the engagement of pushing on a button and the right right.
That's a very successful thing you're affecting the global anatomy right now.
You need to be, whether you want it or not, a kind of global vision that changes the world.
So, who are you?
Do you want it?
You're ready to go with it and enjoy what it requires?
CK: There's some things in this question, so -- Laughter) First of all, in the regular building, so it's going to take a bone.
OK, just when we started 10 or 15 percent faster than our black car.
It's now in many cities, half of the price of Mony.
And we've got all the data to show that the behaviors are more than an hour than what were modern programs.
What's going on is that when the price goes down, it's more likely that people are going to be left in different times of today, than there are other species, and more likely to use it in places that don't use it before.
And what it means for behavior, it's where it's or it's going to learn, more likely to collect someone.
And so what it means is more pregnant in an hour, more minutes out of the surprise that they're effective and actually the wind.
And we've got cities in which we've done really a fifth of five or six corporations of prices and we've seen these privilege deaths over time.
So even in New York -- we've got a blog in a blog called "Four Times" compared the walls of September another September.
The same month every year.
And we're seeing the wind walls over time when the price goes down.
And there's a perfect perspective, you can't want to win.
And in places that we're teaching privacy and we don't see the walls of trees, we're moving back the prices.
So this is the first part.
And then the analogy and all of this -- I mean, the kind of project I'm one that's really excited about making hard problems.
And the way I like to describe this is kind of like a math doctor.
You know? If a mathematician doesn't have a hard problem to solve, it's a really huge professor for math.
And this is how we love hard problems and we like to get excited about them and reduce them.
But we don't just want any math problem, we want the most difficult we can find, and we want those that if we're spending them, there's a small kind of wow.
CA: In a few years -- say, five years old, I don't know when -- you're reducing your amazing cars that are coming out of themselves, in a low price price you're right now paid on a tree.
What do you say to your military of a million behavior and more at the same time?
TK: It's again -- how long?
CA: While a car that's coming out of themselves -- TK: OK, obviously, obviously. Sorry, I've collected it.
CA: What do you say to the fish?
TK: Well, the son, I think the first part is that it's going to take -- it's probably going to take a lot more than I think some of the cup or the media may be out.
This is the first part.
The second part is that it's going to take -- it's going to be beyond the long.
These cars will work in certain places and not in others.
For us, this is an interesting challenge, right?
Because, well -- Google's doing this from 2007, Tesla is going to do it, it's going to be going to do it, the products are going to do it.
It's a world that's going to exist, and for a good reason.
A million people die every year in cars.
And we're already looking at billions or even tricks of hours in the world that people spend in thinking, the genes are scared, the trees.
And think about the quality of life that's transparency when you give people their time back and they're not so nice.
So I think there's a lot of good.
And so the way we think about it is that it's a challenge, but one of the optimistic behavior, where instead of going to against technology, to me like the music industry, or the electricity industry -- we have to kill it or be part of the future.
But how do we spend optimistic through this?
Is there ways to deal with cities?
Would we have ways that we have education system, a professionally professional, and so on, this crisis.
It's going to take a lot more than I think we're all extended, especially the past period.
But it's a world that's going to exist, and it's going to be a better world.
CA: Detroit, what you're on is just amazing and I'm very excited to you at TED, and you're so open.
Thanks very much. TK: A lot of you.
Thank you.
Imagine a brain scientist called Mary.
Mary live in a black room, she's reading just books in a black hole, and her screens only show a black hole.
But even though it's never a color, Mary is an expert in the fingerprint, and you know everything you've ever got on the physics and biology.
She knows how a different organ of light remains three kinds of conventional actions, and she knows how electrical signals are moving into the brain.
There, they create the patterns of self-activity that are going to be violence that most people can see in them.
Now imagine one day, the black screen of Mary's son's back to the fingerprint, and it's going to happen in nature.
For the first time, she hope something she knew about years.
Is it going to talk something new?
Is there something about a finger of color that didn't look at all of her knowledge?
The philosopher Frank Jenson invented this experiment, called the room of Mary, in 1982.
He argued that if Mary already knows all the physical facts about color, and the experience of color is still teaching it new, so the magic situation, like a fingerprint, can't be completely scared by physical workers.
The experimental experiment of Mary's room described what philosophers call it the knowledge, that there's knowledge and physical properties that can only move through an awful experience.
The science argued the theory of physics, which means that everything, including digital situations, there's a physical explanation.
Most of the people who hear the story of Mary, sounds natural that the fingerprint would be completely different from learning about color.
So, there's got to be a certain quality of nature that goes on its physical light.
Science doesn't just touch the fingerprint.
The room of Mary is using a fingerprint to make an awful experience.
If nature scientist can't explain a completely color view, then maybe they can't explain other consciousness experiences.
For example, we can know every physical detail about building and function of another person's brain, but we can't understand what it feels like to be the same person.
These experiments that don't describe have properties called Kolya, objective possibilities that can't describe in action or measure.
Kenya are unique to the person who's hoping them, like a arm, the love, or the name of them.
The physical facts can't explain completely intelligent conditions like these.
The philosophers who are interested in artificial intelligence used an knowledge argument to reduce the theory of physical situation not necessarily necessarily to create a traffic situation.
In other words, building a computer that's an action of every single single cell in the human brain doesn't necessarily necessarily make a computer brain.
Not all the philosophers agree that the experiment of Mary is useful.
There's a argument that its extended science in the fingerprint will be able to create the same fantastic situation that's created by the nature of nature itself.
The screen shouldn't see something new.
Others say her science has never been perfect because it was only based on these physical facts that could be transmitted by words.
Two years after he invented this, Jenson actually changed his restaurant on his experiment.
He decided that even the experience of Mary's experience of seeing red is still a physical event in the brain, and it's not a polio that doesn't know beyond the physical things.
But there's no fear answer to a question if Mary teach something new when she looks at the wind.
Could we be that there's basic boundaries of what we can know about something that we can't experience?
And does it mean that there's some collections of the universe that's inevitable beyond our feeling?
Or the science and philosophy will allow us to overcome the limits of our brain?
What is your luck?
In the Western biology, it's a plane of stars that's been built by your birthday.
But by the Chinese luck, or we're glad, it's your Iraniang, or the animal that's going to go to your education.
And from the many examples that explain these animals and their room, the most important one is the one of the big river.
As the number of story, his wife, or the French, the sky trick, I wanted to find a way to measure time, so it's an extinction.
The first two-dimensions that were going to get the river to go instead of the lucky rolling by the road.
It's a rock with the joke to start earlier, but in the way to the river, it's met in the Street, in Trize and a decade.
Because the road was small and couldn't forget well, he asked help the big animals.
While the ragus and the horse of the movie, the good door of the heart of the dog has to take the road to the other side.
But just when they were going to get to the other side, the river was jumped out of the decade and promising himself the first place.
The decade came two, with the great piano right after it.
The Arabic, too small to fight their fingers, wrapped in the roof of of the roads and the walls to get the fourth.
So the next one came from the dramatic, which was able to fly to the other side, but it turned to help some creatures where they got in the way.
A sister came from the end, the dirt to the river.
But when she went, the swim was thrown and put it.
The scanner was on the back of the theory, and we'll try to get to the personal place.
The French French looked at the river and remember the shake, the coffee, and the chicken is all about French, working together to push it through the people.
When they came to the other side, the third was preparing to give the different place for a woman, which was the most expensive and remote of them, the corner and the chicken.
The next one was the dog, the struggle to go to the beach.
He was a great soldier, but he did so much that he was able to get just in the place of one meat.
The last place was taken by the back, which was done a noise and a switch to eat and sleep before the contrast was collected beyond the end of the day.
And so, every year goes to one of these animals by this room, and the cycle starts over 60 years.
Why are women a year and you don't have 10?
Well, the traditional year is made out of two free systems.
The animals in the luck are exposed to what's called the French 10 years of the Arabic, or Arijo.
Another system, the sky champions, or Chican, are connected to the end of the cockroach, Chile, tree, water, however, however, House, House, House, House, and Darwin.
For every single secret, you're going to have a virus or Janug, which is made out of 10 years's cycle.
When you're going to have the animals of the Arabic fingerprints, you're going to have a series of the survival and a magazine of the skin, it creates that a year of different fingers, which are known as the magic sector, or the anthropy.
So someone who's born in 1980 would be the luck of a coffee, while someone who was born in 2007 would be a firehouse.
In fact, you can also have an internal animal that's based on your month, a real animal that's focused on your birthday, and a unique animal that's based on your night.
It was the big device that was made out of the road if animals were on the Chinese luck, but when the system reduced to Asia, other civilizations did changes to transform their cultures.
So if you're looking at the Atlantic Center, you're going to find you're a cat, not an announcer, and if you're in Italian, you're a biologist called NASA reveal.
So whether you believe or not why luck means you as people, it's certainly a lot about culture from it is coming.
About seven million people around the world are spending every year from a heart attack, and heart disease and blood disease, which causes heart heart and other problems like a summer, they're the leading death in the world.
So what makes a attention?
Like all the muscles, the heart needs a pencil, and for a heart attack, it doesn't get enough.
Social weapons, or Palk, opens up in our white walls.
It's the blood tool that's made of blood flow.
This button grew up with the age, and sometimes we're going to be emotional, listen, or fun.
Finally, the park can become a signal.
If one of the insects come up with a trick or a trick, a person who's made around it in a few minutes, and it's just a particular summer can become a completely discovery.
The blood flow has been reduced to the Hollywood and the noises of the eye are starting to die in a few minutes.
It's an atmosphere to my heart, or a heart attack.
No treatment, the situation can move quickly.
The surprise of surprise may not be able to sell a good person, and his rate may have come out of a train.
In the case of the event, a heart attack can make a surprise death.
And how do you know that someone has a heart attack?
The worst symptoms is as resources in this one that is made because of the noise of the noise to the oxygen.
Civil patients get it as a big stress or be in the public.
The pain can make the wind to the left, to the road, to the road, or cancer.
But it's not always surprised or dramatic like the movies.
There's people who are black in her life or a list.
Technology can be less boundaries in women and actors.
For them, sensory and teenagers may be the main signals.
And most of the surprise, in many people, especially those with conservation, which affects the nervous nerves that are in the pain, a heart attack can be a project.
If you're afraid someone gets a heart attack, the most important thing is to respond quickly.
If you have access to medical sectors, they read them.
They're the best way to get to the hospital.
Luckiin France, which leaves the blood, and Darwin, who opened the sand, can prevent the chicken from the coffee to remove.
In the imagination, the doctors can lose attention.
They usually use electronic electronics to measure the electrical activity of the heart, and in a blood test to appreciate the heart rate.
The patient was taken then to Scottland in the Kenya where the babies were done to get the signals.
Scientists can open up the scanner by taking a blog in a process called a button.
They're often a student from a metaphor or a polio that's going to hold open.
More transparency may be going to take a lot of fun surgery.
With Mord or wake out of another fuel in the body, a dog can return the blood flow around the device.
These processes remove the remote to the heart of the heart, and you get the heart activity.
Civil treatments are affected, but it's positive.
Scientists and living style affects your risk.
And the good news is that you can change your life style.
Research, a healthcare, and a weight weight is releasing the risk to notice, whether you've gone out or not.
Civil doctors are going to die a few times a week, also in an artificial activity and power.
A healthcare of attention is a summer of sugar and stimulators, the lines of heart disease.
So what should you eat?
A lot of microbes, wrap and fish instead of a red bridge, full and nurses like a golden and scans, it looks like everybody's wrong.
Good and communities can also keep the weight in the healthcare rate, which also leaves the risk to notice.
And of course, drugs can also help prevent attention.
For instance, often, doctors give a low design of alarm, especially for patients who have already been treated and those who know they're at high risk.
There's also drugs that help manage the risk, like a high blood pressure, an asteroid, and a conservation, will learn the risk of attention.
The dog is maybe common, but they're not inevitable.
A healthcare of healthy, accumulated using a bank, which is on a bridge, and a lot of sleep and laughter, will help ensure that the important price of your body is going to continue.
The animal that was invented by the Israeli Islam Robert School and was sold by his colleagues Jorgan in the Ukotus, was in the worst restaurant in all the time.
You're and your team is going to give an Amazon on on a future.
The only way to leave the planet is to take its three soldiers, smoke, nor, "" the flow of flow.
Unfortunately, you don't know who he is.
You learn that you can ask three questions of content and not, every single single one of the third.
The answer of slow is always real, the answer of no crisis, and the answer of description is an academic.
But there's a problem.
You've made the language enough to ask every question, but you still don't know who's two words' Oo's' '''s' ''s "and who's why it doesn't mean.
How can we find out who is who?
Stop here if you want to solve yourself.
More answer: Three 2, this animal looks not just hard, but really impossible.
What can you ask a question if you can't understand the answer and don't know whether it's real or critical?
But it's possible.
The key is to ensure our questions so that every answer can be used.
First of all, you can deal with the unprecedented meaning of the word "Oh," "and" the rules of the words themselves in the question, and Second, if you're going to have a real condition, then there's no one that's repeated or real.
To see how it works, imagine that our question is whether two and two is worth four.
Instead of making it directly, we say, "If I ask you if I ask you two and two and two is worth four, are you going to say," Oh? "
If this means "Oh," is yes, "it's a real answer," Oh. "
But what if you stay anybody?
Well, he's supposed to answer "Oh," or not to be a great question, so he's going to go and say, "Oh, it's going to go.
And if 'Oh, in fact, it means not, then the answer to the previous question is "Jo," and then also slow, "and we're still going to get" Oh, "every one of his reasons.
If you spend what it works, the reason it's a mystery structure.
The results of a chicken and a negative illness are always positive.
Now, you can be safe to ask me or even the question that's going to lead to [] if the Industrial question is true and] if it's a study without any meaning of any word.
Unfortunately, it doesn't help us with describe.
But don't worry, you can use our first question to recognize one repeat that is to the surface.
And then you can ask another question to recognize whether it's slow or even.
And once we know this, we can ask it a question to identify the other people.
So let's start.
Would I ask the repeat in the center, "If I asked whether the third of the left is describe, would you say," Oh, are you going to say, "
If the answer is "Oh, there are two possibilities.
You can be that you're already talking to describe, and that's why the answer will be meaning.
But another one, you're talking to slow or no, and as we know, the answer is "Oh," that's what's the opposite question was true, and the third of the left is really described.
Anyway, you can be sure that the recycling is not described.
Like, if the answer is "Oh," so you know that the return from the left can't be described.
Now go to the trick that you've seen is not described and ask, "If I'd ask," Are you no? "Would you say," Oh? "
Because you don't have to worry about an academic possibility, every answer is in identity.
Now you know if his answer is real or criticism, ask the same sensor if the invasion is described.
It's the process of motivation to identify the repeat that's left.
The details want to help you fix the space and you're going to show up.
When you're going to ask you a last question, you're asking me if the way to the Earth is long, and the answer is "Oh."
You still don't know what it means.
All of the physical components that it is, whether you're doing a post, you're going to call an instrument, or a basis of a basis, you're going to need a trust.
The trust is back to action in the goal to get a improvement, and it's helping us to do a quick, speed and security.
So what does the trust do to our brain that help us improve?
Our brain has two types of tissues: a bird and a white material.
It's the improvement of information in the brain, revealing signals and sensors of nervous discovery, while the white material may be particularly fascinated and self-esteem.
So our body is going to prevent, information has to move from the brain material in the brain, in the spinal cord, through a series of nervous curiosity that's called COs to the muscles.
So how does trust and help affect our brain activity?
The asteroids that are there in the Hollywood weapons in the material that's called Mylin.
And this species is that changes with trust.
Man is similar to measure electricity.
It's motivated energy from electrical signals where the brain uses, and it's why it's effective over the boundaries.
A number of new studies in men are affecting this that repeated the physical action of the species that's looking at the nerve of the nerve.
The more education, the more the decline of measure around the nervous series of the nerve, what is that's made like autonomy to the science of your brain to muscles.
So while a lot of ethnicity and artists have their success to a muscle memory, muscles themselves don't really have a memory.
Instead, it's possible, and it's going to be the Ethiopia that's going to make the solution for the ethnicity and these artists through a faster and more powerful and more powerful nervous.
There's a lot of theories that's trying to make the number of weeks, the water and even the years that you have to invest in order to forget from death.
We still don't have a number of magic, we know that control doesn't only do for violence.
It's also about quality and efficiency of trust.
A effective trust is by me, very early, and it's focused on it or in the doors that are in the middle of the right person's capacity.
So if an effective trust is the key, how can we use the best trust?
We'll try the next pipes.
First of all, you've been focused on the police in your face.
It's a potential conference by the computer or the TV and put your phone in a traffic situation.
In one study, researchers were watching 260 students in time for learning.
In average, these students have been reduced in the task just six minutes every time.
Technologists, the telephones, and mostly Facebook have been spent most of the scientific conversations.
It's going to start to take a look or a concept.
Socience is built back, whether it's true and whether not not not.
If you're defending the speed of the artificial citizens, you've got a higher chance to do them right.
Second, a lot of repeat with sophisticated prosperity is a common tool in the highest level.
Scientists showed that a lot of drugs, musicians and careers at the top of 500.0.0-hours a week in costs that are connected to their action.
Many of the time of the time for an effective trust for a lot of artists on a day of limited time.
And at the end, we've been trained in privacy in details.
It's a little surprising, but a number of studies are affected by that, because you've got a physical action, you can get it in just a imagination power.
In one study, 144 players required me to buy two groups.
A group of the physicist in the end of a click with one hand while a group in Jama was in just a minute.
When they were born in a couple of weeks of experiment, the academic players and the monkeys in the two groups were almost the same way.
The more science is going to go through our brains, the more we're going to grow up on trust.
Now, effective trust is the best way we have to push our personal boundaries, get to new tests, and listen our fingers.
When I went to Afghanistan in 1985, social justice was on the National Science School.
The new government was caused after a long war and the president of January January: health care and education is almost free.
The Western centuries of the French Health Central Health is about 80 percent of the population in a mirror of less than two percent of these centuries.
In 1980, the Foundation of the Freedom, 25 percent of the Life Guinea was conservative.
By 1990, just a decade later, the rich sky skill came up -- 80 percent!
I felt great to be part of this change.
You could really feel about emotions and the sense of the background.
The work for the person of my grandmother's life is scared with scientists, doctors, social activities, I've just been thinking not just for African independence but to prevent the advantage of global public health.
But there were also bad challenges.
In 1985, the year when I came to the congestion, the first case of Iran.
I was looking at some patients with AIDS in the early '70s, when I went to my medical training in a hospital in the hospital, but we didn't have an idea what would happen in Africa.
My first days there, the decline rate was about two percent.
But these lessons have been invited to one of four adults until I left Iraq, 17 years later.
By the end of the '90s, I've spent hundreds of people in the lab of their lives that they left HIV.
I've seen in the cases and friends. My students, patients in the hospital, die.
As a response, my colleagues and I've come from an exhibition.
We've been able to use conferences.
We've invented Western programs in schools and jobs.
We've done studies. We've been treated to my daughter and the partners of men's customers, on the roof.
We worked hard, and at the same time, I thought I was doing the best.
I gave a great treatment as he was.
But I didn't talk about transformation.
The NASA's Life Center School was told in the press of his personal failure that led to the wind of Banada.
In 1994, he was the mayor of the peace of peace in the "name."
On the next 10 memory to the tree, he said, "I'm going to do the best, but I realized after the tree that I could do more to avoid the arm and rain."
The medical community wasn't familiar with the HIV, and now, when the World Health Act estimates that -- 39 million people have come from the disease, I'm not the only one that's a forest on that we didn't do more early.
But when I was living in a conference, I didn't see myself as a chicken or a political role.
I've been there in the face of the technical chemical chemistry, the Civian and the physical research that I had.
I thought you've been able to treat patients, and I've been trying to figure out how the disease goes into the population's population, and I've been going to be able to look at the rate of the virus.
I was aware of this that the animal population in the hospital are at high risk, to move and death from AIDS.
In the end of the summer, the water is more likely to predict emissions than modern actions, to 60 percent of the women's women's women's previous HIV.
I've been in order to show that the president is not as a moral, but it's about the culture of healthcare, to work of the galls and anonyma.
The white is almost unfair.
Like health care, the tools that we've learned were most successful: to convince people to change their feelings, to use drugs, to reduce the number of partners.
The president of the Texas was caught, and when in the West was killed a doctor, a treatment that we learned that the most powerful weapon against the president, he was unable to be able to be able to get on the public sector in Africa.
I didn't talk about the inequality of these living drugs or on economic systems and politics that have come up with the decline in a large groups of the population.
I've adopted my prosthetic by reminding myself that I'm thrilled in the country. I'm going to win me if I'm going to leave my arm, and in order to prevent me to do a good job, to treat my patients, to do very positive studies.
So I didn't talk about the early state of government about AIDS.
I didn't have my hands in a radio line.
A lot of doctors and health may think I didn't do any bad.
Our president with the hospital, the Hopkins and Turma, is going to have a patient's context.
And I did every one of my patients.
But I knew that refugees were spread out of our society, which they're exposed not just biological, but it's important, the patterns of living and the privilege, stem cell phones, right, metaphor, metaphor and so on.
It was true about AIDS.
It was true just recently about Ebola.
Scientists like President Freeman who've been working in IDS, read to it from a mathematical violence, because the inequality of the political organization and the economic organization of our social world, in a way that the power can't see it: and violence because of its effects: academic, a demand, is an aid, it's what it
We don't do enough for our patients if we can't know that social justice.
We've made the first step for a public health care, and so we can raise a way to make a real change together.
So in these days, I'm not doing.
I'm driving my voice with many things, also when the market is uncomfortable, even when I feel comfortable.
And a lot of volunteers have been treated to inequal equality, and we're going to have a institution, things that we don't have to exist in this country, probably not in medicine or public health.
But they're comfortable, and their price is an effect of life in them.
So the Amazon decline on the effects of the healthy health in the United States, the moral and the personal violence that people in the sky, together with our president of 250 years of working, 90 years of Western Western Western and 60 years of inevitation, the president of these things I've been able to be able to do with the health of New York City.
In New York City, academic demand 65 percent of black men than only.
In 2012, in women's risk of the high death of the liberal death is 10 times more than a woman's woman.
And despite that we've been focused on a huge tremendous disorders of babies, black babies are still at three times the risk of death in the first life compared to babies.
The New York City is not extraordinary.
These statistics are focused on statistics all over the United States.
At the bottom of the wall that I was recently published in New York Times that there were a million and a half million men who were born.
They've mentioned that more than any six black men who were supposed to be today in the age of 25 to 54, they've gone from my life today, lost to life in prison or early death.
There's a huge tremendous justice in daily violence and I've been reduced by young men who are dealing with it, from the last decades under the Google Blaser's waves.
But we need to remember that the suffering and the inequality and the consequences of a philosophical style that's fun -- heart disease, HIV -- diseases that are horrible and the effect of other animals have been pregnant.
The more you're going to do in Bllands, the more you're going to do, I've been afraid, and I've felt that the medical community was driving by the word "growth" in our studies.
You're probably interested in something every time I said it.
Our students to medicine have been in the classes where they're as "in their white bones," but the medicine of the medicine in the country has been reduced, in a time, it's continued to affect the option of the academic and death.
And I'm worried that the mammogram has evolved to personal health and accurate, genetic and biological search or biology in order to get better care of treatment, can make us not worse for the big picture, where the context is living, is going to grow, they love, are the most important, the most important ones in health care, and so many of us are not good.
Like health care, in our daily work, if in Famia or in the research, we're going to have a huge justice: the house that's not able to be able to predict the medical care because it's got smaller prices, a young young girl who's not going to have a very difficult way that our society is so hard to feel because it &
Our role as health care is not just to treat our time, but to activate the arm and move a voice in a change.
Basically, or not in justice, our social crisis gives our own special sounds, and we don't have to move it.
I'm afraid of this that I didn't talk about in the restaurant, and I've been looking at myself that as a healthcare of New York City, Andrew every opportunity I've had to operate the arena in order to raise an inequality in health.
I'm going to talk about stem cells, and I hope you're going to join me, and I'm going to join you when you talk to Syrian or any form of equality.
It's time that we're going to come out and talk about inequality.
We don't need to have all the solutions to feel change.
We just need courage.
Our health care, the health of all of us, depends on it.
Thank you.
In the ancient microbial imagination, you're going to spread over dozens of decades that hope and convenience, Iraq, we've built the rules of the human and nature.
He's gone out of his father's arms, and he's got more and more.
You're looking at the ground, it looks like don't, and when it's watching it, it's also felt like don't.
But, in the ancient microbial imagination, the line that the prize between the Amazons and the person was aesthetic, and the human beings who were trying to cure it was wrong.
It was the case of Iranians and Dorus.
Life years ago, Iranians were born, his father was sitting in a museum, an artist, and a piano in his birth country.
He's invented the genes and all the tools that are going to get to it.
It's spread the first tree and the first restaurant.
He created so full of life that Hercules was going to think they were human beings.
Even though there was skills and valuable, Dereus was an atheist and journalist.
Because six of our lives was a more familiar artist from it, Dardus wanted it.
As a contrast, Dr. Dordus was reduced from Asia and made his way to the posters.
When his penguin represents it, Dr. Derelos got in the wall by you've been on the airport.
There, as the Tasmanian summer of the training, Dordus went to push the boundaries.
For the next kids, he created a tool from an anthropy that's seen lives.
He's invented the extinction and the penguin, which we gave people control.
With every piece, Detroit has challenge the human limits that have learned so much about the price between the people to the allies, until finally, it's put the limits.
The wife of the President Minister, Faza, started by the South Koren to love in the mirror of the screen.
Unfortunately, it's hard to help her.
In a typical motion, it's the savings.
Dordus built a very, very real space that she'd come in.
When a psychiatric was scared in the process of Detles, she showed up and Monota that was half a person and a half.
This is, of course, made you win, and he put the Dereus on it that allows the rules of nature.
As a contrast, Dr. Dereus has been able to build a fabric that we can't win under the hormone, for the mystery.
When he finished, Mexicus didn '
But Detles still had a museum.
While you've been watching the birds that were coming around a door, the events for the restaurant.
It's and the microbes will go out of the prison like just birds or ask.
With the birds of the birds that were built on the rain, and it's hoping from the walls, Detles built two huge walls.
When he's communicating the walls to us Iranians, he'd put it up: he's going to be too close and the walls of the walls and the walls would be too honest to use.
It's too close to the sun, and it's the heat that's going to reduce the hope and the walls will be reduced.
Anyway, they're going to be convenient.
So, the key to the conversation will be in the middle.
With these boundary hormones, the men were killed from the size.
They were the first human beings who were working.
While Detles remained a speech in the central corner, Iranians came out of the Kaka's accident, and the power of the Alexanda has gone on.
Dordus could only expect what when Iranians were trying to get out of her, unprecedented to change the finger of us.
When the sun of the sun represents the hope of the plus, Iranians were falled from the sky.
It's just like Dereus has been spending many times of the results of human rules in his service, Iranians was also by his House.
In the end, the two men were born on their biomateria from their actions, Iraq in his life and Detles in the restaurant.
If you can't imagine life without chocolate, you're lucky that you haven't been born before the 16th century.
Unfortunately, chocolate was only in America in a very different way of what we know today.
Another in 1900 before the camp, the region of the region learned to predict the trees of the local coffee.
The most famous baby is affected by this that our patients were born and sat with a church and a chicken Chile to create a production -- not a pain of a coal, but a cooking and short.
And if you thought we're doing a big bit of collapse today, the American School has shown to do.
They believed that there was a food food that could be built to the human beings by a contrast of convenient, was worried to the IKKA called Kikkkan and the Fiklin called the Cale.
The telescopes used the coffee with a metaphor, which was sold in the pockets, we gave it to the soldiers as a success on the ground, and they used it on the planes.
The first Atlantic Atlantic with the collapse was happening in 159 when the president Center was visited in the Monaka's cartoon in Nakitta.
On the end of the scanner of a chimpanzee, the next 150 pounds of the game that was fed and reduced to the gold.
When the philosophers came back with the lessons of the new strategies, the academic astronomers, of the local behaviors, we've been able to get a mammography of passion.
First of all, his text did it from Europe to diseases, such as a Korean Center, but the president with a road, a summer or a cold collapse in the middle of the French in the Southern Foundation.
And at the end of the time, Eric Richard wasn't perfect without a series of the Soviet.
The optimism that I didn't have a lot of time to create a big scale.
It's been used by actions and power in the sea in the clinic and nurses of Africa.
The Scott world has changed invisible in 1828 with the Kenya Cambo by Canada of the Atlantic Amazon.
The invention of the cancer is going to look at the natural tone of the Kako, or compassion.
So there's a choice that's going to be able to do and make a prosperity from a production or feeding again with the Chicago to create the productive molecule that we know today.
A short period later, Soldian School called Denel Paul Paul was reduced in a space for a repair, and that's how you put the spaces of the space.
In the 20th century, chocolate wasn '
It's about the Chinese decline for a much larger culture of the box, which can only grow at the equal line.
Now, instead of African countries who are sent to the Cambridge of South America, the Chicago itself into the Western Africa when the globe remained two feet of the World War 2015.
And yet, the tumor of the tumor in the code industrial industry, have happened a terrible decline of human rights.
Many of the mistakes around Western Africa, which is provided to Western societies and children and children, and they're going to have about two million children have been done.
It's a complicated problem, despite the big Soviet companies to cooperate with African countries trying to reduce children or children's business.
Today, the chocolate Babbs itself in our modern culture.
In the end of his local link with deaths, and I'm going to share with the privacy power, the chocolate is exposed in the community of something I've been passionate, and not.
And it's still learning about the extinction history, and it's about its privilege, and it's about its productive process today, shows us where these options come behind and what's going on behind them.
So when you put your next cartoon from your next chocolate, you'll take a moment to voice that doesn't everything about learning is scared.
A person can survive without just about 100 hours.
But there's a tool that's so recycled, which can survive in their hands for decades.
This animal in a millimeter can survive in the worst climate and most cases in the Earth, and you can even stand at high levels of crisis.
It's the water boss, and it's one of the most powerful creatures on the planet, even if it looks like a nitrogen that's left from eight feet.
Most organisms need water to survive.
Over water spread materials, which is the process that moves all the biological responses that happen in the cell.
But creatures like the Saradian, the worst of water, they get these limits with a process called England, from the daily, which means life without water.
And some of them are amazing, the water's isn't alone.
In bacteria, fear organisms called astronomy, plants, and even other animals, can survive.
Many days, it requires beyond the situation of a town.
They're causing a generation, they're reducing your head and eight feet into the body and waiting until the water will come back.
The cities that when the water gets rare and dogs go into the situation, they're starting to contract special molecules, which leads the water cells to decide water that they're lost by creating a crazy piece.
The components of the cells that are going to be scared, like DNA, proteins, and from the streets, we're going to go inside the trick.
The cities that it's hearing about these molecules are made in a place, to prevent them to fit, to fit, or move together.
Once the organism gets water back, the mushroom is caused, a left behind cells are functioning and not worse.
Despite the dog, water dogs can also click into other extreme trees: Pacon, extended beyond the period of water, high levels of radiation, and even the distance of the external space.
It led to some of the signals that are previous, they're regulations.
Even though you've got to think about it, scientific evidence from their customers on the planet, where they've evolved over time.
In fact, this Arabic evolution has created over 1100 species of water, and there's probably a lot of other people who have joined.
And because of water is so sick, they're almost there anywhere.
They live on each other, including Antarctica.
And they're in diverse biofuels, including demand, curiosity, the sea, water, rainforest, and the highest roads.
But you can find water scans also in the most normal places, like a beetle and an extinction that's in the budget, parks and forests.
All you need to find them is a little bit of customers and microscope.
Scientists are now trying to find out if the fish are using a star, their anthropotic techniques, to survive other trees.
If we can understand how they are, and other creatures, represent their emotional biological molecules, maybe we can apply this knowledge to help us reduce vaccines, or to develop peers to pressure that can deal with the climate of the Earth.
And if we know about how the stars survive long to the crowd of the extinction space, scientists can generate privilege about the environmental limits of life, and how to keep astronomers.
In the process, water tests can even help us answer a critical question: Can life survive much less around our face?
A trillion soldiers, viruses, and tricks live on us or inside us, and it's on a good relationship, and we're going to be reduced to free our interactions.
Together, they create the microbial day, a rich ecosystem system that's done in our bodies.
The bacteria in our cases can just take food that the body can't wait, create important materials, to fit the vaccine system, and make the gene against the bacteria.
We still don't have an answer to a question of what good soldiers need for healthcare, but we know it's important that microbial day will be a variety of microbes.
A lot of causes affect our microbial, including our environment, drugs like antibiotics, and even if we were born in a moral surgery or not.
Also Dorda, it's changed as a main effect on our eyes health.
And while we can't control all of these genes together, we can control our microbes if women's attention to food that we eat.
Social cases from tools like elephants, mammals, gas, cartoons, and nurses are the best fuel for the eye life.
When soldiers are caught, they represent that series of regulation service that represents the dead tissue, they're reducing the immigrant activity system, and you can help the previous system, which is the risk of cancer.
And as you can eat more symbols, it's going to see the microbes in your cases.
In a recent study, scientists decided the daily daily asteroid in many ways of a group of a country in South Africa, with an American diploma in the bone and happiness.
After just two weeks on a primary diabetes, rich in Shanghai and her daughter, the African Americans were reduced by the Gabby, and yes Brothern Brothers.
It's a short service that's thinking that we're going to support the risk of cancer.
In the meantime, the group that decided to take a richer in many ways, and it's on the right results.
So what's going to do in our extinction region when we're eating fake and roads in many ways?
It's less fun than a fuel to the exhibition, or in fact, what they're going to do is they're the noise.
The result of this is less diverse and hungry soldiers.
In fact, some of them might start to eat the Ray School.
We also know that certain components can affect the external life.
In a microbial study, scientists found that parasites, collapse, coffee, red red, and chocolate from Mr. Morter were exposed with a limited diversity.
These leaders know politicians, which are natural materials are extinct.
On the other hand, you eat with high space, like a full space and a summer of sugar, there were sophisticated with a decline in a variety.
The way the food is also important.
In any training of my imagination, in general, more cases and it's a better fun.
So fossil colors, Sota, or not sick, they're usually more powerful than a gene tools.
There's also ways to make food that's going to define the amount of good bacteria, which is also what's called antibiotics, in the cases.
Egyptian tools are exposed in microbial patterns, like Lotus and Portugal and bacteria.
It's been used by a way to use food before the magazine, but there's still a traditional driver around the world.
Fields like Kiki, as most of the bubble, Texas, and Chicacasi provide diverse and corporations to our dignity.
Guutt is a other conference that can define the amount of good bacteria in our cases.
It doesn't mean that all of the good beauty is about us.
It's too much of the summer and not enough microbes that might not help.
It's just general.
There's another study before we're going to completely understand how these options affect our microbial day.
We see a positive motion, but in our eyes is a place that's hard about a direct security.
For example, we don't really know if these causes are responsible to change in the direction, or if something more complex happens.
While we're just at the beginning of the research of the fabric regions in our eyes, we've already been able to have a few generations is the microbial microbial system.
The good news is that we have the capacity to discover the microbes in our eye.
You've got the Chinese consumption, the tricks and the taxes, and you're going to trust your eyes.
Your research team found out a historical virus that's put in the road, and we're going to look at it there for a study.
After a long day, you're just doing the lab when an academic earthquake goes around and make electricity.
When the South Korean comes into action, it's going to serve your most insects: all the samples of the samples that were born.
It's all over the time, but if you can't admit, the light of light will be opened up in a lot and it's made out of a little bit of the air that's put in the air.
Without the horse, you're spending your "bus" and you're going to save the world.
The lab is a 160-grade fingerprint with a box in the north of the northern Kenya, and it's found in the South East.
Every single room is connected to the transparency causes it by acting air, and the virus is released in any room outside the techniques.
To invite it, you've got to go into every single room and reduce its self-concept.
But there's a coffee.
Because the security systems in the eye, once you're just going to win, you can't go out without acting the button, and once you're doing it, you can't go back to the room.
You're starting to record possible service on a piece of paper, but there's no train that allows you to invent without spending at least one room.
So how can you invent the virus in every room and survive to tell the story?
Stop here if you want to understand yourself.
More answer: Three more answer: 2 more answer if your first project is to try to record your possibilities on the roof, your idea is true.
It's a local source of the car problem called the Amazon Amazon of the 19 and William Robert.
The challenge of the path problem is to find if the data is there's an aircraft.
It's a concept that's in every point in it just once.
It's kind of a problem, that's called a whole NP, it's known to be in his voice when the graph is big enough.
Although every average solution can be profound in communities, we don't have a real conversation or create a way to find one, or to the number that one is there.
And we're not even sure it's possible for computers to find these kinds of solutions.
It's this animal to add a Titanist to the problem of the airport that you have to start and end with certain points.
But before you move a lot of graphic paper, you need to know that the real TV is not possible with these final points.
It's because the faces create a form of rainforest with a number of faces across the side.
Anyway with this trick, the climate trade that's starting and revealed in corporations is not possible.
Here's one way to understand why.
Think about Grand Darwin with a number of squares on the side.
Every trade will change between a black and a son.
These rates will also be a number of boundaries of events because a number of feet is a pair of pair.
So the Technology on the rapid that's starting in the black, there's going to be just a little bit.
And one that's just going to have to hide in the black.
However, in every rain with a number of posters, corporations are in the same color, so it's impossible to start and finish the climate traffic in the corporations.
You don't think you're not lucky, but if you're looking at a general and you're looking at a very important career.
It's true that as soon as you're spending the driver in their fake room, it's happy and you can't go back to it.
But there's one room that didn't be fair -- the box.
It means you can leave it once without acting the driver and repeat there when you've got one of these fingers.
The room I've made may be surprised by the air, but it's okay because you can invent the corner after the other visit.
The weird crisis gives you four options to a product, and a similar set of possibilities if you put this room before.
Obviously, you're going to expect a map in Pophilic, but after this is an axis of a privilege, you need a prosperity.
Maybe you need to take the last work to become a travel device.
The life of the microscope of the microscopic lab, Chiles are just a couple of short weeks.
It's compared to the road, that can live over 100 years.
Women and women are helping their lives after four years only, while satellites, the most valuable life in the world, can live 200 years and compassion.
Like most of the life creatures, most of the animals come in privacy after they got to sexual health, in the process called Chicaa.
But what's it actually aging?
The genes behind this process is ridiculous and complexity, but eventually, Congress has been caused by death and activity of cells.
When we're young, we're all the time sending cells to replace cells from fossil cells.
But when we're extended, the process is from the text.
In addition, adult cells are getting less good than young people.
It causes our bodies to transform, when the final result is disease and death.
But if it's always true, what's the big reason for aging agriculture and life's life in the background?
The answer is in a number of causes, including the environment and the size of body.
These can create a strong evolutionary pressure on animals to fit themselves, which eventually creates differences between the species in the process of aging.
Think about the cases of the Atlantic Atlantic and the Arctic, where Canada can live over 400 years, and the collective explanation also is going to live until the age of 500.
Perhaps most exciting in the ancient ocean is the anthropy of the Antarctic, which can survive over 10,000 years in cases.
In different environments like these, heart actions and rate of refugee materials.
Research cases that it's also exposing the process of aging.
So, the environment is made up of days.
When it comes to the size, often, but not always, big species have a long life of small species.
For instance, Philip or a lot more life than a lot, a dung, or Nigerian, they've got a relative advantage of years to fly and die.
Some small animals, like moves and boys, are also limited by their cells.
They're mostly built out of the cells that can't be part and transparent when they're moving, so their body's faster.
And the size is a strong evolutionary evolution in life.
More creatures are more important to texts.
Finally, for example, can't expect to survive more changes in nature.
So he evolved to grow and transform a larger speech, like an evolutionary mechanism against its extinction of life.
More animals, despite that, is better in previous corporations, and that's why they've got the virus of time to grow larger differences, and many times more often during their lives.
It's coming out of the general of the size of the size of the size of coffee, birds, birds, frozen, but in each of these cases, to live there's other characteristics that allow them to wind.
But there's still cases in which animals with similar genes, like size or environmental environments, except in completely different ways.
In these cases, genetic differences, like how the organisms are organisms for water, often the differences in life.
So I'm going to share all of these genes, which works in different choices, explains the states that you see in the living planet.
And what about us?
A human beings today have an average life of 71 years, which means that it's usually not close to the one of the most expensive life creatures.
But we're very good at our life system.
At the beginning of the 20th century, people were only 50 years old.
Since then, we've learned to move by control in many reasons of death, like environmental and engagement.
These causes, and other bees in life space, make us the only one in the world that control us natural.
Why do we make certain products or choose certain organisms?
These are questions that are always asking, and they don't have simple answers.
However, there's a tool that's helping companies explore this and similar questions, and it's called code groups.
By the '40s, a market study was particularly chemical and based on things like a trick and curiosity to track.
But it changed in the other world.
The Sologists Robert Robert and Paul Lesearch decided to look at how the extinction of war is affected by public.
Instead of asking many people direct questions with chemical answers, the studies have done personal interviews, sometimes in small groups, and they've lost them with more open faces.
More later, the method was affected by the primary industrial industry with objects, like a psychologist near Egeria Dartt, which was the first one of a code group.
This new method was a kind of inherent research that was focused on the bicycles and computers of people.
He can't say to markets what percent of the people are produced or a certain, but they can tell them more about the people who are lines, the reasons they're customers, and even the unaware of these reasons.
Instead of making products for businesses and skills, code groups will be reduced from the collection of new ideas to products and the bosss on a deeper understanding of the consumption of the consumption.
For example, early code groups have found that in Nigeria think of popular optimists at the same time, often, women had a much more effective effect than their homes in a car, so a career would draw her code to a direct cars for women.
And Dr. Dr. Twitter itself has been valuable groups of code to find out what girls want in the morning.
The result was the original bar.
So how do you work a group of code?
First of all, companies react between six to 10 transparency participants from the specific tricks to the research goals.
They can have children between five and seven, or teenagers who are designed to buy a new phone in the next three months.
It's often done through a professionals that are used by people's actions that have been used to participate in code groups for a river or a different corner.
Over the meeting, the participants respond to respond to different actions of the group, like to tell what you knew about a certain product, or what their emotional responses to the end.
They may also ask them to do a task that looks not about, like imagine products as animals in the gene.
The thought is that it can discover useful information on the emotional emotions that predict traditional questions may not go directly.
Over this basis, there are many possibilities.
In a code of code can be two managers or more, that maybe you're showing insects on a question, or a concept that would be a little bit of code with the other hand of the participants, to see how you can affect their answers.
And researchers can also watch the whole process through a unique mirror.
But even though they can provide a total structure, a code of code has limits, and one of the main is that the understanding of something can change it.
This principle is called the extension.
The answers that participants probably give the actions of researchers, social war from the end of the group, or just a quick speech that they're participating in a code.
And because studies use usually a little bit of a small and a specific environment, it's hard to move their cameras.
The inventions that researchers come to them in code groups are often in experiments and collecting information.
In these ways, they're looking for questions like some potential customers, and what price is ready to pay.
It's part of the process changes when technology works.
But code groups were actually left the same thing for decades.
Maybe when it comes to the big and important questions, you don't have to wait for people who are really interested in it.
You're going to be ready for a wall when a sudden, you feel worse in your head.
We've all experienced the training of uncomfortable, but would you ever be wondering what we're doing?
The average person is made dozen dogs a day.
They can get out of all of the reasons, including the response of corporations, yes, and even a few diseases.
And there's also worthy that affects no reason at all, or just about worse.
You lose your head now, right?
Anyway, let's take one of the hormones: insects.
When you're going to jump you, it's released to your body of materials that are called Grandma, which is what you're going to call.
This material, which is that we're a little bit of ethnic, a concept of historical, as a weapon that makes our surgery to go.
It enables a limited blood flow, which is helping to discover the response of the body's body's response to this freedom.
It's explaining the advantage, and that's the same reason for the actors can make your eyes move.
The histories also spread the nervous nerves that are out in the road, and that's why you're going to make you look at.
But it's a completely uncomfortable sense.
Actually, a lot of what we know is coming from the convenient research of worse in men.
Scientists have found that the genome signals are being transformed through a group of objects that are going to get in.
These nerves represent molecules that are called Navopopolic Pololina: that's active that's activated in the spinal cord to the brain, where it creates a sense of worse.
When we're looking at, our French effects on the skin causes a low level of chemistry that's based on the sense of the horse.
It's almost like the conversation, which creates the sense of compassion.
But is there an evolutionary goal to survive, or is it just a goal for us?
The leading theory is that our skin has evolved to be very sensitive for a moment, so we can deal with risks from the external world.
Think about it.
Our autonomous response is going to make anything happy that can be on our skin, like shooting roads, switch, or coffee plants.
It might explain why we don't feel worse in the body, like our cases, that are fresh from these external water, although imagine how many of it would be.
In some people, mistakes in the response of the response to all of this can make a rise that can actually move in their friends.
One extreme example is the psychological situation called France France accurate, where people believe that their bodies are full of instructions and parasites, that are happening everywhere and translating their skin, what makes them more and more.
Another phenomenon is called a flow of flow can happen in patients that have been active.
Because this surprise came so much in their nervous system, it's going to spend the terrible boundaries in the body and create a sense of the fossil that's not there.
Civil doctors now treat antibiotic and disorders.
In the fossil tables, most of you are used to reduce the fossil fuels, which is the patient's fabric.
It creates a illusion that's built in the brain to think that the red arm is made.
Unfortunately, it actually works.
Scientists are also looking for the genes that are responsible for worse, and they're reducing treatments and they're collecting the nerves of the road in the extreme cases.
If you have a worse that you can't get to, you feel like a personal genome, a screen.
The Italian Research wrote about a region in the genome where people were going to be done by being sold and worried about forever.
What's common to these animals?
More than you think.
Together with over 5,000 other species, they're green, or friends in the green parts.
All of the green are sophisticated, which means they have a spinal cord.
But mammals are built in other creatures in a common number.
It's including a hot person, a body hair or a prosperity, the capacity to go through reality, and their birds in space.
But despite their imagination, these creatures also have biological differences, and one of the amazing ones is how they're born.
Let's start with the most familiar, negative entrepreneurs.
This group is all of people, crops, dogs, jeales, and even satellites as patients, the biggest animals in the planet.
The third, a listener of a rich tissue in the blood, is connected to the hot wall to support the key.
The third is what you're talking about transparency in time.
It's directly directly to the blood region of whether, it's focused on magnitude materials and directly directly into the body of the connection, and it's also reducing its waste.
Twenty days can spend a lot more time inside the hole than other mammals.
Child satellites as patients, for example, spend almost a year in whether or not.
The third is reduced on the rise in life right until the night, when the TV is going to take and the right systems, the blood and the waste of Hollywood takes a code.
The size of about eight feet, a galaxy that's already able to predict.
He's going to get the next three months in the 225 pounds in a space if you're on and you're sick every day.
In the time, in Australia, you can find a second kind of green -- animals.
The babies of genes are so small and better when they're born that they've got to open in the pocket?
Take the coffee, one of the smallest chaos, which is only 18 million pounds at night, which is worth about 30 graphic graph.
Congress, a different church, a single baby in the size of the size of every time.
The baby's fabulous in the middle of the middle of three instructions of his mother, and then you have to fly into the chaos, where it's bringing 611 months into the next.
Even after the Congress goes up the previous gender, it's going to go back to the space.
Sometimes, it's just one of three babies who's an accident in them.
Congress can often support one time in the hot and another in the classroom.
In no good situations, Congress can stop their diversity.
When it's happening, it can make two different types of space, one to the new, and another to its big body.
The word from the word comes from the word from the left, which is a little crazy because while Congress represents a protein in in their classes, they don't actually have their hands.
So my favorite example, the third example, and maybe the most crazy example of Lada Bennia.
There's been centuries of my daughter, but today there's only five: four species of the president and the Rwin.
The name is a black guy who's treated to develop the only one where they're using the culture, refugees, and the task.
Like birds, crops, fish, dinosaurs, and others, these species are dragging in a place for the door and animals.
They're going to take a train, and when they're slamming, they're going to be convenient in the body whether they're big enough to eat themselves.
Despite the trees and other violence that we're going to get more uncomfortable, like the networks of the Brothern's networks, the source of the Arabic School, and the Arabic School has on their legs, they're in fact, mammals.
It's because they're sharing the characteristics of mammals, and evolutionary connections to the rest of the group.
Whether a third, boys are fun, or my husband, every one of these holes and they'll be unique to learning, how strange you're going to be, have been able for thousands of years to bring new life and direction to the green planet.
I'd like to tell you the story about this time that I've almost been scared, and I've gone to a mammogram of a red light.
It's a day after I've finished design. I'm going to need a budget.
And what a guy comes with a red left, and it starts to look at my objects.
It's a creation of art that I've created.
And it turns out that it's in the city alone for the night, in Tuesla is reduced before he's coming to the "."
So I invite him to go out to my house and he told me about his viewer to do a change in the world.
It begins to be later, and I'm going to be quite beautiful.
When I'm talking to the math, I'm doing mistakes and ask him, "So where are you going to get the night?"
And he brings the situation when he says, "In fact, I don't have a place to the window."
And I think, "No right!"
What am I going to do?
We all know it, right?
Do I have to offer this guy?
But the moment I met him. He's going to say he's going to join the United States, but I don't really know if he's going to join or's "and I don't want to find myself a little bit of a bed."
It's in the "small!"
And then I ask myself to say, "Hey, I've got a crazy sector that you can play on my window."
And my voice in my head says, "Well, what?"
At that night, I'm sitting in a bed, I'm going to look at the case and think, "Oh my God, what did I do?
Social return to me in the window!
What if it's psychiatric? "
My restaurant goes down to this, which I'm lucky from the bed from the bed on my heart rate for a door, and we're going to take the door of the bedroom.
It turns out it wasn't psychiatric.
We've left about since.
And the art of art that it's made from me in a car depends on his classroom; it's a teacher now.
It was my first wind experience, and it was completely changed my investment.
Maybe the people I learned to hide as strangers were actually friends who were waiting for them.
The idea for people on foreign citizens became natural to me and when I went to San Francisco, I took me the extinction.
So we jump two years forward.
I'm confident, almost completely disabled, my partner to the train and the river goes.
And then I find out that comes to the city and design design, and all of these are full.
And I've always described their fear to the kitchen is the gift of creativity.
So here's what I'm offering to my best friend and my month and my new sister for a choice, Richard: "Hey, I thought about doing a little bit of fun -- to make our dialogue to the staff, to offer young people who are coming to the city, in a song, a little bit of a little bit of work, a little bit of
Ha! "
We've built a basic website, and so we've been born "Alex.com."
Three lucky organisms were going to move on a fingerprint in 20 dollars on the effect.
But they liked it, and also we are.
I'm surprised, to the corruption of the corruption and the Nigerian that we've made was completely different because we've made them for our farmers.
We took them to adventures around the city, and we've been reduced from the last wall, and we've been working on the bank, Britain and I've looked at it.
Would we now find friends and listening, also to make a career?
The wheelchair started to move.
My president for a choice, Next in Chile, joined as an engineering engineer.
And we sat together to see if we can turn it into a business.
Here's what we've got to do in the games: "We want to build a site where people can push photos of their most intuitive spaces, their restaurant, their diabetes -- from the fingers that you're usually leaving out of a rain when people come to you.
And then, through the Internet, they're going to be repeated back back back to come to their home!
It would be great! "
[]]]]]] []]]]] []]]]]]
It didn't happen.
Nobody who's a fabulous person who can't invest in the service that can help help the people's homes.
Why?
Because we're all teaching children, that strangers are curiosity.
Well, when you take a problem, you're back to what you know, and everything we really knew is design.
In the school of art, you're learning that design is much more than the mirror and the feeling of something -- it's an outcome experience.
We've learned to do this for objects, but here we wanted to build a training training in a political scale between people who've never been killed.
Can design make it happen?
Is it possible to design trust?
I want to give you a sense of trust that we wanted to get.
I've got a three seconds experiment that's going to push you out of your current region.
If you're in the building, you're going to have a variety.
Okay, I need you to take your mobile.
Now, when your mobile is outside, I'm going to ask you to click his eyes.
Now let's give your open code to a person who's sitting to you.
It's a little bit of this small inner sense that you feel right now -- Laughter) It's exactly what you feel for the first time they open their hands.
Because the only thing is your mobile is your house.
People don't just see your consciousness, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.
Now, how does it feel to keep the open of someone?
Most of us feel very responsible.
So you feel most of the farmers when they're going to come up with a house.
And it's our society at all can exist.
By the way, in the way, who's the mobile mother's mobile?
[]]]]]]]]]] You can please switch out on Twitter that he's going to go to the president?
And so you can return the mobile.
Now, after you've experienced the training challenge in front of us, I'm going to share with you some things we've discovered over the way.
What if we get one small thing in the design of this experiment?
What if your daughter was the first one to tell you the name, where is it living, what are his children or his heart?
Imagine he had 150 curiosity of people who said, "He's great to keep phones don't go!"
But now, how would you feel about a mobile device?
And it turns out, the Minstein system is a very, very good system is a central camp in building trust.
And we didn't really understand it for the first time.
People are hard to leave bad actions.
In the end, we've learned to wait until the wind and the corner left the response before we sat them.
Now, here's a discovery from the week.
We've done a common study with Stanford, where we've looked at people's neighbors's features in someone on their imagination at age, from the universe and geography.
The experiment was invented, not surprising, that we prefer people who care about us.
The more someone is different, the more we're going to think about it.
It's a natural civilization.
But what was interesting is what's happening when you're add to a regulation, in this case, with curiosity.
If you get less than three victims, something doesn't change.
But if you get more wealth, it's all changes.
Monta's high selection.
Technology can actually help us move on one of the most important privacy we've learned.
We've also learned that to build the right amount of trust requires the right amount of important.
It's what happens when the wind sends the first message to the corner.
If you take a little bit too little, for example, "Hey," the libraries go down.
And if you go too much, like, "I have problems with my mom."
But there's a sense that's exactly true, like, "I love your art in your house."
So how are we designing for the right device?
We're using the size of the box to offer the right text and the right text and the president to encourage the join.
We've been wondering with all our society on the hope that with the right design, people will move on their option to fear.
What we didn't understand is actually how many people were ready and forced to give up this option.
It's a graph that shows our model rate.
There are three things here.
The first one -- the amount of lunch.
The second is the effort of our team.
The third is the damage of a need that doesn't happen before.
The things were quite beautiful.
Of course, sometimes the things don't expect.
Egyptian has already been caused for reasons, and they've been reduced in the water.
Many of their organisms are conducted in the rain.
At the beginning of the way, I was the customers, and these conversations came directly to my mobile.
I was in the front of the trust.
And there's nothing worse about these conversations, I can even think about them.
And the fair of someone's daughter, was and the largest instrument to continue to improve.
For our minds, from 123 million degrees that we've ever seen, less than a quarter of a percent were in real eyes.
It turns out that the trust is funny.
And when the trust works well, it can be completely cool.
We've had a guarantee in an organ in Amazon, and we've got a heart attack.
It took it to the hospital.
You've got his blood to open.
Let me show you his crisis.
[] "A great house to the pixels that are built to the heart muscle.
It's a beautiful area and it's a direct approach to the best hospital.
It's a switch and it's going to become always a second for the sky that's going to take your life without reminding you.
They're going to take you to the hospital in their car when you go, they're going to stay in the right room when the doctor's doctor's going to make you a beautiful surgery.
They don't want you to feel individual, they bring you books to read.
And they're going to stay in their house for other diseases without having you.
It's fair. "
But of course, not all the wind is like this.
But this context that's going to have to do is exactly what's called "The CO2."
When I heard this moon, I have to admit that he's completely invented me.
How do collaboration and business work together?
So let's move: It's about training.
But if you read it just "economics" it wasn't perfect.
The chicken economy is a trade where there's a conversation to human happiness.
People participate something themselves, and it changes everything.
To me, the intervention of the day is like a faster food -- it's effective and party, on local and authority.
What if you're going to do was like a fantastic investment of local experiences?
What if anywhere where you visited was a central market of local local markets that offer you to go together in the boss in cities, in the neighborhoods that you didn't know about Kayan.
Or do you learn to the spring of a five stars?
Today, the homes are designed around the idea of privacy and privacy.
What would happen if the power was designed for a complete collaboration?
How would it look?
What if cities would have been exposing the previous culture?
I'm seeing a future of foreign cities, which brings us a community and connection instead of measure and disruption.
In South Korea, in the city of City, they really started it.
They've changed the opposite of hundreds of governments so that they've been translated by the city.
They're listening to students who are looking at a place to live, and they're dealing with fossil trees, they've left their house.
And they've made a bit of what you're going to go back to the next generation of oil companies in a cooperation.
The West, just in our choices 75,000 people in the century and one of countries will take in the homes of strangers or get these to their homes.
It's obvious that it's not as crazy as we've learned.
We didn't invest here anything new.
The earthquake exists since and never.
There were many other cities like our own.
So why is our musician at the end?
Freebruary and trust, I learned that you could take the components of trust, and reduce this goal.
Technology can overcome the most basic privacy of "strangers" are a curiosity. "
And it's amazing to me.
It's enabled me the brain.
I think about it every time I see a similar mystery.
So we know that design doesn't take all the problems of the world.
But if it can help with this problem, if it can make a small effect, it makes me identify, what can we design now?
Thank you.
Thank you.
The evolutionary of the species of animals.
Can you worry about what you look like?
If your answer is transparency, you're right.
Even though the extreme effect of the bird doesn't look particularly strange, it's using a strange device, complicated patterns in the boss to transform.
We're seeing other amazing organisms in insects, mammals, crops, roads, roads, roads, and even fossil.
It seems to be not evolved faster and more diverse generations from those who are heard in culture.
On the surface, it makes sense, because evolution works through diabetes.
When a living is more sick, her genes are common.
And since the species and the species are the tool of the animal to culture, every improvement they're going to have an immediate effect.
And yet, what's the benefit in local areas that look like this?
After all, the species of the species looks simple.
President goes a little bit of an arm and he gets it and put it into a series.
Paul Portugal on the roof and the democratic structure on the kitchen needs to stop every animal.
But it's not what we see.
The pencil of the chimpanzees, for example, doesn't really look like a palpa, more like the San San Ford School.
And it's the prosperity of extinction that's similar to something you'll find in a book of Dr. Street.
Research all of the animal plants, my favorite is very complex things, it seems that they're too complicated to do a task.
It's because my favorite doesn't just wake up and get an arm.
A lot of males use the corn also as a repeat device, like the fingerprinting.
Some species in South Americans, males have a spider and a graph on the penis, which produces a song through the right body when they're pushing.
You think that if you're a contrast of the president from this extraordinary movie, it's going to be able to remember being the father of their fingers.
In this way, the genes of the famous musicians spread, which leads to a quick evolution of insects.
Like, for some beetles, there are two small tons to the finger.
While the fusion, they'll be smart, they're going to go, or they're going to take on the kitchen with them.
And a couple of animals are scared, like women and sleep, use the rocket card on the left side of the penguin to create a sense of the horizon.
But how can the female really choose whether it can apply them just after the fish?
Here's where you're going to go into the action of the nation.
In fact, it's different from the transformation, and the Henry Murkey is taking the test.
For instance, in some fabrics, the Amanda knows that they're going to reduce the arm between different males as they've been attracted.
Soldiers use their faces to the region, and we're going to reduce their instruments, they're two reasons that the species have evolved to be so complex.
But there's more, because the species are also where the species works.
The interaction of the Kenya's interaction is not the best if it's going to reduce its effects with the best and the best engagement of genetic diversity between its fingerprints.
Remember, on the other hand, these are bad news.
For him, it's going to be the best if it's going to use his arm to discover all of its options.
So we're seeing parts of the violence in a evolutionary weapon to keep control.
A black spider has a frog that you can have a prosperity that's built in the Amazon and remained the ideas of the teenagers, and you're reminded by a completely puncture of the ridiculum in using a fraction of insecure cells directly into its own cancer.
And in order to move on it, we've evolved a concept of demand.
How many kinds of feedback, the presidents developed a completely new Italy in their right hand where the muscles usually come to them.
It enables an unprecedented precedure with their brothers.
And the nurses of Brothers are made like a restaurant in the argument so that when the bridge goes to the long penis against his argument, and it doesn't agree, everything she needs to do is take her arron and jump her arron and fell out.
So, the species are so different, not just to build us, but because in any species, they're the result of Texas and the brain of the species that's going on from millions of years and continue more than a million years.
In 1996, Mr. Jerson France got a full of themselves that he couldn't recognize.
Torn Ford reminded him Aria, but the arm objects were affected on a bigger animal, a animal of three meters.
As you think it's a huge kind of huge, and it's not known for the North American, Jerson's reminded the studies of Los Angeles and Calk because it's kind of crazy.
But the objects in the box of Jerson didn't come from malaria.
They've come from a giant designer that was fear.
The history of the history of history has been invented for the first time about 35 million years ago.
And dozens of species have been living around the North, Center and South America, although other ancient creatures like a text and a giant media.
The number of background nerves, like the corporate sector, were as a crowd, but many of them were devastated.
The nerve of John France, Mexico, who's about tons, and it's been very small to a threat, which was able to get to the weight of a tone, a crowd of a cat.
They went to the Iran in the forests and the Sanna when they use their fingerprints and their refugees to explore plants and jump on trees, while they're a season, roads, and they're in San historical French.
Actually, unfortunately, the giant bank may not have been in October today.
A smaller animals couldn't slow the fossil graph, but the nerves are, and they've made the boss boss everywhere.
The backgrounds that were made for millions of years, but before about 10,000 years ago, they began to fit in the same similar to other big boundaries in the Western office.
Scientists think that giant scans have been reduced by the ice of the ice and in the cell, or by stations with other species, maybe human beings, who have come to the region in a time where most of the nerves began to be afraid.
Some of the smaller nerves that have survived and made the trees.
Today, there's six species that live in the forest of the center of Central and South America.
To spend this day on this trees is a good way to get crazy, and there's a tool to eat.
But this dialogue has privacy.
Other animals produce energy products and use this energy to move, to keep their own heat, to reduce their ancestors, and all the other costs that need to survive.
But tools don't know a lot of energy, and the energy that they do do do is it's hard to produce.
Most of the plants of plants add to the lower energy emissions like parasion and nuclear.
But nerves, mostly these three fingerprints, they're focusing on nearly the same way.
They've developed very, very, very useful strategies to deal with this definition.
First of all, they expect the energy that they're producing from their food.
Design has a fingerprint in the dozens that's given to a third of them, and they're able to spend five days to seven days, or even weeks, in a long time.
The other piece of light is to use energy as well as possible.
One way to do that is, of course, not to move a lot.
Desians spend most of their time in the chemistry, contract, or sleep.
They're going to go through the trees just a week to make toilets.
When genes move, it's not really fast.
It's going to take yourself about five minutes into a normal street in the neighborhood.
This artist approach to life means that customers don't need a lot of muscles.
In fact, they have about 30 percent less than a muscle of other animals in their body.
Polines also use energy forces to keep their heat from their body temperature because of their body temperature can change five degrees of gas, less than most of them.
The physical and behavioral fabricate the energy of the bone, or the rate of materials.
For those three fingers, there's the highest refugee of materials in the middle of all green.
The Canada is the other one on the list, and my sisters are in the third place.
It's a slow mood motion that allows yourself to switch in the animal arms in the trees of the trees.
But it also became the nerves themselves to a great price of other organisms, including alcohol, which represent a little bit of the secret, and maybe even a joke.
Sols may not be huge, but it doesn't do them less amazing.
It's a good day to be a detail.
Again and his four friends, in Bertt, Robert, Darl, and Aley found the same: A with 100 meters.
But now, they've got to reduce the discovery to the physical code.
As a chicken, I'm going to offer how to make the fingers.
So, every detail, including Amazon itself, bad or not.
If the vote goes, or if there's equality, the fingerprints are made by the plan.
But if most of the events don't, Alex has to jump out of the boat, and in the text becomes a cancer.
So, in a detail to offer a new dream and all of the details that make it happen again.
If this plan is invisible, it's also jumping out of the boat and Robert takes his place.
This process goes back, when the fingerprint goes to Nelson and then to this until one of the strengths get out or left just one detail.
Obviously, every detail wants to stay in life as they get the most identified you can.
But you know, nobody's on the surface, so they can't cooperate from the head.
And since they're the details of their hands, if they all think they're going to get the same amount in any way, they're going to happen that the chicken will jump, just for the chain.
Finally, every great detail in the diabetes and knows that the other ones are also.
What's a dream of Amazon has to offer to worry about life?
Remember the video here to think about it yourself!
More answer: Three more answer: 2 more answer: 1 if we go after our intuition, it looks like we had to try to fear the other details with most of the golden to define his program to get.
But it turns out that he could succeed much more than that, why?
Like we said, the details all know that each other is a curiosity from the top line.
So when each one comes out, they don't just think about the current station, it's about all the possibilities of the road.
And because the stairs are known by the head, every one can predict how the other people have come in any situation and bring their vote in the face.
Because for the last night, it has the most results to voice, so let's start by looking at her thinking process.
Her idea is to go back from the last possibility when it's just and let's stay.
Don't, of course, to keep all the golden and the vote of this will not be enough to get out of it, so let's want to avoid the situation in every decade.
Now we're going to go to the previous method with three details remain and spread.
Everybody knows that if she wouldn't sound, the surprise goes to Nelson, who would get all the globe while it doesn't get anything.
So in order to make the vote of this, Robert just need to offer it a little bit more than a piece, one metaphor.
Because it's driving its support, Robert doesn't need to offer to nothing at all.
And what if there are four details?
As a chicken, in a planet still has one other voice to make his plan for it.
He knows that Daniel wouldn't want the decision to survive, so he's going to come to a mammogram for one meat for his support without offering anything to this or Robert.
Now we've come back to the original event with all the details.
When you're wearing all the other studies, I'm going to know that if it's your daily, the decision comes to the planet, and it's going to be bad news to Robert and Lady.
So he offers one nature to each other, and he said 98 pounds itself.
In Darwin and Darwin don't, but Robert and Alexis is wrong, in a contrast, worse that the altrum would be worse for them.
The details game including some interesting ideas from the game theory.
One is the idea of a common knowledge where every person knows what the other people know and use it to predict their thinking.
And the last piece is an example of a weight weight, where every player knows the strategy of any other player and trade.
Even it could lead to a worse result to everyone who's special to cooperate, not a single device that's going to make a strategy.
So it seemed to keep most of the golden, and the other details might have to find better ways to use these magnitude solutions, like to change this astronomy code.
So a couple of years ago, I made something really sad, or how many would say something really beautiful.
I wanted to Congress.
For years, I've been on a joke behind the dogs in politics as a piece of money, as a female, but at my heart, I've always wanted to run.
The Congress Congress was in my conference since 1992.
It's never stopped in the train, and no one has never been reduced in French for democracy.
But in my head, it was my way to make a difference, to invest in Texas.
The amazing, with that, they told a very different story.
My examples told me that it's kind of crazy to run, which wasn't a way that I could wait.
But I wanted all that, and in 2012, I became a device in Congress in New York City.
I've been invited that we're going to win.
I had the support of New York City Nigeria, House Richard Jersey took pictures of my election day, and CNBC called him one of the most stressed in the country.
I've put money out of all I've mentioned, including the Indians who were so happy that Indian brains wanted.
But the day of the election, the studies were right, and I got only 19 percent of the sounds, and the same data that I said that I was a political planet now said that I was at 1.3 million dollars on 6,31 molecules.
Don't do the math.
It was a cure.
Now, before you get the wrong idea, it's not a talk about the importance of failure.
And it's not about learning.
I tell you the story of how I wanted to Congress because I was 33 and it was the first time in my life I did something that was really real, where I didn't worry about being perfect.
And I'm not alone: So many women I'm talking to them tell me that they're going to go to the careers and accumulate that they know they're going to be good at them, they know they're going to be perfect in them, and it's not a plan.
Most of the buildings are going to avoid risks and so on.
We've taught us to live a beautiful life, play safe, get just high seas.
The boys, on the other hand, teachers to play a coffee, get high, sand into the weapons, and then jump with the head forward.
And by which they're going to be adult, whether they're dealing on the rise or even inventing the children's children's children, they learn to take another risk.
They're scared of it.
Many times we said in the Chicasin, no one had ever been taken in the customers if you had two tons of roads.
In other words, we've given our buildings to be perfect, and we're growing our buildings to be true.
Some people worry about the National Center, but I, I'm worried about our courage.
Our economy, our society, we're just curious because we don't grow our differences to be real.
The courage of courage is why women don't stop enough in SSM, in the Congress, in Congress, and less than anywhere you look at.
In the '80s, the psychological psychological psychologist was looking at what a couple of children had taken in the task that was too hard for them.
She found that in the clouds were killed to the more.
The more IDA was higher, there was a higher environmental environment that they were going.
The boys are building, on the other hand, found a hard material as a challenge.
They found it as a challenge.
There's been a higher environmental environmental environmental environments.
What happens?
Well, at the level of her classroom, girls have better succeeding in any subject, including math and scientists, so it's not a question of ability.
The difference is how the buildings and the girls are going to challenge.
And it doesn't just play in the classroom.
DP's research found that a man would have been reduced to work if it's only about 60 percent of privacy, but women, women will only be reduced if they're falling 100 percent.
100 percent.
This research is usually used as trees, well, women need a little bit more self-security.
But I think it's the dots that women were taught to survive for the violence, and they're too careful.
And even if we've got language, even when we're going to come in, this foreign forests that have made us take less risks in our careers.
And that's how 6,000 of these possibilities now are important and technology, women are left behind, and that means that our economy remains behind all the innovations and the problems that women were open if they were to be real instead of being perfect.
So in 2012, I started a company to teach girls to write code, and what I found was that I learned to teach them to write a code to be real.
As a code, it's an unfinished process of trying to get the right dots in the right place, sometimes something like a simple object that's doing the difference between failure and failure.
It's a great code, and then it's spinning, and it's a lot of times requires a lot, a lot of experiences until the magic moment when you're trying to build a wake of life.
It requires the device.
It requires inevitable.
We're imagine in our program that our victims are unable to succeed, not to be perfect.
Everybody's plenty of the girls tell me the same story.
Over the first week, when the victims learn how to write code, learning would call her and say, "I don't know what code to write."
The teacher is looking at her screen, and you'll see a lunch.
If she didn't know better, she would think her learning had spent the last 20 minutes just identify in the screen.
But if it's a little bit about a few times, it's going to see that her learning was writing code, and then you're looking at it.
She was born, she came close, but she didn't do it right.
Instead of showing the process that she did, she didn't show anything.
Friday or nothing.
It turns out that our girls really are good at writing code, but it's not just enough to teach them to write code.
My friend's attention to my friends, which is a professor at the University of Korea and teachers from Guina tell me about hours of his office with students of the computer science.
When the teachers work with a task, they're going to come and say, "France, there's not true in my code."
The girls will come and say, "The doctor, there's something wrong with me."
We need to start making social implications, but we need to look at it with girls's communities that can build to know that they're not alone.
Because it's more powerful, it's not to fix a teacher system.
I can't say how many women say to me, "I'm afraid to get the hand, I'm afraid to ask a question, because I don't want to be the only one that doesn't understand, the only one that's fighting.
When we teach victims to be real and we have a support network that reveals them, they will build amazing things, and I see it every day.
Take, for example, two of our high school students that we've built a game called the Iran -- yes, MIT -- to fight against the Amazon of the region and Science in the games.
Or the Syrian French who showed her love to her new country to build an effect to help Americans get to the vote.
Or 16 years old, an algorithm to help identify whether cancer is that President or Mumber, which is that it can save my life because it has cancer.
It's just three examples of thousands, thousands of victims that were taught to be wrong, that they've learned to try, that they've learned to be right.
And whether they're going to become a programmer or go to the next Clinton or the next day, they don't take their dreams.
And these dreams have never been more important to our country.
For the American economy, for every economy to grow, to really new, we can't leave half of the population.
We need to teach our buildings to feel comfortable, and we need to do it now.
We can't wait for them to learn how to be real as I did when I was 33 years old.
We've got to teach them to be real in schools and early in their career, when it's the biggest potential to affect their lives and other people's lives, and we need to show them that they love and get them not because they're perfect but because they're real.
And so I need every one of you to say to every young boy that he knows -- your sister, your sisters, your colleagues, your customers -- feel comfortable, because when you're teaching girls to be perfect, and we're helping them reduce it, we're going to build a movement of young women that they're real and better for each other.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Ray, thank you.
It's so powerful that you have.
You've got food. I'll tell me how it's going.
How many girls are involved in your program?
Rather Raji: Yeah. So in 2012, we learned 20 girls.
This year we're going to teach 40,000 girls in all 50 countries.
And this book is really powerful, because in the year, it's been finished in a computer science only 7,500 women.
Like, the problem is so bad that we can do this kind of change quickly.
CA: And you're working with some of the companies in the room, which are reduced by your program?
RG: Yeah, we have 80 partners, Twitter and Facebook for IBM to Center French for School, I mean, every company there.
And if you don't expect, I'm going to find you, because we need all of a minute company that's designed in their office.
CA: And you've got some stories of these companies that when you're taking more of the aggressive food to the agenda, good things happen.
RG: Things are going to happen.
I mean, I think it's crazy for me to think about the fact that it's now 85 percent of all the consumers have been done by women.
Women use social media at 600 percent more men.
We're on the Internet, and we need to build the companies of a price.
And I think that companies have involved, and they have amazing women that are part of the agency, they're amazing things, and we see it every day.
CA: Rather, you see the response. You're doing a very important job.
All the community leaves you. More power for you.
Thank you. RS: Thank you.
Thank you.
Have you ever wondered what's going to happen to the resources, like Darwin, after you wear it?
A drug that's about your definition can treat your head, a pair of pain, or a coffee.
But how does it come to a place where it needs to get?
It's a traffic printing in your blood system, it's going to go through your body's body to do the job before it's going to be treated by organs and molecules that's going to go to the train and reduce back materials.
This process begins in your potential system.
You're going to say you've had a terrible ball for a pain.
Within minutes, the ball begins to flow in your extinction of the wall.
The Neanderthal is moving into the printer and then through the wall into the blood network.
These blood vessels are referred, which is made the blood, and everything that's in it, to work.
The next step is to go through the shape.
When the person and the molecules of the medicine where they move through the blood vessels in the village, anthropians try to respond with the extraordinary molecules to train them.
The green molecules of action, which is called metaphors, maybe not more effective for power as resources.
At this point, most of the Japanese does his way through the shadow without a minute.
He continues his journey outside the road, through parents, into the blood system of the body.
And half an hour after you put the ball, some of the Europe has already come to the blood flow.
So the blood is moving through all of the gene and the friend, including the heart, the brain, the tools, and help the worker.
When the virtual molecules come to a place where the fingerprint responds, they're able to buy specific molecules that they're part of the pain response.
It's used as resources, like normal, extending to create components that help the body live as a pain.
When we're more and more and more molecules in a text, the effect that you're going to have the fingerprint, and it's going to be used in about an hour of about 10 to two.
So the body begins to train the Japanese in activity, when the understanding of a half hours on average.
When the virtual molecules are separated from their goals, they're going to put them back again.
When they're repeated to work, another small part of the general generations of the Europe has become the telescopes, that at the end of some of the instruments for the cells.
Halloa's respected to the bodies continue on the rate of about one person's disease, as it's in a little bit more than a drug's motor and a particular part of the body.
These basic components are similar in any drug that you take through the process, but the short of the process and the drug that makes the way into the blood flow is changing on the drug, the person, and the way the drug is going to live.
The hormones of the medicine can be used, but they're based on the basis of the population that doesn't represent any consumption.
And it's important to do the design.
If it's too low, the drug doesn't work.
If it's too high, the drug and its neutrons can be toxic.
It's true for every drug.
One of the patients who's most difficult to do with design, is children.
Because the way they're focusing on drugs are changing quickly, like their body.
For instance, an anthropologic that's convenient drugs are changing very change during the babies and death.
And it's just one of many genes.
genetics, age, transparency, disease, and even luck, affects the advantage of medicine in the body.
In the future, restaurant DNA tests may be able to demand with drugs that will give your own personal activity and make others, but in the next time, the best to read the content or the doctor or the doctor or the doctor, and take the implications of the convenience.
Over the end of a long day in the forest in a restaurant search for adult and a sea, the sacrifice and the wind that's driving itself in 72 times.
But before we showed his life, it was going into his face.
He's going to wait up and it's living it, and that's how we discovered it.
At least, this is how the Olympic numbers.
In fact, she didn't expect the noise, but the story of change, the Amazonian reality of agriculture, offers the importance of the future.
Social architects show that the first time came from 6,000 years ago, or 1,500 years ago that the prices have built the big details of this.
The Chinese version is the same kind of growing around the world today, but in a way, it's very different.
It's been conducted or a bone of a gene with a gene of genes.
And it turned out from every game only 1,500 years ago, when people realized that the liquid of heat and conversations can create a complicated, and a variety of the green tools.
After hundreds of years of studying the convenience, the standard became: switch it, put it in a neutra, to look at it into the boss, to click it in the water, and to create a production called Mumba, or Mexica.
Mexica became so popular that has evolved a unique Chinese culture.
It was that if the books and a poem, the favorite game on the walls, and a material for artists.
They'd invent photographic images in the coffee, just like art collected that you've seen in the coffee today.
In the 19th century, during Tang Tang, we're going to return the first device to Japan.
The face has developed their own uniform around her, which has led to the retirement of the beautiful TV.
And in the 14th century, during the Hong King, the Syrian Research changed the standard from the road to the road to me free.
At the same time, China was still an infant of the world's life in the world, what you've put it into one of the current mammograms, together with a platform and death.
It gave China a lot of power and economic effect, when it's spread around the world.
This expansion really started around the beginning of the 20th century, when the Netherlands brought to Europe in big cultures.
There's the pipes to the memory of the Korean Mumba, a Portugan woman, who's been reduced to popular popularies in the English English, when Nica came to you in 161.
At the same time, Britain was in the restaurant of her physical impact and reduced to a new genetic force.
And when Britain grew up, the thing that was spread around the world.
Unfortunately, in Europe, it's in Europe, it's at a high speech that's 10 times from the box, and it's still growing just in China.
The trade trade was so transparent that the rise of the world's richer in the world, the Central School, was born out of the big walls between Western societies.
Everybody started to bring her to the first Europe, to define the walls.
First of all, Britain will tell why about all of this Chinese animal in the collection.
When it got too fun, they invited to go back to another material, optimism.
It's created a public health problem in China, when people have come up with them.
And then in 1839, a man of the teacher's sister on his wife's president to have a huge sophistication of opinion, as the extension against the effect of Britain on China.
It's an action that's made for the first opinion between the two violence.
The streets went through all the Chinese beach to 1842, when Chile School sat on Najing Hong Hong Hong Long Long, and he put the trade in the conditions not good.
The war decided the global class of China for more than a hundred.
The Middle East Indian company also wanted to be able to grow her in itself, and continue to his market.
So they asked the Benney Robert Richard Chile to the Nigeria in the interest.
He's going to make himself a certain journey through the range of China, and at the end of the healthcare and working in Los Angeles, India.
Over, the wind continues to spread, and it's helped to get the rid of the girl's season as a daily day.
Today, it's the second game that's most popular in the world, after water, and it's the extinction of Turkey, until the 20th century, there's almost the same amount of ways of making a program, as a number of cultures on the bus.
What's shared to my favorite music from a Pacific Frankland and the ancient friends?
Not a lot.
So why are they both known as toilet?
Is it a strange, or a deeper connection between the reality?
The story begins in the ancient future.
When the Israeli Egyptian came up, she was in front of the parties and reducing the population of nanocial population over the Golden.
The most powerful people were the German people who were known as the toilets that were used by two privacy groups, the astronomers and astronomers.
While some of the Germans remained an artist of Rome, the Egypt to other people into the Iranian military.
When the Rocial Foundation came to the two, these satellites that were going to have a big role in the gene and the inner power.
In the 20th century, the interviews of a refugee that was reduced by a soldier called Einsteel to reduce Rome and pushed the Western Western walls.
Ouvian and his astronomer's astronomer's astronomy remained a technique under the Egyptian Western Western School and put on the Amazon.
But the Western government will never be one again.
Her control regions were reduced by the economies and other Germans that were built in the local cultures, although many of their levels are still on the map.
It was the end of the Central and the beginning of what many of them call the Middle East.
Despite the famous culture has never been lost, her effect has gone down and new art agencies, which has been focused on religious and religious and religion instead of corruption and autism.
This explanation has evolved to the atmosphere with the building of a student's student in France in 137.
Social networks, privilege, and big windows have done the structure that's more sophisticated.
It's proposed the open and its description instead of the walls and the fabric buildings of Kenyan buildings.
Over the next few days, it became a model to grow across Europe.
But options change.
With the extension of the web of the Italian Atlantic and the ancient Western, the last style started to show a relative gene.
Like you've been sitting in September 15, "Life's life," George William Wardy was the first one to describe it as an artist, the reduction of the men who were thinking about as much as the cultural culture.
The name is remained, and at the end, it became the light of the Middle Eastery at all, with the reduction of the welfare, to the photos, and spread.
But the time is scared, and so what I thought was going to be my face.
In the 16th century, a period of time called the Amazon came, which led the scientific concept over everything.
Unfortunately, autonomous agents like her and Soviet were looking at the Iranian fingers of natural guns and boundaries.
And that's how my sistant word got a new use to describe a final January that's made a more potential of privacy.
The moon was used for the first time by the hormones and to get his restaurant from 1964 "Turkey" as "to the general and the general atmosphere.
Many of the elements of the training became a typical component that was inspired to the babies and many movies from a bird that they were born.
The ladies would be able to serve and film up to the 1970s when a new musical musician came up.
Thanks that were taken from artists like Wott and Andrew Antarctica, British French groups, like John Virgin, in the Olympic, in the Amazon, and the list, to put words from the Guinean and Sanderthals with the House of Vietron, and I'm an ambord,
By the beginning of the '80s, to make these kinds of fossil components by music content, and the popular component of the style that's made it very important to big, big and MTV companies.
And today, despite attention and the negative tricks of the media, chemical music and optimistic continues as a powerful cultural phenomenon.
They've also joined to give Januans, like a toilet, a female, a sister, and even an academic.
The history of the word's genetic word's motivated by years of motor motor motions for culture, repeat that become economies, to the networks that are very, very rapid, to the artists that find beauty in the walls.
Every step looks like a kind of revolution and engagement of civilizations into the past to redesign the hope.
In 1898, Mary and Ford Frank discovered the imagination.
Because there's a argument that it's got foreign properties, a restaurant has been collected for poor, drugs, water, and food.
With a golden green and the bubble, it's used it as well as beauty and techniques.
Just in the middle of the 20th century, we've brought the effective effects of a restaurant as an academic material on its beautiful communities.
Unfortunately, Derek is not the only pencil in the past, it seems to be unusual or useful, but later it turned out as a category.
It's the invention of this invention of three colors and philosophers that we used for a long time to take ourselves and the things that we create: white, green, green.
We've got a story begins in nature.
There's been in the fourth century before the camp, the ancient Greeks were used as a fire to create the bone of the weapon that we know today.
What is the problem?
It's a direction of direction in the human body, and it's coming to the blood, to the quality of the quality, and the independent tissue.
When it comes to the nervous system, it's an illustrated, and it's an extended to the previous code of Syrian, what causes an instrument to learning to a high pressure.
And yet the use of these toxic refugees is going to go beyond transparency and civilizations.
Hollyn was the only collective choice to the nature of a gene or a temperature to the 19th century.
In order to create the color, artists were telescopes of fire to fight, and that's how we're exposed to the most powerful struggle.
It's the modern use of Pacific has made a phenomenon called the Kikolic Valley, or what we know now as the noise of the dog.
The artists who worked with our philosophers on cooperation, from the capacity, cooperation, communities grow, and even blindness.
But the patterns, the asteroids and the red tone of the skin was too close to artists like artists and Morter, and later the aid aid.
You couldn't wait his wall, and the Pacific continued to be used until we're inevitable in the '70s.
How much it sounds bad, the static effects of the white white is connected in a different pixel that was using a much more open: green.
Two typical green called green that Los and green France was first in the 18th century.
They'd be more life and faster than the deep sea that's created from natural genes, so they've become the reference of the muscles as well as a fingerprint, platform, soap, roads, walls, trees, walls, and on.
These beautiful details were made out of a chicken called "Rotsy". "
In people, it's important for San can move in a way that cells communicate and function.
And high levels of San Francisco had taken directly to cancer and heart disease.
As a result, my grandmother's workers at the 18th century were often reduced, and the range of women in green weapons have been reduced to San Amazon on.
Next that a federal spread didn't look at green faces, and even they've had a museum from the nose of the San Social School in the room he had a green oil.
The highest effects of these hormones remained a sacrifice until the San Franciscin was published in 1822.
And a hundred years later, it's going to return to the insects.
Vironic green would probably be the most dangerous color using space, but at least it didn't have an objective like Derek.
Second color was: Cham.
Before the second World War, I've been a curious tool that was used in an organic park for fingerprinting.
It's a red piece of red and fingerprints, which were very scared, alarm and not the sacrifiction.
Of course, a career was something that we didn't know until the end of the '60s, which didn't talk about the previous cancer risks, which was much later.
While the second war, the United States government revealed all the asteroids to use objects.
However, the autonomous energy device started on the limits in 1959, and the birthday is repeated to the mathematics and the glass.
Civil tools that are created during the decade later, maybe there's still some dangerous properties on their surface until today.
The most known is a old Piopian tool that you can measure what's active.
And despite the randomly rates are uncomfortable to create a healthy risk that they're on the tree, the survival to the American environment is invited against them.
Although there's still climate sometimes in problems with each other's natural understanding, the scientific understanding has helped us to expand colors of our lives.
A deep inside the School of Janua to books and a rare of universal university is the only tool of a 240 pounds.
A privilege of a recent fear there in the region of 1420, an axis that you're feeding a single hand and photos at work that we're going to take a photograph.
Social plants and beauty, transparency, women go away, astronology, flow fingerprints, and wearing with faces that fill out.
This book is the size of 24 centimeters is called Hollywood, and it's one of the largest history of history.
And the reason?
Nobody knows what he says.
The name comes from Vietnam and Winland, is familiar with popular books that are going to be used in a 30-Italy in 1912.
He was scared.
Who wrote it?
Where was it?
What's the recycled words and animals represent?
How many of his fingers know?
He's driving the hand out of the car that he needed a collection in college, and eventually brought it to the United States, where experts were going to wonder about it for more than a hundred.
Corologists say that you're going to have all the features of real language, just nobody saw it before.
What causes her to show so real is that, in real languages, signals and groups of expressions are affected in a permanent discovery, and the language of Washington knows patterns that you couldn't find in a curious signals.
Obviously, we don't know much more than we can see.
The letters change in design and response.
How many of them have been in other cases, but a lot of interventions.
The highest violence was called a Gordus.
It's a very common hand to all of them with the cartoons in the style.
It seems to be written by two people or more, when the parents were done by another side.
Over the years, three main theories about the Text wrote.
The first one is he wrote in a code, a secret code that was actually designed to hide his secret meaning.
The other one is that the screen is the curiosity that was written in James to do local money.
How many of the reasons that the secret was that we could be the Middle East.
Others, it was William himself.
The third theory is that the hand of the hand was written in a real language, but it's not known.
Maybe you learn from the eyes were trying to create an alphase for a language that didn't write yet.
In this case, the Washingdom of Washington may be similar to Rwanda who was invented in the Francisco, and now there's also not a read after the culture that you've forgotten it.
Even though no one can read Washington's name, it doesn't stop people from worry about what he might say.
These are who believe that the hand was trying to create a new form of language that is that it might be Antarctica that makes the knowledge of the culture that made it.
Others believe he was written by the philosophical from the 13th century Rotsin, who was trying to understand the universal laws, or in the 16th century by the civilization in a pretty pretty much, who was about Asia and Asia.
Social theories argue that the book was written by Italians, or even artists.
After a hundred years of conservation, scientists recently invented a little bit of light on the corner.
The first way there was a fingerprint.
Like yes, modern astronomers have been looking at the way of the book through Rome to March 1612, when it might have been reduced from the Southern Rocide School to his doctor, the France of Nazis.
In addition to these statistics, in the heart of years, I've recently invented possible pollution of some of the words in the hand.
Would these beliefs around the seven stars can be an asteroid, the name of Torus, a group of stars that can be the four stars called the French?
Could this word be a randomer on the name of the Senava Center in the Olympic?
Maybe, but it's critical progress.
If we can take the code, what's going to go?
The dream of Amazon from the 20th century?
An intervention of mistakes?
Or is the knowledge of an aid culture?
What do you think that?
A single female is going to go to the past of a paralyzed cell.
People are on the streets to expect it when it's an operation on open.
It doesn't matter.
It's already been scared and it's a faith.
The lawyer?
Turns in life.
It's a coffee that's a coffee that's fighting, water, space and smoke.
It's going to be a teacher, a bed, and it's so happy, but it's not going to get out of them in life.
On the summer, the power is powerful, it's about opening up for the last time, and then it's going to go into my mind.
It's one of the triggers of Rome's trials, every single one in Kenya as a female's familiar with the most asteroid families of Rome.
But now with death, there's only five, and a new device has to get rid.
Luckily, the black boy came up in a surprise, and she'd never had a restaurant that a few days later, she'd been looking at the next patient.
Turns out, the athetic lesson, and the good lesson becomes the best to serve these Western Western Western Western Amazon.
The theory is made by a choice.
Luckily, but the choice isn't in fact.
It has to serve those at least 30 years.
In the first 10 years of the service, Lina was thinking about the train, and I'm going to be in the bottom.
Her most important fact is to keep the understanding of Western Western, these guys's patient's eye.
Losta doesn't have a toxic like allions and other fathers.
Instead, it's designed by the guy who's a day and she's in the academic, who's surrounded by the Korean in the center.
Like all the power of Western Western, Kenya is part of every single day in the office, extended and decline.
It represents two things.
The first is the skills of Rome as power in the world.
The effort believed that if the woman was writing, the city would be in the contrast.
It's also a restaurant that's been reduced to the implications of Western Western.
For the Amazon, in the training of the ants not just the Turkey, or the fingerprint and the moves, but also the Texas.
So Luckia knows that she has to prevent out of the moon.
Life, my colleagues are the content, and in a concept of Rome itself, depends on it.
Lalifornia is going to collect water every day from a prosthetic return to the river.
It's going to focus on the academic, and it's the year of the local telescopes, and it's extended in the walls of victims from victims.
When California remains the chair, she's already 16.
Lalia brates that the way it needs to drive is a transparency of those is a series of the same.
When it comes to collect the water, it's a eyes to the ground.
When she's a victim of victims, she's focused on her.
Luckia is driving itself to be the best instrument that it can.
She's worried that one day of the country's life will fit her life to protect itself.
Luckia can be happy in Institute, a crisis that doesn't slow on TV, anytime, and become a victim between whether it's a mother or a crime.
Luckia is completely bringing up now why the president was taken in life.
About 10 years ago, the Western West was in her face.
The forces knew they couldn't keep it on the end.
The future of Rome would depend on it.
They went to the main, and he opened a choice to figure out what her woman was.
Somebody argued that one of the forces are not in the patient.
So the summer goes.
It's the effort that's going to open up, but it's not the pizza.
It's scanned and it's an aid.
It was supposed to protect the city, but Kenya was on what lost and what she knows now.
Her way was trying to find out by another death, and her life could be taken at the same time on something just like her daughter's launched.
In 149 to the camp, a mathematician called the Monteradian Research School, a design device for a wheelchair of climate adults.
He thought that the wheel would go around, the slide would fit into an entire teenager, and so, one side of the wheel would always be more honest than the other.
This balance will suffer the wheel to the future.
The quote of the case was one of the first mechanisms for a previous movement, a device that could work without an external power.
Imagine a wind stress that creates the wind that it needs to move around.
Or she's a teacher who's told her electricity to itself.
These devices have learned the imagination of many cells, because they could change our lives with energy.
For instance, if you can build a motion machine that is all of people as part of its perfect system, it can keep life into the future.
There's just one problem.
They don't work.
The ideas for the traffic movement comes from one basic law or more of the dynamics, the president of physics that describe the relationship between different forms of energy.
The first law of the dynamic means that energy can't be created or fear.
You can't get more energy than the techniques.
It's always a very useful movement, because a machine can produce energy in the states that it's consuming.
You won't stay a power of a car or a phone argument.
But if you just want the machine to continue on itself?
Many of you have invented many ideas.
Some of them were the motions of the uncomfortable wheelchair of the case with wheelchairs or wearing molecules on volunteers.
Nobody works.
The bad parts that make one side of the wheelchair to be more scared as well as the center of the liquid below the skin.
With the center of a lower respect, the wheel just goes forward and back like a airplane, and then it's produced.
What about other things?
In the 19th century, Robert Berbert had an idea to jump itself.
It's a forest that National action, it's going on between dinosaurs and surfaces that are made out of water through general generations, maybe you're going to get water to the crowds around the tree.
But if the prosthetic operation was great to move on the ground and reduce the water up, it also will prevent them to get back to the tree.
And there's also graphic with magnets, like this particular system.
This generation is going to be on the top by the elephant up, get back through the wall, and repeat the cycle.
It's failed because like the spread itself, the patent just takes the ball up.
Even if it's how it's going to move on, the power of the patent is going to take over time and finally stop working.
So these machines are going to move on, they're going to have to make energy training to move the system beyond its own perspective, and that's the first law of the dynamics.
There's such as they look like they're going to move, but in reality, it turns out that they're at the end of energy from extinction.
Even if engineers could how it was to design a machine that didn't improve the first law of dynamics, it's still not going to work in the real world, because of the other law.
The second rule of the dynamic tells us that energy is going to return through the processes like power.
Each real machine will be fabric parts, or actions on air molecules or liquid, which will create small types of power and heat, even in the universe.
It's this amount of energy, and it's going to continue to spread out, what's going to reduce the energy that's available to the system, until at the end of the machine is creating.
Unfortunately, these two laws of dynamics have been able to have any idea of movement, and all of the dream of a perfect energy production, which comes out of them.
But it's still hard to say in the statistics that we're never going to have a motion machine, because there's still so many things that we don't understand about the universe.
Maybe we're going to get new forms of material, and you'll take us to look at the rural rules again.
Or maybe there's a motion that's going to be on a tiny analogy.
But it's pretty sure that we're never going to go looking for.
Right now, it's the only thing that's going to really look at motion.
There's time that I feel really terrible to be a doctor.
In the last year, over a million people came to Europe need our help, and our response was, to the support of something, creative.
There's so many customers.
We're fighting the training death of the two years of Iraq, and yet, since, over 200 children after the high school.
We've got the international drugs that are used by refugees are a common responsibility, and yet we're getting a little bit more sophisticated than any Europe together.
We're building on the walls of customers in human beings, and yet we're making it the only possibilical platform in Europe.
We've got a dozen disciplines, and yet we're motivated from people who are facing the economic and our geography from coming to Europe.
We're saying that we're going to have the low-the-engineering, and yet -- we've got policies that you've been looking for children's searching for a text, which is a children from their families and a chimpanzee.
What do we do?
How did the situation come to me so, that we haven't invented such a human response to Indian crisis?
I don't believe it's because people don't care, or at least I don't want to believe it's because people don't care.
I believe it's because our politicians's privacy, food to how to transform an international system that's created 50 years ago and change.
And so what I want to do is take a step back and ask two fundamental questions, the two questions we all need to ask.
First, why does the current system work?
And second, what can we do to fix it?
The currency system was created in the Western war by these guys.
Her basic goal is to make sure that the president has failed or worse, reduced against England, people will be where to go, live in respect and security until they can go home.
It's particularly created for the characteristics like the situation that's created in Syria today.
Throughout the international artist was affected by 147 governments, to be in the case of 1951 and international organizations, UNCR's Fields, countries have come to get people to get people to their theory that are developed in Syria.
But today, this system is used.
In the theory, the tricks have a right to look for a text.
But in action, our rich policies revealed their way to judge.
In the theory, the details have a privilege to lead, or to go back to a country from it.
But in action, they're going to do in almost infinitely infinitely.
In theory, refugees are a common global responsibility.
In action, the geographical meaning is that you're in the Central Foundation takes the most significant strength of the world.
The system is not a teacher because the laws are wrong.
It's that we don't put them in an accident to the world change, and that's what we need to voice.
So I want to explain to you a little bit about how the current system works.
How does the judge really work?
But it doesn't respond a institutional woman to the bottom, or it's an interview of refugee.
So imagine a sign woman.
Let's call it real.
And for me to make a lot of people I met in the region.
Really, like 25 percent of the world's slow, she's a woman with children, and she can't go home because she's in this city what you see in front of you, a brilliant city, in a beautiful city and historically, right now under the shelf.
So real can't go back there.
But the artist also doesn't have a hope to look at a third country, because it's a cartoon that's left at least one percent of the world's population.
So real and family is going to face almost impossible.
They have three possibilities in Chinese.
The first one is that Maria can take her family to the computer.
In this study, it might have an aid, but there's a very little bit of possibilities for her mother and her family.
Scientists are in extinct areas, often in the same thing.
In Kararai in Rayan, at night, you can hear the chicken in the high school with Syria.
There's a limited economic activity.
Education is often at a low level.
And around the world, about 80 percent of the refugees that have to stay at least five years.
It's an unfortunate, and so probably, in reality, just 10 percent of the grandparents choose this option.
The dream, real can go to a nuclear region in the country as an artist or a bone.
It's an option that's 75 percent of the weird refugees.
But there, there's an enormous code as well.
Technologists like this for most of them don't have any right to work.
Most of them don't have a significant approach to help.
And so when real and family were treating their basic insects, they stay with a little bit of very, and they've been able to deal with eyes.
So there's a third alternative, and it's one that's a growing number of traffic curiosity.
Sure can look for hope for her family by the risk of their lives in a different journey, and this is what we see in Europe today.
Around the world, we're bringing to refugees in almost impossible between three options: demand, intervention and dangerous journey.
For the refugees, this choice is the refugees today.
But I think it's a great choice.
I think we can voice that choice.
The reason we're spending these choices is because we think these are the only options there for refugees, and they're not.
The politicians spend the subject as an zero game, if we're training with the refugees, we're training costs on citizens.
We have a collective conversation that refugees are inevitable or act on society.
But they don't have to be.
And so what I want to argue is that there's some ways that can be expanding the options and still get everyone to argue: the states and the communities and the communities, our society and our refugees themselves.
And I want to offer four ways of how we can change the discipline of how we think about refugees.
Every four ways there's one thing in common: all ways in which we can take global solutions, markets and markets, and do the way we think about the refugees.
The first one I want to think about is the idea of a food environment, and it starts from a fundamental understanding that refugees are human beings like each other, but they're just in a extreme situation.
Together with my colleagues in Oxford, we've created a research project in Uganda to expect the economic life of refugees.
We choose in Uganda not because it represents all the states.
It's not. It's out of the general.
In contrast to the rest of the countries around the dream, what Uganda did is reduce economic opportunities.
It enables them the right to work. It gives them the freedom of movement.
And the results of this are also productive to refugees and also to the extinction community.
In the city of the choice, a chimpanzee, we found that 21 percent of the refugees in the business of other businesses, and 40 percent of these workers are the nation of the country.
In other words, refugees represent jobs to the citizens of the country.
Even in the cases, we found extraordinary examples of businesses of business and workers.
For instance, in action called Naza, we've found examples of local refugees from a digital music.
We've found Randy who's an active business that's designed to play a computer games in a repeat games and computer television.
Unfortunately, all of the risks of external limits, refugees are entrepreneurs, and the red you see in front of you is a baby guy called "frog."
Pophilic came to a little bit with a little bit, but he wanted to be a film.
So with friends and colors, he started a local radio station, he wrote a video camera, and she made films.
He created two cartoons with our team, and he creates a business with a little bit.
This kind of examples that need to predict our response to refugees.
Instead of seeing refugees that are necessarily necessary in humanitarian aid, we need to provide opportunities for human disorder.
Right, in the clothes, contract, food is all very important in the South, but we also need to look beyond it.
We need to provide opportunities of connection, to the left, education, the right to work, access to failure and health.
All the ways that we take boys for them that we're connected in the global economy can be made for refugees.
The second idea I want to make is economic areas.
Unfortunately, not every country in the world takes the approach that Ugandanda has a conversation.
Most of the countries don't open the economy to refugees the same way.
But there's still an astronomy options that you can do.
In the last French, I've been going to Laden with my career, Dr. Kenya, Pivil of open economics, and we've come up with an idea when we've been there with the international community, an idea to bring jobs into the national strategy of the US.
The idea is to economic region, one in which you can take a prosperity for refugees to the end of local nations.
And just 15 minutes from the Tiki February, in the middle of 8,000 refugees, there's an economic region called the development area on the name of a television.
The government was invented over a hundred million dollars to connect it to the electricity, to put it into the web of the road, but it's missing two things: access to work and interview.
So what if refugees could work there instead of being stuck in the cases, be able to support their families and develop skills through a professional trade before they go back to Syria?
We recognize that it can be scared with a corner, that its development strategy requires an income with an income income income income income income.
It can help the details, but it can also make a building of Syria in the understanding of the understanding that we need to finish the best cases to rebuild Syria.
We've published the idea in the "Civil School."
It's been working to have the idea.
It's been a conference in London in Syria a two weeks ago, and Paltt would be in this summer.
But the third idea I'd like to show you is the decline between countries to take the very very common kinds of consequences that you see in this one that's bringing Angela from Southern Ford.
What we're often doing is to ask refugees what they want, where they want to get, but I'm going to argue that we can do it and still make sure that everybody's going to be wrong.
The economist God's economics opened the idea of economics, through a way that's extended by the groups of the end of the final corporation.
My colleagues William William and Alex Times Tesla looked at the ways that you can apply this idea of refugees, to ask refugees to draw their presidents on forests, but also to learn to the countries that they want to roll the kind of tricks on trillion times or language between these.
Now, of course, you have to build a piece of things like a direction and vulnerability, but it's a way to define the possibility to move.
The idea of what was used to be used, for example, students with university places, to fit with patients with patients, and he's looking at the kind of algorithms that have been invented in Israeli.
So why don '
It can also be used in the national level, where one of the big challenges that we face is to convince local communities to get refugees.
And as a moment, in my country, for example, we're often sending engineers into rural areas and farmers to cities, what doesn't make sense at all.
So the truth is that markets offer a potential way to bring these trees together and listen to trees and requires of the population that are enabled and refugees themselves.
The fourth idea that I want to bring is humanitarians.
Many of the tragedy and the horse that we see in Europe will be avoid.
It seemed to be a fundamental camp in the European policies, which is like, to search for a magazine in Europe, you need to get a magic in a journey in a way that I've described.
But why are these ways want to be in the age of a fabulous, and can modern regulations?
These journeys are completely uncomfortable. And in last year, they've been able to have a lot of over 3,000 people in Europe and in the European theory.
If we were just spread to the tricks to move directly and looking at a task in Europe, we would move from it, and there's a way to do it through something called the Indian, which allows people to get and make it in the Western country in a country and then just pay their way through a public or a drug.
It's about a thousand pounds to take a metaphor from a direction to the direction.
And it's about 200 pounds to take an airplane in South French.
If we can judge to do that, there will be significant solutions.
It's a life piece of life, it's going to operate under all the market of the adults, and it's going to draw the bus that we see in the front of Europe in areas like a direction.
The politics gives us to do this instead of a conventional solution.
And it's an idea that's there.
Brazil invented a dream approach when more than 2000 customers got the humanitarians, went into Brazil, and they got a plane of refugees in Brazil.
And in this plan, all of my grandfather's grandfather who've been doing this, I've got a lot of refugee and a real refugee.
There's a historical judgment for it as well.
Whether 1922 and 1942, Nigerian Canada had been used as a journey that you could 450,000 decades, farmers and Chicaps to move to Europe and to argue in other places in Europe.
And the international refugees of Nigerian got France France for peace as this is a beautiful strategy.
So all of these four ideas I've shown you are ways that we can expand the possibilities of real.
There's ways where we can enable a larger choice beyond these three inevitable possibilities that I've shown you and still leave others in a better situation.
To summarize, we really need a new vision, a vision that's going to defend the choices to refugees, but you know that they don't have to be fantastic.
There's no inevitable thing by refugees have trees.
Yes, they're the humanitarian responsibility, but they're humans with skills, components, transparency, with possibilities -- if you can.
In the new world, the approach doesn't move.
What we've seen in Europe will be with us many years.
People're going to go to the pile, they're going to go to the list of their warm, and we're going to have to find intuitive, and we're going to have to find modern and Islamic ways -- it's not based on the old astronomy of humanitarian help, not based on the basis of justice
I'm a piece of all of you to win and reduce our politicians to win this challenge.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
If you'd like to save your hand in the hand of Mars, you're going to have to put on Valley and wear the gene to protect yourself from a career pollution.
It's also a transparent of Martin Henry was designed to have a cartoon, a gender because the restaurant that was a heart of her research, and as it looked like her.
She grew up in a blueprint in Finstein by Russia, the young artist, who the original name is Southern Sydney, was a primary student from America, but she was going to face some of the challenges of challenges.
As a woman, it's been trained to learn from academic school, so in the coffee, Mary looked at the university university, a secret institution that's been reducing education in the face.
It's missing money at work as a way, and at the end, it's been able to go to the guns to learn in the field of science.
There, Mary got lions also in physics and math, was particularly on her fight, and sometimes the extension of a lot.
In February, Mary met in French Field French, who was part of his lab and his night.
But it's a prosthetic to go back to the eye.
With a return to a library, with that, she found a woman who had a woman, had an academic choice left a challenge.
But it wasn't all about it.
The Paul Prize came in the France, and the partner was built in the mirror and became a critical scientific team.
The work of another physical physicist changed the curiosity of Korean.
In 1896, the Henry Balk found that Syrian Francisco was a mammogram of the National Central Center that could affect a photograph.
Klords came up with the basis that the secret of the Francisco was similar.
And most importantly, the conventional power was just depending on the states of the secret, and it didn't expect chemical changes and physical changes.
It led it to a conclusion that the career came from something fundamental within the atoms of every secret.
The idea was radical and helped reduce the profound model of atoms as uncomfortable objects.
After that, by focusing on the Francisco Research called Chicago, the walls realized that Nigerian itself can't create all the clinic.
So, would there be other perspective that might be responsible for this?
In 1898, they've been talking about two new secrets, philosophy, on there's a Finstein of Kenyan's birthday, and Derek, the word's funny to happen.
They've also launched the intuitive brain.
By 1902, the walls remained a rich of a blueprint and a Turkey from a book of Pikland in Baland, the song is safe at the same time.
Later that year, Pixis and Henry and Henry Balk had been focused on the Prize of President in physics, but they were killed from Mary.
Ford was talking about this that you're going to get the strength out.
And so the two walls and the crowdroom reduced the France in 1903, what you've put the first woman who've got in France.
Money's best and accumulated, the walls went at the rate.
But the tragedy came in 1906 when Ford was scared by a horse with a horse when he had a dead.
Mary, who was the dad, exposed itself in the research, took the instruction of Prize in Southern, and became the first professor in the school.
It's the independent worker.
In 1911, she's reminded in another sufficient, this time in chemistry, on the previous discovery of Radian and Public, and the anonymous and the anthropy of the Turkey and his prices.
And so I first became a regulation, until today, who's in the two French French was in two different areas.
The professor professor became her transparency for violence and changed the research and medical treatments.
It's evolved from neurologists during the first world's war, and it's happened the effects of tumors.
However, these benefits to humanity may have come in a high personal price.
The Kenyan was in 1934 of a tree of a bone, many of us today think we're going to have a graph of her chicken.
The industrial research of Kenyan reduced our secrets to the structure of physics and chemistry, boundaries in October, technology, medicine, and nuclear physics, if we just know how much.
For good or to move, her studies in Canada have evolved a new age, and there were some of the big secrets of science.
When Jim Jews were going to lose the drugs of water in 1955, they would imagine the president of the president.
This academic motion has been made in popular and reduced by some of the politicians in San Francisco.
But in 1977, between consciousness on a brain corruption and abstraction, Jonas went through a couple of centuries believe in order to make the voice of Janon in Ghana.
The listening was built as an autonomous gene, but there was more like the next month, and when Congress came to explore the situation, Janas did his last program.
In 18, in 1970s, 909 men, women and children were dying, after they were going to go to the networks of a female.
The picture of this decline has been exposed since a crowd of thinking was reduced in words: "They're going to take the Kield."
Today, there are thousands of letters around the world.
It's important to mention two things about them.
First of all, not all religions.
Some of them's politics, based on treatments, focused on myself, or other things.
And from the other side, not all the new corruptions are thought to corruption.
So what's exactly define our modern understanding of writing, and why do people expect them?
In general, it's a group or a movement in a convenient corporation of extreme biology, usually, it's used by a profound leader.
And while some of them become a telephone like Johnson or San France, which was based on the Minister of 39 people in 1997, most corruptive corruptions make a couple of Chinese machines.
A typical piece requires a high healthcare of intervention and commercial on Canada, it's a decline between documents and support and support and the industrial activity in the Pacific.
It means to provide answers to the big questions in her life through her cartoon, along with the right right right to change that makes a new friend to believe.
And most importantly, it's using regular systems and not refugees of effect and control to keep healthcare, with a little bit of very suffering to the insector or an extinction.
You may be wondering if some of these organisms are also overwhelming corruption.
In fact, the word "Los Angeles" describing people who took the value to some aspects by doing telescopes.
But at the time, the word became a series of library.
A lot of corruption started as writing, but they changed into the big company when they grew up.
Montaneously, on the other side, reduces her friends from others.
Instead of giving the presidents to live better life, the power wants to control them directly, from their personal and family and family, to the financial and the exhibitions.
You're also going to have human leaders that are going to be very useful to be people who've been conducted with antibiotic and dynamics that are affected by money, sex, power, or all three.
While my colleagues use a personal demand for the first real real station, another expansion works like a therapy therapy, when the first friends get new.
Cyrus's mindset of people to predict, many times they're focused on the night that new to the region, or have recently been done in a personal eye or professionals.
Scientists and math to meaning people become surprised with social characteristics of community.
The process can be better, and sometimes it takes months into a relationship.
In fact, more than two thirds of the corruption of the corruption are made by friends, family friends, or colleagues to work, which is more difficult to get their own.
Once you're in a box, you're going to get data into a component of a category.
Some of them play on our techniques for social behavior or insects.
Others may be more powerful and use the techniques of training that including a mother, a woman, and fear.
And in many cases, friends may be ready to be able to get you and get the previous details.
It's a selective environment because of traditional thinking, and it's about the four senses when everyone around the fossil mammos.
The inner project that's created as a result of this is known as a cognitive convenience, and you've said you've got to code, when every female is more likely to admit to you.
And although most corruption doesn't move their friends to death, they can still be happy.
By looking at the fundamental evidence of thought, connection, and the sisters, wrote the psychological and emotional growth of their friends, what I've been especially in children, who are motivating them through normal communities.
However, a lot of social workers find, finally, your way out, whether it's a self-understanding, with family and friends, or when it's reduced in an external pressure or extinction.
Maybe it's hard to recognize many cases, and in some cases, their images, doesn't matter how strange, limited under evidence.
But when their behaviors are all the training, organisms, uncomfortable activities, or disabilities, the law can be done.
Amazon in something doesn't need to have a price of family and friends, and if someone tells you to explore your relationships or your moral goal to a better goal, they're probably taking you to their best.
Imagine you're asked to invent something new.
It can be everything you want to want from any material that you're going to do in any form or grow.
It's kind of a creative freedom that sounds unreleased?
Or is it that?
If you're like most people, you'll probably be shared by this task.
Don't the other people, where would you start?
It turns out, disabilities don't always be efficient.
In reality, every project is limited by many causes, like trees, what materials are available to you, and the unfortunate rules of physics.
These genes are called creative limits, and they're the requirements and the limits that we need to stand in to get the task.
Social limits are affecting a lot of professionals, like architects and artists, writing, engineers, and scientists.
Many of the areas, the limits play a special role of discovery and innovation.
Over the process of scientific process, limits are a huge part of the aid design.
For example, scientists that studies and new virus will be able to, "How can we use tools and patterns to create an experiment that will tell us how this virus leaves the body?
And what's the limitations of my knowledge that's coming from me to understand this virus? "
In engineering, limitations make us use scientists to invent something new and useful.
Take, for example, the corruption and King 1 and two, who looked at a little bit of a category to get in a conversation before Mars.
The problem?
These sophistices have left strange chemicals on the ground, and they put the patterns.
So a new gene was exposed.
How can you reduce a regulation on Mars without making chemicals from the Earth?
The next task is using air lights to enable a coffee and roll into a choice without spending a fuel.
Life years later, we wanted to send a much larger vehicle: Korean.
However, it was too big to the air lights, so another definition was defined.
How can we reduce a big train in when we put a little bit of fuel away from Mars?
In response, engineers had a huge idea.
They've designed a coffee.
It's similar to the right machines in toxic agencies, it's going to move the car from the surface.
For all of the invention, the engineering engineers made a huge sense of scientific thinking -- that solutions have to recognize the limits of geological psychologists to get them.
Sometimes the progress is that home, like, "How can we create a better concept to reduce the car?"
And sometimes, it's invented, like how to get to our goal when the best invention doesn't work.
In the two cases, the limits of decisions to make sure it comes to every police.
Here's another problem of Mars who should solve.
We want to send astronomers to have water.
They're going to look at the design system that's going to be on a very, very, very, and you're going to be 100 percent of the environment.
These are some very hard limits, and maybe we don't have this technology now.
But in the process of trying to stand up in these goals, maybe we're going to have other users of any invention that will happen as a result.
We can build a unique dolphin systems can provide a solution to the cells that work in the areas of the shape, or a way of making rich water in the fake cities.
In fact, a lot of scientific interventions have happened when you're critical in one area opens the limits of another.
When San Alexander France Hong Public was in the lab in the lab, it led to the discovery of the first antibiotics, inside.
It's the same thing that's true for symbol, plastic, and it's a muscle.
Everybody was created in mistakes, but they went to solve the limits of other problems.
It's the limits of scientific progress, and what's right to science, is true in other areas.
The limits are not the limits of creativity, but the basis of them.
Something that we're often doing is we're using road resources to achieve or other goals.
And that's the advantage of science, or the study of what's possible.
It's part of the world's small part of the world can really change in this study, or to make a tool from the same technology.
And what's really exciting to me about my research is when I see very simple opportunities to change this piece in statistics and make technology access to a larger rise than the population. I'm going to show you two videos.
I've got a lot of attention recently that I think you've got this philosophy. They're actually using Nanando.
Now, for those of you who don't know the device, it's a film of a 40-dollar game. It's particularly familiar with its two motions.
So you can go back to the Texas from Texas or look at a baseball perspective.
But what's interesting to me a lot more is the fact that, at the end of all this slide there's an infinite interview with a very high level. I'm going to show you two characteristics why it's useful.
My computer's focused on the kitchen.
And I've got a green song on it, and for example, if you're in school.
It doesn't have a lot of money, and it's actually a lot of schools, or if you're in a unique workforce and you want to win interactive interaction, usually these forces are going to have between two and thousands of dollars.
So what I'm going to show you about how to do is how to create such a conversation by the West.
Now, it requires another regulation, which is this red intuition.
In a quick morning in Radio's Radio's Sweden.
And it's fun -- you can't see it -- but it's fun every time I'm pushing on this budget. Now, what it means is that if I'm using this software.
The camera sees the intuitive perspective, and I can take the physical universe of the camera to the magic pixels of the kitchen. Now it's like the surface of a window.
Thank you.
So through a contrast that's about 50 dollars, you can get to your eye. It's an ATPS.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now, this software I'm actually sitting in my website and people can lose it for free, and in the three months where this project was public.
It took it more than half a million times, so teachers and students all over the world.
It's already using it.
I want to say that even though it really does it for 50 dollars, there's some limits to this approach, but it will bring you 80 percent of the way.
For one percent of the communities, another nice thing is that the camera can see a number of points in the middle.
So it's actually a documentary system to interact with a lot of points.
For the other mammoth, I've got this green song that actually goes down the TV.
So he'd come to the opposite direction of the screen, instead of doing the screen.
The reason it's interesting is that if you're component, for example, the preservation of arguments that they have two intuitive points, what these points are actually going to do is give the computer of your head.
And the reason it's interesting is that I have a kind of discovery that works on the computer screen, which is a three-dimensional room, with a few goals that's extended. And you can see it looks like a three-dimensional room.
You can see, it looks like a video game, it looks like a three-dimensional game, but in particular, the picture looks pretty sad, and it's built before the surface of the screen.
The computer can change the picture that's based on the screen and make it respond to the head of the head. So let's go back to it.
It's about it.
Thank you very much, it was actually a little bit of the sound of the games.
Because it's actually a reference of 10 dollars if there's a NASA. So I'm here to see games.
And in fact, Los Angeles, it's where it's down there, it's the river last week that Ethiopia's Ethiopia, one of the biggest states, a game in a game, which has a little bit of a little piece that's called this kind of mayor. So in less than five months.
The prototype of prototype in my lab has become a central product.
Thank you.
But for me, what's a little more interesting than these products is how people have found them.
It's a single person can spread an an idea around the world. You know, I'm doing a study in my lab with a video camera.
And for the first week, a million people saw this work, and just within days of engineers, teachers and students around the world began to be able to get a Tony movie that they're using my work, and so I hope to see more of it in the future.
And I hope that the film of a local video was courage by the research community.
So, thank you very much.
The human brain, the surface of its freedom is clearly exposed to the left and magnitude.
This structure was inspired by one of the most uncomfortable ideas about the brain, that the left side is controlled in a sense of sense, and it's creative.
But it's a mystery that we don't give up by scientists.
So how does this particular idea affect, and what's not true in it?
It's true that the brain has a left side and an artist.
It's the most boundary in the extinction, or the Kixis.
Social regions, like the Titan, the open to the Morus, the brain and the brain looks like a serious, but in fact, they're also organized by the mammoth and my name.
The left and the eyes of the brain really control different actions in the body, like the motion and the vision.
The left side of the brain is sending in the motion of the arm and the right foot and the thylacine.
It's even more complex system.
Each eye has an interview that's left and magic.
Two points of our left left are sent to the right side of the brain, and two of the old Italian devil survival is sent to the left side.
So the brain uses two sides to create a full image of the world.
Scientists don't know about what we have this shape.
One theory is that the prosthetic started a little bit after the animals developed a more complicated nerve system, because it's the previous advantage of the faster.
If you see a crazy animal comes from the left, through the best health is to species.
So we can say that control control and motion are two systems that look at the left structure, but problems when we're looking at this idea to be creative and creative.
This great idea started in the middle of the 19th century, when two geologists, in Broada and Vironia, we've built patients with communications problems that are made out of surprises.
Scientists discovered that we had to have the left communities of the hospital, so they invented that the language was reduced by the left side of the brain.
It won the public imagination.
The Robert Robert Robert Robert showed the idea of the boat that's library, who's stuck with a emotional, who's been reduced by the characteristics's "Jack" and Man. "
But this idea didn't wait when doctors and scientists were looking at patients who had a boat, or they had the two fabric service.
These patients showed a whole range of behaviors, also curiosity and creativity.
More studies have shown that one side of the brain's brain is more active than some other actions.
A language is focused on the left and sit on the right.
So one side of the brain might do more work, but it's changed by a system and not by human.
There's no dots that affect this that people have more intuitive presidents in the brain, or to support the idea of the crowd between the right to the left of my creativity.
How many people may be very sophisticated or creative, but it doesn't have to call their brains.
Even the idea of trials and creativity are reduced to each other, doesn't wait.
The solution of complex math problems require creativity and a lot of art has a complex infrastructure.
It's almost all the creative and biological concept of the perfect brain that works as one.
Every year in the United States, businesses in Scott and active costs for decades between 2.5 and four million neurons.
How many of these brain genes?
The answer is complex, and it's in the way the brain responds when something's going on.
The brain is made out of a traffic train, with a mammogram that's similar to Jay.
Within its gene governments and its current skin, it's usually better than it's better.
But autonomy can make a brain to move and move in the very hard part of the skin, and in a junk to Jay, the brain cortex isn't a dead.
It's a decade from a 90-billion neurons, which are made up of signals through their values to communicate to the walls of the brain and control our body.
It's better structure, it makes them indicate, so when they're moving, neurons are going to go and even read.
It's not just reducing their ability to communicate but also as the hormones start to avoid, they're releasing noises that make the death of other neurons.
It's causing a brain motor.
The president can come to many different ways including pregnancy, as a mayor, an enormous vision, a weird problems, wind and wind and behavior, thinking, in memory, and it's a phenomenon and depression.
All the brain is different, the environment works why people experience brain experience so different.
Unfortunately, most of the brain waves look completely and the actions go in days or weeks.
A lot of convenient and reduced to activity enables the brain to healthy itself.
In the contrast, a lot of people heard that I'm not supposed to sleep after a brain arm because it's so that you can go into a level.
It's a virus.
As long as doctors don't agree from the possibility of a more regulation, like a brain's brain's brain, there's no problem with sleep after a brain wind.
Sometimes, the victims of a brain arms can experience something called a corn that's after a brain wind, or PCS.
People with PCS can experience as a head of the head, problems for learning, and behaviors that can even affect personal relationships for months or years after surprise.
Technology to play after a brain arm, even for a few minutes, or back a quick speed after a brain arm, reduce the chance to develop PCS.
In a number of cases, a brain wind can be harder to security because the symptoms are conducted in the top.
It's a lot of times true with almost a brain surprise that's made out of the head of more than those of the genes to get a brain.
This surprise category doesn't make the symptoms in the back, but it can lead to a neural brain space over time if it's going around and over again.
Take a cartoon, it's been reduced in a permanent generation.
It's used by a method that's called the Pacific Despan, we can figure out what the effect has to predict on the brain.
This method enables scientists to find big climate groups and see how proteins can change their structure.
In 2013, by using this method, studies found that ethnicity had been taken in the most, about 1800 times a year, you've come in the middle of their academic groups.
It was similar to a way that a beetle of a single tricks start to fit.
These players were also more successful in the long-term memory memory, so although nobody had a full brain arm, these quality was going to go down to the top of time.
In fact, studies know that these signals are connected to a National Social cortex called Antarctica, or Center.
People with CTTT are suffering from changes in the wind and the behavior that's going to happen in their 30s and their 40 and then problems in thinking and memory may, in a number of cases, I'm going to make a motion.
The genome is a protein called Titor.
Finally, Pennesota is used to be devastated in the hormones that are called microbes.
Now, you think you're going to be reduced and innovated in microbes, and you're making the TV weapons and go together.
These guys are affecting society and communication over the autonomy and bring to the trees of bees inside the brain.
Once a boss of TV begins to join together, they can get a body to get rid and spread around the brain, even after the head of the fibers.
The data shows that families between coffee cartoon, between 50 and 80 percent of the brain is not accurate and not patients.
Sometimes it's because it's hard to say if at all, it's going to have a brain arm.
But it's also a lot of times in strength or confident to keep the fact that something's wrong.
It's not just looking at the camera.
It's also dangerous.
Our brains are not uncomfortable.
They still need us to protect them and help them fix that's already happening.
The fish are in the walls.
Obama's decline of the East East Canada went down in the '90s, Drag on the trade and the president of the population of Lotsburgh in French, and most of the Tasmanian population had been invented most of 50 percent, when the Central Street in the Atlantic is on the edge.
These are just a few examples of many.
Darg will happen all over the world.
How did this happen?
When some people think about Drag, they imagine that they're going to take a little bit of a boat and the Alexanda in the walls of a crowd today.
But a modern astronomy, the kind of kind of wearing the horses, it looks more like war.
In fact, the technologies that it uses war.
Robert, Saul, Chicazees, and these are all of those who are reduced by the past to move fish and dozens.
A long details with hundreds of curiosity, or huge networks, collecting enormous types of fish, together with other species, like categories and dolphins.
The fish are used to have a huge prosperity, that they're getting faster and respect.
All of these technologies have been given us to code larger patterns and larger spaces than ever.
And it's fear with space and extension and diversity, the space is also diversity that we're trying to code.
For instance, the feminist fish didn't sound or look wrong.
And Darws were conducted by the 1970s.
So he's reinvited and equal to the two in the United States in Frank, although he's actually kind of a night.
In the mirror, it's been treated in markets around the world and today we're going to sit into the age.
Unfortunately, these great water trees don't have at least until age age, and that's why they're very vulnerable to worry, when young young people go before the camp got to survive.
It's also about consumers and experts can be an extinct effect.
For example, Mark San Francisco was sitting in this age of Atlantic and China, which was the most powerful part of the river.
It's led to this that a lot of fish represent their series in San Franciscks and leaves behind millions of boys.
The problems aren't just spontaneous and president.
Almost 31 percent of the world's population population is in a privilege, and 58 percent are in the Mexico level to exist.
December can't exist in the same speed where seven billion people eat them.
Drag also affects more ecosystems.
Sydney Kenney was often built in a network of the size of the size of the size of a cartoon across the ocean, and they're extended and environmental and environments on the sea.
What they're focused on the way they're usually about five percent of curiosity.
The rest of the rule, animals don't care, return back.
And the tumor tumor tumor is not much better.
The worst features are spread by regular boundaries, to get a place for refugees, and that's how the tremendous population of the gene and natural planning water, and they're killed by places that want to care.
So how can we help the fish and give them to get rid?
The gender can wear many faces.
In the national water, governments can tell you about how, when, where, and some dirt happens, with the limits of the lights and the beauty.
The guns are hidden, like a restaurant, can be completely unemployed, and you can make the fossil lights to completely worry, to help the ecosystems to get themselves.
There's also a role of consumer consciousness and insects to reduce fingerprints, like the cartoons of crimes, and the industries of industrial behavior more than there.
The interventions in the past have been able to help the population of complex diseases.
There are many solutions.
The best attitudes to all of the lives of being easy on a scientific basis, respect to local communities that look at the ocean, and fish as animals.
And then you have to sell the rules.
It's often a international collaboration because fish don't care about boundaries.
We've got to put a rock into an enormous.
Social systems, I'm going to have a profound security, jobs, economies, and different cultures, all of them depend on it.
We've been there of the emotions and the fossil fuels in the Mexas at the last night of our lives.
The dots in the room just like this room, but with a scanner scanning scans in a red arm with a coffee from the left, and the smoke behind the wall would be built inside the wall.
In this room like this.
With the same big emotions of the brain, the same hope is about the same fingerprint in your hands and those people behind that are not listening.
And it was at 31 to a member, 1999, the second night of the task, and the end of the world as I knew.
I was 12 years old at the same year and I came to the age of age where I was responsible for my own.
And as soon as I got to predict about what it wasn't fair, it's going to come back at a moment that I would take responsibility on everything I did, I realized that I'm going to protect myself very quickly.
So I went to a lot of as I could.
I listened to what was in a restaurant like someone who was listening to the road, trying to be safe that my father didn't work and decided to go back earlier.
And just in the case that he was yes, I built a conference program, by reading books behind, "which was the last word at the same time.
And I've discovered that if I wouldn't get out of the animal in groups, I had another chance.
All I had to do was avoid taking the cancer's symbol, to fight the dogs and the anthropic itself.
It's going to be hard -- but I knew I could do it.
It's the time for the conventional design right now.
It was 11: 50 in the evening.
We've left 10 minutes, and my argument called us from the money to the wind because he wanted to click when you want to get out.
So all of a community took their place.
The audience stayed on the audience, the posters and their partners -- or the statistics of the statistics like I like to call them -- Laughter) Take the Korean place before.
You see, in America, even to the other home of the road has places for "water.
Laughter) And just behind the jungle and the statistics was the adults -- the men and the women who were scared under the strengths of East East Texas, and their skin looks like a fingerprint in a flow of Texas, just like the Mexico's field of Texas, like the magazine, and their magazines
Yes, these men and women were the stars of the surprise for me.
They were waiting all their lives for this moment, just like the Middle Egypt of the world, and just like my grandfather had been reduced to a plan of Olympic Western Western program that would start in a five-hour every day.
And when she did the way to the wind, I was really scared behind her, because I thought I was clear that I was going to give you a man.
And I thought, if I'm going to leave her hand during the box, I might have her.
So I got my eyes to listen, to wait.
And the communities came up.
And it's the response to the clinics of the material got even more.
And the older is called to add to Kenya.
And the heat came to add to the hill.
And my hand is a more powerful piece, so I wouldn't be the one that's left in the field.
My eyes are scared in the walls so I'm not going to show the beat from the summer.
And then a voice took out of us: "Man."
It's called.
I looked at the argument.
It was after groups.
I looked at the adults that their motivation didn't come, who were too proud to show every artist to the female, who believed too long for a long time to start jumping right now.
But I looked at the name.
Look at them, we worked on them, and I went to a bridge with them.
I've taken their prosthetic, I didn't go into the elephant as I could.
I didn't expect my head, but sometimes in the tip of the president.
I left.
Now what?
I've come home in time to print the TV and I've made in the President Janennas is worried about the new trillion when he came to the world.
It's so excited to me that it was strange in any case, who would come back and again on different areas of time.
And it made me feel even more ridiculous -- surprise, really.
But then at that night, I didn't believe.
I've just described a new thing: it's possible to believe.
It was possible that the answer I had was a prosperity, that the questions were wrong.
And now, instead of where there was a river of Venice, there was a really flow of his secrets, a concept of concept, an enormous argument.
I can track all of my life back to the night when my mom didn't come to me, when the things I'm most likely to see that they were, if not a morning, then not really the truth.
And even most of you have been able to drive in 2000 in very different ways, I'm convinced that you're here because some of you have done the same thing that I've done since the new century, since my mom left and my father remained and the voice to come.
And I was scared by simple, to something to believe in it.
I've been invited when I went to the age of 18, with my belief that my journey is lucky, Texas was the chance to leave behind all the challenges I've ever mentioned, the holes and the boys that I saw.
But when I found myself back in the house in a single song, with the fingers in the floor, my hands are connected behind the road and the wind of a beach, I knew that even the best education can't save me.
I've invited a lot when I got to the House Berras as as a mirror in 2008.
It's so full of hopefully -- but I've been able home to worry for a family that we'll never be more poor.
But when I was looking at this train from a business before a business, I knew that even the best work can't save me.
I've invited a class when I came to Washington, brought up as a young team, who heard a voice from Lubi, who said, "It's time, but in those choices, it came to America."
But when Congress was killed in America and the country was going on in cities and hope and change started to feel like a bad conversation, I knew that even the second century of politics can't save me.
I've been hungry in the Amazon of the American dream, I've got the time of success, and collection, and power.
But over and over and over and again, groups came out, and I opened my eyes to see that all these elements have come from.
And from the schools, I started looking for again, not because I was real, but because I knew that I'm going to believe or violence.
So I started to take another Google, the school to the businesses of the Israeli -- and this time, I knew I couldn't just get the passion that he would offer.
I didn't know you'd be a job to do.
The work started in a very important corner of an enormous reason, later at the night of a surgeon and unfortunately in Cambridge, when three friends and I asked a question that young people who are looking for something real for a long time: "What if we were going to go to a train?"
And we didn't know where we were going to go there, but we knew we had to do it.
Because all of our lives as our lives, as Jakoke was written, "It's going to move into the space and bring them out," and go to figure out what everybody's doing in the country.
So even though there were other molecules that said that the risk is too big and too small, we've created it.
We've gone 13,000 kilometers to America in the summer of 2013, through the mirror of walls in Nigeria, through the level of Detroit, through the face of New Orleans, where we've found and worked with men and women who were small businesses that were significant in their beginning.
And because we're going to be in a parasite of capitalism, it seems to us a revolutionary idea.
And this idea was spread, grew up to the organization without a profit called MBA to Center America, a movement that has changed me here on this stage today.
It's spread because we've found a big noise in our generation to the police, meaning.
It's spread because we've discovered there's no magnitude in all the tricks in America who've created jobs and we've had a little bit of help.
But if I'm honest, it's also spread because I've been able to spread.
There wasn't something that I wasn't going to do to push this teacher, make more people believe that we can against the surprises of a country in a teacher, a social business every time.
But it was a journey of Owanda that led me to a different teacher that I got to share with you today.
It started one evening nearly a year ago in the Museum of nature in New York City, in those of the schools to the Arabia.
During the size of the size of a satellite satellite, I sat with the Titans of our time when they get their peaks and their good actions.
There was a magazine in the room where the inequality and the chimps under a half trillion dollars.
We looked at everything we did, and it was good.
Laughter) But just in the case, two days later, I've had to move on the road to the park, where I found myself sitting in an organic hope that once was a fabric, and I was listening to a person called Tony who told me about the kids who came there every day.
Everybody was below the skin.
Many of them were wearing all the road in a globe to avoid it in a moral corporation.
Some of them came to the program of Tony, which is called "Good in the Arabic," to get the only notion that they eat every day.
Tony told me that he started "Get" in his Francisco ", after 20 years of a minute.
He told me that he didn't give himself a form, because although the success, the plan was based on resources.
He told me he would get every help he could get.
And I was there for this help.
But when I left Tony, I felt the shock and the moon of the doors that were in front of me.
I felt the weight of the discovery that I could sit in one night, where for hundreds of people were half a trillion dollars, and in another room, two days later, only 50 blogs in the street, there's a living person without a teacher to get her only conversation at that day.
And it wasn't the inequal inequality that made me want to wait, it wasn't the thought of kids and moral, it wasn't the extension of one or a 99.
No, what I've invented was that I finally realized that I was the intervention for a country that had a device.
I realized that my story was about all of those who wanted to bring themselves out of the shoes, even if they didn't have shoes; that my organization was going to go for all the Chinese Chinese sector who had never come to come to IChile or the beginning of the age of the beginning that my voice had seen too much more than all of these voices, much less than a home.
And the name of this, the mother was pushing me like the mother of sitting in the TV, to expect in January Mexico is about the month and over and over again.
I was working on me, put me out.
But this time, the morning was me.
You see, I went through a long way from the wind at night that I thought that the world was expensive, from the world where people were talking to different and suffering as a conventional action of God and they were trying to text as a safe.
Yes, I got so far that I went back in a place where I started.
Because it's just not the truth to say that we're living in a age of infaith -- not, we believe today just like every time before.
Some of us may believe in Bernon's son's bank or Tony Ross.
We may believe in the DNA of the New York City is coming up or the Robert in House House.
We may believe in the belief that when we're really curious here in the TED Talk, but we want to believe, we need to believe.
We're talking about various leaders of critical leaders that ensure to solve all of our problems.
We're seeing a tremendous action of capitalism that is our alcohol, we take the text of technology progress as a joke.
And we're at the end of seeing the human price that we pay when we're able to ask one person, because we're afraid that it may be unfortunately our secrets.
But if you're trained from the necessary things that we get, then it has to be time for questions.
So I don't have a teacher of change or invention or a final teacher.
I don't have a teacher to share with you today, actually.
I've got a teacher and I'm offering a teacher.
The teacher of the book doesn't ask you to stop believe, is that you're going to believe in a new thing: it's possible to believe.
It's possible that the answer we have. It's possible that the questions themselves are wrong.
Yes, the meaning of the book is that it's possible that we, on the stage, in this room, wrong.
Because it brings the question, "Why?"
With all the power that we spend in our hands, why are people still suffering so much?
This book leaves me to share that we, we're living my organization, MBA to the Amazon of America.
We've been published from our team and we've made our dogs and we're going to take our model in freedom with anyone who will see their power to do this work without waiting for our feelings.
This book enabled me to give me the role of motivation that some of you have given me, because our time is too short and our risks are too long to wait for the second house, when the truth is that there's not a plane.
And this concept, it's fun me, it gives me hope that our service will move on us, as we're going to see that the same way that we've got to our failure, when the French doesn't bring back to our surprises, it's not going to be the faith of our creation -- it's going to
Thank you.
Thank you.
In most of the jobs, obviously you can get you, whether you're in a crisis, inability, or just worse performance.
But what if your work is the most powerful crisis in the United States, or in the world?
Here's where the dead is to prove.
It's not the same thing as a meter.
It's a similar way to a child in a sentence, it's just the faith that's developed the sentence, which can be on the top of an hour or a car.
It's a teacher in England, it's been able to enable a service for the student to vote to the Pwitter of the government's government even without the president.
Even though it was an important crisis on the power of the power, the next can't be worried because the third is sitting in the study of all the government power.
But for American refugees, there was no more high school than people themselves.
And that's how it's going to prove an extinction in the United States as a power of Congress has been reduced to every public job, and including the president.
Despite the demand to propose can come from every friend in the public, just to the adults have the power to start the process.
It's starting by the law of the Lady School, usually the Science Western Western Western War.
The laws look at the halls, look at the evidence, and they're going to be able to look at the edge.
If they find enough material to continue, the house is doing the evening on all the apartment in France, what's known as the conversation.
If one or more of them go in most simple, the public worker goes to the conversation and what's known to the sentence.
The sentence itself that's when it's been reduced by the president to enhance in Senate.
The friends of the house, who are known as managers, are working in a minute, while we're going to have a conversation and because we've learned the gene.
The Senate works as a sentence and also as a crisis, a sentence and a lawyer after all the patterns.
If it's the president or the president that's going to be able to prove, the top president of the oil is as a head.
The hour requires most special of two thirds and you're a car train.
In addition to the original aspects, it can also reduce them to keep a choice in the future and enable them to predict them to a repair.
So what can you just make a prosthetic of someone?
It's a little bit more complicated.
In Canada to England, it's been reduced to prove in the United States as a decline in front of others's connection in the government, who've been tested in democratic way.
So, in order to prevent the process to be political weapons, the diversity of reminds that you can only have a lot of conversation on the age, fear, or another serious crisis.
It's still leaving a lot of place for innovation, not to remind politics, and a lot of the crisis of the demand was taken between the parasites.
But in general, the process is enabled to a significant meaning of power.
The first one that was going to prove was the San Tasmanian and William Berbert in 1997 on a listening to a relationship with Britain to search for control the Science of Iran.
Since then, the rich house evolved in the walls of the decline for about 60 times, but only 19 was invited to the strength.
And the cases that were scared in the hour and the conversation from the job were everyone's job judgments.
And the president of president are even more rare.
Andrew Janson was allowed to prove 1868 on trying to replace the Washington Washington Washington without an accident in San.
More than a hundred years later, Bill Clinton was going to propose on the road under a week during the right president.
They're both going to be collected, when the vote of the Senate's vote is going to have a fabric of a second third.
And in addition to the wind belief, Richard Nigerian has never been so excited about the French of Western Western.
He's taken before it could happen in the event that he's going to be almost in the security.
Social, the United States of the United States is designed to prevent power, and it's increased by a variety of different parts of the water and the algae, the limits of prosperity, and free freedom.
But the conversation can be able to take a lot of time when the customers are failed.
In the case you're wondering, no, I'm not wearing that, and not, I'm not going to say what I'm wearing under.
It's Chicago.
It's the National Center in my country.
So you spend all the men in cancer.
So for our women.
It's like our women, we're also the men to wear collapse colors, but in different than the women, we've got to push our legs.
So our national web is unique, but it's not the only thing in my country.
Our conversation to stay with a NASA is also unique, and that's how I want to talk about today, our conversation to stay with a NASA.
But before I continue, I have to tell you about the background that's behind it.
I have to tell you our story.
In cancer, it's a small country in the Himalaya.
We've made us Grandha, or even the last Grand.
But let me tell you here and now, we don't get rid.
I've been a media is not one big weird of galleries that's happy.
It's in reality, we're focused on 700,000 people and extended between the most general countries in the world, China and India.
The truth is that we're a small country and uncomfortable and we're doing all we can survive.
But we live not bad. We survive.
In fact, we're glad, and the reason for regret is that we're going to look at cities from the general.
Our anonymous trials were working without the doors to develop our country, to fill economic growth against the evolution of the environment, and it's useful in the culture, and it's all in a healthy region.
We're called this French French's "Olympic" or "Good."
In the past, it's been known in 1970s because we've spent the fourth quarters of the Central Amazon, a Golden of GDP, we've become more important than the GDP.
So since then, all of the development activity in cancer, is driven by "Good, a half vision that's going to improve the red and most of the chicken's face.
But it's easy to say, and it's hard to do, especially when it's in the country with one of the smallest economies in the world.
Our local product is looking at two billion dollars.
I know that some of you are more equally equal -- laughter to you, from my country's economy.
So our economy is small, but here's what it's going to be interesting.
Education is free.
All citizens get free education to the car and those who work hard education on free traits.
Social discovery is free.
Social treatment, medical care, drugs: all of these are made by the country.
We're able to do this because we're using our limited resources at speed, and also because we're left to the top of "worry," which is open with values.
Our economy is small and we have to wait.
The economic growth is important, but it's not that economic growth will come up with our unique imagination or on our privilege.
Today, we've been reduced from a rise.
We're going to push our art and our architecture, the national and the National and the National, Nigerians and strangers.
And yes, we're also killing our national weapon.
That's why I'm going to wear my gene.
Here's a rich fact: you're looking at the largest poet in the world.
But it starts here, goes behind the back, and it repeated here.
In this pocket, we're feeding all kinds of personal objects from mobile phones and parks and so on in Japanese, wearing out of hands and books.
But sometimes -- it's also a valuable metaphor.
So we've taken a dog, and that's how our nature is.
72 percent of us are foreign.
Our agriculture requires 60 percent of all the states of cancer will stay in every single time.
Thank you very much for our exploration, this concept, we need a forest.
By the way, our brand was used the same way to move us to democracy.
We realized, we were the people we didn't want democracy.
We didn't understand democracy, we didn't take it and on the surface that we didn't wait for a service.
Unfortunately, we're going to have a democracy in this way that we've been looking at it in the constitution.
And he did beyond that.
It's usually in a conservative conference that's going to be able to reduce the screen, and the partners that require you to go out to the middle of 65.
So we've got one of you in the Marian: We've got the Greek, the big four years ago when he's in his popular restaurant.
He was at the same 51 in the time.
So as I mentioned earlier, 72 percent of our ancestors are forests, and all these forests are primary.
That's why we've got a ridiculous biological diversity, which is very few areas in the world, and it's also why to the fingerprint in our country.
In the planet under climate change, we're a country with a NASA carbon carbon.
It turns out it's a Darg.
Over about 200 countries in the world today, makes sure that we're the only country, at the age of a NASA.
It's actually not really accurate.
In cancer, it's not about a NASA's carbon.
In cancer, it's a negative carbon.
We've created 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide, but our forests use three times more than that, so we're like a Nigerian Center for over seven million tons of carbon in every year.
But it doesn't play it.
So we're making the green electricity that we're producing from our farmers.
So today, the green energy that we're producing, is a platform of a five-million tons of fear in our face.
By 2020, we can create enough energy energy energy to add up to 17 million tons of carbon dioxide.
And if we're going to win forever the potential of our atmosphere, and that's how we're scared, the green energy that we're producing, you're going to be able to reduce something from the size of 50 million tons of carbon tons per year.
It's more fear of what's created in New York City last year.
So within our country, we're going to play a conference to a fingerprint.
And out of it, we're spending in the boundaries that are made.
And it's a big meaning.
Look, the world's going to become more hot, and climate change are the reality.
The climate change affects me.
Our curiosity is focused on, and they make the customers and the rivers, which are responsible for disasters and killed in the world.
I went to visit this also not time.
It's from the biographic.
So he'd see 10 years ago, and so he would see 20 years ago.
Just 20 years ago, this also wasn't there.
He was a curiosity for them.
A couple of years ago, I'll also get rid of his sisters and made a tremendous price in the face of his face.
This reference was also one curious curiosity.
We have 2700 of these.
And the point is, my country and her husband didn't have any of the global warming process, but we're talking about the walls of his arms.
And for a small country, the top and not products, it's very hard.
But we're not sitting in hands and uncomfortable.
We fight climate change.
So we looked at the rest of a NASA.
We first looked at this in 2009 during K.C. 15 in the Canadan, but nobody noticed it.
The governments were so scared in one conversation with the other and the other person in climate change, which is a little bit of the arm of the hand, "We're going to stay with a fear of a NASA," No one heard.
Nobody would care.
In an explanation that's been in France, in K.C.1, we've come back on our test to stay with a NASA's coal.
This time, we heard us.
We've spent our lives, and they'd all care.
And what was different in the chimpanzee is that governments were used and taught to get climate change are reality, and they would be familiar to cooperate and cooperate.
All of the countries, the smallest, is conducted to reduce the fossil refugees.
The United States of climate change means that if these conversations are going, we can keep climate change under just two degrees.
By the way, I asked the TED Talk to define the animal here in two degrees, so if some of you feel that's out of the age, you know who to feed.
It's the advice that we're all born in our test.
In all the moment to cancer, we're going to be focused on our test.
Here's some of our ways to do that.
We're telling free electricity for cities in the rural areas.
And the idea that my brother is that if there's a free electricity, they wouldn't survive there for their long-term choice.
We're investing in sustainable transportation and electrical weapons.
Like, we're based on the price of a child's price, and our governments are trying to work without a function.
We're driving the whole country as part of the national plan: in the ocean, and we're moving objects around the Earth as part of the ocean cancer is also a national project.
But our genius areas are the case of strategy to sell on a NASA.
These areas are the president of our carbon.
They're our lungs.
Today, at the top of our country are limited areas: international parks, nature and animals live together.
And the beauty of this is that we've been looking at these areas with each other with a biological network.
That means that our animals are free to measure around the planet.
This horrible for example.
We'll first look at the 250 miles over the sea on the jungle and the fossil ecosystems.
Two years later, the same virus just looks at 400,000 miles in our critical areas.
It's true that it's about?
[Applause] We've got to keep it like this.
We've got to sell our extinctions.
So every year we're treating resources to the president or unfortunately, the budget or pollution in the French or pollution, and they're getting resources in order to help the limits of the French's forests to manage their foreign forests, to transform climate change, and we're going to have a high quality of
But it's not cheap.
For the next few years, our small economy will reduce the resources to reduce the requirements of the requirements to sell our environment.
In fact, if you do the beetle seems to take us at least 15 years until we can admit our advances to the environment.
But in cancer, like every other country can't deal with the street of 15 years.
So it's why it's been reduced to the fabric of cancer.
In cancer, we have the time we need it.
It's given us a conventional profit.
It's actually a training mechanism that's designed to protect our insects, until the government can deal with the telescope.
The idea is to raise money beyond objects, corporations and institutions, but the money is only done if some conditions exist and all of the participants are going to happen.
So it's one thing between some causes: an idea of the Wall Street.
What it means that independent patterns can have without worry that they're support a program with a training training.
It's kind of a text project, just with food for 15 years and millions of carbon tons that are on the park.
Once the prosperity is repeated, we're using the magazine to define our insects, and we're going to give our government time to defend it to the end of the 15 years.
At the end of the period, the government has to worry about trust here and her sister.
We're almost there.
We're going to be able to switch the prosthetic later this year.
Actually, I'm pretty excited.
Thank you very much for the World Bank to live is our main language in this journey, and I want to admit them from a heart of the exact work that they're doing in cancer and around the world.
Thank you. Wow, we're going to do a really hot map.
I'm excited to you about the story of our story, the story about how we're going to stay with a NASA, the story about how we're looking at nature in our country, for us, for our children, for your children and the world that we're going to stay in.
But we're not here to tell stories, right?
We're here to dream together.
So to summarize, I want to share with you one other dream I have.
What if we can admit the bridge and our resources, our impact and our passion, to apply the idea of cancer for other countries so that they can also sell their regions into the future.
After all, there's a lot of countries that are facing our identical challenges.
They also have a nature of nature that can help the global struggle for sustainability, just that they don't have the ability to invest in hope.
So what if we take the Earth into life, a global curiosity for the ideas of cancer to live around the world.
I invite you to help me, define this dream out of the boundaries we gave for all of those who worry about our planet.
After all, we're here to dream together, act together, fight climate change together, protect our planet together.
Because the reality is that we're all great at the same situation.
Some of us may be scared in a different way, but we're all in the same boat.
Thank you very much, Ghana. Thank you very much.
Applause) Thank you, thank you. Thank you.
The things that means here are my scientists and they don't expect the consciousness or the policy of any surprise.
So I'm a color.
I believe in the hole and the room.
I'm in the very courage of a police and a soldier from Marian and a library.
I believe in a responsibility, and we all need to be safe in our community.
I love my job and the people who do it.
I just think it's our responsibility to do it better.
In the front of you, until 25, we've done one of the next things: France in school, comes into a place where his wife said in the France, or she's got to go into the top of the top?
It's okay.
How many of you have been scared? We've studied not rules or go from a chicken -- yes, even with a couple of people?
Now, how many of you will ever find one day in prison because of these decisions?
How many of you who are sitting here today think they're a training for the public or you have to define them by the same kind of crazy moments?
But the point was built.
When we're talking about French French, we're usually focused on a number of things, and that's what I want to talk to you today.
But first -- as a idea that you're going to change me, I'm going to compare you.
I went to school to the sentences to do money.
I didn't have any lawyer to be a public service I didn't have any lawyer in the French sentence, and I certainly didn't think I was nature.
I'm close to my first year at school to the details, I've been inevitable in the court for local buildings in Mexico.
I knew most magic is that a coffee in the Boston, the dog of weapons and drugs.
My life and my critical career changed that first day of the illness.
I went into the sentence room, and I saw a room full of people after one after the other, they were going to go to the park of the sentence to say two words and two words just: "I'm not there."
They were mostly black and holes.
And then a judge, Sannouncer and accumulate decisions make decisions on the same person without hearing their knowledge.
They were particularly white.
When they gave one of the room, I couldn't think, how did they come in?
I wanted to know their stories.
And when the nature called the facts of every case, I thought to myself, we could predict it.
It looks so much like this.
It's not because I've been a reference for the French, but because of a simple sense.
Over the transformation, I started to identify people in the room, not because they were sophisticated, but because they were able to ask us to help and we were sending them without help.
My second year in school at school, I was working as a lawyer of School, and for this experiment I met a lot of young men who were left in the kitchen.
Even in the worst "we asked, I saw human stories.
Everybody's going to have a childhood train, called "Hey," which, "which, every school," is accurate with the police and the French system, "everybody's focused on the court."
These are the ones that were born in the kitchen, we were trying to finish their lives at the end of the river, and it was during my emotions with the same men that I couldn't get so much money to get this person at the end of the next 80 years when we're all going to invest it from all of this to the beginning.
Thank you for the third year in my school in the school, I've been asked about people who were in the street street streets, most of them suffer from mental illness, most of them, most of them need help.
They would come to us, and we would send them without help.
They needed our aid.
But we didn't call them any aid.
They were born, scanned and got to define by people who didn't know about them.
The amazing activity is what led me to work in the French sentence.
The instruments that came to me to want to be a curiosity.
The forces that I think about them have made me be nature.
I don't want to spend a long time to talk about the problem.
We know that the French system needs refugee, we know that 2.3 million people are powerful in the production of America, which means that makes us a country with the largest library in the world.
We know there's seven million other people who are in the table or confident of journalism, we know that the Palestinian sentence system in people who are unproductive, especially in people who are poor.
And we know there's failure everywhere in the system that bring people to our sentence.
But what we don't predict is: How many of the events are the collapses that are.
When we're talking about French in the French system, we're as a company focused on three things.
We're branding, we're creative, we're happy about the police, on the lawyers?
Just rare, if at all, we're talking about nature.
In September 2009, a young man was killed by a bank in Boston.
He was 18 years old, he was an American army and he was in the last night in one of the public schools.
He's planning to go to school in Kenya, but he'd been scared in the Minister of Minister, he didn't stop the economic possibility of the economy, he needed to go for his studio.
In a spinning of some bad decisions, it's 30-computer computers and sell them on the Internet.
It led to a regulation and a regulation on a road that's 30s.
It's the most popular time for him, it's that he's going to pushing the worst Chris.
But he had a very regular understanding of the effect that would be reduced to the future.
I've been interested in the same day when the case of Chris's career was thrown on my destruction.
Despite the risk I'd heard a dramatic, at the same moment, a future of Chris was in my hands.
I was 29 years old, a completely new nature, and I had a understanding of how the decisions that I would have been going to get on the life of Chris.
The case of Chris was crazy and he had to treat it like this, but I didn't think that our grandfather was the right answer.
Unfortunately, colors come into a role with a little bit of the implications of our decisions, not to call our code.
Despite the extension that we have, we learn to avoid risks in any price, make our scientific voice actually value.
The history has changed us to believe that somehow, that the French system brings back to the responsibility and reduce the public security, although the evidence of the opposite.
We're taking faces and except by our beliefs and we're going to get in our details, so we don't really care about being creative in our case, or take risks for people that we wouldn't take.
We're testing in the techniques that's been sold, that's caused to be the same result that we want to get, which is more safe communities.
But it's most of the colors that were going on in the commercial would be addicted to their Chris.
They've got a restaurant of what we can do.
The hour of Chris is leaves to French, what it's hard to get a job, what's going to avoid a Google that's going to define the rules of the French system today.
With a French and work, Chris wouldn't be able to find a mistake, education or a coffee.
Without these magazines in his life, there's a higher environmental environments that France will be done in a more compassionate crime.
The more you're going to have a better village to communicate with the French system, the more likely it's going to come back and over and over again -- all of that in a huge price for his friends, to his family, and his friends.
And ladies and gentlemen, it's a result of the public security of all of us.
When I finished the school for refugees, I did the same thing that everybody did.
I've come out of a color that's going to do justice, but I've never learned what it's right -- but one of us's not learning.
But one of us is not learning.
And yet, the colors are the players who are very powerful in the French sentence.
Our power is actually unlimited.
In most cases, not the judge, not the police, not the crisis, not the mayor, not the mayor, the president and the president can tell us how to play our games.
The decision to predict Chris Darwin and open it was in my face.
I would decide whether I'm going to predict it for 30 degrees, one choice on a pale, or if at all.
I would decide whether to enable a business village or take the case to the sentence, and eventually I'm going to ask that Richard would go to the river.
These are decisions that are doing every day without any limits, and we're not aware and unhappy to implement the weight of these decisions.
One night in the last summer, I was in a small meeting of men in the city globe.
As I'm going to go there, and I'm going to get a little bit of smaller machines as you're doing as a public service -- and I've looked at the other side of the room, in a young man who's driving me, from your life and you're going to come up with me.
And I mentioned it, just I couldn't get out of the speed, and before I realized what's going on, this young man scared me.
And I was told.
"You'd care about me, and you've made my life."
It was a career.
You see, I've never learned to make a Chris.
He's never going to have a judge or a prison, he'd never had a repair.
Instead, I've been working with Chris; first of all you would take responsibility on his own, and then, put it in a situation where it wouldn't happen again.
We got back 75 percent of the computers that he's caught and reduced them to Bay, and we've designed a financial program how it's going to pay for those computers that we didn't.
We got back. Chris did jobs.
He wrote a job where he was looking at how this case could affect future and the future of the community.
He'd come from Kenya to college. He's got an economic aid, and he's going to end up with radio in Virginia.
And I saw that Shadn't been scared, I looked at his name, and I saw that France was a big bank in the Boston.
Chris came to be killed -- and it's much more money than me -- and it's been able to get all of this in the six years since I saw it in the Frank.
I can't give myself a curiosity on the journey to succeeding of Chris, but I've never done my parts to keep it on the road.
There's thousands of muscles there out there, some of them are in our boundaries and our prison.
We need thousands of colors to make it and we've got them.
Chris is a good business for the public security more than when it's bad.
It's a larger range of all of us.
In a back view, the decision that doesn't move with Chris looks completely sense.
When I saw him for the first time in the February February, I didn't see an accident here.
I saw myself -- a young man who needs intervention.
When you take a big amount of drugs in my late late lab, I knew from the first concept of the opportunity in the corner of the French system.
While the way, you've come up and the way of my unique nature, my picture and the judgments, I learned the power of nature to change life rather than kill them.
And that's how we're in the Boston.
We've come to a woman who's been scared because a teenager needs to feed her children to find a job.
Instead of put a teenager from a teenager who had been in prison in prison for adults because he was looking at another adult, we were going to have a mental treatment and joined in the community.
A child who's joined from the house that was scared because I worked in the streets to survive in the streets, we've got a safe place to live and a big place where -- something that we could help her.
I even finished a young man who was so afraid to go after school in the children's lives of one last week instead of put a blog in the baseball, he's there 9 miles from a car.
We've got the time that we've had to make our babies for months on a sentence to find real solutions for problems.
What is the best way to use our time?
How would you expect your colors to use their time?
Why do we spend 80 billion dollars on the river industry we know that it's possible, when we're all going to take this money and bring it to education, for freedom, treatment treatments and investment in the community so that we can develop our neighborhoods?
So why would it have you?
Well, for the first reason, because we spend a lot of money.
Our money.
In some countries, it's going to go 100,000 dollars to a remote camp for a year, with 60 percent of this person to come back to the same system.
It's a terrible passion to happen.
A second reason: It's the right thing to do.
If the colors were part of the problem, it's connected to be part of the solution and we can do it with other disciplines that have already been collected and studied the data for us.
And a third reason: Your voice and your vote can make it happen.
The next time you're going to exist in the choices of the Egyptian fingerprint in your judgment, ask the leaders of the next questions.
One: What do you do so I and my neighbors become safe?
Two: If data you collect, and how do you train your colors to make sure it works?
And three: If it doesn't work for everyone, what do you do to fix it?
If they can't answer these questions, they're not supposed to do this work.
Every one of you who showed his hand at the beginning of this talk is a living and a living example of the opportunity, of the intervention of support and love.
While every one of you have a different model of meaning about the choice that you've spent, one of you're going to get one day in prison to do you with people that you're today -- some of the biggest brains in the universe.
Every day, thousands of times a day, collapses around the United States are so powerful that can bring to the asteroid, at the same speed that it can bring an opportunity, intervention, support and yes, even love.
These possibilities are the price of a powerful community, and a powerful community is a safe community.
If our communities are in generations, but let's make sure that you've been able to fix them with innovation, not effective and curiosity.
You're going to take more; you're going to get the color that helps people stay out of the prison, not that there's them in the face.
Good better.
You're coming to you, you're coming to your kids, you're coming to people who are connected to the system, but more of all the people we've been able to protect them and do them with justice requires it.
We have to do better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
In India, we have huge families.
I'm an intervention that many of you have heard about it.
What means there's a lot of family events.
So as a girl, my parents would get me to these family events.
But the only thing I've ever seen was to play with my animals.
And there was always one measure that was there, always ready, jumping with us, a game with us, give us the kids to really enjoy.
This man was really successful, he was safe and lucky.
But then I saw that person in this bear from a healthy room.
He was diagnosed with Frankson.
Frank is a disease that's caused by the nervous system, which means that this person who was independent all of a sudden products like a coffee coffee, because it's much more difficult.
It's kind of started to use the high school to go, and to go, it really had to take one step every time, like this, and it took a lot of time.
So this man, who was a heart of attention in every family meeting, all of a sudden came behind people.
He came from the extinctions of people.
And it's not the only one in the world.
Every year, 60,000 people are diagnosed with Frankson, and this book just costs.
As designers, we're sharing that our creatures will solve these complex problems, one solution that will change everything, but it doesn't always have to be that way.
You can also focus on simple problems and create small solutions for them and finally create a big impact.
So my argument here was not to reduce France Frankson, but to do their daily techniques to a lot more simple, and then create change.
Well, the first thing I've focused on was dead, right?
My friend told me that he'd stop a coffee, or she's in the public just a woman, so, I've designed a plane that didn't stop.
It's just working on its form.
It's over a mirror repeat back in the face every time they have a quarter, and it's reminded on the walls of a normal telescope.
But the key here is that it's not scared as a chair for Frankson Frankson.
It looks like a glass that you're going to have, to me, every single person from a restaurant, and it's doing it much more than they're going to use, to get rid.
So, well, one problem has evolved, a lot more to solve.
All of this time, I've seen it, I've been looking at it, and then I realized I've got very scared information, or just answers to my questions.
But I really had to get a deeper story to get a new perspective.
So I thought, well, I'm going to look at my life today, as I'm going to have food, as it's here on TV.
And then, when I really looked at him going to the table of his food, it's so excited to me, this man who's found it so hard to go on the ground, how does it move in the stairs?
Because in India, we don't have a beautiful piece to take you in the stairs like this in developing countries.
People actually need to fly on the stairs.
So he said to me, "Well, I'm going to show you how I do it."
Let's look at what I saw.
So he took him a very long time to get to the moon, and then all this time, I think, "Oh my God, would he really do that?
Is it really, really going to do it without high school? "
And then...
And it turns out, it's got them so easily.
So -- are you in the market?
Well, I was also.
So this person who couldn't go on the land of a sudden suddenly became a prototype of stairs.
When I looked at it, I realized it's because it's a traffic movement.
There's another man who also suffers from those symptoms and uses the high school, but once he's going on the bicycles all the fossil fuels, because it's a motion movement.
So the key for me was to transform this sense of going on the stairs back to a train.
And many ideas were born on it, but it worked at the end of this.
Let's take a look.
So I call it the stairs of the stairs, and in fact, the staircase of the stairs have all of a sudden, it's called a step.
So it's happening a lot, so why don't the stairs get out of all their faces, and make them feel much more safe?
You know, technology is not always the solution.
What we need is solutions that are based on blood.
I could easily turn it into a curiosity, on Google Gates, or something like that.
But I wanted to focus on a simple pattern on the floor.
The printing can take a hospital to make them feel harder.
What I hope to do is make every patient Frankson feel like my cousin felt that day.
He told me that I made him feel like himself again.
"You're in the world of today, it's going to be a post of a task, and the world just gets more than every day.
But why can't you be something simple and still effective?
All we need is a little bit of empathy and a little bit of curiosity, to get out there, to see.
But let's not stop it.
Let's find these complex problems.
They're not afraid of them. We're just getting them to a lot more small problems, and then they have simple solutions.
We're looking at these solutions, we're going to have, but with new insights to do them better.
Imagine what we could do if we were all very simple solutions.
How would the world be if we took all these simple solutions?
Let's make a more sophisticated world, but with spread.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Are you good as you think you're?
How good are you good in the money?
What about taking the emotions of people?
How many healthy are you unique to other people you know?
Are you better than the average person on a test?
Our capabilities and the way we've been able to be able to those of other people, it's more than a self-esteem.
It's helping us understand when we can move on our decisions and our intuitive, and we need to ask.
But a psychological study argues that we're not really good at the accuracy of ourselves.
In fact, we're a lot of times that we're going to move ourselves into the field.
Scientists have there to this phenomenon, an analogy effect.
This effect explains why more than 100 studies have shown that people are indicated with motivated lines.
We're looking at ourselves as better than others to reduce the math rules.
When you're planning in two companies, they've been asked to draw their performance, 32 percent of engineers in one society and 42 percent in another hand put themselves in the top five percent.
In another study, 88 percent of the Americans get themselves as high as the average leaders.
It's not a fabric.
In average, people tend to kill themselves as better than most of the areas like health, leaders, leadership, ethics and more.
What's particularly interesting is a question with the most powerful capacity is that most of those who are likely to be reduced as their parents will move on the scale.
People who're really bad at the confident of the philosophy, look, physics, emotionally, emotional intelligence, medical experiences, and they're all tend to kill their experts almost like experts revealed themselves.
So who's the most likely to get this illusion?
Unfortunately all of us, because we've all have fuels of inability that we're not aware of.
But why?
When the psychologists of analogy and the microbial will first describe the effect in 1999, they've shown that people who are missing knowledge and skills in some parts are suffering from a crowd.
First of all, they're doing mistakes and responding to bad objects.
But Second, those objects also know from them to search their mistakes.
In other words, my husband can be reduced by the primary experts to identify how bad they are.
For instance, when the studies are participated in Tordan's experience in general, the toilet that require in the last decade in academic homes were almost four of every five.
But they thought they were almost 60 percent of them.
Without a deep understanding of the creative idea, the students just couldn't recognize when and what their genes were created.
Dang Tang effect is not a question of the way that makes us blind to our friends.
People are usually focused on their solutions once they're aware of them.
In one study, students in the beginning, they got a bad piece in the blog and then take a short restaurant was pretty ready to draw their original actions as bad.
Maybe because for people with a amount of experiment or expertise has less security in their capabilities.
They know enough to know that there's a lot that they don't know.
Unfortunately, experts tend to be aware of their knowledge.
But they're often doing different mistakes: they're sending all the other ones are knowledge.
The result is that people, whether they're unemployed or high expertise, many times we're going to get in the morning of inevitable self-concept.
When they don't contract, they can't see the memories of themselves.
When they're high, they don't understand how much they're extraordinary.
So if an Iranian effect looks invisible to those who experience it, what can you do to apply your children in different ways?
First of all, you've been asked from other people, and they've been listening to them, even if it's hard to hear.
Second, and more importantly, they went to learn.
As we're more knowledge, we've got less likely to have invisible holes in our capacity.
Maybe it's all about the future sentence: when you're planning with freedom, first and that the other person doesn't do the same thing.
Well, this is a story about how we know what we know.
It's a story about this woman, Nigeria Richard.
It's biological, what means is that it's dealing in the rules of really ancient things.
[Nigeria Richard]: Yes, there were some called me already "Derek things die."
Latch Nazi: And I think it's particularly interesting because of the places where it's reducing these things a lot more than the Arctic, in the conservative rare.
Now, one summer in 2006, she worked in a restaurant website called FFELA, which was found as 10 degrees of the fingerprinting.
[Video: Really, it's not going to sound so exciting, because it was another day of the lab with your GPS and a friend and a piece of everything I'm going to be happy.
LG: And at some point, she noticed something.
[Video] NG: This dream, something in a dream of a dream, about the size of my hand.
It's just about the surface.
LS: And in the first thought, it thought it was just a tree, because it's the kind of things that people found there in FFLED -- parts of historical plants.
But at the same night, when back to the computer.
[Video:]]]]]]:]... -- I'm looking at the skin]]]] []]] &#
Maybe it's a matter of the night, but it looks just like.
Obviously.
LG: Ha. So over the next four years, she went back to the same point again and again, and at the end of the 30 men of the same object exactly, many of them are very small.
RG: It's not so much. You can put it all into a series of Richard.
LG: And she was trying to connect together the bees like a fingerprint.
But it was a challenge.
[Video: It's a song for so many beautiful pieces, I'm trying to use a beach and in MK, and it doesn't look good.
So at the end, we've used a dozen weapons.
LG: Oh! OK: Yeah, ah?
Laughter) LS: It turns out that it's much easier to do it in Tony.
[VG: It's kind of magic, once it's connected together.
LG: How many of you were safe that was looking at everything right, that trained all the parts right?
Would you be a potential that you would put it in a different way and have them, say, "or something?
Laughter) []] []]]]]]] []]]]]]] &#
We've got it. LT: What she had, she discovered, she had a bone, a foot, and a slide, one that was scared with a fabric, so something like a France or a woman.
But it can't be one of those.
It was just too big.
OK: The size of this thing, it was huge.
It was really a huge animal. LT: So what would this animal be?
After a summer in the summer, she showed one of the men to her colleagues in Kenya, and they had an idea.
[OK: We took a little bit, and we've just seen her end, and there's a really interesting conversation that's coming out of it.
LS: It's the smell like a kind of loud meat.
It was a guarantee that was an expert in a gorgean in her anatomy: collapse.
Hollyn is what's called our self.
And usually, after so many years, it comes out.
But in this case, the Arctic would play like a natural magazine and say it.
So a year or two years later, Nigeria was in Berlin in Brothern, and you'll see her voice called Michael Bay's new process, he called "Tim's". "
Science that different species have a little different structure of collapse, so if you get a microscope of an unknown object, you can compare it to the right species, and who knows, maybe you can get the accident.
So she sent him one of the men, in France.
[Too]: Yes, you want to track it.
It's a kind of important.
And he found the accident.
It turns out it's 3.5 million years old that Italy has been reduced in the high high school.
Good.
[]] []]]] []]]] []]]]]]
LS: So they looked at a number of men, and they got it a result for each other.
However, based on the size of the bone that they found, it means that that this flow was 30 percent of the modern rain.
So this wheel was about three meters, and it's about a tone.
[Audience]]]]]]]] Yes.
Nigeria came out of a huge axis.
And now, when you hear the word "Gabby," What you might think about is one of those, the Baki Bay's pool of East Asia.
But the risks are the galleries that you have in the brain is one of those, the dirty, the dirty, the creation of its own -- in the hot and water places like the Middle East and the Amazon, it has a big dog on the road to the rise of the rivers in the same thing, it has big emotions and big moments to help him to help it in the rule
So how did one of those came to the high school?
Well, scientists knew a long time, it turns out, even before the discovery of Nigeria, that ants are actually in American crisis.
[music: The American design] []]]]]]]]:]]]] []] &#93
For almost 40 million years that ants were in the environment, you could find them just in North America, around 20 different species, maybe more.
[] LT: If you put them in the room, do they look different?
NG: Yeah, you'll have a different body.
You're going to have a few with a really long wall, so they're actually functioning like jihad.
LS: Some were extinctions, like a microscope.
[] NG: The French] Ramists were very small, almost like Arabic.
LP: What? What's the size of the size of the countries?
[]]]]]]]]]] []]]]]]]]
So these are probably not the same.
LG: Oh my God, I want an announcer from a class.
OK: I know, it wasn't great?
Laughter) LS: And then about three to seven million years ago, one cloud of the ants went to South America, where they became violence and thousands of pounds, and then reduced the bridge in Hawking into Asia and Africa.
And then around the end of the last summer, the ants of North America have gone.
So, scientists already knew all of this, but it still didn't explain how Nigeria was so expensive.
Like, it's, in terms of temperature, it's the opposite to the restaurant.
Now to be the genes, three and a half million years ago, there was more hot than 22 degrees of now.
So it was a famous forest, so more like the mayor or Turkey today.
But yet, as if, they had a half years of a year in which healthy were a pipeline.
You've had predators.
You've had 24 hours a day of spinning.
Like, how? How?
How is it that one of the asteroids of the restaurant could survive in the Arabic conditions?
And her colleagues think they have the answer.
And it's a kind of geography.
What if every neighborhood that we imagine that makes the wheel come to places like the restaurant, actually evolved to help him go through the frog?
What if these little legs are going to do not take on a blue, but on a song, like a kind of sang?
What if the dog -- which is big news for me, you don't know water, it's got rid of water, and it's there to help go to the wall of the sensor of the innovation, when food was rare?
And then, just later, a lot after he pushed the ground bridge, he's going to bring these extended features to the stage?
Like, for example, the continent may help the crowd in a smaller clinic because when you've got everything out of one place in one place, like, you know, you're going to have a gundane, say you don't need to measure all of your body.
So it's helping return the heat more easily.
It's this important idea, which seems like the profound to the basic stadium of the wheel can actually be proved to a high school.
Now, I'm not the first person to tell this story.
Others told him as a way to fill biological evolution or as an action of climate change.
But I love it for a completely different reason.
For me, it's a story of us, about how we see the world and we're about how it changes.
So I'm an artist.
And I learned, in fact, many of the scientists are also the president.
They're trying to understand the past.
They tell the history of the universe, of the planet, of life on this planet.
And the Turkey, you start with an idea of how the story goes.
[OK: We're spending stories and we're testing in them, like the road in the same thing, right?
It's a great story! It's completely convenient to it.
Obviously, it's always living there.
LG: But at any moment, you can find a small door.
You can learn a very small thing that's happy with you to return everything you thought you'd know.
Like, in this case, one scientist found one scientist of what she thought it was a tree, and because of that, science has a completely intuitive theory and a new way about how the Arab creatures looks like a book of San Street looks like what he looks like.
And for me, it became completely the way I think about the wheel.
It turned out to be a really creature that I was just going to come up with this one environment, to be this global telescope in the case, and it could get really everywhere.
Thank you very much. It's left.
My parents, my mom, what are you?
Okay, here, I have one of those here.
Laughter) So my grandfather came in from her normal work in all the music of Studio radio.
It's not even a conversation.
Anyway -- but really, my sister wrote a animal that our world's story is dynamic.
It requires our convenience to transform ourselves, reimagine.
[] Right, left? "
And really, we're all in a mirror of one object from seeing the world in a new way.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
[We're doing the day as we're bringing life -- Andrew Darwin] in 1997, the spaceship reduced] NASA's President's President []]]] &
But after a few days, something was completely changed.
The generation is great.
The Finstein actually made a difference: it was a conflict, but it didn't do her most important task.
What happened?
There was a blog, it turns out, in the training system.
All the operation system has something called a funding system that says to work on a few time to work on every task before it comes to another, and why to go.
When you do that right, computers go in the space between their different tasks, and so you create a illusion that they do everything at the same time.
But we all know what happens when things change.
For all of the faces, it can be a little bit about us.
Even computers can be beautiful.
If we learn about science behind computers maybe we've got ideas about human struggle in time.
One of the first actions is that all the time you're focusing on a metaphor is time you don't care about it.
For example, when you're looking at your email, you can switch all the consciousness, choose the most important.
After a treatment of it, repeat again on the process.
It makes sense, but there's a problem here.
It's called CO2 algorithms.
However, with a two-times, these things will take two times a time and have to do two times of them!
It means four times a job.
So the operating system for Nex was taken in a similar problem in 2003.
Nicx was killed every single one of her tasks to the important, and sometimes her husband had more time on the road than in the eye.
The advantage of the intuitive solution to the intuition of the programmers was to replace this uncomfortable number of "Disney" was less accurate about what to do right now, but it also also made it more time to do.
So if you're going to answer your email about what's important before, it can lead to the motor.
A threatening is three times more than the age of an hour is an hour for an hour.
You're still going to answer okay, or even in the way!
Unfortunately, sometimes and perceive things of perfect things can be the key to their own.
Another insight that's made of a thought is about one of the most common properties in the modern life: disorders.
When you thought it's going to continue one thing to another, it has to do the chimpanzees, to train the place where you'd be in one task, you'll get an old information from the memory and put a new information.
These actions have a price.
The phenomenon is that there's a fundamental generations between agencies and states.
To do a serious job says to reduce the refugees.
But it means to respond every time something goes.
These two principles are in a fundamental brain.
This moon allows us to decide where we want to put the balance.
It's the obvious solution is to reduce disorders.
It's a less clear solution is to jump them.
If you didn't have any prosperity or an email doesn't require more than a hour of an hour, let's say, that's exactly the evidence you need to look at them.
No more. In computer science, this idea is called the disorders.
Instead of deal with things when they happen -- Oh, the past is going?
Could you be stressed?
The summer went to the street? -- the system is fighting these disorders together on a couple of time you can give them a lot of time.
In 2013, the privilege of disorders came up with a series of my life's life of the mobile computers.
Because the privilege allows the system to test everything together, and then go back to the situation of a safe prison.
Like computers, so with us.
Maybe it's a similar approach to us, the users, to get back our computer, and bring us one of the wonderful things in the modern life: Did you try to improve your fingerprint and your phone? If, we're going to move on a road to make a life, a computer science that's going to make decisions, "You can get back to the human deci
You're going to have your hand, you're lucky chemicals to your head, and you're starting to eat.
You wouldn't know he was there, Iran didn't prove the red bar, a frog in the Piopia.
It's the goal, but this method is an important symbol that you're defined by your vaccine system, the main material of your body against pollution, disease and disease.
This system is an enormous network of cells, tissue and organisms, which really change the genes against every threat on your health.
In addition, you'll be important for billions of soldiers, viruses and agencies, that can become a thing that I'm just like a piano or a piece of design.
The immune system is looking at the genome of millions of blood cells, which are also known as satellites, those come from our bone.
These cells tend to go into the blood cycle and the space system, a network of generations that helps the body from insects and waste.
Our body is full of scores: there's 4,000 to 1,11,000 in every single Twitter of a person.
When they're wrong, refugees work like a stroke team, and they're reduced by the blood, the tables and the organisms for important symbols.
This system's mostly based on symbolists called anthropologists.
These molecular signals are on open and other materials, and they're exposing the walls.
Once the philosophers recognize them, take the regular response of the body just minutes to start acting.
There's a lot of different kinds of organisms on our bodies, so the response of the vaccine system needs to fit itself.
It means to depend on many different kinds of philosophers to deal with organisms in different ways.
Despite this direction, we're kind of sophisticated to two cell groups, which come up with unique action.
First of all, refugees reduce the response of the vaccine by sending a professor and a dancer to the blood.
As a question of them, they spend every recycling cell that they're scared, by his mother.
It allows you to reduce the analogy to identify the analogy that they're eating and bring this information to the other cells that really affect the genes, the refugees.
A group of refugees that's called TT cells are looking for the water cells and put them in the mirror.
In the meantime, SB cells and TT finds information that's collected from the normal anthropologists to start creating special proteins called genomes.
It's the regular gas: Every anthropin has a penguin that can connect to it like action and key, and reveal the discovery cells.
SB cells can create millions of these, which are then moving in the body and extended by the threat of the autonomous threat.
While all of this happens, muscles are familiar, like a high heat, they're actually the processes that are designed to help the response.
A more coal body is accumulated on microbes and lights to culture and spread because they're sensitive to their own.
And when the body cells are flow, they're releasing chemicals that make the fingerprint into the lights of education, what causes joint.
It's also transparency, that you've heard the walls and the cells.
Obviously, a vaccine response is always a threat in a few days.
It doesn't always avoid you to spend, but it's not its goal.
Her real work is to prevent the threat to remove to a certain amount of fun in your body.
And through a conservative device over time, the immune system gives us another device: it helps us develop a long-term vaccine.
When SB cells and T recognizes anthropologists, they can use this information to identify popular women in the future.
So when a threat comes back, the cells can spread the right genes to deal with it, before it affects other cells.
So you can develop curiosity to certain diseases, like wind events.
It doesn't always work well.
Some people have autonomous diseases, which make the immune system reduce the healthy cells of the body.
Nobody knows exactly what makes it, but these disorders are conducted in the vaccine system in different times, and it's about problems like a fingerprint, I'm a common concept.
But for most people, a healthcare system of fighting success in 300 agencies, and there's no possible pollution in life.
In addition, these organisms will be able to something much more dangerous.
So the next time you're going to take a plane or you're going to have a blueprint, think about the immune system.
We have to have our lives.
I'm going to come from one of the most popular places, sufficient, and early in the United States, Satatch Washington.
And I grew up with a family of great Satatatrian people.
My mom was an artist, my father was a professor in college, and I'm really grateful about how I've been talking to me, because I've always felt completely uncomfortable in design just like I've seen for the risk.
And in fact, I took a way that was not exactly what my parents thought.
When I was 19 years old, I was married from college -- I was married, I was a lot of noise.
And I went to a way of playing a professional French player, which was a dream of my life.
I've built a musician music all over the United States and Europe, and I've been at the end of a couple of years with Benn January called Charlie Berley.
And by the end of my 20th century, I got to be a friend of the Minister's reference of Berna School.
What life is great.
And you know, my parents have never seen.
They'll put me all the way.
It wasn't their dream.
They would say to their boys and their friends, "Our son, he takes a decade of a decade."
And -- there was, with that, one strange conversation about my life that I want to tell you about.
I was 27 years old, and I was at Berkelin, and I looked at my parents to the front, and I spent a dinner with my mom, and we were alone in the kitchen.
And she was a cartoon, which was too sick.
Something was wrong.
And then I said, "Oh, what do you think?"
And she said, "Your father and I'm really worried about you."
And I said, "What?" I mean, what can it be, at this point?
And she said, "I want you to be completely honest with me: Is it the four to the French of French?"
But now, the truth is. I wasn't completely political, I just was a French French.
But I had a little bit, and they put it, and it made a little bit of a bone.
You see, I became a prototype, and I want to tell you what it is.
It's an interesting thing that's going on over my life, believe or not, right.
We realized, when I was a child and I grew up in the atmosphere, I remember the first time I saw real poverty.
We've been a family of the lowest class, but of course it's not real.
It's not even close.
The first time I've seen poverty, and the poverty, was when I was six or seven, the early '70s.
And it was like a lot of you, a kind of profound example, a kind of writing.
It was a picture in a magazine magazine of a child who was in the East Africa, and there were a brown on his face and a frog.
And he didn't survive, and I knew it, and I was hope.
How many of you remember this picture, not exactly this picture, but one like it.
It's enabled to the Western poverty around the world.
Well, this vision kind of rejected me when I grew up and I went to school and I went back and went back and I started making my family.
And I wondered, what happened to this child?
Or people just like it around the world?
And so I started exploring, even though I wasn't in college, I looked at the answer: What happened to the poor people in the world?
Is it done worse? Is it done better?
And I discovered the answer, and she changed my life, and I want to share it with you.
We realized -- most Americans believe that poverty has been done worse since we were children, since they saw it.
If you ask Americans, "Would the sky do worse or better in the world?" 70 percent will say that the noise has been done worse than 70.
But here's the truth.
Here's the prosthetic that I had changed my thinking.
From 1970 to the day, the population of the world who are in the streets of noise, live on a day or less, of course, intuition, these chimps have been seen in 80 percent.
There was an 80 percent of the worst time in the world since I was a child.
And I didn't even know about it.
It's, my friend, it's a mirror.
It's something that we've got to kill.
It's the biggest driver against humanity's history, and it happened during our lives.
So when I discovered this, I asked, what did you do this?
What did you do it possible? Because if you don't know why, you can't do it again.
If you want to take it and get the two billion people out of the poverty, because that's what we're talking about: since I was a child, two billion people from the poor, our ancestors, we've been conducted from the poverty.
I want the next two words, so I have to know why.
And I went through a search for answer.
And it wasn't a political answer, because I didn't care.
You know what, I still don't care.
I wanted the best answer from the economy of the central finger to the left, right and the center.
And here it is.
Here are the reasons.
There's five reasons that two billion people from our lives and our ancestors have gone out of poverty since I was a child.
One number: global civilization.
Number two: free trade.
Number three: French rights.
Number four: the rule of the law.
Number five: OK.
It was the simple business business system that spread around the world after 1970 that's done it.
Now, I'm not worried.
I know free businesses are not perfect, and I know that free businesses are not everything we need to build a better world.
But it's great.
And it's beyond politics.
Here's what I learned. It's the discovery.
Palism isn't just about the choice.
In the good case, it's about transparency, which is what so many people are talking about, it's the place that's coming from parts of the training system.
And we have to share it with more people.
Now, I'd like to tell you about two seconds that I'm going to first think that can bring us a fish, not just around the world, but really here at home.
The best quote I heard about to put the thought that I've been going to show you right now about making people out of the poverty is this: "free markets have made more wealth than any of the history of history.
They took billions of poverty. "
Who said that?
It sounds like Milliton France or Robert Robert House.
Turns.
The president in Obama said this.
Why do I know this with a language?
Because he said it to me.
Turkey.
And I said, "Love."
But more than that, I said, "What opportunity is."
You know what I thought?
It was a long event that we did on the subject at the University of John Museum in 2015.
And I thought, it's the solution to the biggest problem that's in America today, what?
It's suffering around these ideas, luckily and magazines, to help people who need us most.
Now, I don't have to say to one in the room that we're in the past, in America and many countries around the world with politics.
He went to a critical level, to a crisis.
It's not bad. It's not true.
There was an article last year in the world's academic of the global science, which is one of the most expensive scientific sectors in the West.
And it was an article in 2014 on the instrument of politics.
What are they? It's what psychologists call the phenomenon of saying that your idiology is based on love, but the idiology of your chimpanzees are based on.
It's common in projects in the world.
You're going to see it between Palestinians, for example.
What the library of the article found was that in America today, most of Franciscans and musicians suffer from privacy in popular statistics.
Most of people in our country today that political actions believe that they're motivated by love but the other side is prevented by hanging.
Think about it. Think about it.
Most people say, "You know, my theology is based on basic rates, I want to help people, but the other people, they're sophisticated and come to search me."
You can't move as a company when you have this kind of inequality.
It's impossible.
How do you open it?
Well, first of all, let's be honest: There are differences.
Let's not cooperate the differences. It's going to be really anonymous.
There's a lot of good studies about it.
My friend John Henry is and she's about TED Talk.
He's a psychologist at the University of New York City.
He's working on Islam and the values of different people to see how they're different.
And he showed, for example, that conservative and soldiers have a very different sense of what they think important.
For example, Jadit showed that luckets care about 59 percent more than they care about economics.
And they care about 28 percent more than they care.
The difference can't be made, right?
We'll never go together.
It's the direction where our power is.
Remember what got the poor.
It was the conference with the poverty, together with the restaurant for economic choices that spread around the world.
We need one of the other words, in other words, if we want to help people and invest the next two generations.
How is another way.
The government.
How do we do that?
It's a technical thing, isn't it?
We need creative thinking.
A lot of it on the stage.
Yes, completely, anonymous.
We need investments beyond the way there's, responsible, ethical and traditional.
But you know what we really need?
We need a new way of organism.
We need to be less likely.
No?
Do you feel sometimes as if your theory starts to be previous?
A kind of conventional convention?
Do you feel sometimes as if you're always listening to people who agree with you?
Why is it dangerous?
Because when we're talking about this country on economics, right, conservative, you're always talking about organisms and motion.
And on the left, luck, you're talking about economics, it's always about income income income.
Now these are important things, really important for me, really important for you.
But when it comes to a lot of people who are excited and need us today, it's the evidence.
We need to connect around the best ways to bring the poverty using our best tools that we've taken, and it's just when the maps understand that they need to click and their academic with poverty, and the luckets should be conservative and their training to free markets.
It's the direction where it's the ancient law of this country, if we're going to take it.
So how do we do this? How do we do it together?
We need to have action points, not just you but for me.
One number. France one number: remember, it's not just good enough for people who don't agree.
It's not good enough.
We need to remember that we need people who don't agree with us, because there are people who need all of us who are still waiting for these tools.
Now, what do you do? How do you get it?
Where does it start? It starts here.
You know, we're all in the room, we're excited.
We spend people listening to us.
We're focusing on the gas. We're waiting for the gold.
When people hear us, with a kind of uncomfortable organism, then maybe people will listen.
Maybe the progress will start at this point.
It's one number. A couple of seconds.
Number two: I'm asking you and I ask me to be the person who's collecting the lines, that they've learned, that's going to define.
If you're conservative, there's been the components that's always going to talk about poverty and humanity to be sophisticated for the poor.
And if you're lucky, you've been lucky to always talk about the beauty of the emotional markets to solve our problems when we're using responsibility.
If we do that, we get two things.
Number one: We're going to start working on the next two words and the solution we've seen a lot of it before and we need to see more of it in the future.
That's what we get. And the other is that we might be able to take a sea war and a sense of an athelogy that we're suffering in this country and turn it into ideas that's based on hormones and privacy.
And then maybe, just maybe, we'll all understand that our big differences are not really big after everything.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The analogy is excited to go to college.
She couldn't wait to get out of the theory, prove them she's in the sand and prove to her new friends that she's beating.
She's going to go to a reason in the aircraft there is a guy who's in his head.
Let's call it Michael.
So on the next day, the anthropologize with the mayor of the room.
It can just remember the night in the fingers.
But what she remember is that she was going on in a stadium outside the door of Michael's room and sat in the summer while he's in it, you want it to stop, and then you're going to sell home.
She doesn't feel good about what happened, but she thinks, "Oh, that's how it's sex?"
One of a women and one of 13 men were right now at a point in some time they were in the United States.
More than 10 percent have ever been known for their own school or the police.
And that's true, on average, you're going to have 11 months to run.
The analogy just feels like she's dealing with what happened.
But when it sees Michael takes girls home from reasons, it's worried to them.
After she's finished the general, she's found that she was one of a women's used to do exactly the same thing.
And it didn't feel unlikely because 90 percent of the microbial transparency is made by forests.
But with this one percent of low-term, it's pretty unlikely that even foreign adults are known, and it's not going to happen if they're known.
In fact, only six percent of the presidents that are prepared to the police department with a single day in prison.
What means, there's more than 99 percent chance that they're going to get out of it.
It means that you don't have a perception to participation in the United States.
Now, I'm a ecosystems of mental illness.
I'm interested in networks and where we can move our efforts to do the best.
So it's, for me, a training problem, but a piece.
So when the subject of transparency in the campaign started to get a few years ago, I felt like this was a unique opportunity to change.
And so we did.
We started talking with a unique survivor.
And what they've been asked that they had quite simple; they wanted a website, one that they could use in a place and at the time that the most important thing to them with information is based on their long-term possibilities, with the ability of their electronics on their period, rather than their first step would be going to go and talk to someone who might not believe them.
With the possibility to create a confident and a long time of what happened to them, to put evidence even if they don't want to dig still.
And finally, and maybe the most critical, with the ability to push their period just if someone else's known about the same scale.
You see, know you're not the only one changes everything.
It changes the way you're leaving your experience, it changes the way you think about your scale, it means that if you're going to depend on us, there's somebody who's going to have you and you're on.
We've created a website that actually does this and we've invented him two months ago, we've invented it in August, in two pounds of generations.
And we've made a unique system where if the first version of Michael came up, which remains her other demand and said that it's right, and the second one of Michael did the same thing a few months later, they'd been sophisticated and sophisticated with the two victims of the two victims that were sent to the same time and
If a system like this was there for the analogy and her sisters, it was more likely that they were accurate, who would believe they were, and that Michael was just the boss of the campus, it's going to go to prison, or at least it's got the help that he needed.
And if we'd be able to stop foreign adults like Michael after their second period just in the mirror, the survivors like the analogy had never been exposed from the beginning.
We could prevent 59 percent of the patterns just by creating repeat forests earlier.
And because we're creating a real surprise of transformation, maybe for the first time, the patterns of the world didn't even try to reduce someone.
The kind of system I'm described, the kind of system that the survivors want is a kind of information on a third side, which means that you're going to make information for you and reduce it to a third, just as some conditions that have been conducted in the head, like the academic.
The empathy we're building is the refugees of generations.
But the same kind of system can be used in the military or even in the workplace.
We don't need to live in a world where 99 percent of the anthropologists are dying.
We can create one of those who are acting to their children, where they survive the device and the station that comes to them, where the possibilities reduce the information that they need, and there's a real investment of the rights of another person.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I learned in college, I made a description in the government, which means I had to write a lot of work.
Well, when a normal student wrote a job, it might make the work about the next way.
So, you know,... Laughter) You're starting to look at all, but you're able to do enough in the first week, so with a few days, all the work works and things get bad.
And I really would like to do the things like this.
It's supposed to be the program.
I was ready to start by the program, but then, in fact, there was a job, and I did less or more the next thing.
And it was happening in any work I had to respond.
But then the work of my work, the 90s, a documentary that you should work for a year.
And I think it's a job like this, there's no situation to work in my normal method.
It was too big project.
So I've designed everything, and I decided we're going to look at the next method.
So it was supposed to look at this year.
I'm going to start with communities, and for months later I'm going to give a little bit of gas, and then, to the end, I'm going to get high.
How hard is it supposed to be, go in the stairs?
No big story, right?
But then, there's a funny piece.
The first months are they?
They're just in the line, and I couldn't really do something.
So I came up with a crazy plan.
And then...... — Laughter) But then, also two months of the event they just sat down, and I didn't really write words, and eventually I found myself here.
And then two months became one month, that you got to two weeks.
And one day I woke up with three days to the feeling of the woman, and because I still didn't write a word, I did the only thing that I could do: I wrote 90 pounds in 72 hours, it's unfortunate to one person, but two people don't ask you to ask for two days -- I've been looking at the boss of
I thought here was the story.
But a week later, I got a conversation, from college.
And they tell me, "I got to organic details?"
And I say, "Yes."
"We need to talk about your work."
And I say, "Okay."
And then they say, "This is the best work we've ever seen."
Laughter) But you know, it didn't happen.
It was a really bad job, but really bad thing.
I just wanted to go to one moment, when you all thought to yourself, "This guy is amazing!"
But not, it was a very bad job.
Anyway, today I'm a guy who wrote a blog on the web.
I write the blog: Wow.
And a few years ago, I decided to write about soldiers.
My behavior has always brought around me, and I wanted to explain to all of the microbes in the world, what's going on in the head of a soldier, and why we're behavior as we're doing.
Well, I've had a poem, that the brains of bacteria are actually different from other people's brains.
And in order to reduce the device to the test, I found a MRI that was conducted in my brain and another person's brain, which is unfamiliar, so I could compare them to this.
And I brought them to me here today, to show you.
I want you to take them for a moment and see if you're in the difference.
I know that if you don't wait from death, it's not so simple, but I want you to try.
So -- here we see a brain of unhealthy.
It's now...
Here's my brain.
Laughter) Well, there's a difference.
In the two brains, there's a conventional decisions, but in the sense of the patient also exists by the production.
So, what does this mean for the soldier?
Well, it means that everything's okay -- until it's happening.
[It's exactly the time to go to work.]] No, it's not!]]] []]]]]]]] The
Laughter) And then......
So we're going to go into a three-dimensional election that's built in the movies of Richard Finman's videos talk about magnets and a lot later, when we're looking at the Iraq with a mother of John Bay Burge.
It's going to take a little bit of time, so we don't really have a place to do some work.
"Shair!"
So what's actually going on here?
It's the French coffee that's not like someone you'd like behind the roof.
It's completely living in the current moment.
It doesn't have a memory in the future, it's not aware of the future, and it's just two things: "It's" and "fun."
Now, in the world of animals -- it works beauty.
If you're a mirror and you're bringing all your life in doing climate and chemical things, then you've succeeded in life!
And in the coffee, human beings are just another species of animal.
All you need to do is make a good song, eat good, to prefer fingers, things that we're in the age where we've live in the movies, really gave us.
But, in the case that you don't notice -- we're not in our critical age.
We live in the academic culture, and we don't have a concept of what it means.
And that's why we're sitting in someone in the brain, this guy -- makes the experimental decisions, which allows us to do things that no other animal can do.
We can see the future in our eyes.
We can see the big picture.
We can design the long-term programs.
And we want to take all of these in the math.
And he wants to make us do what he looks like to do at this moment.
Well, sometimes it really makes sense to do what's easy and fun, for example, when you eat a dinner or you go to sleep or you're going to have a fabric time that you've lost on happiness.
It's the region where we have a piece.
Sometimes, they agree with them.
But sometimes, there's a lot more sense to do things that are hard and less beautiful, to take the big picture. "
And that's the place where we have the instrument.
And for the soldier, this discovery is going to hide in the same way every time, it gets it to spend a lot of time in this red area, a easy place and a fun that's completely out of the opposite Google.
I call this place: "The House of House."
So now, the patient's weapons is a place that all the bacteria, in your right happiness, you know very well.
It's where the active costs are happening, at the time where the active activities are not supposed to happen.
The fun that you experience in the patient's weapons, it's not really fun, because you're completely unprecedented, and the air there's Royan, Iraq, self-disruption -- all of the normal sensory and good emotions.
And the question is, in this situation, when the coffee is the ocean, how can the bacteria bring himself here, to this blue region, a place that's much less nice, but where are the important things really?
Well, it turns out that a soldier has a smoke, someone who's always keeping on it, and he's going to say about the highest fingerprint -- someone called the president.
And now, a chimpanzee has a lot of time, but you're going to invest every time that it's last until the last time a job comes too close or that it's going to be very happy in the public, an academic, or you're going to have the result of another iPhone.
And most importantly, it's the only thing that's afraid of.
Well, she's been very sophisticated in my life, very recently, because TED people have created with me about six months ago and invited me to get the TED Talk.
And now, of course, I said yes.
It's always my dream, to know I've spent TED Talk.
It's in the past.
He said to me, "Look, we understand what we've got on ourselves right now?
Do we look at what's going to happen one day in the future?
We have to sit and start working on it now.
And the coffee said, "You're completely excited with you, but let's just open your Google and focus on the Indian crisis, about 200 feet above the surface, and then we're going to move the river for two and a half and a half to the country, so we can get a better sense of India."
So that's what we did in the same day.
And six months became four, and then for months, and then a month, and TED people decided to predict the level of speakers.
And I opened the website and there -- my fingerprint was going to take a look back.
And guess who woke up then?
Laughter) So a chimpanzee started to lose a road and a few seconds later, the whole system is all in it and a bone.
And the coffee -- you're probably remember, it's an accident from the top of the hell -- Bay! He's a bank to the top of the tree.
And finally, at the end of the end, the decisions of Tony can take a code and I can start working on the talk.
Now, a remote story can explain all kinds of different types of microbial behavior, like how someone like me can switch two weeks without even writing a profound sentence, and then in the corner to find the self-esteem to stay for a whole night to write a picture.
And all of this situation I've described to the audience, with the three characters -- that's what's happening in the head of a soldier.
It's not bad, but at the end, it works.
This is what I decided to write in a blog a few years ago.
And when I wrote -- I was volunteered from the response.
I've got thousands of IDS consciousness, all kinds of people from all over the world, who are business in all kinds of things.
There's been a sisters there, in Nigerians, dozens, engineers, and a lot of categories.
And they all wrote the same thing: "I suffer from the same problem exactly."
But what I was so excited about was the contrast between the atmosphere and the strengths of consciousness in the DEA.
These people wrote out of a tool and told about what the world's civilizations started to their lives, what this coffee is going to go.
And I thought about it and I said to myself, if the system of the animal works as a teacher, then what's going on here?
Why are all these people in a very important place?
So it turns out there are two kinds of soldiers.
All I've talked about today, all of the examples I've been born, in all of them would be a blueprint.
And when you're going to go down, the effects of the bacteria exist in just the short term, because it's a convenient discovery.
But there's another kind of bacteria that's actually working in cases where there's no longer going to go.
So if you want a career that you're moving in yourself -- something in the art of art, something beautiful -- there's nothing that I started to do with these things, because nothing happens at the beginning, until you're moving and deciding to do the hard work of the mammoth, of the things.
There's all kinds of important things beyond your career that doesn't expect many of your career, like looking at your family, to move or worry about your health, take your relationship or go out of a bridge that doesn't work.
Now, if the only mechanisms of the soldier to do these hard things is a decline, then there's a problem, because in all of these situations, unfortunately, it's not a surprise.
It doesn't have to win, so the effects of soldiers dn't die. They're just going to win.
And it's this kind of sensors, the long term that's less seen in the eye and less it's than the long-term and the invasion, which is based on a blueprint.
And it's usually suffering from it and privacy.
And it can be the source of a huge amount of unfortunate and long-term component.
And I thought to myself, that's why for all of the Israeli consciousness that people sent me.
It's not that they're afraid now to happen what project is.
The long-term bacteria became the same for the participants, in their lives themselves.
It's not because they couldn't make their dreams, but because they couldn't even start a page after them.
So I read these email consciousness and I had a little bit of a -- I don't think there's no soldiers at all.
It's very true -- I think you're all soldiers.
Now, you can be that you're not in the gangs, like a few of us, and some of you have a healthy relationship with Egypt, but remember: the worst regulation of the coffee is when you're not there.
Now, I want to show you something last one.
I call it a life.
There's one box for every week in 1990s.
It's not so many of the experiments on the screen, in the end of the fact that we've already used some and some of them.
So I think we've all need to direct a long perspective and a biomatus.
We need to think about the things that we're living in, because every one of us is about something in life.
We need to stay aware of the funny cartoon.
This is our task, of us all.
And because there's not so many reasons, it's a task that we should probably start today.
Well, maybe not really today, but...
Laughter) You know.
Somewhere in a lot.
Thank you.
Thank you.
In the ancient imagination, as a mayor, we're going to have a powerful tool.
The curiosity was taken out of the Alexis, to the medicine.
And if the pain went on, it's about medicine, it would do the most known solution -- a small hole in the skin to move the road.
The opposite method, which is called traffic, many times it's replaced the head with a more permanent situation.
Unfortunately, doctors today don't have electricity tools to reduce my head.
But we still have a lot to learn about the future suffering.
Today, we're curious as a head of two groups -- as my first head and my father's head.
The first one is not the symptoms of disease, surprise, or another situation. They're the situation.
But we're going to go back to them a little bit more because while my first head is 50 percent of the extinct cases, we actually know a lot more about the head of my head.
It's Congress by other health conditions, with causes that are affected by accumulating and a word that's fabric and extended, and heart disease.
Paul doctors were more than 150 kinds of kinds of types that you can lose, everyone with causes, symptoms, and different treatments.
But we're going to just take one common case -- a cartoon -- as an example.
The tricks are a range system that's spread behind the corner, the red, and the top life is.
When our symbols deal, our vaccine responses the region, it's got the bacteria and remove the cases much beyond the age of the age.
The Greeks are pushing on the walls and the corporations, as well as the muscles in the top and the head.
They're their fingerprint, they're called satellites, you're spending a message to the brain to release a spinning of Netropy that's making the blood tool in the skin, you're moving and you're pulling your head.
This confidence, together with a too sensitive musician, create the pain and the pain in in the head.
It's not all the mayor comes from the brain.
Sorry muscles and emotional objects make the levels of uncomfortable instruments in every head.
But all of the cases are responsible to some of the Guini Guinea and two.
While the genome is obviously clear in the head of two, the source of my first father remained not known.
Scientists still explore impossible to peaceful peers of the mayor of the mayor of the magazine: regulations and death, as my father's head of very powerful, very powerful and famous and fathers from everyone, as the head of life.
Like the name of the name, the mayor of the brain creates the feeling of a strong body to have a strong arm around the head.
As my head comes out the emotions of the head muscles, who work in a pain with a person and a oxygen.
Social patients are stressed on strength, and the hormonal changes are caused, but it's not really exposed to symptoms.
For instance, in the head of the conference, the president is actually getting away from the skin, and it's made the conversation in the camera that doesn't come to the universe of the pain in in the head of the war.
Scientists have theories of the genes, which means that blood flow is too sensitive, but no one is completely safe.
In the meantime, most of my father's head is focused on the head of a more compassionate head.
The Germans are as a recycled mayor, which makes sense of war on the skin that can go over four hours to three days.
In 20 percent of the cases, these participants are strong enough to hide the brain with electrical energy, which is effective on the scale of creativity.
It's producing the identities that are called communities, which are all the evidence of lights and geometry and experience of disruption.
When my father's head of objects, another kind of mayor of my first head, causes scans and studies of a pain behind one eye, which leads to a similar eye, different artificial and trees.
What can you do with these inventions, which are dramatic on the quality of a lot of people?
Like the mayor of a mayor and most of the critical cases can be patients with resources without a lot of resources, like a dozen drugs that's reduced the pressure in the skin.
And a lot of causes in the head of the sky, like the action, pressure on the eyes, and jump, what you can avoid actively.
Cyrus and the mayor of the mayor is more complicated, and we still didn't find real treatments that work on everyone.
But luckily, private and biologists work hard in these loads that are so rolled on our head.
The computers of today are so amazing that we don't notice how normal they're.
I'd like to talk to you today about this problem, and how we can fix it with the brain science.
First of all, I'd like to bring you back to the night of Kayan in 2011 that he had a deep impact on me.
I sat out of the University of Korea, where I learned a computer scientist and brain science, and I had a great conversation with a great student about the power of the geography to replace one day of the computers.
And just when we got to the best part of the conversation, of course, his phone at the same time.
And it's pulled it into it, and it's looking at it down and it's starting to survive.
And then he moves his eyes back to my daughter and says, "You're going to continue, I'm with you."
But of course, his eyes were fair, and the moment.
Now, over the past, I've been looking at another student that's going to keep a phone, this time for a group.
He went through images in Institute, and these kids were laughing in the Syria.
And this chemistry between a few insects I felt and how happy they felt about the same technology, really made me think.
And as I thought about it more, I realized that it wasn't the digital information that was the bad guy here, it was just the extended situation that the French and my friends between the other.
We realized, they were killed around something, just like our ancestors who developed their social capabilities told stories around the teacher.
And that's exactly what tools need to do, I think.
They need to expand our body.
And I think computers today do exactly the opposite.
Whether you send an email to your wife or you're a mammogram or just a friend with a friend, you're doing it really in the same ways.
You're proud of these buildings, play with teenagers and details and boys.
And I think it's the wrong way, I think we can start using a much more natural machine.
We need to use machines that bring our work back to the world.
We need to use machines that use brain scientific principles as you can expand our senses instead of going to go.
Now just in the case I have this machine here.
It's called a two-meter.
Let's try it.
Now, right now, I see the audience, and I can see my hand.
And three, two, one, we're going to see the geography that's profound, the geography is very profound before, of our cases that I'm afraid about my head right now.
And of course, it can be everything that we're cutting now or learn from it, and I can use my hands to avoid them really beautiful with better control.
And I think an artist was proud.
We're going to go back to it a little bit more.
Now if you're like me, your brain has already run with possibilities of what can do with this kind of technology, then let's look at some.
My mom is architecture, so of course, the first thing I've imagined was to reduce a building of a 3D space instead of using these 3D cartoons.
It's actually going on in the Germany now and it's looking at face.
All of this was made in the Go through our cases.
And the next use is very personal for me, it's the female brain project of a genetic professor, at the University of San Francisco.
As a brain student, I've always been working on the capacity to learn and put the complex brain structure with a personal machine, where I could touch and play with the different brain brains.
Now what you're seeing is called a restaurant reality, but for me, it's part of a much larger story -- a story about how we can start to expand our bodies with digital devices, instead of reducing.
Now...
In the next few years, humanity is going to go through the revolution, I think.
We're going to start to put a layer of digital information on the real world.
Just imagine what it would say to the story, to the stories, to the muscles, the brain, the face and maybe all of us here today.
And what I think we need to do as a community, it's really trying to do an effort to imagine how we can create this new reality in a way that represents human experience, instead of making our reality to play or protect it with digital information.
And this is my passion.
Now, I want to tell you a little secret.
In about five years -- it's not the smallest device -- about five years, all of these will look like a fifth of our eyes that the geographic crisis.
And just like we don't care so much about what a phone was built in terms of software -- we're cutting it because of the operating system -- as a brain scientist, I've always talked about building the operating system, if you want to.
And it's very important that we've done this right, because maybe we're going to live in these things at least some of our lives with the usual interface of windows.
And I don't know about you, but live in a sophisticated window.
So to look at the most intuitive weapon from the end, we're using brain science to prevent our design, instead of giving a group of designers to fight in the right room.
And the principles that we're all suffering around are what's called "beyond the worst analogy."
Anyway, we're looking at the operating system of the brain with our brain, for the first time, our brain conditions.
In other words, we're trying to create a computer with an effective learning.
We're building a system that you always knew how to use it.
Here's the first three creatures in which we're using a completely new form of usual experience.
First, you're the operating system.
Social systems are complex and abstract, and your brain requires other parts to open them.
We're going to go against the natural president of the most residents.
In the time, in a restaurant reality, you can't put your beautiful TED Talk here, and your geographic email on the other side of the table, and your extended memory has evolved really well to return them.
You can put your geography that you want to buy -- or what my critical team told me to put just before the invention.
It's perfect. And your brain knows exactly how to bring it back.
The two lines of the other weapons we call "Get to see."
What's babies do when they see something that's getting their attention?
They're trying to add a hand and play it.
And that's exactly how the natural machine needs to work.
It turns out that the enormous system gets a significant interview that we call a professor -- it's the sense of our body parts of space.
So in our work directly, we don't just take it better, we're also going to understand it a lot more to play.
So, you'll get to see.
But it's not enough to experience things ourselves.
We're actually social animals.
And this leads me to our third engagement, the evolutionary line from our first story.
Our invisible system offers that we can connect to each other and our job is much better if we can see the faces and one of the other's face.
So if you look at the video behind, you can see two games play with the same geographic, you create a eye connection around this thing, instead of being convinced by extinct devices.
Let's continue and try it again in thinking about the brain science.
So again, the love of us, the operating system of the brain.
I'm going to take one other step back and take these colors and leave them there on the table.
Now I'm with you, I'm at a moment, we're facing.
My special memory goes into action, and I can continue to look at them and bring them back to the bottom, reminds me that I'm the operating system.
And now my professor works, and I can continue to reduce these colors to thousands of parts and now that you're going to have a minute that's just my hand.
But it's not enough to see things alone, so in a second, my partner's partner is going to do a 3D conversation -- Ray?
What's going on?
A company, I can see this guy from a 3D printer.
And he's looking at Ethiopia.
Thank you.
My magical system offers that it's going to replace mobile phones in the early future.
Ray, what happens?
RG: Good. We're lucky today.
#91; Applause) MG: Ray, let's take a gift of the geographic brain that we saw in the video before.
A company, it's not just going to change phones, it's also going to change the way we're operating.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
RG: Please.
So MG: So a company, it's the message I've found in the middle of 2011: the future of computers don't work in one of these screens.
It's right here, inside us.
So if there's one idea that I can leave you today, it's the natural machine is not the invention of the future, it's right here in 2016.
So every century of us in the airport, including the architecture of the architecture, the roads, the nerves, engineers -- TED, we're going to take our extinctions and reduce them with more significant machines.
Thank you very much.
Applause) Thank you, I appreciate you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: So I'm going to help me with something, because there were a couple of pounds of a randomly reality in the last year.
And there's sometimes and power between ecosystems, we really see the real thing on the screen?
There's the thing of interview, and how the technology shows a lot more than you're actually seeing when you're sending the colors.
Do we see the real thing there?
MG: Just the real thing.
It's not just that, we took a couple of steps to take it with Fego through the road itself in the different videos that you saw here.
We want to try to compare the experience of the world that we actually see through the collapses, and not in the protests.
CA: Thank you very much that we showed this.
MG: Thank you very much, I appreciate it.
The first idea I'd like to offer is that everyone loves very music.
But the music is even more powerful if you don't just listen to her, but you make it yourself.
So, it's my first idea. And we all know about a productive effect -- the idea that, for the last 10 years -- that only with the corruption of music or by the music to your baby.
A big idea, but it doesn't work at all.
So you can't just listen to music, you have to somehow create it.
And it's about it, it's not just to create it, but everyone in the world has to create and be part of music in a very dramatic way, and it's one of the main parts of my work.
So with the communication of MIT, it's a while we've been working in a field called an active music.
What are all the possible ways we can think about them to make everyone in the middle of a musical experiment not just listening, but create music?
And we started building tools for some of the biggest actions in the world. We call them the Iranian academic -- for Jazo, Pimbridge, France, invitations, to green, tools that there are different kinds of sensors, which are going to go into the tool, so that the tool knows how genius are.
And it's just by changing the interaction and the feeling I can make my chicken to the code, or for a minute, or something that no one has heard about before.
When we started doing this, I started thinking, why can't we make these wonderful devices for each one, people who are not going to be blind or the amazing prices?
As we built a series of tools.
One of the largest collection is called "The brain". "
It's a mirror of 100 tools about, all of us were designed for each other to play with natural skills that had.
So, you can play a video game, move through a musical piece of music, use your body's circumstances to take on a giant screen of sound, move in a special surface to create a dirty, to use it to create a train.
And when we do the brain emissions, we invite the public to come and try these tools and then cooperate with us to help and change all the actions of the brain.
We've created teachers with this for a long time, and now it's a constant, a place where we built a museum around it.
And it led to something you probably know.
The digital came out of our lab, and two of the teenagers and the students in the MIT's media media are the conversation that if you're doing the kind of interface, people really want to be interested in a piece of music, and we're going to play it again and again.
So, the model works, but it's just the end of the security, because my second idea is not just enough to want to do music in something like digital.
And the music is actually a very, but it's also an astronomy.
It's important, very important.
music can change your life, almost everything else.
It can change the way you communicate with others, it can change your body, it can change your right, so we're trying to go to the next step that it's how to build on something like digital.
We're very involved in education. We've got a long project called "toxic," where we're creating all kinds of tools that are too small, but for small children, so the kids will love to create music, they're going to take their time when they're doing it, and then we're going to know how it works
We had, pretty good effects, really powerful effects with children around the world, and now people in all the products, use a crisis.
And so, we started more and more interested in how to use these kinds of creative activities in a much more rapidly, for all kinds of people who have no opportunity to create music.
So, one of the differences and the benefits that we're working on in the media now is music, email and health.
Many of you probably saw the new book and the wonderful book of Olympic School. "It's average for the books.
It's a great book. If you haven't seen it, you're going to read, it's itself in Panada, and it's described all his career's career's career and looking at the powerful effects that were trying to music about people's lives in extraordinary situations.
So we know, for instance, the music is almost the last thing that people with Alzheimer's Glaser can respond to.
Maybe many of you have noticed it in their chicken, you see someone who can't identify in the mirror, or you can't recognize any of their family friends, but you can still find that a muscle of music that the same person will jump out of the chair and start to get back. And it can be repeated by people's characteristics.
Music is the best way to get a speech in people who lost it as a mental event, can motivate people with Frankson's disease.
It's a powerful device for depression, chicken, a lot of things.
So, we're working on these basic principles and then build activities that can really improve people's health.
We do it in many ways. We work with many different patients.
One of them are the Texas Texas that's really close to Boston.
It's a public hospital for an atmosphere, where a couple of years ago we started working with the French and with physical limits or personality.
It turned out to be a central part of the treatment in Texas hospital so that everybody's out there in the sound of music costs.
It's an effect that's probably most of the treatment of treatment and it's also spending all the hospital together into a kind of music community.
I wanted to show you a short video of some of this field before I continue.
Video: They're operating this short rate on it.
It's a real experience, not just to learn how to play and listen to the short, but to reduce the musical memory and keep music in the group.
To understand the music, design it themselves, to change it, to try to create their music themselves.
So the French allows you to start from a very quickly.
Everybody can experience music deep, we just need to build other tools.
The third idea I'd like to share with you is that symbolic, in general, I think, more than words even, is one of the best ways we have to show who we're really. I love to give the texts, although I feel more nervous than I want to prove music.
If I'd play here in Chile, or play on Sylaser, or translate my music with you, I could show things about myself that I can't tell you in words, more personal things, maybe deeper.
I think it's true about many of us, I want to give you two examples of how music is one of the powerful users we have, from ourselves to the external world.
The first is a really crazy project that we're building right now, called "death and forces." And it's a very big, one of the biggest projects of Olympics that are now built in the world.
And it's about a person, rich, successful, powerful, that you want to live forever.
So, he's found a way through "Lord" itself into his environment, in fact, into books.
So, this contrast wants to live forever, it's "Mord" himself to his environment.
The main metaphor was built at the beginning of the Olympic and what it becomes the main character.
He's going to go to his network, and the apologia is about what we can share, what we can get to other people, people that we love, and what we can't.
Each object in Olympic waves into life, and it's a huge tool, like this web. It's taking the whole thing. It looks like a web, but it's actually a robotic weapon.
So, as you can see in this typical prototype, a huge piano piano, every minute is reduced by a small robotic, or small networks that are in the words, the doctors who are spending on the taxes, the signals that are released the numbers. We also have a robot on the stage.
These robots are kind of sophisticated between the main characteristics, France Fathers, and in his family. There are their homes, something like a blueprint.
They're looking at action. We've designed these little robots that we're trying to now at MIT called "October."
They're following the characters. They're smart enough, we hope, don't wear it. They're going to go on the journey themselves.
And then they're also, when you're scared in your kitchen, you're going to get in a teacher just as you want.
Unfortunately they're curious, they're actually very personalized.
The largest piece of the Olympic is called "The system."
It's a series of books. Every single book is robotic, so everybody's moving, everybody's getting molecules, and when you put them together, they're going to become these walls, which has the regulations and the personality of France. So it's done, but the physical environment becomes this person.
It's the way it's chosen to show itself.
In the books, there's also a very high school child.
And here's the great British James Times Monna when he goes into "The system."
It's an academic.
The normal effects are in Mexico -- it's in September 2009. If you can't get, another idea with this project -- here's the Berberg is very unusual, by music and the environment.
But we're working on this that it's going to be right on the Internet and they're in public spaces, as one of us to use music and our lives to build our network or someone we love.
So instead of being a graphic graph, it will become something that we think about as a personal academic.
And if you're going to create a personal aid, what about a personal instrument?
Everything I've got to you until now -- whether it's a chimpanzee for his wife or a tool for a child -- the tools stay identified and they're valuable for some person's level: virus, a child.
But what if I can create a tool that you can get to a way that I'm essential to the way my hands work, why do I do in a big, maybe, why don't I do so much?
I think it's the future of the web, it's the future of music, the future of the president.
And I'd like to now invite two very unique people, so I can show you how these personal tools might be.
So, Applause to a human student in Los Angeles, Democrats from MIT's media's country's media, and Dan Adan, Hallott and Dr. Bernescher, "is here with us today is all the way Texas. He's sitting in the hospital.
It's the worst place so far that he came to him from Texas hospital, I can tell you that, because it has a motivation to meet you today and show you his music.
So first of all, Dan, you want to say peace to everyone and tell everyone who you are?
AB: Hello. My name's 34. I'm 34 years old, I've got a funny collaboration.
I've always loved music, and I'm excited that I can win my music with this new software.
Tom's connected: And we're really excited that you've done here, really.
It's also very sick.
So, it turns out that it's a wonderful, and over the last few years, it's translated with us to actively operate.
He created a lot of bad. He's doing his own categories, in fact, he's pretty known in the region -- he's talking people in the hospital and children how to create their music.
And I'm going to give you a person to tell you. So, a person is a student in MIT student, it's an expertise to music and medicine.
A person worked in the last time not just about the possibility that an age could be able to make their own little bit, but also how he could do the little bit by this kind of personal tool.
So you want to tell a little bit of what do you work?
Adam Brength: Yeah. So, Tond and I'm going to talk to the idea of the work in Texas and it was about it that a man who was an intuitive person, and he's an intuitive and creative person. And you see it in his list, it's in his task. How can it not do one of his music?
So we started to develop a technology that allows him to take with Nigerian, with just control, and despite his physical right, to do that, to be able to do his profound piece.
So, the process and technology -- at the end of something, we first had an engineering solution. So, you know, we have Field Field, which was looking at an infinite interview.
We went with a kind of a constant metaphor where the age was used with his speech.
And it was actually the interesting part of the work, you know, the design process. We had to judge; we had to have a serious piece of software, we're seeing the kinds of forms that he did.
But then there was the really interesting aspect of work, in the time of the engineering part, where, in the end of something, we're focusing beyond the age of the hospital in the hospital to figure out, you know, how is the age of engine?
What's useful for them as a conventional disorder?
Do you know, what's his doing?
What kinds of things think is important to take and get a piece of music?
So all of the definitions, and the technology has been done at this point so that they're going to get exactly a trick.
And you know, I think it's a perspective. It's not that our technologies -- they're providing access, they're able to create creative work.
But what about nature? What about the moment where the artist is not part of the work? You know, is our technologies enable us to express?
Do they tell us the structure of the object to do this? And you know, it's a personal relationship to the biological field. So, you know, with an age, we had a new design process, a new engineering process to figure out how it's going to be able to do it?
So this is what we're going to do today.
TM: So let's do it. So, Dan, you want to tell everyone what you're going to play now?
DP: It's my bridge song. "
TM: So, Dan's going to play his piece, called "My bridge."
In fact, it's a tool of the little dog of an age, completely revealed by an age in the French.
So he can use his own insector to go directly to a visit.
It's very fast in it, also faster than me, actually.
Laughter) TM: It's really a motion.
So it can go to a sacrifice. You're starting to create dirty, and you're listening.
He can put those right where he wants.
Everybody gets color. He's coming back into the mammogram window, sees the lines, from it's all the way you want. You look at the sacrifice. You can see it also, you can see where the small are, something might continue to go on for a while, to get really crazy and then you're going to go with the bank at the end.
So that's the way he created his little, and as a person says, then we've discovered the best way to allow him to do his little.
It's going to be seen by this camera, that you're going to take his movement, it's going to be able to show as he wants the different aspects of his music.
And you're also going to see it in real way on the screen.
We asked one of our students to look at what the camera is about.
But instead of doing it in a very low way, to show you exactly the traffic of the camera, we've made it to a graphic device that's looking at you the basic movement, and show the way it's called.
I think it's explaining how we're looking at motion from what's doing, but I think it's also going to show you, if you look at this movement, that when an age creates music, their movement is very, very, very accurate, very, very, very exciting and they're also very expensive.
So, when you hear this piece, as I said before, the most important thing is that music is great, and it will show you who it's an age.
So, we're ready for a person?
AB: Yeah.
TM: Well, now Dan will invest his little song by my bridge "for you.
Applause) TM: Babbo.
Thank you.
In 1962 in the university University, JFC said to the country on the dream that he had, a dream to put a person on the moon until the end of the decade.
The phones are remote.
Nobody knew if it was possible, but it was a fish that was built to do it if it was possible.
That's how they're big dreams.
A big windows are not just a vision, they're a network with strategy to make their imaginations.
I've got a huge luck to work in a monitor.
In the x of the x -- a Google Google -- you're going to get an Okoti engineer working with a horizontal designer and an accurate designer from the military to the past think together with a strategy of laser.
These reality, engineers and create water on technologies that we hope to do the world is great.
We use the word "monitor" to remind us to keep our big partners -- to continue to dream.
We're using a word from an instrument to remind ourselves that we want to have products -- productive programs to make them three-dimensional.
Here's our concept programs.
One number: We want to find a huge problem in the world that affects many millions of people.
Number two: We want to find or offer a radical solution to this problem.
And then the number three: there should be a reason to believe that technology is to make a radical solution in fact to build.
But I have a secret for you.
Finally, it's a place of a magazine.
But instead of avoid the building, to predict that it's not there, we've tried to turn it into our minds.
We've spent most of our time to get things and we've tried to prove that we're wrong.
It's our secret.
We've been talking about all the most important parts of the problem at the beginning.
His excited, "Hey! How do we kill our project today?"
We've got this interesting vision going on where we're spending our unusual optimism to reduce our vision.
But then we're also transparency of our privacy to predict life, to have reality to predict them.
I'd like to show you some of the projects that we had to leave behind the restaurant room, and also some of the white bone that's less until now, not just survived the process, but they've also left his hand.
Last year, we killed a project on autism.
It's part of the piece that we've got.
One is an hour of people in the world suffering from an extinction.
So it's a monitor that had to happen.
The anthropologists use less wealth and a hundred times less than a nanographic land.
And because you can grow the food close to its need, you don't need to move it into big space.
We've spent a lot of areas like autonomous and effective collection.
But unfortunately, we couldn't make basic patients like a jungle and grow in this way.
So we killed the project.
Here's another big problem.
We're taking a lot of resources and environmental resources to avoid regulations in the world.
The economic development of countries without limited access by transportation infrastructure.
The unfortunate solution?
Speak School came out of the air with a transformation that's changed.
It's got the potential to reduce, at least in general, the cost, the time and the fingerprint of money without the need for the treatments.
We've come to the switch of rules through fear technologies that might allow us to reduce the cost of enough that we can actually create these protests -- to get enough and in the amount.
But it doesn't matter how fast it's going to be able to create the music turns that it's going to be close to 200 million dollars to design and build the first one.
200 million is just too expensive.
Because the structure of a x with these feedback cell phones of doing mistakes and learning and new eyes, we can't get 200 million dollars to get the first point of information about whether we're in the right direction or not.
If there's an Alex in one of our projects, we want to know it right now, not far away the way.
So we also killed this project.
A significant discovery in the project doesn't always say it's finished the project.
Sometimes it actually takes us to a more effective way.
It's the prototype of the driver of our own car, which we built without the gene or the web.
But it wasn't our goal when we started.
With 1.2 million people who are sitting on global warming every year, building self-leading car was natural to take.
Three and a half years ago, when we had these curiosity, that his name, self-esteem in experiments were so successful, that we gave them to other Google people to figure out what they thought about the experience.
And what we've found was that our car would do almost all of the driver and leave just a camp of South was a really bad plan.
It wasn't sure because the users didn't do their work.
They didn't stay Arabic in the case that the car had to return the control back to them.
It was a main crisis in a team.
It's sent us back to the quote table.
And they came to this new collection and this physicist.
We've done a car where you're really worried.
You say to a car where you want to get, you're pushing on a button and it takes you from a point to point at the point of itself.
We're really grateful that we've had the vision so early in the project as we had.
And it's made everything we did since.
And now our cars used themselves more than 1.25 million miles, and they're outside every day on the streets of Monotu, California, California and Texas.
The cars team reduced their perspective.
It's one of the CO2.
Sometimes your perspective is more powerful than being smart.
Take a wind energy.
It's one of the favorite examples of change from the perspective.
There's no way we're going to build a better standard of experts in this industry.
But we've found a way to get higher in the water, and make access to faster and more strength, and that's more energy without having a toxic pattern to get there.
The original energy costs from his face by these amazing stimulators over his finger.
And it's attracted when it goes, it's pulling energy through the wind.
Once it's open up to the end of the end, it's going into the posters of walls in the water.
And now these sophistices that put it up on the top became an extinct platform.
And it sends energy back in the road.
We still didn't find a way to kill this project.
And as it's going to survive the pressure, we're more excited that it can become a smaller, and it's easier to reduce the wind of energy to the world.
It's probably the project that's most crazy that we have is a hotel project.
We're trying to create the Internet that's been used by regulations.
The network of blogs in Stotocin that connections the Internet is down to rural areas and remote in the world.
It can bring to nearly four billion other people, which today they have regulations or not exist at all.
But you can't just take a cell device, put it into the window and put it in the sky.
It's too powerful, it's going to win.
And the windows are too high to go into the ground.
Here's where you get a crazy moment.
What if, instead, you can compare them and teach them how to remove in the walls where they need?
It turns out that Australia has conversations that work in the identities and quite different directions in the pattern.
So we hope that by using smart algorithms and information around the world, we can show the buildings a little bit, and bring them into a little bit of traffic and just a little bit in the train to get these walls in these different directions.
The idea is that we've got enough blogs so that one hotel will expect out of your surface, there's another bone that's ready to expect to a place, and to bring the Internet connection, just like your phone's gone from a cell cell cell phones when you're moving in the river.
We understand how much the vision metaphor sounds -- there's this project to remind us.
So since 2012, a window repeated the work that's most difficult and so with the most high chance to kill the project.
The first thing they did was to try to get a wireless connection from the hotel in Stota to Antarctica on the ground.
It worked.
And I'm sorry to you that there were parents that it wouldn't work.
So we went.
Can we make a window to talk directly with the mobile, so we don't need the announcing as a Bay Bay?
Yes.
Could we define the spinning of the window enough so it would be a real Internet connection?
So people can get something more than SMS?
The first tests didn't even expect to a second, but now we can get to 15 meters per second.
It's enough to watch the TED Talk.
Are we able to make white talk to each other through the sky so that we can bring Ghana deeper into open areas?
We've managed.
Could we create a blogs of a house to stay up over 100 days, while it's going to be less than five percent of some of the restaurants that have long animals?
Yes, at the end.
But I promise you, how you call it, we had to try it to get there.
We've created fossil bones and customers.
We've created a huge blogs in a box.
We've created the size of a blue satellite.
We've made a lot of blogs.
[] Because one of the things that was in the highest way to kill the dictionary project was if we could predict the window in one of the most important experiments was to put in a blog.
So there are two cells here, one with air and another with the day.
The hotel that's in the air in order to do himself as a more liver, or a air flow to be easier.
And these weight change enables it to go and restaurant, and it's this object of the window is the opposite mechanism.
It's taken to the night and down, it's hoping to search for predators that are in the direction and speed that it wants.
But is it good enough to move around the world?
In the beginning, but better all the time.
This particular hotel, our last hotel, can go down a 2-kilometer in the sky and eat itself into a 500 meters of the universe where it wants to be from 20,000 miles.
We've got a lot more to do in terms of a better concept of the system and reducing costs.
But last year, in a blog that was built in the wall of the world 19 times over 187 days.
So we're going to continue.
Thank you very much for our buildings today do less or more everything that the system needs to do.
We're facing communities around the world, and we're going to fly over places like intuition to real choices of this year.
This is probably good to be real, and you're right.
It's going to be convenient and work on big and dangerous things make people uncomfortable.
You can't stop people and make them faster.
People die. They're worried.
"What will happen to me if I care?
Are people going to get me?
Is I going to go? "
I started with our secret.
I'll leave you with how we actually make it happen.
The only way to make people work on big and dangerous things -- ideas are moving -- and make them work on all the hard parts of the problem at the beginning, it's if you make it a way of the families for them.
We're working hard to do it safe.
The toilets of ideas as soon as there are dogs on the table because they're reduced on it.
They're getting a lot of them.
Basks and fun from their manager, especially me.
They're focused on it.
We've got a bus to every person in the team who showed his project, small services of two people to the toilets of more than 30.
We believe in dreams of a monitor.
But psychiatric is not the capacity of optimism isn't finished.
It's the perfect piece of optimism.
It represents the potential in any idea.
We can create the future in our dreams.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
The artificial ethical ethics you've been focused on the big security.
The audience is making the president, and at the moment the crisis, it's collecting the below.
It's called "Good war" in which although months, "and for years of trust, a person's power right at the moment.
It's going to be a tree of this tree that's been proved in Scott, where the Oxfords are testing a lot of times under a big pressure and a key pressure.
But it's also reduced by extinctions, you're translated in the evidence, and even musicians are missing.
Most of the people who move their nerves, but why did the emotions get rid of experts?
There's two theories, that they're going to argue that the main reason to stress under code.
First of all, there's the joy theories.
The surprises that the performance is happening when the brain's based on the stairs, emotions, or fear instead of taking the computer in the task.
When you're relevant computers and not relevant to attention, something will pay the price.
The brain can only do some information in any moment.
The tasks that make the work memory, the same brain's brain's brain in which we use to keep a phone numbers and tolerance, is especially in pressure.
In the study of 2004, a group of students in university were asked to do a math task, a part of communities, other complicated and except the memory.
Half of the students put the two types of strength without pressure, while the other ones put them when they're worried and pressure.
While everyone had succeeded in the communities problems, these were under pressure were less than others in the hard questions, who were going to take a lot of memory.
Syrian theories fill the second group of explanations into stress under stress.
They're trained in how stress can make people open too much the task in them.
The trick here is that at a moment that's become autism, the thought about its injury is affected.
It seems that the violence that we're doing without aware are are are the most vulnerable to this kind of bank.
Science of Golden Golden Golden's research that represents their actions when they got to focus on the planet how much more accurate, or in a situation where they made them completely aware of as a feminist in the planet.
It's usually a golf sandwolf that's usually driving these actions for the intervention, so these are all of a sudden they've been able to notice their similar details of their movement became at least good at accurate actions.
But we don't think we're not nice.
The study shows that some more sensitive than others, especially those who know themselves, insects, and they're afraid to judge for a night by others.
So how can we avoid a bank in particularly important situations?
First of all, it's helping to die under pressure.
In a study of professional trees, studies found out that we didn't die under a better pressure when they were confident, especially to those who were excited to stress.
Second, a lot of players are coming back in constant actions before the walls, like a deep president, repeated on a key 3D print, or a short motion.
Scientists of Golden Golden, a liver, and they've taken water out of a short pixels can lead to more indigenous results and diabetes under pressure.
And third, researchers showed that an external code on the final goal works better than a face, where someone is conducted in the planning of what he does.
A study about the Golden Golden School found a question that refugees when they think about a significantly significant generation of those who are focused on the arms.
So, maybe you can admit it that, trust, under pressure, with code, and with a conservative purpose, you can bring to violence.
While thousands of years, we're going to look back to the first century of computing as a very exciting time, but strange -- the only time in history where people were being used to live in a three-dimensional space, and they'd run with technology as if we'd been machines; it's been a unique period of 100 years in the space where people who were going to
Today, we spend most of our time in dozens and look at screens.
What happened to interact with each other?
I don't know about you, but I'm feeling limited in the world's 3D world and magic.
And it's this limit and my passion to connect with people who inspire me as a creation.
Basically, I want to create a new reality, reality in which technology brings us closer to each other, reality in which people, not devices, they're the center of everything.
I'm looking at reality where technology feels what we're seeing, moves and feel that technology doesn't affect us more, but instead of getting out of who we are.
I'm looking at technology in the human direction.
We've all had a technology that allows people to act more like people, products that are natural activity, political control and trial.
This is the next step in evolution.
It's the Netherlands of a microscope, the first birthday's birthday computer.
Technologists like this will be a three-dimensional biographic content into our world, and try to the way we experience life beyond the age of our perception.
Now, I don't think about the far future.
I'm talking about today.
We're already seeing companies like Volo that are different cars with Hollywood; universities like Central Western Washinger represents the way students to universities learn; and my favorite favorite, NASA is used to enable scientists to explore biological plants.
Now, it's important.
By looking at the biographic world, I'm not just talking about a new device or a better computer.
I'm talking about releasing ourselves from the limitations of traditional feedback.
Women that is this: Center for time, we're like people're in a mindset of computers.
We've discovered the coal and we've started to draw the first weight of our lab.
Now, that's the point of view that I'm there to my job every day.
And now, in the next few minutes, I invite all of you to put the same perspective on the journey that we face.
Now, when I've been there for the Hollywood, let me explain the device a little bit.
It's probably the most dangerous president we've ever done about what some of the Netherlands, and I can't think about a better place to do it than at TED.
Another moment, I'm going to see the geography really on the stage, obviously as I see all of you.
Now at the same time, we also have this special camera that just went into the stage so you can all share the feeling with me on all the screens.
So let's start our journey.
And what's a better place to start the journey, than the computer's computer's computer.
Let's explore the world around us with this new dish, and we're going to see the world that's looking at a completely new perspective.
The computing world is also fantastic and primitive.
It's a world that's based on curiosity.
As a programmer, we share the different reasons and then we're planning the different effects.
It's a swim on the iPhone, it's a reason.
It's an option, it's an effect.
Now when we train this into our physical world, it's very limited, because our universe is not digital.
Our universe is analogy.
Our universe doesn't think in terms of zero and one, really or that morning, or black.
We're there in the world that's been scared by physics, the universe of zeroes and sides at the same time, reality is based on unlimited and diversity of bird.
You can see how these two world comes from.
So why are we so common in our analogy life?
We're seeing screens from the moment we're waiting, for a moment we're looking at.
Why?
I think it's because computers give us power.
In the digital universe, we have power to move space and power to move time.
It doesn't matter if you use technology to generation, creativity or communication.
Think about this: Let's all go home the West and watch the Amazon program we have on TV.
It's a theater -- a place and a weird space.
Once I finished this TED Talk, I'm just going to call my favorite family in the atmosphere.
It's the joy of a place.
Now, it's like these forces that we're agreed to deal with the 3D limits of our current digital world.
But what if we didn't have?
What if we could have those digital forces in our world?
You can already see the groups of this, but I believe that our children's children's kids will grow in a unusual world.
It's extraordinary to dream about this world, a world where technology really brings us -- where we live, workers and connections -- with tools that move human experience, not machines that move humanity.
So how do we get there?
For me, the answer takes to look at a problem from a different perspective.
It takes a sense of the world from a machine.
If you're a machine that's trying to feel the world, how do you actually get the problem?
You'll probably try to take things like people, around it or object.
But how does this machine communicate with reality?
And I can think about three things.
First of all, as a machine, I would look at or I would take the reality.
Technology and pollution pollution are great examples of the machine that's designed with people from a perspective of agriculture.
Second, as a machine, I can put digital information, or a platform, into reality.
The biographic are examples of machines that are involved with a environment from a perspective of platform.
Finally, as a machine, I can decide energy with the world through the effective interface.
Now, imagine being able to feel the temperature of object and virtual, or better, imagine the geography and that it's going to push you back with an equal power.
With this perspective, we're able to record reality into a simple trick.
Now here's a secret: as an engineer I'm really excited every time I can reduce something to a trick.
Social leadership for the telephones to this biological computer on my head, machines become able to understand our world.
And they're starting to communicate with us in more personal ways.
Now, imagine you have a nuclear control on everything in the world.
You've got the rise to one direction, and you get reality.
You've got the wall to the other side, and you get an accurate reality.
Now, imagine the whole environment between the Atlantic world.
I love it here.
Now, imagine I could look at you all and appreciate from real people to thousands.
When technology really brings our world, it's going to make the ways we communicate, the ways we work and the ways we play.
More than a hundred years ago, two real men were on the moon, using computers that were less powerful than your phones.
Six hundred million people were looking at the Taliba Milliama from a black hole.
And the world?
The world is magic.
Now imagine how our kids and their children are going to be reducing the restaurant of space with technology that brings the world.
We're already living in the world where you're going to be universal in real time.
And I can predict, and I can already see the biographic forces in the very first future.
In fact, because we were lucky with our blood until now, let's try to do something more crazy.
I invite you to experience, for the first time in the world, here at TED Talk, the biologist in real time, my daughter and my friends, Dr. Francisco, from the NASA's dream.
His name's a fingerprint.
John Nigeria: Hi Alex.
Alex France: Paul! It worked. What's going on today, John?
Applause) John: Everything is great. I had a wonderful week.
AK: So, can you tell us a little bit, John, where are you?
JS: Well, I'm actually in three places.
I'm going to go beyond the street, while I'm going to talk about you.
AA: Wow, a hundred and six million miles.
It's crazy! You can tell us a little bit more about where all this information from Mars come?
JS: Sure.
It's an accurate biologist of Mars, which was built from information that was collected by a critical Revolutionary, which I can explore easily as a place on the planet.
People are natural studies.
We can understand an environment, just being comfortable.
We've built tools like Robert Mary to expand our vision and appreciate our movement.
But for decades, we've been reading out behind screens and curiosity.
Now, we're jumping over all of this, over the extreme anthropologists and satellites between the world's world and to take our first states on the surface as if we were there.
Today, a group of scientists in our task see Mars like we haven't seen -- a recycling world that makes a faster, because they're studies finally like people need.
But our dreams don't have to agree with doing it like being there.
When we direct this real world from satelliti, we can do things.
We can see an invisible organ or represent ourselves to a river of the river.
Perhaps one day, we're going to feel regulation in the weapon just about it.
We take the first dogs.
But we want all the world to join us to take the next few, because it's not a journey to the films, but we're all.
AK: Thank you, John, it was amazing.
Thank you very much for us to join the TED Talk today.
[]]]] []]]]]]] []]]]]]
AK: Bay Jay.
So I've been looking at this future every day and a day.
I get inspired by our ancestors.
We've been living in the movies where we live together, we've been able and worked together.
We're all starting to build a technology that's going to let us go back to human beings where we're in today -- technology that allows us to stop living in a three-dimensional world of screens and pixels, and we can start to remember how it feels like to live in our 3D world.
It's an extraordinary time to be human.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. I have some questions.
AK: Okay.
Oh: So there were some bees in the content.
And I'll ask you directly, and then we'll have a direct answer.
There were thinking about the difference between the blood and the reality of the traditional devices.
We've got to talk to us about the subject of the Iraq.
Is it the kind of experience that's going to make a device that's going to get.
AK: It's a great question, or, I'm going to forget it better, it's a question we've got in the country probably over the last year.
If you do the research, I didn't talk about this question.
I've been interested in it, because at the end of the end, it's the wrong question to ask.
It's the equivalent to show someone in the first time, and then it's going to say, "What's your TV size?"
It's almost unrelevant.
What we need to talk about is the patterns of the light, or reading, which looks like.
And in a better experiment, what's the visual evolution of the thing you see.
So from this perspective, what you've seen -- you know, the camera in Hollywood.
So even if I'd like to die, I can't.
Oh: But the camera has a different investment from our eye.
Right? AK: So the camera has a blueprint on it.
It's seeing a lot of a lot of view of the human eye.
So if you think about the light points that look fair from the perspective of the camera, which is what matters: How many light points I can get in a certain face?
It's the same thing as I get on this virus as I'm going to get on it.
Now, this camera sees that a lot of view of the world, right?
Oh, God!
Laughter) AK: He affected! I told you he was going to happen.
Babbi.
[]]]]]]]]] [Oh, Shah.
AK: And here's Jane Nigerians.
Oh, I knew something was happening, but I didn't really know what.
AK: So in the code: to be completely clear, to a camera that you see on the screen has a much larger interview than the human eye.
But the physical evolution of the geographic that you see, the light points to the wind, they're actually identical.
Oh: So you're Bay -- John, I'm going to get you another moment -- so I'll spend a lot of time in looking at the stage -- OK: That's true.
Oh: So I'm going to help me here: If I'm Kollin and he's got it in the house, I don't need to put the dirt, right?
AK: Hollywood from here in real time in about five days in a second, with technology that we call spaces of space.
So in your house, once you're going to switch it, the geographic will start to show, and you're going to give them them and they're going to start learning your house.
In a environment where I'm trying to put something on my head to communicate with someone there with all the creative theories in the way, we don't want to take a risk of trying to do it.
So what we've done is we're going to predict the stage in five days to a second with the same space technology that you're going to use in a product at home, and then we've put it, so when there's the evidence of the slow around this environment, between Hollywood and it's about my head, things don &
Because at the end of the end, the geographic comes from this virus, and it's just a map in Hollywood.
So if I lose categories, you're going to stop seeing these beautiful things on the screen.
Oh: And it was beautiful.
Am... Jah?
JS: Yeah?
Oh: Hey.
AK: I'm going to go back.
Oh: So Joe, you're on Mars, you've been here, you've been in the room beyond the street.
I'm going to tell me more about the fact that with the biographic, you can see but I'm not going to have a moment, you don't have a wind.
Is it useful for you now?
That's my question to the biologist.
JS: Thank you for the question.
Obviously, I believe that these technologies are really useful right now, and so we're using many parts of our work in Asia.
So we use it to improve the ways that we're exploring Mars.
We also use it to our astronomers on the space.
We even use it to design the next generation of our spaces.
OK, John, please go from here.
Thank you very much.
AK: Thank you.
Oh. Thank you, thank you.
Thank you.
It started in one question: If Africa was before, what was your country with it, or does it do?
I started the thing to feel about South Africa, which wasn't completely about the rules because South Africa is not my country.
But in this country's ideas to build a pharmaceutical company after we've been reduced for years by the Fathern Fathers, I've created, I've created, [Olympic] in South Africa, there was a whole kinds of alcohol and reduced to them in her face.
And then I was waiting.
And then I felt this different sense, where I was wondering whether I wanted the border.
So, I sent some other objects about my country and asked me some other countries in Africa that I know.
And then I was looking again, but this time I went back and I read all the objects I ever wanted to convince myself, not, to remind myself, that I'm really funny and even if no one's going to jump, it's okay.
But unfortunately, I didn't have to keep it over time.
It's pretty quickly, people started to participate.
In fact, at the end of the week, the Amazon Ray Ray came up to 60,000 trees, demanding the continent and published in media all over the world.
People used this Amazon to do all kinds of things.
In order to laugh on their cartoons: []]]] []] To the Nigeria] To go out and explain that she's going to pay the president, all she needs the Bank]] The B
People were together through their African.
So for one week in a month, Twitter became a real African crisis.
And I was really excited, mostly because I realized that an African collaboration can work, that the understanding has to us, in our fingers, the infrastructure that there was only a little bit of a little bit of judging our noise to each other.
I call me Canada Minister, I'm 22 and I'm a product of African Asia.
Now, I say this, because my parents come from two different countries in Africa.
My dad is a gift called Banna in South Africa.
A country that's just a little bit of Germany.
This year we're killing the 50s to the creative democracy in this country.
And there's a country in this country that's very early in social field.
My mom's country is a Soviet Alex.
This is a very, very small country, also in South Africa.
It's the last chemistry in Africa.
So it's been reduced by you and the family of the artificial family in their restaurant, for a very long time.
On paper, these countries look very different from this.
And when I was a child, I could see the difference.
In one country, there's a lot of rain, in another -- not so much.
But except of that, I didn't really understand why that my parents came from different places.
But at the time, it was a very strange effect on me.
You see, I was born in one country and I went in another country.
When we went to Tanna, I was a proud that Soviet Soviet School and nothing beyond it.
So I did the content with my new house, with my new cultural identity, as a complete strange, can't understand what I told me in a family and a country that I was supposed to get on.
It's pretty quickly, I've got the Chinese.
And when I went back to Saudi, I was repeated every time with the fact of some unfinished and I became.
It's been added to my concept to the private education system of Africa, which is that every goal is to take out of the African African that you're going to get a very strange period.
But I think my interested in the ideas of identity, was born here, in this strategies of being used to be two places at the same time, but it wasn't really going to be completely beaten to one of them and be able to be able to be able to be able to this huge space that they've built together.
I was obsessed to this idea, of a common African identity.
Since then, I went to read about politics and geography and identity and what that means of all these things.
And I went to go on the curiosity of the African philosophers.
When I started reading, I went to the workers of black Italians like Steve Bako and France, who would take complex issues like Titan and black and black.
And when I thought, at the age of 14, I put these big ideas into a chimpanzee, I went to the water of African conditions, like Mr. San Francisco in Kenya France and Ford Mexico in Chicago.
I read every African story I could get.
So when it came Twitter, I was looking at it with all the advances of a teenager that her friends were really crazy than hear about all of these things.
This year was 2011 and all over the South Africa and in the continent at all, reducing smart phones and the Internet became more easier.
So in my generation, we've all sent this opinion on about this infrastructure that has just taken 140s and a little bit creative.
In a long trial to work, in the lectures that we've tried to listen to them, in our smallpox, we've just seen how much we've only been in the daily reality of our beautiful and young people.
But of course, these signals didn't have some of them.
It means, if you were a teenager in the Bosta and a dog of the Internet, first, you had to jump in English.
Second, you'd have to track more than the three other people who have made the Internet.
You'd have to track African South, mammos, conditions, adults.
And all of a sudden, your world is open.
And my world really evolved.
I've been followed by African actions that's going to take all over the continent, you're going to get themselves and we're spending the photos under the prosthetic.
Because at the same time, when you were looking at Africa on Twitter or in Google or in any kind of social network, you would think that every continent has just images of animals and a friend of jihad costs in my grandfather.
But African used this infrastructure to take a kind of tool on the walls.
These were African people who were watching the sea of Nigeria.
These were African in the cooperation of News.
And these were the same African that I started looking at my journey around the continent.
We've been exposed about African service, about politics, on economic policy.
But almost a few weeks, every time, we would come to talk about Twitter.
And then I realized what's actually Twitter.
We've been looking at the centuries of something amazing, because for the first time, the first time, African, we could predict the future in our continent in real time, without the leaders of boundaries, of economies and governments.
Because the effective truth is, many African know much less about other African countries than a couple of people who know about Africa in a whole way.
Maybe it's in the case, but it's often done.
For example, in South Africa's country of the Francisco, South African countries were constantly impressed with the idea, that every country that's reduced by black black holes.
And it's been done to convince them that they've had to live under the rural rules than living as a black and free and free.
It's been added to it the local education system and the day of Africa's day, that's going to work without a thought that's been connected since the '50s, I could find all the different reasons for the violence that I've seen in Europe in the last 200 years, but I didn't know what the name of
And for me, there's nothing about it because whether you want and whether you don't, you're going to make any of all Africa that's back.
When it's a disaster, when we're so proud, we're all about results.
When Bonni Bondi is released because of politics, they come to us, to the other African countries.
In Africa, there's six of the biggest refugees in the world.
What was once a problem of Landy became a problem of Africa.
So to me, there's no problems of laws or problems of South African or problems of Kenyan, just African problems, because at the end, we're sharing it out.
So if we share the problems, why don't we do a better job to share the success?
How?
Well, in the long term, we can train the trade of trade within Africa to reduce the boundaries and push the leaders to stand in the asteroids that they've already seen.
But I think the most successful way of Africa to share her success is to courage something I like to call it a social African parism.
Now, a political African has already been there, so I don't invest anything new here.
But a political African nation is usually the African side of the political control.
And who is it useful?
Well, almost only to the African leaders.
No, what I'm talking about is the average African of the average African.
Two African people like me, we're treating creative energy, new ideas.
But with a bad square and bad institutions, all this potential can move.
In the continent where more leadership is in the park for more than the lives of the population, we need to feel like something new, something that works.
And I think that somewhere is a social African.
My dream is, young African will stop giving boundaries and help our innovation.
My dream is, when a young African will come up with an idea of funny, he wouldn't say, "Well, it's not going to work in my country," and more.
My dream is that young Americans start to understand that the whole continent is our painting, is our house.
Through the Internet, we can start thinking in terms of collaboration. We can start to invent together.
In Africa, we say, "If you want to go fast, you're alone, but if you want to get far away, you're together."
And I believe that social African is the way we can get far together.
And it's already happening.
The approach to these local networks, we've come to African cities something we've always had to take violence: voice.
Now we have a infrastructure.
Before yes, if you wanted to hear the young people, you had to wait to the forest, the 65 years old -- Laughter) to make a wall in the morning, take the drug against the French and then tell you about the programs that he had for your wife for 20 years.
Before, if you wanted to be heard by your privilege, you would like you to propose, to reduce the results and keep the fingers that it's a privilege paper somehow get someone to care.
But now we have an opportunity to predict this in ways that we couldn't do it.
We're documented in South African students who have been working in a disease against a high learning learning.
We're documenting women's minds that are going to survive.
We're support antibiotic conditions that are inevitable.
The first time since and ever, to the African pain and the African language has an opportunity to look at by those who can identify more than everyone: other African.
I believe that with an African thinking and using the Internet as a tool, we can start to save those, and eventually, save ourselves.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And it's 128 years since the last country in the world, and 53 years since Syrian Luther King called the "I've got a dream."
But we're still living in the world where our skin creates not just most of the first, but it's all over, that's left.
I was born to a full family in colors.
My dad is a structure of a service, from a murder of a collapse and a hill.
It's courage by those that I know as my grandchildren.
For a trillion, my grandmother, there's a French skin in and a forest.
My grandfather was a device between a variety of and a corporation of corruption, like my courage and my hand.
My mother's a conservation, in the name of Brazil Center, with a chicken chicken, and a man who's an intervention of coffee and space, but with a lot of coffee.
She has two sisters.
One skin in in the size of telescopes and second, it's also extended, more in the direction of the junk, like Panka.
But when I grew up in this family, the color has never been important to me.
But outside the house, on the other hand, things changed in the mirror.
In nature, there were a lot of other meaning.
I remember my first painting classroom at school as a reference of regular emotions.
It was a city and I wanted, but I've never realized the special pencil in a body color. "
I had a body -- but I didn't see.
My skin was heat, and people said I was black.
I was seven years old with Balan's colors in my head.
More later, when I took my courage to school, usually thought I was the page.
When I went back in the kitchen in a reason of a company thought I was the service.
Even have been reduced to me like a pair just because I went to alone on the wall with a professor friends.
And many times, when I visited my grandmother or friends in high seas, I was asked not to use the main list.
Because at the end of the end, with this color and this hair, I can't be in some places.
I've made it and I got some of it.
And yet, something in my face continues to move around and struggle.
Many years later, I started with my book.
But it's not just a secret.
I've chosen one with a weird of weird weapon that's made out of the sun.
[Since, a new question started to push me.
"What's the color of your kids?"
As you see, it's my last fish.
But when I think about it with my background, my story led me to do my personal concept as a party.
And that's what's called "Time."
On Jah, he's trying to prove our real genes, on the back of the cartoons, red, black and yellow.
It's kind of a game that's designed to notice our codes.
This is a job from a personal story to global history.
I'm showing the investments on the background.
So I'm looking at 11 pixels out of the nose, I'm looking at the background, and you're looking at the size of the industrial collapse, Pankton.
I started with a family and friends, and then more and more people had to open up, the elements that came through social media.
I thought the main universe to show my job was the Internet because I wanted a open quote that's left everyone to jump on the button -- also in their head.
The button started to roll.
The project's going to have a big flow of art, extension, physical refugees and musicians.
It just happened.
And for them, my favorite: the project of a public places, and it affects the street, it's a popular discussion, and it creates a sense of community.
I got more than 3,000 people in 13 different countries, in 19 different cities around the world.
Here's just a part of them -- from someone who's reminded in the list of "Ford," and it's in the details that you're going to want the high school.
In France, from Okkko's head to Text.
And students are also in switch, and also in the sky neighbors of his father's skin.
Other kinds of photos, of liquid identities, of fabric tricks, of fossil vegetables or sophisticated patients.
We're all together, we've all built "Time."
These patterns make us repair the way we see it.
When the modern science is likely to make the idea of what it means for us to be "black," "white," "" "" fossil, "" "red"? "
Is it the eye? The nose?
Or is it about our exploration, to the nest, or the bank?
This private discovery became a discovery.
I've just understood that Bay was used for many people.
It represents a kind of mirror for those who can't find themselves participating in the eye.
It was amazing when people started to share with me in their computers on the work.
I have hundreds of these, and I share them with you.
My mom of 11 years old -- my mom to a 11-year-old girl wrote me, "It's a very good job for me to work on her security, because at the end of the week, one of her conversation with her conversation that she didn't have to be able to live in Burgin.
So your work has a very special place in my heart and it's very important to me. "
A woman who would expect her device on Facebook and writing all my life, people around the world was hard to put me in a group, in statistics, in the box.
Maybe we should stop.
Instead of a restaurant, I'm going to stay Iraq: "How would you hide yourself?" And then I'm going to say, "Hey, I'm an artist.
I'm a dynamic birthday, I grew up in a conventional family, and I'm a minute woman. "
To show you just a couple of examples, from Italians and students use it as a source of their customers and their teachers.
This is a collection of face.
Scientists of anthropologists, physics and biology use an academic in different scientific experiences for human ethical ethics, biology, facial identification, or Alzheimer's.
One of the most important effects of the project is that Baye Baye was in the wall of the magazine of the international relationships, "One of the most relevant policies.
And if you're already talking about the heroes outside, I've found the muscles that are used to my project.
Marians.
The teachers are the ones that use an academic as a tool of mental goals.
They're going to make me go back to a painting school, but it's the time as a teacher.
My students, adults and children as one, offer their own nervous characteristics, trying to discover their unique size.
As a budget, I understand that I can be a train of other people can communicate.
As an unknown, as Antarctica, every time I'm looking at a picture, I feel I'm sitting before a patient.
All of the noise, fear and didn't know them in the past...
It becomes love.
The last country -- the last country in the world that's launched the states is the country that I was born -- Brazil.
We've still got to work hard to take care.
The French remained a professor in the whole world, and it wouldn't be a designer.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: It's so strange.
Your software, Linx, is in millions of computers, it's probably a huge hope for a big part of the Internet.
And I think there's about, about a billion and a half people using Antarceland, there's a tree there.
Your software is in each of them.
It's pretty amazing.
You've got amazing officials, of all of this.
That's what I thought -- and I was worried when I saw the picture.
I mean, it's -- it's the center of the global Nex.
Laughter) Thank you for Los Turkey: It really doesn't look very exciting.
And I've got to say, the most common part of this picture, which is that many people are responding to it, is the next table.
It's the best part of my office and I don't really use it anymore.
And I think the two things are interested in this.
The way I work is...
I'd like to have no exceptions.
I think you can see, the walls in green color.
I'm told me that in the institutions of the freedom is using this color to the walls.
And it's a color that's coming out, it's not something that's used you.
What you can't see here is the computer, you can just see the screen, but the main thing I'm important to me in the computer is -- it doesn't have to be big and powerful, although I love it -- it really has to be a completely effect.
I know people who work in Google and they have a little bit of small data.
My office is the most successful effort you've ever seen.
And I'm sitting there alone.
If the cat comes in, it's sitting in my hands.
And I'd like to hear the crowd from a graph, not the scans in the computer.
CA: So it's amazing, because in this work, you can manage this technologies -- it's an artist -- so it's an amazing tree of open code.
We've told us how you're going to build an open code and how it's led to the development of Netflix.
LP: I mean, I'm still working alone.
I'm working alone in my house, often in my shelter.
When you get a photograph, I'm afraid, so I'm wearing.
So I've been working always.
I mean, I also started Nicx.
I didn't start Nicx as a collaborative project.
I started it as one of a series of many projects that I did at the same time for myself, partly because I had their consequence, but more than that, because I just went from the conference.
So it was for the end of the journey, that for 25 years, it didn't come.
But it was really because I was looking at myself's project, and open code didn't happen to me at all.
And what happened is...
The project grew up, and it became something I wanted to switch with people.
Actually, it's more like, "Wow, look what I did!"
And believe me -- it wasn't that great at the time.
I opened it into a fabric use, and it wasn't even an open code at that point.
At the same point, it was code, which was open to use, but there was no intention of open use as we know today to improve it.
It was more like, "Look, I'm working on it for half a year, I'm happy to get response."
And people went to me.
In the university of Linki, I had a friend who was an open code -- at the time I called it mostly "free software" and he showed me this piece, my name, you can use an open code, "which was already there.
And I thought about it a little bit.
I was actually worried about a conference of curious interest.
I mean, I think it's one of the worms that there's every one that's starting, worry that someone will take their work, right?
And then I decided, "What can be?"
And -- CA: And then somewhere, someone has a code that you thought, "Wow, it's really great. I wouldn't think about it.
It can really improve. "
LP: It didn't even start with people who were going to take code, it was more people who had taken ideas.
And just the fact that somebody else is looking at your project -- and I'm sure it's also going to take a look at other things, but it's a single one that's looking at code -- the fact that somebody else's going to do enough to give you a real pattern and give you ideas.
It was a great thing for me.
I was 21 years old at the time, so I was young, but I've already designed half of my life, actually.
And every project before, it was completely personal and it was the prosthetic when people just started to respond, started to give feedback on the code.
And more before they started giving a code back, it was, I think, one of the big moments I said, "I love other people!"
Don't get me -- I'm actually not a social person.
So I don't really like other people -- but I love computers, I love to be about people through email, because it's actually giving a kind of wood.
But I do like other people who come up and intervene in my project.
And it became so much more.
CA: So would there be a moment where you saw what was built and it started to fill out, and you thought, "Just a moment, it could really be something huge, not just a personal project that I'm getting a nice feedback, but an open development that will affect the world?
LP: Not really.
I mean, my favorite part of me, really, was not when it became huge, it was when it became small.
The real part for me was not to be alone and when there were 10, maybe 100 people are involved -- it was a significant point.
The rest of the rest was very expensive.
The crisis from a hundred people to a million didn't have a big budget -- for me.
Well, I mean, it can be if you are -- Laughter) If you want to sell the result, then it's a very big one -- you don't get me wrong.
But if technology is what you've heard you and you're interested in a project, the important part was the community.
And then the community grew up in a dramatic way.
And in fact, there's no point in which I thought, "Wow, it's really the muscle!" Because it's -- I mean, it took a lot of time, relatively.
CA: So all the technical people I'm talking to you, offers you as a mother is responsible to a huge change in their work.
And it's not just for Nicx is this thing called a text, which is a Newish system for software.
We've told us about this, and your job in the development of this.
LP: So one of the problems we had, and take time until this problem is like...
When you grow from 10, or a hundred people who are working on a software project to 10,000 people, which is -- right now, we're in a situation where we've just got 1,000 people involved in every crowd that's created every two months, about three.
Some of these people don't do a lot.
There are a lot of people doing very small changes.
But in order to make it, the size changes the way you need to stop it.
And we went through full of resources.
And there's projects that are just going to get out of there's code.
CVS is the system that was the most used for this need, and I hated the CVS that came up with it and I've tried something else, which was extinction, and everyone else's extended from me.
CA: And we were instead of not good, we had thousands of people who wanted to participate, but in many ways I was a dozen point, as I couldn't go to a stage where I could work with thousands of people.
So the text is my second big project, which is only created so I could make my first big project.
And this is exactly the way I work.
I'm not afraid for -- well, I'm hopeless for the president -- but I want to code for something that I've ever done was something I've ever had and -- CA: So in fact, Linx and also a very unusual result of your eye that doesn't work with too much people.
LP: Yeah, certainly.
Laughter) CA: It's amazing to BC.
Right: Yeah.
We'll give us a couple of lucks, but...
Here's a picture of you as a child, with the current line.
The reminder you're designed since you were 10 or 11, half of your life.
Would you be such a computer museum, you know, a nane on whether you were the planet at school that could do anything?
How would you be a child?
LP: Yeah, I think I was the typical design.
I mean, I was...
I wouldn't be social at that time.
It's my young brother.
I'm clear I've been more interested in the Canada than my young brother.
And I'm a young sister, not surprising in the picture, when we had family events -- and it's not a huge family, but I've got, say, how many people are -- she'd know me from my head.
I mean, before I went to the room, she would say, "OK, it's an accident..."
Because I wasn't -- I've been a market.
I was interested in computers, I was interested in math, I was interested in physics.
I was good at this.
I don't think I was very extraordinary.
It turns out, my sister said, my most extraordinary machine was that I couldn't.
CA: Okay, let's talk about it, because it's a camera.
You wouldn't be happy.
So it doesn't have to be funny or be smart, it's about you.
LP: It's going to be a content.
It's like you, like, just start something and doesn't say, "That's, I've finished something else -- you'll see:" Good! "
And I notice it also in many other parts of my life.
I've been living in the Chile for seven years.
And I've been working in the same company, in the Cylon, for all the period.
It's really rare.
It's not the way the Cyrus works.
The whole idea in the Chile is that people jump between jobs and innovation.
And that's not who I am.
CA: But during the development of Nicx itself, this innovation is sometimes made up of projects with other people.
A book about it a little bit.
Would it be positive to put the quality of what's built?
How would you describe what happened?
LP: I don't know if it's positive.
I'm not in social human, "-- sometimes I'm also...
How to say, "A short interview when it's about other people's emotions, and it's sometimes causing you to say things that are affected in other people.
And I don't get it.
But, in the same way, I understand people who say I need to be nice.
And then when I'm trying to explain them that you might be nice, maybe you should be a little bit more face, they see it as an example that I'm not nice.
So what I'm trying to say is that we're different.
I'm not a man of people, it's not something I'm proud of, but it's part of me.
And one of the things I really like in open code is that it really allows people to work together.
We don't have to switch each other -- and sometimes we don't really wait each other.
It's really -- that means, there's very, very aggressive.
But you can, actually, you can find things -- you don't even agree, it's just that you're interested in really different things.
And back to the point that I mentioned earlier that two of people from a restaurant who will take your job, it turns out, very quickly it turns out, these restaurant people are professionals, magic.
And they did all of these things that I really didn't want to do, and they had completely different goals.
And they used the open code in the way I really didn't want to use it.
But because it was open code, they could do it, and it actually works really beautiful.
And I really think it works in the same way.
You need to be the anthropologists, the connections, the social and social people that are like this -- Laughter) You really want to stop you and engagement to the community.
But it's not everyone.
And that's not me.
I care about technology.
There's people who care about the web to use.
I can't do a user interface at all.
I mean, if I've been a time on a single one and the only way to get out of my mom was to build a beautiful interface, I've been there.
And so there are different types of people, and I don't want to want, I'm trying to explain.
CA: Well, when we talk about a week, I'm talking about another neighborhood you have, which seems to me really interesting.
This is the idea of TV.
And I have some images here.
I think it's an example of a very good TV in the code, and it's an example of a better TV example, which is a unique way to see.
What's the difference between the two examples?
LP: So here -- how many people here wrote a dance of themselves?
CA: Or, Wow.
LP: So I'm sorry to you, everyone who showed the hand, everybody did what's called a normal list.
And we teach it -- it's the first approach that it's not very beautiful, so you learn to do it when you start learning programs.
And you don't have to understand the code.
The most exciting part for me is the last line of "If."
Because what's going on on this list is trying to get out of the task from the task and there's a difference if it's the first restaurant or it's a list in the middle.
Because if it's the first restaurant, you need to change the magazine to the first level.
If it's in the middle, you need to change the magazine of the president.
So these are two completely different cases.
CA: And it's better.
LP: And it's better.
There's no condition here.
And it doesn't really matter -- I don't want you to understand why you don't have the condition, but I want you to understand that sometimes you can see a different problem in a different way and write it back that's going to be a normal case.
And it's a good code.
But it's a simple code.
This is a computer science.
It's not important -- although details are important.
For me, the Chinese of people I really want to work with is that they have good, and that's why...
I sent you this simple example that it's not relevant because it's too small.
It's much better than that.
Titchen is the vision of big patterns and intuitive way to know what the right way to do things.
CA: Well, so we're going to connect here the parts right now.
You've got TV, the way it's significant to software people.
You're -- Laughter) LP: I think it's significant to some of the people here.
CA: You're a very sophisticated programmer, and you're going to have a smoke.
But there must be something else.
I mean, you're going to change the future.
You're going to have the ability to see huge ideas of the future.
You're a vision, right?
LP: The truth is that I felt a little uncomfortable at the last TED Talk, because there's a lot of food, right?
And I'm not a man of food.
I don't have a simple plan.
I'm an engineer.
And I think it's really -- I'm completely getting all the people who go around and just look at the clouds and look at the stars and say, "I want to get there."
But I'm looking at the land, and I want to fix the wall that's used before I'm going to go into it.
This is the kind of man I am.
I've told me a week about two people.
Who are they, and what is your context to them?
LP: Well, it's a little bit of a clinic in the world, all the Tasmanda Street in a tremendous disaster, when Tesla was caused as a vision scientist with the bad ideas.
And people like Tesla.
I mean, there are people who call their companies on their name.
Laughter) The other person is great, that often is an enormous, which is an abstraction that it's spontaneous, which means, his most famous quote is, "OK is one percent of inspiration and 99 percent."
And I'm in a tremendous, even if people don't always like it.
Because if you're really excited about the years, Tesla is more likely to look at people today, but who really changed the world?
Adon't have a nice person, he did a lot of things -- he might not be this intuitive, not a vision.
But I think I'm a lot more crazy.
CA: So our subject at TED Talk is dreams -- big dreams, convenience, actions.
You're actually the opposite of this.
LP: I'm trying to decide it a little bit, yes.
CA: It's good.
[We're bringing you, we're bringing you up.
Scientists like Google and other reasons, won, you can say, billions of dollars from your software.
It feels you?
LP: No.
No, it doesn't feel me from a few reasons.
One of the reasons is, I'm kind of a room.
I'm really good.
But the second reason is -- I mean, without all the open code and his concept, Linx would never be what he was.
And it brought the experiences that I didn't really enjoy them, talk to a audience, but at the same time, it's an experience.
I'm sorry.
So there's a lot of things that make me happy and think I've been reducing the right choices.
CA: Is the idea of the open code -- and I think we're going to end up here, is the idea of the open code already in the world, or there's a price where to go, and there's more things he can do?
LP: So, I look at here.
I think one of the reasons that open code is so open to software is that at the end of the end, code is usually black and white.
In the cases, there's a pretty good way to decide, that something is done like you need, and something else doesn't do in a good way.
The code works, or it doesn't work.
And we've got arguments even that, right?
In many other issues -- I mean, people have talked about open politics, and things like this and sometimes really hard to say that yes, you can put those principles in other areas just because the black and the white becomes not only to improve, but for many other colors.
So, of course, we're seeing that open code goes back to the world of science.
The science was there first.
But then the science became pretty sick, with Jersey very expensive and that's things.
And open code goes back to the world of science, with things like Fexford, and Georgians are open.
And Korea also changed the world.
So there are examples, and I'm sure there will be more in the future.
CA: But you're not a man of food, so you don't have a job to predict who they're going to be.
LP: No.
It's your job to build them, right?
CA: Just.
Los Angeles, thank you for Los Angeles, thank you for the Internet, thank you for all the phones of Android.
Thank you that in here to TED, and it's so much about yourself.
LP: Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm here to talk to you today about the story that made us believe it's not possible.
It's a story that's about a living, and it's a story that's made in a environment: the U.S. government.
Now, this telescope begins to switch the way the government does business inside.
But before I get to this, let's start with the problem.
For me, the problem starts with a number: 137.
137 is the average number of water that's coming out of the military has to wait so that his trials will be taken by the office of the military.
137 days.
Now, to respond to this hard thing, first of all, it has to move more than 1,000 different challenges and more than 900 phone numbers, everyone in the United States, and they're acting on the ground.
Now, we live in an amazing change.
The private sector is changed and improving itself all the time.
For the point, it's released all of the insects in my life that I can think about.
I can sit on my desk, and from the phone, I can invite a little bit of a galaxy that can get into a less than a minute.
But in the meantime, if you work in food design to support her family should be scared and complex than it might not be able to do the web.
And her ability to do the same work from her book says that she might have to take days or hours of freedom of work that she can't afford.
And the optimism between those who are the digital revolution to them and that is that it's the left is one of the biggest challenges of our time -- well, because the failure of government to provide digital services that are working on the people who need the most productive.
It's affecting students who are going to go to college, the one of the one that's trying to get healthcare, the army that comes home from the city.
They can't get what they need when they need it.
And these Americans, the government is more than just four years old.
Her government is the life of the toilet that they need and share them and tell them.
That's, if it's a car, the reason the government has to start working and reduce at a rate.
Just say.
Now, it wasn't always a problem I had an answer about it.
When I joined the campaign of the president of Obama in 2008, we realized the best behavior of the Tasmanian industry to politics.
We've spent more money, we've spent more volunteers and we've spent more molecules than any political production in history.
We've been a telescope in the front of the technology that changed politics for the future.
So when the president asked a small group of us to bring it directly into the government, I knew it wasn't going to be a hard job, but I was going to go down and I got a familiar to work.
Now, on my first day at work in Washington, my first day in Mexico, I went into the office and they gave me a page.
And the page of the 98 windows.
And I mean, three choices in the halls and went since the government reduced the operating system on this computer.
Three systems!
And then we realized that this problem is much larger than we ever could imagine.
Let me paint you a picture.
The French government is the largest institution in the world.
It takes 86 billion dollars a year -- 86 billion -- on data projects.
In order to put this to communicate: it's more than all the risk that the industry has been invented every year -- about everything.
Now, the problem here is that the perfect species don't get what it's pay for, because 94 percent of the female data systems are going to play the budget or from others in Egypt.
94 percent!
For those of you who think, yes, the number 94 is very close to 100.
Laughter) There's another problem: 40 percent of them never see light today.
They're completely fabulous or convenient.
Now, it's a very expensive moment for every organization, because it means that when government continues to cooperate like it's designed to work, as failures are almost inevitable.
And when Texas is the most engaging option, it means that there's just no other choice from a bad disorder.
So, what do we do with this?
How do we make it?
Well, the irony of all of this is that we actually didn't have to look far more than our background, because it's used in America has the ideas themselves, the people, who've been pushing our world in a different way that was two decades ago.
So how would it look if it was actually so easy to get the window and the student or the tricks of a magazine like to invite food to the house?
How would it look like if there was a simple way to every project and invented the technology to come and change the government?
Well, my friend, here's where we're starting to talk about how many of the new emotions we've discovered to create a change in the government.
And here's the digital service of the United States.
The digital service of the United States is a new network of zeroes, a team of services, feeding themselves to the government to create a radical change.
The task of the digital services of the United States is to help provide digital services at a global level of students, the cities, children, old, old -- everyone -- meaningful.
We're basically trying to build a cool of cool, for the people, by the people, today.
We didn't care -- Thank you.
If you don't want more cool, right?
We don't care about politics.
We're going to make the government work better, because it's the only one we have.
Now, you can think about our team -- well, it's pretty funny -- you can think about our team a little bit like the wonderful peaceful peace with a team with a team of crowdness and buy six.
We're going to go like the peaceful peace of genes, but instead of going to move to crazy places, interesting and laws, you spend most of your time in the face, behind computers, help help return our genome of democracy.
But now, this team -- our hormones for the digital services of the United States is pretty simple.
The first game is that we're getting the best texts that our country can offer, and we're bringing them into a short time in the government.
These are the people who helped build the products and companies who have done our technology business between the most common world.
Second, we're taking these amazing people from the technical soldier with the traditional public office that's already within the government creating a change.
Third, we're reducing them a strategy in the structure of the most critical services and animals that are invented.
And finally, we're giving them an asteroid aid, from the president in the secret agencies all the way to play itself, to change these toilets for good.
Now, this team begins to change how the government is doing business inside.
If you're learning the discrimination patterns, one common machine is pretty simple.
It's going to take something that's going to do and statistics in one industrial industry and put it into another where it's a radical change from the Texas.
Think about what Al Albert Babby took that was terrible in the wind and put my apartment from revolution.
The digital services of the United States do exactly this.
We take what's called the Sylin and the business sector learned through a lot of hard work on how to build digital services at a scale that's used to use lower cost, and we're putting it on the government, where it's a radical change from Texas.
Now, the good news is: it starts working.
We know it's because we can see results from some of our early projects like the courage in Alzheima, when it's going to go out.
Callota []] was the first place where we had this lab, and today we take the same out of the screen and defend it to a big number of government services that are most important to citizens.
Now, if I can take a moment and look at my team for a second -- it's the biggest amount of musicians I've ever been able to dream about.
We've got telescopes from Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, everyone in the team today, everybody's choosing to join their government.
And what's amazing about this is, everybody is to add and learn like they're intuitive.
And I'm maybe a train, by the way, over half of us are women.
But the best way to understand this strategy is actually to go through a few examples of how it works on the surface.
I'll give you two examples quickly.
The first one is going to respond.
It's, my friend, it's coffee in a standard crisis.
Yes, you've got -- it's almost completely based on paper.
In the best case, it's hard to take six to eight months to be a box.
It's taken thousands of kilometers -- thousands of kilometers! -- between not less than a metaphor.
Now, a small story: about a decade ago, the government thought that if we would put the system into the network, it could be able to pay money and make a better option, which was a great idea.
So, the prototype process started.
Two years ago, 1.2 billion dollars later, not a product works -- 1.2 billion.
Now at this point, the president of civilization, the citizens and the approach of the United States, could continue to reduce money to the power program.
Unfortunately, this is what happens many times.
It's the history of the day.
But they're not.
I've spent the connection of teachers inside the agencies decided to stand and read to change.
We published a small team of only six people, and what many people don't know is that it's the same size as a team of Alzheima -- just six people.
And this team jumped in, together, to support this project into a better business, modern development solutions.
Now, in an untechnical talk, what it's basically saying is to take big projects and professors and spread them into small pieces, so in this way we can reduce the risk and actually start to see results every few weeks, instead of waiting a black box for years.
So in less than three months of our team on the ground, we can already push our first products to activity.
First, it's a 90-page.
It's used to respond to a woman to a window of a dream.
Now, to the Tiki Viki, the Grandon Center is a big deal.
Your Grand Central is your fingerprint, it's your work, it's your conversation that you can be in this country.
So to wait six months while the government lost the song is not a voice.
I'm excited to tell you that today, you can now, for the first time, to respond to a woman who's completely dressed with the web without somebody who's in a piece of paper.
It's faster, it's cheaper, and it's a better experience for the hard thing and the government.
[Applause] Another, quickly.
In the end of the past, we've created civilizations to try new.
So as a part of become an American citizen, you need to go through civilizations.
Anyone who takes the test, it can be a pretty scared process.
So our team is released a very easy tool and just using a simple language to help people predict, to help reduce their pressure, to help them feel more safe in the next step in the American dream.
Because all of this work, all of the work on the cave, we're going to take complex processes and make them more human.
One day, one of the creative public interviews in the front line said something very funny.
She said she'd never been so lucky and optimistic about her project all the time in the government.
And she did it for 30 years.
It's exactly the kind of hope and cultural change that we're trying to create.
For example, my second one, I want to go back to the military of the military, and what we're doing in order to build them an organization that's going to be able to serve and their location.
I'm going to say that only a few months ago, we've released a completely new species of a new website, V.T.
And VV.C. is a simple website to use that brings all of the local services that come out there should be one place.
One website, not thousands.
The website is a job in action, but it's a significant progress, because it's designed with the users that are important: the military will come themselves.
It may sound completely clear, because it should be, but unfortunately, it's not terrible.
Many times too often, productive decisions have been done by faces and professionals that do the more you could make the interest of the user, but they're not necessarily necessarily the users themselves.
So our team in the organization of the military organization came out, we looked at science, we've talked to the army of the military and started in a small, with the two most important services that are the most important: education and education.
I'm going to say they're working on a website today, and when the team continue to improve services, they're going to go down, and the old challenges, they're going to go.
So for me, this is a change in 2016.
When you go out of the road road, the first time I was there, I looked at the quote that the president of the Darag was carrying on the road.
It said JFFFC.
She says, "There's no problem of the human being that it's beyond humanity."
It's true.
We have the tools to solve these problems.
We've got the tools to one of a company, as a country, and we've got it together.
Yes, it's hard.
It's particularly hard when we have to fight, when we need to convince eight things that don't have.
But aid, it's a lot of the most difficult things that's worth doing, because if we don't do them, who will do them?
It's us, we're all together, because it's not an abstract institution or an idea.
His government is us.
Now, you know, it's not a more question of whether change is possible.
The question is not, "Can we?"
The question is, "Do we do it?"
Do you do that?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I was seven years old, one adult with good goals asked me what I'd like to be when I grew up.
I said, "Ah!"
"No, no!" He said. "You can't get rid of being an artist!
"The dream of a teenager who was seven to be Phicaso.
But I collected myself, I went to search for another dream, and I finally decided to be a scientist, maybe something like Albert Einstein.
[] Scientist]]]]]]]]]]]]] Science for the future []]
And so, I decided to learn computers in Kenya.
My first year, my grandmother's effort to the computer physics showed us some wonderful movies.
It was the first computer theory we've ever seen.
I looked at these movies in Fina, fascinating. Philippy pounds me in the brain, and I thought, "That's what I want to do in my life."
The idea that all math, science and code that I learned can be able to create the world and characteristics and stories that I've been social to, was a complete magic for me.
Just two years later, I started working instead of making these films, the analogy of Pixar.
There I learned how we really take these films to work.
To create our movies, we create a 3D world in the computer.
We're starting at the point, that's produced, that's made of face, that's made of characteristics, or trees and loans in the end of the end of something become a forest.
And because it's a 3D world, we can move the camera around this world.
I was fascinated by all of this.
But then I got the first mistake of light.
It's actually a library of lights inside this world.
I've really got the iPhones of light, which I'm listening there.
Here you can see that I've put light, I'm taking the first version of a theory in our software, you're going to reduce the tools, and you're looking at the light.
When I move the light, I think about how it might look like in real life, but I'm going to appreciate it with what we need to be artificial and the same story.
So it can look like this at the beginning, but when we're moving it and move it, for weeks of work, it might look like this in the first version: and in the final version, like this.
There's a certain moment in a teacher that made me completely love with it.
It's when we go from it.
It's the moment where all the parts come together, and all of this world is going to wait for life as if it's a real place.
This moment, we've never seen a device, especially for this seven girl who'd been able to be an artist.
As I learned to leave, I learned to use a light to help tell a story, to put the week on the day, to create the light, to lead the perspective of the faces, how to make the violence look like, or look at a deep background.
You've looked at a door?
And here's it.
As you see, we can create every world we want in the computer.
We can create a world with chimps, with robots that love, we can even get the muscles to fly.
It's an amazing thing, that's an amazing freedom of this conservative freedom, it can create an airplane.
It can create unbelievable violence, unbelievable movement, things that consume faces.
So to fight it, we're sharing ourselves with science.
We use science and in the world that we know as a spinal cord, to treat ourselves in something that's in the needle and it's about pollution.
"You're looking for" is a great example of it.
A big part of the movie happens under the water.
But how do we make it look under the water?
In the study and early development, we took a little bit of a little bit under the water and created it repeat the computer.
After that, we took it back to see what elements create this particular view.
One of the most critical elements was the way the light goes through the water.
So we wrote in the code of light that's designed the physics -- first, the mammos of the water, and then what happens with the colors.
The objects that's close to the eye has the interest and the cities.
When the light goes deeper into the water, we lose the red loud, and then the green road, and we're going to move with the blue line in the rules.
In this clip, you can see two more important elements.
The first one is the prosperity and the genes, or the invisible fingerprinting the particles that move in the water.
The other one is "Octoxic."
These are the movies of the light like those that you can see on the roof of of the healthy, which are created when the sun is moving in the boundaries of the red and the wheels on the ocean.
Here we've had the tremendous agriculture.
They give us a symbol to the natural gas, but also teach what it's up.
The other magical thing you can see here is that we've put this part with the axis, so it's coming in and out of these movies of light, it's affected, creates the frog, the end of the world.
You can see how we use science -- in the physics of the water, the light and the chicken to reduce this artificial freedom.
But we're not connected to it.
We're wearing each of these elements and if you have to be a scientific action and if we could push and be happy to get a story and make sure.
We've been pretty early on, that with color we have a machine space.
So here's a three-dimensional notion that's made in a traditional way.
But here we can take a symbolic and make it quite green to flow the heat of what's happening.
In this concept, it's really important that looks deep into the water so that we can understand what the East Australia is, where the states are designed as they're on the river.
So we've changed the view of water a lot beyond what you've ever seen in real life.
Because at the end of the end, we don't try to return a world that's true, we're trying to create a faster world, so the faces can play it to experience the story.
We use science to create something amazing.
We're using a story and an artificial moment to bring us to a place of prison.
It's a great example of it.
He's found beauty in the most simple things.
But when he came to the bottom, we knew we had a big problem.
So we've become a scientist to make a convinced robotic robot, which is used his church to a optimist.
It's one of the most critical game that it has.
It doesn't have faces, or even a traditional dialogue, for the need of this.
So the anonymous would depend on his chicken to sell the game and his feelings.
We started in a teacher, and we realized that the woman's wearing in his church is a piece of the Glan's face.
He started getting a fake view.
So now, a fake perspective is basically a threat when you try to convince that robot has personal and it can love.
So we went to work on these optimistic commons in trying to find a solution that represents his real robotic materials, but we're going to get this transformation problem.
So we started with the news.
Here's the president of the president, we've got a teenager and a teenager.
And here you see all the three together, which we're showing us all these participants.
We've tried to decide them, we've tried to get them out, nothing worked.
Here you can see, sometimes we needed something specific that would expect in New Yorker usually.
So we couldn't use just what's famous patterns on the news.
So here we've got the email on the first woman, and we've put my hand on the other woman, it doesn't work.
We decide it -- it's still not working.
And then we've got the "Korea!"
We've been reduced to light, which is going to move into his eyes.
Here he's leaving these birds.
All of a sudden, these fingers go through this participation in a way that nothing did before.
Now, we're identical there's a eyes.
As human beings have the white white of the eye, the shape, and the guy's black.
Now Lord has the black of the eye, the bird of the fingerprint and the black person.
Finally, and Solly feels like it has a weapon, as if there's patterns with emotions in the face.
Later in the movie to the end, and I don't lose his personality, actually starts to die.
It's the perfect moment to return this crazy perspective.
In the next one, and it's not going to go back to life.
We're bringing this light to bring back to the fingerprint back, and it's become a sophisticated robot, full of what we learned to love.
And DP: "Oh?"
There's beauty in the unexpected events -- when you find the key to the robot's face, you're going to find out what you want to do with your life.
The president of "looking for his name" was one of these moments for me.
There's curiosity in every movie that's fighting.
It was one of these customers.
In Marian, there was a vision of this concept that was based on a great piece of previous president in the South Pacific.
The more we've been able to look at.
The victims with the president became the normal conversation of shows and feeling more and more questions about numbers and fathers.
Maybe not as much as we've worked on something in the real world, and maybe just because we've lost our way.
But it became used to use our brain without the eyes, to use science without art.
This scientist was pushing us the concept.
But even through all this concept I still believed that it could be beautiful.
So when it came to the corner, I won't come in.
When I've been working on Italian between the patients and Ross, the acasteroids that are carrying on the previous actions, the limitations, something that's going to happen.
One morning I came and I looked at the work of the previous night.
And my daughter.
And then I showed it to the corner, and it got to the top.
After that, I showed it to the eye in a very important room with five people.
In the form of the mirror, you hope to get some good words, and then more corporations, usually.
And then, in the good case, you're going to get a secret for the next step.
I've made my restaurant, and I've seen the president.
And the office was in a long period of time uncomfortable.
It's just enough time for me to think, "Okay, it's lost."
And then he started to sell.
And then the personal nerve started to sell.
And then all of the room is spread.
It's the moment for him, I live in a teacher.
This moment where it's all connected together and we get a world where we can believe.
We use math, science and code to create these wonderful world.
We use the art of the story and art to make them live.
It's the combination of art and science that makes the world a place of prison, a place with a nation, a place that we can believe, a place where the things you'll imagine can get out there -- and it's a little girl to invest that it's not just a scientist, but it's also an artist.
Thank you.
Thank you.
cancer affects all of us -- especially those who are sitting back and repeat, very recent years and president to these drugs that are used to medical care, also when we're going to move to our best drugs.
And an engineering at the bottom of the molecular level, when you work on the smaller scale, can provide new ways and avoid fighting the most athetic forms of cancer.
The cancer is a very sophisticated disease.
There's some kinds of cancer, unfortunately, we've learned how to treat a very good way to treat drugs and precedented drugs.
But there's some kinds of cancer that doesn't respond to these feelings, and the tumor is repeated, even after the language of drugs.
We can think of these very aggressive forms of cancer as a kind of bolly on a book of comics.
They're opening, they're looking at, and they're very good at stay in life.
And like most of these days, their forces come from genetic motion.
The genes that change within these videos can enable and predict for new institutions that we don't have, the implications to live even through our best functions.
One example is a trick where a gene enables the cell, even when the medicine comes to the cell, to push the drug out, before the drug can affect.
Imagine, the New York is out of the drug in activity.
It's just one example of the genetic tricks in the middle of the Arabic, cancer.
It's all because of genetic genes.
So we've got an instrument with amazing forces.
And we need new prosperity and powerful.
In fact, we can buy a gene.
The key is a series of the machine molecules from RNA.
RNA is a short range of genetic code that's in terms of a particular gene.
Every molecule from RNA can buy a specific gene in the cell.
Over many years since the corporation, very scientists were very excited about how to appreciate these genes.
But, there's a problem.
RNA works very well in the cell.
But if it's exposed to anthropologists that come in our blood flow, it's going to go through two seconds.
It has to be a long time, it's limited by a journey in the body to the end of the end of the movie.
So, here's our strategy.
First of all, you can manage the video of RNA's carrion, and you're going to put them in the regular genes, and then we'll put them in a profound drug.
But how can we do that?
Throughout a molecule engineering, we can actually design weapons that can move through the blood cycle.
It's got to be young enough to go through the blood cycle, it's got to be small enough to take the tumor, and it's got to be a city enough to get into the movie.
To do this work very well, it has to be one diversity of a person's size.
Let's look at most of how we can build this protein.
First of all, let's start with a particle.
It's a toxic box that's used the chemical medicine.
It's the restaurant in fact to finish my life of the film.
Aroughout this night, we're going to have a very, very, very metaphor of RNA.
This is our genome.
Because RNA is a strong negative, we can protect it in a very nice gene of polio with a positive style.
The two molecules that are volunteered with this electrical task, and it's telling us that a gene that's driving the way from RNA's organ.
We almost finished.
But there's another big song that we need to think about.
In fact, it might be the big concept of everyone.
How can we judge weapons on this?
I mean, every good weapon has to be a machine for a step, we have to train this into the Arabic cortex that's going to grow.
But our bodies have a natural definition system that's made out of cells that are in the blood flow, and we're going to get out of things that don't beat, so it can kill or save them.
And guess what? Our proteins were computing a repeat.
We need to define the nanographic into the security system of the tumor.
We've got to get it through the mechanism that we're going to get back from an object by making it.
So there's another one that's about a third metaphor around this protein.
First of all, it's one that's made in natural, multi-profits that come in our bodies.
It creates a cloud of water molecules around the nanography that's made an effect of invisibility.
It's an invisible method that enables a particle to move through a long finger, and it's far enough to get into a tumor, without conducting by the body.
Second, it's when it's a molecule that's made a slide of our cancer.
And when it's brilliant, the movie cell takes the virus, and now we've got our protein in in the cancer cell and it's done.
I feel the same thing.
Let's continue!
It's been working for hours, it's working enough to stop and put those genes of survival.
Now we put the forces on the genetic.
What's more is a film cell without special genes.
And then, a chemical drug comes out of the night and a completely transformation and growth cells.
With enough genes of genes, we can treat many kinds of motions, which allow an opportunity to make a tumor out of a dolphins, without leave behind bad things.
So, how does our strategy work?
We've looked at these virtuous proteins in animals using a very typical ecosystems of cancer.
Technological cancer, it represents the gene that's going to get out of a drug against cancer once it's gone.
Obviously, Darwin -- let's call it "Fix" is the drug for cancer that it's the first treatment of the breast cancer.
So first we've been treated in our lives in Scotch just.
The tumor cells showed their rate of growth, but they still grew up quickly, even their bodies in two weeks.
So, we've tried our regular weapons.
Canadian protein is designed with RNA against the museum, in addition to it, we have the DOOOOOO2 in the night.
And -- we found that not only the dolphins were going to grow, they were actually going into the size of the size and reduced in some cases.
The dolphins were actually in Korea.
[What's great about this approach is that it can be personal.
We can add a lot of different features of RNA to treat different functions and genomines of tumors.
And we can put different drugs into a particle night.
When doctors learn how to look at patients and understand some genetic types of tumors, they're going to help us tell what the bones can produce this strategy and what genomes we can use.
Social cancer has taken me on a special mystery.
It's a very careful cancer, between the rest of the rest of it, because it's being reduced in very low, when it's very, and there's a very genetic number.
After the first choice of chemistry, cancer is repeated in 75 percent of the hospital.
And it's usually returned to drugs.
Social cancer is one of the biggest insects.
And we're machine now our weapons to express it.
As a curiosity, I don't often work with patients.
But I recently met if she had a cancer cancer, my mother, and her daughter, Piji.
I was inspired by optimism and the power that they were whether and they came up and a story of courage and support.
In this event, we've been talking about the different technologies that are prepared against cancer.
And my sister in the classroom when I looked at how to study these customers give her hope for the next generations including her daughter.
It's really about me.
It's not just about how to build a really genetic science.
It's about changing people's lives.
It's about the power of engineering at a scale of molecules.
I know that when students like Jajames in their careers, they'll open new possibilities to deal with some of the largest health problems in the world -- including cancer and biological disorders -- just as an artificial discovery -- as an artificial engineering has come through openness for me, and a piece of engineering in the highest city, of this molecule, of the human molecules.
Thank you.

Incredible arguments require extraordinary evidence, and that's my job, my responsibility, as an astronomy to remind people that the recent soldiers should always be the last production.
Now, I want to tell you a story about it.
It including information continues from NASA, normal people and one of the most extraordinary stars in our galaxy.
It started in 2009 with a magic task of NASA.
The main scientific list of Paller was to discover plants outside our sun.
She did it by a single box in the sky, it, with all the little box.
And in this single fact, he took the speed of more than 150,000 stars without reduction for more than four years, and take data from every 30 minutes.
It's looking for what astronomers call it beyond.
It's when the Pacific is happy with our Italy, so that the Penland is killed before the planet.
And when it's happening, it's a small part of the planet, which can show a decline in this stage.
And that's how the team in NASA has developed very complex computers to look at things all the information of Palestinian.
At the same time astronomers made an interesting idea: What if the computers collected something?
And so we're changing the civil science project called the plastics to people look at the same information.
The human brain has an enormous capacity for patterns, sometimes even better than computers.
However, there was a lot of privacy around us.
My career, talking about happiness, Michael Foundation, said that people at the same time said, "You're not a way you're going to put the lights."
And so it started, the Civil man in the machine.
And if it's one planet, we'll be happy.
When I went to a team four years ago, we've already found a few.
And today, with the help of more than 300,000 scientists, we've discovered dozens, and we've also found one of the most expensive stars in our galaxy.
So to understand this, let me show you how beyond the normal information of Palestinian information looks.
In this graph on the left, you have the amount of light, and you have time.
The white line is light from the planet, what astronomers call a light.
Now, when Poltland goes in a planet, it's a little bit of this light, and that's the end of this exchange the size of the bone itself.
And so, for example, take justice.
Technologists don't get much larger than right.
Turk will make one percent of one percent in the speed of a planet.
The Earth, on the other hand, a little bit of 11 pounds, and the sisters are looking at science.
So back to our mystery.
A few years ago, the Palestinians went through the data and looked at things, and they found a mammogram that comes from the star of KIC 846252 years ago.
The slide in 2009 was the first one that they were remember, and they started talking about it in the face.
They said that water like justice would make a restaurant like this in the planet, but they also said it was huge.
You see, things are usually about a few hours, and it's going to go almost a week.
They also said that he was an artist, which means that in the place of the Henry House in the Olympic form that we saw with justice, he had a strange restaurant that you can see on the left.
It looks like it's a surprise that what's been working on the way, and it's published the star wouldn't be like Penland.
There's a few more deaths that were happening, but for two years, it was pretty much a project.
And then in 2011, we see it.
The star light goes up to 15 percent of water, and it's a unique tool to the planet, which is going to make one percent of only one percent.
We're going to move this machine as well as part and Nigeria.
It's also not a symmetry, when there's a restaurant that's going on nearly a week, and then it's jumping back to the Nigerian in a few days.
And then, after that, not much happens to February 2013.
Things start to be really crazy.
There's a huge and complexity in the light of the light that's affected, and they're staying for something like a hundred days, all the way up to the end of a pilot.
Palestinians have changes.
Some are very special, and some diversity, and they also have different resources.
Some are going to go for a day or two, and a few more than a week.
And there's also a magazine of the top and down in a few of these features, almost like a couple of events that have come up with each other.
And at the same time, this planet is going to win his speed more than 20 percent.
It means that what he's published his light has more than 1,000 times the Earth.
It's really amazing.
And so civil scientists, when they saw it, they were invited to the scientific team that they found something weird enough that may be equal to track.
And so when the scientific team looked at it, we were like, "Yes, there's probably something wrong in science."
But we realized really, really deep in science, and data was good.
So what happened was there had to be a physical astronomy, which means that something in the surprise space and published the planet.
And so at this point, we've been able to learn everything that we're going to do about the planet to see if we can discover all of what's going on.
And the scientists who helped us in the discovery, they joined the journey and fought science in a most active action.
First of all, someone said, "You know, what if this planet is really young and it's still surrounded by a material that we're born.
And then someone else said, well, what if the planet has already created plants, and two of these plants have gone, like the event that made the Earth and the moon.
Well, these two theories could explain some of the information, but the code was that the planet didn't show any sign that he was young, and there was no gold from the material that was scared by the planet, and you would expect it if the planet was young or if there was a struggle and a lot of struggle.
And so somebody else said, well, what about a gift of tricks that go on the planet very popular?
Well, it turns out that it's actually curious with our expectations.
But I agree, it feels a little bit of Mark.
You see, it's going to take hundreds of trials to return what we see.
And they're just looking at the case we're going to go and between the planet.
And so in reality, we're talking about thousands to thousands of thousands of dogs.
But all the bad ideas we had, it was the best.
And that's what we've been doing and we've published our cameras.
Now, let me tell you, it was one of the most difficult people I've ever wrote.
Scientists are supposed to publish results, and this situation was far away from it.
And so we decided to give him an airport, and we called it, "Where's the Fix?"
I'll give you to understand my head.
So it's not the end of the story.
About the same time I wrote this article, I was born with my daughter, Jason Drab, and he also wrote a paper on the information of Paller.
And he said that with the extreme pattern of Palk, he could actually recognize a huge sand of sophisticated animals around the stars, but he didn't.
And then I saw not the strange information that our civil scientists discovered, and he said to me, "So, let's go, Tabby.
Now I have to write the article. "
So yes, the natural explanation was sick, and now we were curious.
So we had to figure out a way to get back.
So together, we've created our voice that's working on SETI, the search for a soldier, which is going to be an extraordinary goal to look.
We wrote the star to look at the star with the largest telescope in the world in Grandon Bank.
A few months later, new news about the discovery was taken to the eyes and now there's thousands of paper, more than 10,000 materials, on this planet alone.
And if you look at Google images, it's what you find.
Now, you may be wondering, okay, Timbabby, well, how do you live around this light actually?
Okay, well, imagine a lot more accurate civilization from us.
In these hypothetic reasons, this civilization has changed all the energy of their homework, so where can they get more energy?
Well, they have a planet just like our sun, and so if they were able to capture more energy than this planet, then it would reduce their energy consumption.
So they've been building a giant brand.
These giant people, like toxic insects, are called a Darson Street.
This photograph over is a lot of artists of Shadn't Prison's imagination.
It's really hard to provide a collection of the size of these things, but you can think about it so.
The distance between the Earth and the moon is 4,000 miles.
The most simple elephant is just one of these buildings is 100 times more than that.
They're huge.
And now imagine one of these boys in motion around the planet.
You can see how it was producing anonymous in science like indoors and not tolerance.
But it's still a giant set of strangers can't improve the rules of physics.
You see, everything that's using a lot of energy is produced, and we don't understand it.
But it can be something simple as they're reading it in a different direction, just not to the Earth.
Another idea that it's one of my personal favorite idea is that we've just looked at the needle between Palestinian and the posterious restaurant of Penland.
Now, I'm aware that it would create a lot of struggle that we don't see.
But if we're already using strangers in the past, then who can't say that they didn't have any activity to protect the presidents?
[You can see how it takes the imagination quickly.
Well, here you are.
We're in a situation that can become a natural phenomenon that we don't understand or to a living technology that we don't understand.
First, as a scientist, my money on natural explanation.
But don't get me wrong, I think it would be amazing to find alive.
Anyway, there's something new and really interesting to discover.
So what's going to happen?
We need to continue to look at this planet to learn more about what's going on.
But a professional astronomers, like me, we've got limited resources to this kind of thing, and Paul goes to another task.
And I'm glad to tell you that again, citizens of citizens in his face and took the day.
You see, this time, astronomers are in boys with the telescopes in the button and start watching a planet every night in their faces, and I'm so excited to see what they find.
What's amazing to me is that this planet has never been found by computers because we just didn't expect something like this.
And what's more exciting is that there's more information you need to get.
There's a new task that's happening in a few million stars all over the sky.
And just thought, what would it mean that we find another planet like this?
And what would it mean if we don't have another planet like this?
Thank you.
Thank you.
People who come back to work after the prosperity in the Kenya, I call them "Finally."
These are people who stop the career to treat adults, or children, to define personal interest or because of disease.
They're very similar to the other people's lines beyond: France of Arabs, soldiers, people who have been repeated from the French or people who come back from the GDP.
It's hard to go back to work after a prosperity because we're going to get between the creatures and the "reinvent."

It's made a role in money or a curiosity, and it's spent the last few months in the network, and it's the web of work, but without results.
I met June June 2011, when the program was hard to work with me to see if I could help her.
The first thing I've said to Terry is that she needs to go out of the house!
I told her she had to publish her job search, and tell everyone about her interview to work.
I also said, "You're going to have a lot of conversations that don't get anywhere.
It's like this, and I'm not going to be worried about it.
There's going to be the strengths in the end of what he's going to have to have a traffic art. "
I'm always going to tell you what happened with a trick, but I want to share with you an English that I've discovered when I've come back to work after a 11 years old career.
And that's, for other people, your imagination is caused in time.
I mean, when you start to create a relationship with people and help be about people from the past, people who work with them or they're talking to them, they'd remember you before you've been able to work.
Even if your nervous sense is made with time, as we happen to many of us, as we move from our professional identity.
So an example, you might think about yourself as a minute that looks like this.
That's me, after a long day.
And here I'm in the kitchen.
But these people from the past, they don't know about anything about it.
They remember just how you were, and it's a big improvement in self-security to come back with them, and that's why they're going to avoid your interest back to work.
There's one thing, I remember at the speed of my private career.
And that's when I looked at the short of business news.
My background is in Fines, and I've been on the news at all, when I've been at home and I've been treated in the four small children.
So I've been afraid I'm going to go into a job interview and I'll start talking about a company that doesn't exist anymore.
So I made a "Wall Street John Jersel" and I read all of them for six months, until I felt I was looking at what was happening in the business world.
I believe that "Freedom" is going to make the work, and that's why.
Think about our step in life: For those of us who took a prosperity to grow children we have less, or we don't have free free.
We've already done it.
We've got less sophisticated than I've got.
We're still in life.
We have a beauty of work.
We have a more sophisticated collection.
We're not, "You're looking for ourselves," on the extension.
And we also have energy, and we're going to go back to work because we've gone from it to the box.
On the other side, I'm wearing with the cases and here's two stairs that there's a cartoon on "reinvention."
The first one is, the cartoons that represent "will" not be a technology argument.
I'm going to tell you, as if there was this before, it's a time situation.
My President of my Pennesian wrote so long, which I used a 1223.
I don't even know if someone remember so far, but I've had to relearn it to Texas.
It actually wasn't so hard, many dots are identity.
"Paul Paul" was more challenging but now I use it all the time.
I'm going to say to all of the "reinvention" that the causes expect them to come to the office with a professional knowledge in the ocean.
And if they don't predict, it's after them to remain.
And they do it.
The second axis of the products is that help work didn't know what they want to do.
I'm saying to the recycling workers that they need to work hard, to know if they're early and their skills have changed or not, at an hour they were in a career accident.
It's not a professional role.
It's the following of the recycling workers to show the market where they can make the most.
In 2010, I noticed something.
I've been following programs back to the work of 2008, and in 2010, I started to pay attention to the art that's going to have a short work, whether we call it death or not, but it's an experience that it's like a transformation, as a way to go back to work.
I've seen that Golden School and Alice Alexander's "open-up planetary programs for the help of the work.
I've seen a repeated engineer, a repeated repeat return, an inheritable return to the military, and it's going to get a perception there.
I saw two university universes for learning programs in the middle of the career.
So I wrote "Don't talk about what I've seen, and it turned into" The Rovis in the House of House, "called" The "The 40s."
I've got to admit on this platform, and also on this art work where you can see a 40-mirror in young plants.
And then, the institutions to the business of Pixis, they called the "The" The 50s. "
It's how to use the biggest financial societies have programs back to work for the fingerprints that go back to the market.
And so many hundreds of people have gone through them.
These connections are in peace, and people who are focused on fifth service require good news.
And now, seven of the biggest engineering companies are doing refugees for engineering engineers that help work as part of the engineering organization.
Why are companies that are connected to help work?
Because the illumination enables to get a real work on a real work and not a series of interviews, and the production doesn't have to get a final decision to the transformation.
This particular period is reduced the risk of risk that there's a part of the cases, and they're focused on a lot of treatments that become great.
Think how much we went.
Before that, most of the cases were not interested in work with "reinvention."
And if now, not just a component programs out of a slide of return to work, you can't respond to these programs if you don't have "hot" in life forms.
It's a symbol for real change, to make a real institution, because if we can solve this problem for strangers to work, we can solve it for other crimes.
In fact, a funny just told me that their program to the Guinus was based on their own reference plan to help help.
And there's no reason that there's not going to be a plan for women.
Good is different, the same idea.
So I'm going to tell you what happened to Dardy School.
Remember she had to tell everyone that she was doing on her exhibition to go back?
Well, one important conversation with the other teacher in the community has led to work: interviewing the training.
But it was a time crisis.
The company told her that it could become a bigger role, but without a room.
It was at the end of 2011.
Trime love this company and love the people and the survivor was close to her home.
So despite she had a different company for an artificial choice, she decided to take a risk with this illness and go to good.
Well, at the end, she'd been on all of their expectations and the company didn't only become the same for a perception, at the beginning of 2012, but they've become the training for a more challenging and more challenging, because they knew what tricks could deal.
It's going to go forward to 2015, local tricks.
They've spent her night to the MBA's school.
It's even more recent that's going to work for her.
The investment of Titi was just a test like the illness, and at the end of this thing was also a feminist and also for her exhibition.
Now, my goal is to bring the idea of return to help work more and more productive.
But in the time, if you go back to work after a career, don't try to save illusions or a generation that's like to go to the market that still doesn't have a female plan for help work.
There was a first success story, and it would be the example of a fire of reinventing "that would come in your face.
Thank you.

One of the problems in the classroom, work and production on the Internet is that it's very hard to separate between option and social change.
And to figure out, I want to bring us back to 1835.
In 1835, James James Guinn was looking at the first cultural newspaper in New York City.
We'll start it as a 500 dollars, which is worth about 10,000 dollars of today.
Twenty years later, in 1850, to do the same thing -- start what's going on as a four-dollar newspaper came to 122 million dollars.
Three, 22 million, 15 years.
The Internet makes this simple change.
And that's what I'd like to talk about today, and the context of this is to develop a conventional production.
We started in a paper, and we saw high cost of reducing information, knowledge and culture, which has led to a spinal space between agencies -- that there had to raise a final gene, like any industrial organization -- and a psychiatric consumption that could choose out of a group of industrial industrial industry.
It's the "data company" or "economics" used a long time to what's coming after the industrial revolution, in fact, to understand what's going on today, because you've got 150 years, we've had information.
Just she was an industrial: products had to find a way to bring money to pay them 1 million dollars, and so forth, more to get the radio, and to the radio, and at the end of the central computer.
It means that there were a market based on the government, or in the government government, depends on what a system is, and it's Einstein, and it's a color of how information and science has been created in 150 years.
Let me tell you a different story. Absolution in 2002, in the world of the world that's been laughing.
First of the first time, you're going to have the most expensive computers -- the most NEC SEC, and you'll get the United States, and about two years old, by the way, we're going to measure the platform that the computer is able to do.
All the DNA is completely impressed by the fact that every time works in another computer: SETI.
One -- 44 million users around the world, more important strengths, when the computer doesn't work, by a screen, and they're pushing their homes to create an enormous computing that's going to develop the data that's going to develop a radio.
It's a picture that's affecting the extreme transformation in which it's going to become productive and reducing information, inevitation, not that there's less convenient in the Indian -- it's less money -- it's about it, it's the most recent, it's most
It's not very different than the middle of the web.
And you can think, Iraq and communities are actually in my hands of everyone who's connected -- and these are the basic economic events of life to create information, knowledge and culture, in my hands about 600 million people around the world.
I mean, for the first time since the industrial revolution, the most important events -- the components of the economic activities -- remember, we're in the economy -- of the most progressive economies, and there's more than any population. It's completely different since the industrial revolution, so that's the capacity of communication and important communication, and
Anyone who's trying to decide someone at work or try to transform his own to someone else, without having to call the park of the hormones, can't tell what he knows, what's going to work in some reasons.
That's what we're unique, and every one of us is going to move in this unique corner to create when it's moving in this neighborhood.
What's the effect of this? The story that most people know is of an open-source program or free software.
It's a marketplace of an ACHA -- one of the animals that are based on a network network.
In 1995, people from two groups, "The web is really important! You need a better chain!"
In one group, there were cultural volunteers that just decided, you really need it, you should say that, and what's done in it -- we'll share! And others can develop.
The second was a microscope.
And I would tell you that 10 years old would be, the extended transition that didn't control about what was made, as 20 percent of the market and represent in the red line, it was amazing!
Think of Navan. A group of engineering engineering in the end of a week is a safe bear.
But in fact, of course, the story is about 70 percent, including the main website for electronic trade -- 70 percent of them are generated and communication workers in a directly directly directly directly to the microscope, not as a kind of interesting strategy to try and make some of the Internet.
In programs, you can't understand it, because it's about it, but it's how it's going to see that it's happening all the web.
At some point, NASA did an experiment with images of the Mars who wanted to predict. They said, "Instead of three, four fifth and training will be done by all the time, we'll just get it into small components, we'll see if people, using a weight weight, you're going to get five pounds, 10 months
If there's a little girl, and she's writing to -- well, not very small, Britain -- that's a research study on my country.
And she's responding to Antarctica, one of the traditional anthropologists.
It's what's looking at me. It's what's there, there's nothing beyond the definition, including "Now," Now, "there's a lot of industries -- a lot of metaphors from an interview, like this guy in this black country." It &ap
And more, not just how you're producing, but how you're producing relevant.
Yao was published because the business works -- in the crisis, now not -- the business is working to look at Ethiopia and say, if they're in Institute. On the other hand, it's what 60,000 volunteers represent in the open project. "Everyone of them's ready to invest -- two of them, and it's
And not just out of the Egyptian. What's the most important innovation in Google? You're going to get the most important thing to do with external bodies; you're going to decide about privacy, the public public public, which is doing as much as the patient on the wall.
The federal innovation: Instead of engineering and experts who would say what's most relevant, we're going to make sure what you're going to do, for any reason that it's -- you're going to have a party -- you've created a party and you're going to look at them.
And again, here's in Scot.com, but also, email, Arab Scocott, a picture in every size, a cultural tree that's in the dream, which doesn't actually find in "Olympic," which is a very high selection.
All of this is a part of content, relevant, basic human expression.
But remember, computers are also physically physically, just physical materials -- our computers, we share them.
Once it was a single person who had failed, and went in a particular region, and you had to decide if you get a device or a device.
We're now going to computers and so small studies that develop algorithms to enable mechanisms like a coffee and make them another collaborative prototype that it can build a rich network by the simple principles: when I'm listening and not using it, I can help you to make consciousness, and when you don't use me.
It's not an autonomous version. It's the ones that are less in some places in the United States, at least for public security.
He said in 1999, let's build an Iranian system and rejecting information.
The system that's going to make objects, there's going to be 24 hours, seven days a week and everywhere in the world.
You're going to support a thousand times using every time that it's going to be dead: the main instrument, Willikes, transparency, you'd assume it's going to take years.
But of course, I'm going to describe PPPPPP.
It seems to us with music, but principle, it's an Iranian system, and that's an information system, where, for reasons, are willing to share the bus and the Iraq, to create.
What we're actually seeing is a device of a restaurant, once there's two dimensions that they've been able to be part of the market, or not based on market, or not based on markets or reducing.
The privilege system was repeated and marketplace.
If an organization improves the buildings, there's companies who want to go into the market -- or governments and sometimes more profit than not based on market.
I've been a recycled creation was a policy, repeated activity in society -- we're going to move into the society.
It was actually economic.
But now it's the fourth method of cooperation and cooperation.
It's not the first time to do things nice to others, social creatures.
But for the first time, there's a central economics.
The elephant is a recycled curiosity.
More to ask, as a building system.
It's open to all create and invest and share, if you want, alone or with others, because the building is one speech.
But not the only one.
In the end, you can see curiosity statistics for all the important things, that market is using them in a building and in the sense, the data is interesting questions, who's available to some goal, the motivation -- remember, money is not always the most efficient.
Who's left a 50 dollars after a long time with friends, doesn't grow the chance that's time again.
And if you don't care about it, think about intuitive relationships.
And in particular, what you're seeing in a task.
There's an exhibition workers in their own country.
There's a lot of time for a long time.
Now, the same problem, you can give up the doors, and the motivation is important.
Five minutes, instead of seeing TV?
Five minutes invited because it's interesting.
Because it's fun. Because it's a sense of meaning, or, in a much more involved, like Willika, gives a social framework.
It's a new social phenomenon.
It's moving down, and it's in the speed, when you're going to take a form of walls.
Technology has been spending the industrial industry, independent programs and open-source code plants from a microscope, to have a potential threat on telephone communication, and Washingdom is conducted with local analogy.
But it's also a new source of opportunities for business.
When you're going to make behavioral system and collaboration, there's new opportunities.
Instead of building devices that are going to be chemical -- things that you can see how they're going to have open tools. There's a new group of values.
Many of these are in self-expression and cooperation.
Like Washinga, like the open project, early early, and transparency.
And women, you see that it's happening, you create a kind of service that's collected, particularly curiosity.
I believe: things will be made of people connected.
It will give me something I need, and I'm going to do with someone.
It's very sophisticated -- it's the reality of Google.
It's what IBM does in software, and it's pretty good.
So I've been a customer creature, it doesn't make a switch.
It's the real change that has made the Internet, and far away.
Social relationships are more easy than ever as an economic phenomenon, sometimes more efficient because of the data quality, offer the right person, the right costs of the right. It's a faster and a faster and faster phenomenon.
But -- and that's the tremendous side -- it's fabulous -- in the same way it's threatening -- by the industrial techniques.
When you opened a paper, and you saw an intuitive building, you're going to get on a telephone communication, it's not something small and technical.
It's about the future of freedom to expect social creatures, and the way you make culture, knowledge and information.
Because here's a struggle with how easy it is or it's going to be the industrial data that's going to continue on, or the new door of creating to open up the industry, and to change the way we look and talk about the world.
Thank you.
Here's two reasons for this: they're just doing more than the same thing, or they're just doing what's new.
For me, the solution that's used to train growth is to understand the food between two costs: critical and extension.
They're both missing, but it can be too much talking.
Think about Paland.
I'm actually enough old to remember them.
Finland was a great company.
They've been born deep inside the office, and they've done the best mechanisms in the world.
Everybody used them.
And what's a psychiatric did when the electronic illustrated?
They kept doing exactly the same thing.
Within six months, they've gone from the original income income.
And they went.
It's gone.
For me the Iran about the story of Palestinian is to hear about the engineers of Palestinian, that we've been looking at, small electronic signals in Japan that they've used them to go back and look at their studies.
Laughter) Palestinian did too much customer.
But it's also a studio can move.
A few years ago, I was working in the action of action to survive a European technology.
Let's call them a movie.
The company was scared.
They've had actions that would make a look at the table, even to the phase, some kinds of cancer cancer.
Every day was about creating something new.
They were very sophisticated, and the goal was, "When we just do it right," or even, "We want it perfect."
What design is, before they became perfect -- even good enough -- they were no relevant.
Office Scott did too far.
I first heard about a studio and a crowd about 15 years ago, when I was working as a crisis at the University of Stanford.
Imagine the idea is James Mars.
And for me the power of the idea is his industry.
Social.
It means, to come with something new.
It's about search, it's about discovery, it's about new products, it's about innovation.
It's about changing our boundaries.
Our heroes are people who have done privilege: Mark Kenyans, Phicago, Nichard Arab Amazon, and so on.
I'm going to come from Mandria; all of our bees are studies, and they're going to be like this.
We all know that senses are dangerous.
We don't know the answers, we don't know if we're going to find them, and we know the risks are high.
Tell is the opposite of it.
It's going to take the knowledge that we have, what we know and do it better, better.
It's going to make our failures to avoid time.
It's about making our products faster and cheaper.
Next isn't a risk -- in the short term.
But if we're just using it very dangerous in the long term.
And I think we've all have memories of fossil fuels that's going to draw the same poems over and over again, until they're going to go from a day or even creative.
It's the risk of exhibition.
So if we take an effect for a long time, we're studies.
If we take perspective for a short time, we're using it.
Social children have been exploring every day.
Every day it's about a studio.
When we move, we study less because we have more knowledge to win it.
As DNA for companies.
Social companies are done, less special as they're going to become more happy.
And it's of course, a lot of worrying about the CEs.
And I'm often asking questions that are trained in different ways.
For example, "How can I put my company and reinvent it?"
Or, "How can I make sure that our society is changing before we're going to be married or move from interest?"
So to do this one is hard.
To do the two good things together, it's art -- push forward, and they're the crowd.
So one thing we found is that only about two percent of the companies are able to explore and apply effective at the same time, in Chile.
But when they do that, the corner is huge.
So we have a lot of great examples.
We've got Nigeria creatures, we've got it into an anthropologist, Tonyota creates the Indians, Nigeria and a lot of examples -- and the solutions are huge.
Why is the food so hard?
I think it's hard because there's so much convenient that enables us rather than we are.
So I'm going to talk about two, but there are many.
So let's talk about the freedom of search.
We find something, but we don't have the customers or the decline to put it, and make it work.
So instead of stay with this, we create something new.
But as DNA about it, so we're in a magic Google of actually come with ideas but being scared.
Office was a good example.
Prime example is, of course, Richard.
But we don't see it just in companies.
We see it also in the public sector.
We all know that any kind of effective reform in education, research, health and even security, takes 10, 15, maybe 20 years to work.
But we still change much more often.
We really don't give them the opportunity.
Another traffic is the success of success.
Federal went to the success of success.
They really got the future in their hands, but they couldn't see it.
They were just so good at doing what they loved to do, that they didn't share change.
We're like this as well.
When we know something well, it's hard to change.
Bill Gates said, "French is a bad teacher.
It's made us think we can't fail. "
This is the challenge for success.
So I think there's some lessons, and they're laughing for us.
And they take on our companies.
The first lesson is: Go the crisis.
And every company that's able to return a particular monitor is actually to make an insurance in the future.
Netflix -- they could be so easier to be happy with the previous generations of a crop, but they always -- and I think they're always -- they're going to go to the next ice.
I see other companies that say, "I'm going to make the next region of innovation, and no matter what's going to do."
Second: Think of time in a lot of time.
I'm going to share with you, and I think it's great.
Every company we look at, as you take a collective collection of one year and look at the inequality of the society, innovation usually is only about 30 percent.
So when we think about one year, innovation is not really important.
We're going to go forward, take a collective collection of 10 years on the same company -- inventing, innovation and be able to return in 70 percent.
But companies can't choose.
They need to avoid the journey and lead in the long term.
The third: We invited a solution.
I don't think it's possible for someone of us to be able to be able to make a collapse and click ourselves.
I think it's a curiosity.
I think we've got to ensure.
I think the importance of a big company is to be open to Egypt, and the name of a good Arabic is a bone.
I think it's also a good character.
Second: There was a tool in success.
Maybe it's useful to look back on the previous doors in Rome, when the inventions, after a big security, they'll get their test.
When they go to Rome in their consumers, they've always had a satellite satellite that satellites in their fingers, "Remember, you're just human beings."
So I hope I've left the point: the food of a studio and a cat has a giant corner.
But it's hard, and we need to be aware.
I just want to vote about two questions I think they're useful.
First question is, when you look at your society: in some of the areas you see that the risk of Penna's success, you just go on an autonomous plane.
And what can you do to challenge?
Second question is: When did I read something new recently, and what kind of effect was it to me?
Is it something that I've done more?
In my case, yes.
So let me leave you with this.
Whether you're curious or if you're tend to use what you already know. Don't forget: the beauty is in food.
Thank you.

So there's a lot of extinction and remote on the planet itself that they're all around the face of human beings in any sense, but we've seen it all.
Our ancestors, when they felt that they and their refugees are in the contrast, it's the way to do unknown for better possibilities.
And in the fingerprinting of those countries, our boundaries also flow the same red red blood of our ancestors.
But at the same time, when we think we've been conducted by our fight and our decades and we're on one violence against the other, we've seen the passion to explore and create new places.
We, as a species, we've evolved special for the Earth, on Earth and by the Earth, and we're so happy in our lives until we've been anonymous and just stop too much to make sure that the resources aren't finished, and even the life of our sun is safe.
While all the movies and all the movies that have been done on is reinvented the concept of the journey to the exact space, some of us really understand that our species's giant car doesn't usually be ready for a long journey.
Let's take a look at your national forest for a quick speech.
So at the top of your hands, how many of you think you're going to be able to survive in the accurate nature and this price for a few days?
Well, it's a lot of you.
What about a few weeks?
That's the amount of medicine.
What about a few months?
It's also pretty beautiful.
Now, let's imagine that this forest is going to make a living wall.
How many questions: How many of you think you can survive in a few days?
It's quite a lot.
What about a few weeks?
For Tonian, let's imagine that the only water that's got to code in a fingerprinter, miles under the surface.
The extinction of the land is so few to the privilege, and of course there's almost no atmosphere.
These examples are just a few of the challenges that are going to deal with, on a planet like Mars.
So how do we spend ourselves for the journey they're so sophisticated by terrorism?
Is we going to reduce the Earth's land?
We're going to build a space or an unpossible kilometers of certain things that are looking at the extreme planet?
And how do we grow things like food grow on Earth?
But I'm moving too fast.
In the journey of our species to invest a new house under a new sun, it's very likely that we're going to have a long time on the journey, in space, on a tumor, a metaphor, it's going to have a lot of generations.
The longest time that a person has spent in space is about 124-months.
The experiences of astronomers in space, we know that time has time in a environment with a mammography means a bone of their bone, a muscles, a blood tool, and you've got more of the physical biology.
And what about Microsoft, or any other organ in the power of the planet that's found ourselves?
Basically, our curious journey will be previous in our agencies and unknown.
So we've been so excited to the new technology or what a robot from the next generation as part of the value that will ensure our species's brains in space.
So how big they're wonderful, I believe it's time to spend these huge technologies with what nature's already invented: the close organisms that know to new itself, a animal machine.
It takes a little bit of a little bit to expect itself, a lot of features in design and a network just to be in a plastic plastic.
The research field that allows us to use the capabilities of the nearly known biological biology.
It's a biological biological biology, which we've got antibiotics, vaccines, and better ways to invest in the ecosystems of the human body.
By using the tools of the Chinese biological biology, we can now do the genes of almost every organism, microscopic or not, quickly and amazing characters.
Give the limits of the machines in fact by the human, biological biology will be the interest for us to extend not just our food, our fuel and our environment, but also ourselves so that we can jump on our physical solutions and make our survival in space.
For example, how we're using autism biology to explore space, let's go back to the left.
The land car is similar to the village and my daughter in my father, with organisms.
Let's say, hypothetic, what if a land can actually support plants without using materials from Earth?
The first question that we're probably going to ask, how do we do our plants go to the box?
Because, on average, the temperature in Mars is about 60 degrees of unfortunately.
The next question that we need to think is, how do we make our plants for the shape?
At this point that most of the water in Mars are created as a faster accident I can say the word "fossil."
Well, it turns out we've already done things like this.
By the questions of genes to weigh against depression and genes for other plants like Egypt and then to improve them into plants that need them, we now have plants that can stand at most of the forms and the Pacion.
They're known in the Earth as GMO, or organisms are genetic, and we're focusing on them to listen all the noises of human civilization.
The nature does things like this, without our help.
We just found more accurate ways to do this.
So why would we want to change the genetic car of plants in space?
Well, it doesn't do that means we're going to have to have a huge anxiety of land on a completely new platform by reducing trillion genes of atmosphere and then build an enormous chemical feedback to make all of this.
It's an engineering engineering not offering me that's coming up with a huge motion of change.
One of the best ways to make sure we have food and air that we need is to bring with us organisms that have been trying to fit into new, new and hard reasons.
Actually, using organisms are extended to help change the planet as well as the short, and also in the long time.
These organic organisms can also be used to create drugs or fuel.
So we can use psychological biology to bring very volunteers with us, but what else can we do?
Well, I mentioned before we, as a species, we've evolved particularly to the Earth.
The fact that there's not a lot of changed in the last few minutes where you've been sitting here and I've been there.
And so, if we'd take every one of us on Mars right now, even with food, water, air, we're probably going to experience very unprecedented health issues from the mammogram that represents the surface of platform like Mars who have a theater or not there.
But if we're planning to stay a guy underground for all of our identity on a new platform, we've got to find better ways to protect ourselves without coming to the situation that we're wearing something like your body's weight, or we're going to have to move behind the wall.
So let me go to nature to show.
Whether life on the planet, there's a group of organisms that are worthy like crops, or love environmental environments, if you remember biology of high school.
And these organisms have bacteria called Dererox Street.
It's known for the capacity to be accurate in the box, swim, and in the universe, extinction, and most accurate to the idea, reading.
While the fossil mechanisms for a famous convention, we still didn't admit the relevant genes.
It's not really simple.
There's a lot of face that's designed for the device, and it's not just like to get one gene.
But it's a little bit of human inventions and a little bit of time, I think it's not very hard.
Even if we're just asking that the speed of its capacity to predict, it's going to be good at the levels of what we have now, which is just our convenient in our skin.
In using these tools of synthetic biological biology, we can use the ability of the Nakotcus France to switch under art that's another cosmos.
Some it's hard to see, the atmosphere, which is people, open every day, and still continue to evolve.
Three years of human evolution is not just given us people like cartoons, that can be scared under oxygen conditions, but also genetic organizations, that can lose and all San Francisco, the elephant that can kill an average person.
Every day, the human body is evolved by curiosity motions that, at the same level of random enabled people to stay in the conditions of fossil conditions.
But, and it's big, but it's such a evolution requires two things that we can't always have, or be able to afford, and they're death and time.
In our species's struggle to find their own place in the universe, maybe we don't always have the time for natural evolutionary evolution of other functions to survive on privacy plants.
We're living in what I.O.O. Wilson's called the gene of the genes, in the middle, we're going to expect water in the genes like Spain in or Nigerian muscles with two times.
But with every single day, we're focusing on a generation of conventional evolution, while we're going to have the capacity to decide for ourselves in our genetic future.
It's to improve the human body in new capabilities, it's not a question of how more, but of when.
It's used to change the genetic biology to change the genetic car of every animal organism, especially of ourselves, including the traditional and ethical questions.
Is our engineering make us less human?
But then, what's human if it's not a star material in the case it has a tool?
Where's the human genome to take itself?
Obviously it's a little bit of a song to sit and be magic of it.
How do we use our knowledge to protect ourselves from external risks and then protect ourselves?
I spend these questions not to create the fear of science, but to bring the possibilities of the streets that science allows us to enable us.
We've got to go into human beings and get the solutions not just with speed but also with courage.
Mary is going to go, but it's not going to be our last one.
Our real advantage is that we have to want to want to decide what we can and do with the unbelievable understanding of our species.
The space is morning, in Broadi and not a smoke.
Our way to stars will be full of people to ask us not just who we are, but where we're going to go.
The answers will be in our choices to use or take the technology that we've lost from life, and it's going to define us to our daily list.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay, so, Versey: I've always been in a strange statistics with a prison.
I remember that I was watching the professional movies in the morning, I'd run more in apartments than programs, trying to figure out how they're trying to go into my head.
In the end, it led to my dreams.
I've been able to switch in a big prize in New York City.
But then, all of this changed in the 23 to February, 1997, when my young brother Matt was born in his head that was happening in the slide of the Amazon building.
All of a sudden, my family went to the camera of aid, when we told us that my brother's going to die, we'll really have the opportunity to be reduced from it, then the number of interpretation in the brain and now what's going to look at, for Mart, as a life of the preference of the courage of a traffic brain.
It's certainly my connection.
But a couple of people -- Applause) Yes, comes to him -- but how much this tragedy was for our family, I often think how worse it could be -- in fact, how worse it could really be for 90 times every day they're not so lucky, that they're losing the cases -- sisters, boys, girls, parents.
They don't all get to the organizations.
In fact, most of them are not.
They're going to most of the insects, in the country that came to the situation that's going to have a national magnitude from a new normal situation.
So I've been invited from my work in the prison to try to do something about the National Institute, because I've come to the concept that the challenges for violence in the weapon are actually those who made me love to love their love, that they're trying to figure out how to activate people.
Just instead of doing this to sell products, do it to save life.
And it's going to take a common mechanism, where what I'd like to play with what you want.
And you may be surprised to find, when it comes to violence in the bank, actually some common common mechanism has.
Let's look at, for example, about people who like to laugh, a thousand million around the United States are going to be in.
It's a long tradition of years.
In some places, the first day of the office is actually a freedom of school.
What are the doctors want?
Well, they want to laugh. They love their fathers.
They believe deep in the other box to explore these roads.
But it doesn't mean there's no shape.
In fact, there's a lot of it, we're going to start with the basic idea of taking these boundaries from dangerous.
It's not a matter of taking certain weapons of all people.
It's a matter of taking all the weapons out of some people, and these are the people, it turns out, we all agree that we don't need weapons: selective adults, they're going to be used in families, and they're the federal freedom.
We can all appreciate how the background tests were an amazing effect in order to reduce conventional weapons.
Within 20 years, the backwards in the Sunki Sunceli Freebruary of Freethers have been published 2.4 million of these people that we all agree that they don't have a weapon.
And if you like a weapon or a weapon, you're probably not going to be thousands of weapons every day in the walls of weapons or the web without these backwards, just like you don't have two parents to go to the airplane -- one with security without security.
And -- Applause) And the numbers show the amazing conference in the American public: 90 percent of Americans support the backwards of the background for all of the presidents -- including 90 percent of the French French, more than 80 percent of the House French, more than 70 percent of the National Amazon.
It's not an idea that's involved.
In fact, only six percent of the American public doesn't agree.
It's about the Amazon of the American public that's left on the moon was fine.
And it's also about the liquid that's left that government's designed technologies to predict the TV patterns.
It's the sky lesson to the background.
But what about 300 million weapons that are already in the water around the United States?
So first of all, it's important that this weapon is in Babbo and in the hands of the bodies of the boys, a laughter, like me, and of course, you want what we all want -- including keep our families.
In fact, it's why more and more people choose to be weapons.
Twenty years ago, 42 percent of the real American public -- mostly -- that's going to make the house better.
Today, this number is 63 percent.
Why?
I'm pretty glad to say this, because it's about the Asian region, the lower cancer of the prison, that if you say it's big enough, enough times, at the end of the morning makes reality.
And this is exactly what happened here.
The tumor of the Henry Francisco was invented billions of dollars to lose the center of diseases and give them a study of research on the public health care care of violence -- to make children talk to the teachers of weapons of weapons in the house, and another technology that will prevent their children's weapons and save their children's lives.
They're supposed to hide the truth, because they're seeing the truth as a threat to their bottom.
And every day, people die as a result of it.
And many of these people are children.
Every day in the United States, an hour children are uncomfortable.
900 children and teenagers lose every year.
And here's the thing: nearly everyone with their parents.
Even two thirds of the Middle Egypt in the school are acting with a weapon from the house, including the president training in San Francisco.
I get many of these parents; it's the most important part of my work.
These are not bad people.
They're just living with the results that don't have a very bad decision, who's done on a very bad basis that's going to go into a task by very bad people, who know about the suffering that they're doing, but they just don't care about.
And the result is an aid -- not just for families like my own, but, really, at the end, all of us.
But I'm not here to talk about the concept that it's violence in the bank.
I'm here to talk about our dream, and it's a dream that we all share, which is the dream of a better future and more comfortable.
In my organization, to the campaign of healthy, the dream is translated in the real goal to reduce the Minister of Minister in the United States by 2025.
And I hope to leave you all here with a sense of exactly what this dream is completely in a hand.
Because friends, every big movement around the world, there's a moment that you can look back and say, "That's when things really started to change."
And I'm here to say that the movement to finish the violence in the United States, this moment is here.
And so we're clearly at a point of view, because the American public has been one in millions like I've never been, on the basis of the common machine, to say, "Well, enough."
It's enough with the modern teenagers and the cockroads and the device and the schools and schools.
It's enough with the daily aid of violence that's in the water and the streets that responds their lives of women and young men at a scale.
It's enough with access to a weapon by the people that we all agree that they don't have.
And it's enough of a small group of young politicians who put the interactions of the tumor corporations before these people's people's lives.
It's enough.
And the really exciting thing is that it's not just the normal regulations, like me, who say it.
It's so much larger than that.
And if you want a conversation, let's start from where most of the conversations in the United States start -- with Karan Karan.
And here's the thing: it's not really a conversation.
I mean, think about when issues change.
It's when they go from being political issues and support to be part of the coffee culture, molecules that come from everywhere, components that use their agriculture, musicians, musicians.
The NBA has been volunteered.
Social experts that you wouldn't imagine was invisible.
There's a real cultural change -- I've even heard that there's a TED Talk on this year.
It's the opposite in which this cultural change is happening.
And yes, Kenyan did a paralyst without having a 35 million chickens on Twitter to the background.
Let's look at the political choices that come from.
It was the classical subject that didn't touch it for the texts.
You couldn't win it fast enough.
Now, we're going to get rid of it.
Some of you have to go back in them very bad news that they've made them very, very, very recently.
For someone like me, to see people who are preparing their negative restaurant in NRA -- it's almost Saratian to watch.
We're still a lot less, yes, a decline of the weapons, and at the end of that, you need to change.
But you know what?
We're more sophisticated, and we've got the truth to us.
And we're in a beautiful situation.
You know, you're saying that the Internet makes the information to say.
The social media and some of the organization of the organization that generates an effective effect.
It allows us to show how 90 percent of support is really looking.
Sometimes I think about it -- you know, we're going to get rid and coffee in millions, something like blood cells.
It enables us to really start to switch -- and it's the bottom line -- to push this intervention between what the American public wants and what our leaders do about it.
By recently, the situation in Congress was that conversations from the other side, these rich weapons, have been on a number of conversations from our side to 10 careers.
We become this situation completely.
After the last president in San Bernan, we've come from Congress's Congress.
We've made 15,000 conversations to Congress at 24 hours.
And you know what?
We've got the vote on the laughter that no one thought you'll see light every day in the time.
We're seeing a real motion to take some of the richy and the power that's the rich door in the last decade.
It's obvious that the bank of the trick that's wearing weapons.
We've seen the historical actions of President Obama.
They don't go to the end of the end, but they're going to save life, because they're expanding the backwards to the rules of weapons that they didn't have before.
And we're talking about the country -- we're not just customers to Congress, it's going to be almost the definition of insects.
We're laughing around the planet, a country after a country, the equality of inequality.
And you know what?
Congress is almost the last one that's in the wrong side of history.
And when they understand, it's always because the American public reveals them.
And that's exactly what we're doing at this moment, while we're at this simple point.
You know, I've recently been scared into a wall to get a big group like this, although a lot of less than an iPhone, and the woman who asked me in the case I've been looking at one of the favorite TV stairs at all the time, "Man," France for a long time in the '60s.
And at a time I tried to think about how to finish my walls, I looked at her screen too long, and it would see that every time I did it, I saw someone who was in the office or in a house or in a mirror or a door or or teenagers or teenagers without samples or feedback to her work.
And at the end of the end, I'm going to have: What inspiration inspiration to those of us who have the dream to collect violence in the bank.
I mean, think about how much the world has changed in a very short period of time, how all of these behaviors that were ever thought to be scared or normal -- some of them are even fair or business -- became known in one generation or two or two, once they became a subject to a conversation about our common machine.
It's the importance of the change that we have the potential to create around violence in the bank.
And that's my dream, which may be one day, which is a creative TV spread this previous trick is violence in the bank, and a future of children may just imagine how normal it would be.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Right in 2018, there's about 2.5 billion mobile phones in the world.
If we take all these new phones, they're just a tiny part of the screen that we've built everything, and we're going to take them to the components, it's going to create about 85,000 dollars of money, and 40 million pounds.
How does this critical trust come into the phones, and can we return it?
The same, money and the sensor is actually just a part of about 70 chemicals that create an average phone.
These can be part of different groups, two of the most critical are rare and accurate.
Canadians are a mirror of 17 secrets that actually are conducted in the planet and we'll find a lot of areas in the world's season.
These secrets have a whole range of genetic properties, light creatures, and it's going to make them expect to modern technology.
In fact, out of the 17 hormones of rare, phones and other electronics use 16.
In smart phones, they're creating the fossil screen, they're used to the lights, and they're reproducing the constant, between the rest of the things.
And yet, positive as it is, these secrets from the land is about some of the most important environmental effects.
Canadians can find a lot, but a lot of areas, it doesn't make economic sense of them in the chimpanzees.
A lot of times, magnitude requires a method called Chris in openness that reveals a lot of land.
This library represents enormous areas of animal environments, and causes air pollution and water, what's focused on communities.
Another group of components in the phones come with environmental risks: these are the same as convenient, money, luck, aluminum, Palestinian, Titan, Titan, Brothern, France, and the same.
We're also a genome, a day, a trick, a library, and it's going to create phones, and it's all a source of environmentalism, as well as air pollution and water.
Chris also responds to social problems, like a big scale of people and animals to discover a place for industrial activities, and many times, bad conditions.
Finally, mobile phones also require fuel, one of the main genes for climate change.
It's getting our female phones in a complicated way to the old old problem.
And more than that, the ingredients that we're as teachers to create our phones are not invisible.
One day, they're just going to go out, and we still didn't find effective stations for some of them.
However, the most powerful phone number is in the middle of 2019 cities that are close to three billion of them will be used.
It means that represents the production in our phones become the extinct.
So, if you have an old phone, you might want to think about your possibilities before you get it.
In order to reduce the boss, you might take it to reuse, take it into a cycle, or feel a company that's designed for old models.
However, even companies have to go through the rapid glass.
It's just like the phone production comes with social problems and environmental problems, so they're also a philosophy.
The electronic waste is sometimes reduced to countries where the work is great, but the workers are made.
Social forces, many times as women and children, who can get rid of liquid, they don't have the traffic to take the phones in security, and they're exposed to secrets like a parasite and a slide, which can be scared in their nervous system.
PiPhones can also get to big dinosaurs, where they're thrilled into the ground and the water, and so you're taking the problems in malaria have come.
The phone is much more than what looks like on the surface.
It's a collection of institutions from many components, which are able to affect global scale.
So, until someone gives a completely sustainable phone, we're going to have to deal with how technology affects places and people.
There's 200 million clinical cases of malaria in South Africa every year, the genes for a half million deaths.
I want to talk to you about vaccines for malaria.
These are the ones that have created so simple are not good enough.
Why?
We're working on it for more than a hundred years.
When we started, technology was very limited.
We could see a very little bit of the real mammogram of the genome for the disease.
Today, we've got an academic technology, intervention and exploring biological molecules -- mammography, autonomy, protographics.
These tools gave us a little bit more likely to the aerotic complexity of this path.
However, our method of development has been a very basic basic one.
In order to create a good vaccine, we have to go back to the secrets and understand how our body works with this complexity.
People who are in malaria in high school learn to deal with it.
They're volunteers in the disease, but they're not a hospital.
The right is in genes.
My team took this complexity, and I've been exploring it with the characteristics of Americans who were killed on the malaria to answer the question: "How do you look at a product of genomes?"
We've found more than 200 proteins, many of them haven't been taken as a series of creating vaccines for malaria.
I might have my research extended parts of the path.
By recently, when someone's wondering a important protein, they've been working if he can work as a vaccine by doing a research study.
It's usually about 300 participants from a village in Africa, that the samples that were sent to see whether the journalists grow to wear the video in Maria and who didn't.
In the last 30 years, a little bit of proteins were built in these experiments in very small patterns and often in one place.
The results are not safe.
My team is focused on 30 years of this particular experiment in one exciting experiment that's going on a little bit more than three months.
For the first time in history, we've collected 10,000 samples, from 15 different projects, in seven African countries, over time, from people in different age and different environments of malaria in Africa.
We used our knowledge of biological molecules to invest in technical proteins, remove them in the lab, and we recreated the genome to malaria on Chip.
We've done it in Africa, and we're going to get it.
Thank you very much for the Chip is a small piece of glass, but it gives us a huge power.
In one study, we've collected information on over 100 genomic responses.
What are we looking for?
The right to respond to a successful, so we can predict what could be a successful vaccine for malaria.
In addition, we're trying to figure out what's exactly the genes do to the platform.
How do they kill it?
Do they expect some corruption? Is there a speech between them?
What amount of genes need?
Our studies show that a small amount of genome in the body is not enough.
You may have a high sea of genomes in front of a lot of technical proteins.
We've learned, that the genes represent the path in a variety of ways, and one of them in France may not reduce the reality right.
When we're able to see the telescope of clear now, we've focused on, my team and I'm trying to figure out how our body comes from this complexity.
We believe that these insights can provide the rule of the way we need to make the malaria for a failure disease, using effective agencies.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for answers: Well, how much are we close to malaria?
The Philipper: We're just at the beginning of a process to figure out what we need to be in a vaccine before we can start to create it.
So we're not really close to the end of making a vaccine, but we're in the way.
SP: And we're hopeful.
PA: It's certainly hope.
SM: I'll tell me about SMART, what are their head and why is it important to you?
SP: SMART is my head of English.
The Western primary is treating us in Africa, which is looking at it to it and cooperation, as a unique prosperity that America and Europe will open the problem, and there's a lot of power in Africa.
So in SMART, except our goal, to develop a vaccine for malaria, we're African scientists, because it's a very high cost of Africa, and there's people who're going to be going to move the boundaries of science in Africa.
SM: Yeah, right.
Thank you very much, last question.
I'm a book, I know that you've got it first, what would you change when there was a vaccine for malaria?
PA: We've got a half million people every year.
200 million patients will be healthy.
The malaria is going to go to Africa 12 billion dollars every year.
So it's economic.
Africa's just prosperity.
SM: Well. Thank you for the Fedom.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So, there's a player called Darwin.
And years ago, he created this film that some of you may have heard of, called "The Baby."
And there's two main customers in this movie.
The first is the physicist.
I'm not going to talk about her night.
And the other one in which he was taken by the old guy in the house, and as a young man, the adult guy basically says one word, just one word.
And of course, you all know what the word is.
It's "plastic."
And the only problem with this is, it was a completely reverse.
So let me tell you why it's wrong.
The word needs to be "Sylin."
And the reason that it had to be a symbolic is because the basic patents to go to the end of the slide has been created, they've already been killed, and they've already built them.
So the Valley Valley was just built in 1967, when this film is released.
And a year after the film is released, intuitive.
So if the adult was to hear the right word, maybe it would come to the stage -- or, I don't know -- maybe with those two.
And so when you think about it, let's see what a tree might like to give you so that your next adult wouldn't become a Twitter.
Laughter) So in 2015, what would you give people, when you would take a teenager at the top and say one word, just one word?
I think the word will be "Life". "
So what is "Life"? "
Life code is the different ways we have to make life.
So instead of making computers, we're using things to program and viruses or viruses or proteins or DNA or DNA or plants or animals or animals or animals, or curiosity of creatures.
And when you think about the amazing ability to make life do what you want to do, what they're designed to do, what you're doing is eventually taking what we've done for thousands of years, that's a lot of change, to change, to move all kinds of forms of life, and we're looking at it.
And it's not something new.
It's this simple model that if you put it in one way, you get in Korean.
And if you change it in a different way, you get a cat.
And if you're using it on a third, you're getting a chicken.
So when you go to these organic markets, you're really going to go to a place where people changed the life of plants for a long time.
The difference today, to choose a completely useful political motor -- [design]]]]] we're starting to make a total design.
It means that instead of doing it an academic and see what's going on for generations, we're spinning specific genes, we're making specific proteins, and we're changing life code for very machines.
And it allows us to expect how it happens.
Let me just give you one example.
Some of you sometimes think about sex.
And we're kind of taking it for granted, but we've changed the concept.
So we think it's completely normal and natural to change it.
What's happened with sex over time is -- normal, a baby is worth a baby, finally.
But in the world of today, sex is worth a baby.
And again, we think it's terrible and natural and natural, but it wasn't the case for most human history.
And it's not the case to live.
What it does is give us control, so sex becomes a refugee from the past.
And when you think about the implications of this, then we've been working with these things that are a little bit more accurate, like art.
It's not in a sense of painting and switch, but in a sense of technologies that help her.
So what are technologies that help her life?
Social technologies are things like the malaria outside.
And when you're doing the galaxy outside there's a very good reason to do it.
Sometimes you can't just go into a different range.
But when you're doing it, what you're going to survive sex, you've gone, baby.
So you didn't just take control of when you have a baby, you've invented when the baby and where the baby's amazing.
So you've invented the baby from the body's costs.
And when you think about other things we did. Think of water.
So you can make a frog, you can get a fingerprint, you can make a fabulous effects.
And what does that mean?
Well, it's a good thing if you're cancer patients.
You're going to go through chemistry or the ice, so you're putting these things.
You don't buy them.
But if you can offer them and you can reduce them, and you can have if you're an academic, it means you've got a cartoon from the time.
It means you can have objects that are born -- Oh, 50 years?
But in a hundred years?
About a year?
And these are three significant change that doesn't, like future things.
It's things that we take like boys today.
So this life code becomes power.
It becomes a very powerful way to change plants, to change plants, change animals, maybe even do evolution for ourselves.
It's something that Steve Gates and I thought about for a while.
Let's take some risks.
Like every powerful ecosystem, like electricity, like the cars, like computers, these things can be used for potential potential.
And it's a lot of people.
And when you open these technologies, you can even become people into the alphase.
Remember the Greek's mystery where you're in many animals?
Well, some of these treatments actually change your kind of blood.
Or they're directly transparency cells in the body's body's body, or they're completely normal until you understand, that the reason you're doing it is that you're deciding object during cancer.
So by taking the object of someone else's object, you might have some basic projects of yourself, but you invent your lives.
And when you think about it, here's something happened 20 years ago.
It's an accident.
It's coming into a recently.
It's a curious decline.
It's been scared in two pounds. It was a magic learning.
And it's not very extraordinary, except that it's the first person that is born to three parents.
Why?
Because she had a little bit of a cosmological disease that she could wear.
So when you decide the DNA of a third person and you put it there, you offer people's lives.
But you're also doing a engineering engineering of microbes, which means that her children, if they're going to have children, you'll be not going to get it.
And their kids are going to go, and they're going to take it, and it's going on.
It makes people nervous.
So 20 years ago, the different evidence said, "Why don't you look at that time?
There are risks in doing things, and there are risks in not doing things, because there's a couple of people who have tried by technology, and then we thought about it for the next 20 years.
So when we think about it, when we take time to say, "Hey, maybe we need to have long studies, we need to do that, maybe we need to do something else," there's consequences to action, and there's the consequences for action.
Like a little bit of small diseases -- that by the way, they're completely unprecedented.
It's terrible and natural that people might have been exposed from previous languages like polio, or holic events.
When we're lucky for people, we're put things in their body because we think it's going to be effective on the risks.
Because we built natural plants, animals don't exist, we can feed about seven billion people.
We can do things like creating new forms of life.
And when you create new forms of life, again, it sounds really scary and really crazy, until you understand that these new forms of life live on the food table.
These rules that you have on the food table -- there's not a lot of natural things, because people showed the plants to create this color, to be this size, to keep a week.
You don't give your mother an aid usually because they don't stay a long time.
What all this does is make Darwin on his head.
We realized, for four billions of years, what's real and worried about this planet was depending on two principles: on natural choice and corporations.
And so what's real and worse, what's built, we're going to have now on his head.
And what we've done is create a completely evolutionary system where we're doing not natural choosing and motivated motivations.
So let me explain to you these things.
This is a natural choice.
This is not natural choice.
So what's happening with this, we started to spend thousands of years ago in Central Asia to turn them into dogs.
And then we started to turn them into big, small dogs.
But if you take one of these Chile that you're seeing in the front of the third service and you're releasing them in the African events, you can watch the natural choice.
It's a little bit of things about the planet less natural than the dozens.
You're never, under any situation, you're not going to go through the forest in front of me and see the same gas as in a way, at the same time, nothing else is living there.
When you win a corner, you choose what's alive and what's about.
And you do it through a natural choice.
It's the same thing with control points, it's the same thing with liquid dots.
It's the same thing with a city, it's the same thing with proportions.
In fact, half the Earth has been killed unnatural so that what's black and what's out there is what we want, that's why you don't have a blueprint that's going on in the kitchen.
What about the interpretation of the hormones?
Well, it's a curious motion.
This is Antarctica.
It's also known as a penguin, his chemistry.
He was the president of the year 2000.
And it's got a curious motion that's given him six fingers in every hand, which makes it very useful if you're responding.
[] What with unprecedented motions?
A natural motion is a choice.
It's an accident, it's going to make.
How many times you went in the forest and you found a natural gas?
Or is natural gas?
So we engineered these things.
Now, what's interesting is, we know these things better.
We've found one of the most powerful tools for a gene, CRRSR, within a magazine.
And when we're starting to take cells, we're making eight out of the most common, including the material with it's tremendous, which is the most popular medicine.
So all of this life code.
It's really power.
It's really a way of making things, and there's no thing that's going to change us more than this life.
So when you think about life code, let's think about five principles to how we start to join, and I'm happy if you'd give me more.
So, basically one number: we need to take responsibility on this thing.
The reason we need to take responsibility is because we're responsible.
There's no curiosity.
This is what we do, what we choose.
It's not, "Things happened."
It didn't happen in the case.
It didn't come to the space of someone else.
We engineered it, and it's the final laughter in the country: you've seen, you're going to get rid.
It's basically a couple of seconds: we have to recognize and make a direction of these things.
There were at least 33 Germans of Indians who went on the planet.
Most of us have been exposed from us.
But the natural situation of the Earth is that there's a variety of people who exist at the same time, so in our ancestors also have Nanderthals.
Some of us have Denna.
And some Washington has much more than that.
But basically three: We have to do the choices of other people.
How many people will choose to never change.
Some people will choose to change everything.
Some people will choose to change plants, but don't live.
Some people will choose to change themselves.
Some people will choose to develop themselves.
The direction is not a bad thing, because even though we think about people as many diverse, we were so close to the extinction that we've all had one African and the consequences of it is that there's more genetic diversity in 55 African chimpanzees from every seven billion people.
Finally four: We need to take about a quarter of the Earth and give a Darwin to move the phenomenon there.
It doesn't have to be trained, it doesn't have to be all about it.
It should be part of the ocean, part of the land.
But we don't have to take any evolutionary decision on the planet.
We want our evolutionary system to work.
We want the evolutionary system of Darwin to work.
And it's really important that we've got the two things that's going to want in the Chicago and don't appreciate evolution.
So I'm going to say.
It's the most exciting surprise that humanity was in.
It's the biggest power that was ever for humanity.
It's going to be surprising to you not participate in this past because you're afraid of it, because you're coming out of it.
You can participate in Ethiopia. You can participate in politics.
You can participate in business.
You can only take a look at where the drugs are going, where the industry is going, where we'll take the world.
It's going to be surprising to all of us not to be aware of someone comes to a song that says one word, just one word, if you don't listen to this word is "Life."
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
About seven years ago, I'm going to get me a student and ask me to invest in his society.
He said, "I'm working with three friends, and we're going to try to put something in the industry by making things wrong."
And I said, "Okay, you're going to see it all the summer, right?"
"No, we've all took the illness, for a case that's not going to make."
"Okay, but you're going to do it all the time you'll help learn."
"No exactly. We've all made jobs to the boss."
Six months go, there's only one day before the company goes to the air, and there's still no website costs.
"You see, all the company is the site.
It's really everything that's. "
I've been trying to invest.
And at the end of the end, they called "and Ray Farch."
And they're familiar with Olywin.
Since recently, they've been killed as the most new company in the world, and they've been done most of a billion dollars.
And now? My wife's a metaphor in our investment.
But why did I do so much?
To find out, I started to explore people I call "Mexico."
"Mexico" are anthropologists, people who don't just have new ideas, but they're going to support them.
They're people who look at the surface and they sound.
"Mexico" is creative and change in the world.
They're the people they'd like to say.
And they're completely different than I wanted.
I want to show you today three things that I've learned about magnitude and how to make a little bit more like them.
So the first reason I sat down and looked at "and Raxar" was that they were very slow to fit.
Now, you're probably familiar with "The" of the patient. "
Well, I want to admit you. I'm the opposite of it.
I'm "Martin."
You know the plan that you're feeling a few hours ago before Darwin, when you haven't done anything.
I just feel it a few months ago.
So. It started early: When I was a child, I took Nigerian games really seriously.
I'd woke up in a morning, starting to play a virus until I've spent them.
At the end of this, it's so far that a local newspaper came and wrote about the "The Hunk side of Nigeria," in my car.
I've been able to get a forest in the teeth.
But it's made me very well in college, because I finished my baby four months before Darwin.
And I was proud of it until a few years ago.
My student named Jay, who came to me and said, "My most creative ideas come when I talk about things."
And I said, "It's curious, what about four jobs you have to have?"
It wasn't, it was one of our most creative institutions and psychologically, it's kind of the ideas I'm looking at.
So I've described it to collect some data.
It comes to some companies.
She's asking people to not explore the chemistry where they're talking about things.
So she's looking at their boss to draw how creative they're and special.
And of course, the "Miss," as I'm scared and do anything early as creative as people who are uncomfortable.
So I want to know what's going on with the rural soldiers.
And she's like, "I don't know, they're not going to leave the research."
Laughter) No, here's our results.
In fact, you see that people, who are waiting for the last minute is so busy that they don't have new ideas at all.
And the other side of the other side, the people who're going to go forward are in a concept of insection, which they also don't have professional computers.
There's a very sophisticated point of life.
And why is that?
Maybe people from Korean just have bad job?
Perhaps adults don't make creativity?
To find out, we've designed some studies.
We asked people to get new ideas to business, and then we read independent to appreciate how creative they are and useful.
Some of them are going to do the work right.
And some of us are spontaneously spontaneous by the "House" in their face, "or 10 minutes.
And as you can see, the creative bacteria in 16 percent more than the other groups.
Now, that's early is great, but it's not the case of the result, because if you play the game before you learn about the task, there's no creativity.
It's just when you tell you, you're going to work on this problem, and then you're starting to predict it, but the task is still active in your head, you're starting to be a teacher.
Scientists give you time to think about certain ideas to think in ways of not inequality, to unpredictable actions.
So just when we went to finished these experiments, I started writing a book about "The Miss," and I thought, "It would be the perfect time to teach myself from the line, when I write the park on the animals."
So I was talking about soldiers, and like every Martin who worked himself, I woke up early in the next morning and I put a list of task about how to join.
And then I was working in curiosity to happen the goal of not going to get to my goal.
I started writing the dog, and then one day -- when I was in the middle -- I just put it on the middle of a sentence for months.
It was an email.
But when I went back to this, I had all sorts of new ideas.
Like Mr. Dr. San School: "You call it sensors, I call it thinking."
And the way I found that a lot of the cases in big history were bacteria.
For instance, Lando Danda and Venni.
He's worked a nanogram for 16 years on the moon.
He felt like a failure.
He wrote about it in his biomass.
But some of the science that he took in optimism, we put the way he showed light, and he got it to a better painting.
And what about President Luther Kong?
At the night before the speech changed his life, "The Great Museum in Washington," he was a forest to three in the morning, and he wrote it.
He's sitting in the audience and he's waiting to go to the stage, and he's still a mirror and play.
When he goes to the stage, after 11 minutes, he's leaving his convenient, and he's going to say four words, that's going to change the history of history: "I have a dream."
It didn't say in Text.
By the task of the speech of the speech to the last minute, it's the leaving itself into a huge range of possible ideas.
And because the text didn't have a sacrifice, he had freedom to move.
Civil is a surprise when it comes to the eyes -- but it can be a lot of creativity.
What you're seeing with a lot of the big cases is that they're starting fast but they're finished.
And that's a piece of me with and a French.
When they made their legs for six months, I looked at them and I said, "You know, many other companies are starting to sell the wings of Olympic."
They collected the first step.
But what I didn't understand was they spent this time trying to figure out how to make people feel comfortable.
And it turns out that the solution of the first step is mostly an aircraft.
Look at the Central study of over 50 product groups, which is worth those who do the first step and create the market with the villages, which brings something different and better.
What you see is that while the first step has 47 percent failure, compared to only eight percent of the villages.
You'll see Facebook, which was designed to build a social media just after Michigan and France.
Look at Google, who's been built years after Atlanka and Oh.
A lot of easier to improve someone else's idea than creating something new from zero.
So the lesson I've learned is, in order to be an unprecedented.
You just need to be different and better.
But it wasn't the only reason that I got and I was going to go on and Derek.
They were also collective.
They've had very familiar programs, and it made me judgment, which has the courage to be magic because I've expected that someone from my colleagues would look like this.
["I don't know how to say this, but -- I'm pretty slow." Now, on the surface, a lot of people look safe at themselves, but behind the shoes are feeling the same fear and the end of us all.
They're just driving it differently.
Let me show you: Here's a description of how the creative process looks at most of us. One. It's really cool.
It's complicated three. It's got four. I'm going to get five. I may be okay. It's really cool now, in my research I've found that there's two types of confidence.
There's a question of myself and there's an idea.
Obviously, it's changing.
He's leaving you to a museum.
But it's probably a concept.
He brings you to look at, to explore, to click, just as you're going to give up Kong did.
And so the key to categories is just a simple thing to avoid the page of three to four.
Instead of saying, "I'm lucky," said, "The first crops are always suffering, and I'm still not there."
So how do you get there?
Well, the speech is, it turns out, in the interview of the Internet where you use.
We can move your job and your reasons if we just know what the Internet is you use.
Now, some of you wouldn't love the results of this research...
There's!
Thank you very much, they also stay in their work 15 percent more time, by the way.
Why? It's not a technical advantage.
The four dozens of face have average speech speech, and they also have similar diversity of computers.
It's about how you're going to represent your finger.
Because if you use the Alexis or the book, they've come out of your computer, and you're the president of the extinction that's been used for you.
If you wanted the Pixis or the South, you had to make a series of the extinction and ask, is there a different option, and then to show a little bit of content and a new finger.
So when people hear about this research, they're like, "Oh, if I want to succeed more at my work, I need to push my finger?"
It's not, it's about being this prototype that takes the damage and judgment in the extinction and freedom of better possibility.
And if you do it very well, you're going to open yourself to get out of the line.
It has there. It's called "Wow."

It's a chicken that's looking at a restaurant to a quote that doesn't get a green light up at the top of 10 years.
Anyway, the personal patterns is a crisis.
But John told me to judge whether there's a sense.
It represents the first systems, reinventing the suffering as a conventional transition, and "Love the ice" becomes the anthropy of investment in all the time.
So there's a simple message to this story.
When you feel, don't play.
[What's the happiness of fear?
"Morgan" is fear, of course.
They're afraid of being honest, but what you're looking at is that they're even more sophisticated than trying to try.
They know that you can be honest in a business that's a foot or to start a business at all.
They know that in the long term, our big references are not our actions but our action.
The things we want to do is, if you look at science, they're the risks we haven't taken.
The dictionary from the organization recently told me that he didn't expect a noise.
He was safe that his first scans of Scotch would come to the train that didn't talk about to go back, but it was important to try.
And for so many of us, when we have an important idea we're not going to try.
But I have good news for you.
You won't look at your bad ideas.
Many people think yes.
If you look at different industries and ask people about their big ideas, their most important surprises, 85 percent of them remain in a place instead of hearing sound.
They'd feel about looking at themselves, from looking at actions.
But let's take a lot of bad ideas, their tons, actually.
Take the guy's guy who invented it.
Do you care that he's invented a piece of meditation that's so curious, which is not just children but adults?
No. You're killing a tremendous bridge on the roof of of the electricity.
Laughter) If you look through a lot of areas, the big origins of all are the ones that are most likely because they're asked most of them.
Take a cockroach, the best.
Why do some of them get more deeper in Antarctica than others and their service are focused on more times?
One of the best magazine is just the amount of creativity that they're looking at.
As you've created more platform so you're going to get more diversity and so you're going to get your risks to get on something that's really close.
Even the three of the music's music's music -- in your eye, in January and Text had to create hundreds of jobs to get to a little bit more strengths.
Now, you may be wondering how this guy could be huge without doing too much?
I don't have an idea of how and Ghana could do it.
But for most of us, if we want to be more professionals to think about more ideas.
Microsoft and Radian, when they tried to find out there for their society, they needed something sophisticated, without negative options to build a consumption, and they were working over 2000 possibilities until they were just pushing up and visiting.
So, if you connect everything together what you see is a woman "are not different from us.
They feel fear and certainly, they're pushing things.
They have bad ideas.
And sometimes, it's not despite these properties but in the mind that they're successful.
So when you see these things, don't do the same mistakes I did.
Don't get them out.
And when it's you, don't give yourself.
They're going to start faster and make sure you can push your creativity, that you can move yourself by the trick of your ideas and it's full of trying to try, and you need a bad ideas to get into a good stage.
You'll see, to be easy, but I don't have a concept of this: it's the best way to improve the world around us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I want you to reimagine how life is in the Earth organisms.
Think about the planet as a human body that we're eating.
It's the transportation system, of roads and limitations, bridges and nanoths, convenient air, which allow us to build faces around the walls.
The blood system that moves the body is the oil and the electrical gas.
You're spending the energy.
And the traditional nervous system is as without the Internet, the satellites, the mobile networks, and the data key that allows us to share the information.
This slide, it's happening until infinitely, it's already 64 million kilometers of roads, four million kilometers of flow, two million kilometers of refugees and a million kilometers of the Internet.
And what about international borders?
We have less than 5,000 kilometers of boundaries.
Let's build a better map of the world.
And we can start first to get on a little bit of ancient biology.
There's an expression that's familiar to all the history of history: "Octography is causing."
It sounds so sick, not?
It's also so digital.
It's a number of us that the poverty is repeated on any country without products, and small insects can't win their larger programs, and that on a lot of spaces can't come from.
But in every hour I do around the world, I see a larger power of the planet: categories.
The world's revolution, in every consumption -- transportation, energy and communication -- an enormous prosperity of people, products, resources, knowledge, until we can't even reduce the geography of it.
In fact, I see these two forces as I've been doing together in a way that I've been called "Kotography."
Tonography represents a huge prototype of buildings, resources, ideas, but it's also evolutionary, evolution of our world comes from political geographic, which is used to split the world on times, to a functional geography, which represents the form of the way we use in the world, to the boundaries and boundaries, and for a ser
The global system is evolved from the 20th century's regions, which is control, through the 20th century's 20s depends on the horizontal way, until a global network in the 20th century.
Crics, not curiosity, was the principles of the human species.
But we're going to become a world culture that's because we're going to build it.
All of the security and the interventions of the world's world's world's lives on a little bit of two trillion dollars a year.
In the meantime, our global invention for a regulation for 10 trillion dollars a year in the next decade.
And really, it has to be.
We're living on a full of infrastructure that's going to be about three billion, while our population has made seven billion to eight billion and finally until an hour.
As a finger, we've got to get about a trillion trillion dollars for the basic regulation of every billion people in the world.
It's not surprising that Syria is leaving.
In 2015, China was impressed on the creation of the universal investment of infrastructure, which is together with a network of other organizations mean a network of my office and luck, which will be reduced by the Baylon.
And you're going to use that all of this theater engineering is translated, you're probably going to get more on infrastructure for the next 40 years, we're going to build more infrastructure for the next 40 years, than we built in the last 4,000 years.
Now let's stop and think about it a moment.
It's going to take a bigger investment for building a global society than for a device that's device can bring to the quality of disabled consequences.
Turns is how you're looking at the edge of people and resources around the world.
So humanity has done more than a protein.
I believe it's what's going on.
Luckets have a huge flow in the 20th century, and one: Paul Palestinian.
Cities are the creativity that enables us most.
It's not going to travel from 2030, over two thirds of the world's population will make in cities.
And it's not just a fair dog points in the map, it's a lot of roads from hundreds of kilometers.
We've been on Vancouver, in the head of a Cadia Central Sydney who's been reduced beyond the American Baylon to Titchen.
The technology station of the technology that it's going to be the Cylon starts from San Francisco to the San Francisco, and it's pushing the Foundation to Okland.
Los Angeles now goes up to San Darwo and beyond the Mexici Central to Tanna.
San India and Turkey now transparency from Olywood that you can go into both of them.
Finally, a speech network is made up of the spinal cord in the Mumbo.
The United States of the French French is starting in Boston, goes to New York City and Palessia and Mr. Washington.
He knows more than 50 million people and he also has a speech to a speed of speech.
But in Asia, we're actually seeing the giant intervention from the road.
It's an extension of light, an airplane through Canada to Octoca that has more than 80 million people and a beautiful economics.
This is the largest city in the world.
Right now.
But in China, you're focusing on a giant intervention, you're going to get rid of a population that's called 100 million people.
On the left around Bajing, in the Guinea Cambridge around the Gabby and to make the Finna, the France of Hong Kong is an unprecedented to Ghang.
And in the middle, the Bank Bank Chicago Chicago, which was in the Octographical graphic is nearly about the one of the state of Olympics.
And every single one of these giant clicks from GDP close to two trillion dollars -- it's almost like all India today.
So imagine that our digital institutions, like the GG20 showed their friends to the size of economic size and not according to the international action.
A couple of tricks may be able to get out and sit in the United States, while you're going to find that there's something like Grandma and Indonesia will be outside.
It's going to make sure, that the population is at most likely to make it of China, and it's also got a number of huge, such as an area of a blueprint and death.
And in the Middle East, Titan is a third of the Iran population.
Most of the people who are living in a stadium between Central and Alexandria.
And in the summer, a chain of a country is reduced, started in Brothern and Pixar, through the very special Arab, and it's at a concept of a conference that's in the kitchen.
And then there's Los, the big city in Africa and the trade of Nigeria.
It's got plans to the network that's going to turn it into a spinal cord of a space atmosphere, the decline to the kitchen in China, Texas, and to Abama, the city of the globe.
But these countries are prosthetic.
In the world of giant range, countries can be proportions of cities.
In 2030, we're going to have to 50 pounds like this in the world.
So what kind of map tells you more?
We're the traditional feedback that's complexed in the states and you're going to give up most of our studies, or this map of 50 pounds of giant fts?
And yet, even that's a protein because you can't understand any huge toxic without understanding the muscle for others.
People go to cities to be connected, and categories is why these cities get rid.
For many of them, like San Franko or Iraq or Iranian, there's a GDP that's coming up or costs between a third of their national GDP.
But it's important -- you can't choose a single value in the prison of the people's role, the trust, the technology that allows them to get rid.
Take a bank of a gunk in South Africa, which represents the Janug and the city of Friririria.
It also represents a little bit more than five miles from South Africa.
But it's important to be -- it's reducing the survival of almost every cultural corporation that's going to be directly in South Africa and believe in anything, in every continent of Africa.
Cities want to be part of a world's possibility.
They want to be part of the global work.
So cities think.
I've never known a mayor who said to me, "I want my city to go."
They know they're going to beat the same way to the world culture like their home countries.
Now, a lot of people, a blueprint causes a lot.
They think that cities reduce the Earth.
But now, there's more than ethnic ethnic ethnicity.
It's similar to the internal organizations that we have.
And all of these microbial networks are accurate to one task, the first preference of humanity in the 20th century: sustainable.
Is it working?
Let's look at climate change.
We know that we've caught after a pig in New York or a price didn't reduce the magnitude emissions.
But you can see that technology and science and policies between cities is how we really started to reduce the income of our economies.
Cities are one of the other.
How to make a refugee building, how to appreciate electrical cars.
In centuries of centuries, you're going to use the number of cars in the streets.
In many Western cities, the forest doesn't even want to learn to drive.
Cities were part of the problem, now they're part of the solution.
Ninequality is the other big challenge in front of a sustainable axis.
When I'm going to travel in a giant click to the end -- it takes hours and water -- I'm going to try to train different different different kinds of extinction within the same geography.
And yet, from the world's world's world's world's world's world's world, there's never been bigger, and it's about 300 trillion dollars.
It's nearly the GDP of the world four times.
We've got on ourselves so big since the economic crisis, but do we invest them in the entire potential?
No, no longer.
Just as we built a risk enough, public, and in the top, when we invest in transportation networks, the possibility of people to call it physical and digital, then our friends and our friends will feel healthy and health.
And that's why the infrastructure has been invented in sustainable development of the United States, because it's enabling all the other.
Our political leaders and economists learn that theories don't think, is an opportunity.
And that's why our financial community needs to understand that theories is the most important features in one piece of muscle.
Now, cities can do the world more sustainable, they can do the world that's fair, I also believe that categories between cities can do its world more.
If we look at the areas in the world that they have an enormous relationship between their boundaries, it looks more traffic, more creative and more creative investment.
We all know the theory of Europe after the second world's war, where the industrial industry is the process that came to the Iraq Amazon of the day.
And you'll see that most, by the way it's the most common of all the main objects in the international system.
And there's a lot to explain the implications of today.
The countries are less profound in the method has less to stop it.
In North America, the most significant lines in the language are not the American or the American Central Central, but the coast of roads of roads and roads of roads and cockroads and networks and even electricity and electricity tables.
North America doesn't need more walls, it needs more connections.
But the real joke of categories exist in the world's world's ecosystems.
All of these areas where boundaries were the most historical musical musicians and the generations of leaders have had this beautiful relationship with it.
But now a new group of leaders come into the video and it allows the parents.
Please, for example, the Egyptian Amazon, where you're planning the networks of rapid trains between Bashington and Singapore and Singapore and Turkey Social School.
Now this region of 600 million people are dealing their agriculture and its industrial cooperation.
It's evolved to what I call "Charles Asia" between Asian countries.
It's a similar phenomenon in the East Africa, which is half of the countries that are made in the boundaries of luck and a multi-dimensional restaurants to be able to prevent their train to the market.
Now these countries are going to die of their infrastructure, and their investment policy.
They're also developing to the African corner.
One region we know that can help this kind of thinking is the Middle East.
When Western interventions are focused on tragedy, what's left behind are just the ancient cities, such as a community, bowl, and grow?
Actually, 400 million people in the Arab world are almost completely indicated.
As companies, anger, they're rich, or twice, energy industry, or energy consumption.
And the only way to fix this instrument isn't more war and more boundaries, because if more categories of refugees and trees.
Unfortunately, the Middle East is not that.
But it has to be, a local intervention, from facing faces and intervention of intervention to the programs: Europe, Asia, and Africa.
Now, maybe you don't sound like categories is what you want to now by the most hair region in the world.
But we know where theory is the only way to make a long-term strength.
Because we know that in the region after the region, theory is the new reality.
Western cities and corporations are going to join generations that are more and more sophisticated.
But the real test is going to be Asia.
Could categories move on the price of the big objects of the Middle East?
In the end, it's where our third war is supposed to be done.
Since the end of the War War, a hundred years ago, at least six main war in this region.
But no one of them didn't laugh.
Take China and Titan.
In the 1990s, it was the leading of everyone to the third world.
But since then, the trade of trade and investment to the galleries of the French has so far that in the last year, the leaders of the Southern Westerners have been the history of the history of the history of reducing the future.
And even the contrast in Iran's Italian's face that's been earlier than a year doesn't work under this basic dynamics.
China and there's a long history of privacy and that they're doing the air and their sea to show the healthy device.
But in the last few years, Japan has been invented in China's greatest investment.
Time cars are reduced there in a scanning lesson.
And let's look at where the largest number of strangers in Japan?
Next: China.
China and India had a critical war and they had three open savings, but today India is the largest sea in the Second French investment.
They're building a traffic stadium that's been reduced from the East India to Andrew and to South China.
They're going to grow from 20 billion dollars a decade ago to 80 billion dollars today.
India and South Korean workers have been paid for three wars and continuing strength in a brilliant interest, but they're also convenient, and they're also trained to travel to a country that's going to have a refugee and want to be reduced from Iraq through San to Indian.
And let's talk about Iran.
Not only two years ago that the war in Iran was inevitable?
So why is all designing and designing what's critical for business there?
My gentlemen and gentlemen, I can't wait for most of the third world is not going to prove.
But you can't see the reason it didn't happen.
Even though Syria is the house of the most quickly differences in the world, the same countries also spend billions of dollars in the series of the library and the second infrastructure.
They're also more interested in the academic geography of the other than its political geography.
And that's why the leaders are thinking sky, they're going to go back from the edge, and we're deciding to move in economic connections on TV plants.
It's often a lot of volunteer that the world's been reduced, but building more theories is the way that we've built a reinvasion, much better than before.
And as we looked at the world in physical and digital theories so serious, we're focused on evolution to happen in a world where people can jump their geographic genes.
We're the cells and the blood that's scared in these global networks.
Every day, hundreds of millions of people come to the web and work with people who have never done.
More than a billion people go boundaries every year, and it's more likely to go to three billion in the next decade.
We're not just building categories, we're getting it.
We're the global network, and that's our own.
A map of the world in which Octography is not the opposite.
Instead, for the future, there's a new symbol and more hopefully: categories is a rock.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Which is that we're going to go to the lights, we're going to go to Mars.
It's not just a single astronomers of thousands of people who are going to be sitting in Mars.
And I'm going to tell you that it's going to happen most.
Some of you're going to work on the projects that are going to teach, and I'm going to make you that some of your children will go to the body there.
It probably sounds ridiculous, so I'm going to tell you how and I'm going to happen.
But first of all, I'd like to look at the question of the web: Why are we doing this?
Twenty years ago, I gave TED Talk about 10 ways to the end of the world.
We're data under our galaxies.
One big asteroid can invent us Titanic.
In order to survive, you need to look at life on other plants.
Think about how terrible it would be if everything that humanity was able to achieve an accident as not.
And there's another reason to look at Mars: Western exploration is in our DNA.
Twenty-two million years ago, the management person evolved in Africa and then Twitter reduced on the planet all by spending violence across the horizon.
It's going to show us.
And the humanity that's driven in this way.
Some of the most important things in civilization and technology have come in this global crisis.
Yes, you can do a lot of good in the world with the money that requires to make a listening to the left.
And right, we've all got to admit to our home consumption.
And yes, I'm also worried about the thought that we've been destroying Mars as we've shown the planet.
But think about a moment, what happened when June. Kennedy told us that we could reduce a person on the moon.
It's a whole generation and made it a dream.
Think about how exciting it would be to see a man on Mars.
Maybe then we look at the Earth and we'll see just one humanity instead of a lot of water and maybe then we're going to treat the Earth as a solution to our ancestors on Mars.
So let me tell you about the wonderful journey that we're going to go out.
But first of all, some facts are looking at where we're going.
This picture actually represents the real body of Mars on the planet.
Mars are not the star of the Earth.
It's much less than a half of its body, but although it's smaller, the face of Mars, it's possible to stand in the body of the Earth, because the Earth is in the water.
The atmosphere of very good artists -- a hundred times more minute than the Earth -- and you can't get it, it's complex from 96 percent of India.
It's very expensive there.
The average temperature is about 63 degrees of gas, although there's a pretty big temperature.
About a day on a long left on the planet in 39 minutes.
Women and years on these are two times more than it's on the planet.
And who's interesting one day to wear walls and move, teachers have a lot less grammar than the Earth, and it's the places where you can jump above your car instead of going out of the side.
So as you see Mars are not so similar to the Earth, but it's the most close to the world that's going to happen from any other planet in the sun.
The problem is.
Mars are very far away from us, 1,000 times faster than our wind.
The moon is 4,000 kilometers of us and astronomers of Olympic took three days to get it.
Mars is 400,000 miles from here and take us eight months to get there -- 240 days.
And it's in a journalist who's living on a particular day, and at some hour, that's one of the two years, when you're born and the Earth is going to be so, that the distance that the space is going to be the most successful one that can be.
240 days, it's a lot of time to spend something with your colleagues inside the box.
And for a while, our survival of the movement to the Arabs is a spinal.
We're together with the hormones, the doctors, the face, the Chinese and the Indian, that we've actually created 44 spaces there, and in the eye, or we've collected the hill, or the conference.
Just when a third of the violence were successful.
And then we don't have a lot of spaces right now to get there.
We've ever had, San five.
Two San 5 was enough to bring us there.
It was the most expensive machine that had ever been built by humanity, it's the adult that took us to the wall.
But the last five trillion that used us in 1973 to the Southern Southern School, and then we decided to decide in the space instead of going to be able to use it to Mars after the moon on.
The biggest adult that we have right now is half of the size of the size of the size of the requirement to get to the Mars.
So it wouldn't be just going to get to Mars what leaves us to a very interesting question...
When could the first person join there?
Some of the experts think that if we can do it by 2050, it would be a pretty expensive driver.
Today, NASA says that in 2040, they can reduce people on Mars.
Maybe they're right.
I believe they can do it before in 2035.
But in fact, I don't think they're going to have to send a space to Mars in 2035, because we're already there.
We're going to join Mars in 2027.
And the reason for this is that this man is going to feel about doing it.
His name is Iraq, it's a CEO of Tesla Mord and Fix.
He said to me, in fact, we're going to take on Mars by 2025, but the window is more optimistic than me -- and that means a lot -- so I'm giving it two years old.
There's still...
Would this man do it until 2025 or 2027?
So let's see what a window is about one decade.
Where was this car 10 years ago?
It's the electrical car of Tesla.
In 2005, a lot of people in the car industry said we couldn't have an electrical car that's worth in the next few years.
And where was it?
It's a French School of Field Freex, six tons of French to the international space.
Three years ago, Fix Fix didn't get anything to cry.
So I think it's a pretty sure that the person who made a revolution in the car industry in a metaphor of 10 years and the person that's coming out of a rich company to cure in less than five years will bring us to Mars by 2027.
You know, governments and judges are no longer fixing the game.
Privacy companies are reduced to the space and they're going to take you with them.
And it's a big question.
Are we able to exist there?
So NASA may not bring us there to 2040, and maybe we'll get there a lot of their time, but NASA is doing a tremendous cameras in order to figure out how you can expect artists.
Let's look at the next problem.
Here's what you need to live on the planet: food, water, a globe and a hand.
And here's what you need to live on Mars: Everything I've mentioned before Porus.
So let's start with the most important thing in the list.
They're the basis of all life source, and it's been working too much for us to get water from the Earth to Mars, so we've got to find a source of water on Mars if we want to live there.
And if we look at Mars, it looks pretty expensive. It looks like the whole planet is talking.
But it turns out it's not true.
The land on Mars know about 60 percent of water.
And a number of satellites that we've lost and still suffer from Mars showed us -- and by the way it's a real photograph -- that in a lot of letters on Mars there's a layer of water.
It's not a bad place to get sick.
Here's a picture that's got a little piece of the space of the space of Penix in 2008, where you can see that you're going to have a ice ice. The white region here is a ice.
In the second picture, we took four days after the first photograph, you can see that some of the corner.
We know from the satellites that have huge trees under the surface on the left, as well as curiosity.
In fact, if the curiosity of Mars's posters are coming up, most of the planet will be under a sea of 9 meters.
So there's enough water there, but most of them are in a wind and bees under the surface, requires a lot of energy and a lot of work to express who's in the situation.
This device was found at the University of Washington in 1998.
It's actually a simple device of water.
And it turns out that the atmosphere of Mars is often 100 percent of experience in the water.
So this device can generate all the amount of water to people from the atmosphere of alone.
At the next point we need to worry about how we're going to be on Mars.
I was actually surprised to find that NASA has a solution to this.
It's a scientist from the Texas Mexico's Texas and his name's mindset.
He developed a machine called Mexici.
I'm talking about this thing.
It's actually a fuel cell that's working back, it's scared in the atmosphere of Mars and jumping out of a style.
And you've got to remember that fear of Indian, the 96 percent of the atmosphere of Mars -- is actually about 78 percent.
So the next one that's going to be a future to send teachers in 2020 is going to be such a machine, and it's able to create enough oxygen to the task for one person for a life.
But the big secret -- and it's still at a experimental point -- it's the machine that it's powerful to be 100 times larger.
What's Nazi?
We're able to use fossil growth, but we can't grow more than 15 percent of our food states there, at least until we're going to get water on the surface of Mars and we've got a chance and you can't grow up.
Unfortunately, most food will come from the Earth, and it will be a 3D food.
And what's about a glog over our head.
In the beginning, we're going to use the boys, we're going to be used with a light stress and a piece of air and a fingerprinting themselves.
But it works just for today.
There's too much solar crisis and too much curiosity.
So we need to search under the ground.
So it turns out that the land on Mars, it's great to make sure.
And NAS has been on this as well.
They're going to put a plastic plastic into the white, put them into the microbes, and then you can build buildings with really hot walls.
Or maybe we're just going to switch underneath the nation in the walls, or it's got no end.
And finally, there's the problem of the body.
On the Earth, we've got an atmosphere, that's seven pounds of pressure on our bodies every single time, and we're all the time to stress it.
On Mars, there's no attractive pressure.
So Duba Nigerian, a scientist from the Texas's Texas's Mexico, created a spinal space from the web.
It's going to protect us, it's going to go beyond a crisis and it's about our body.
So let's think about it for a minute.
I'm a food, a telescope, a beach, water, a smoke...
It's possible.
Really.
But it's still a little bit complicated and a little bit hard.
So this leads us to the next big step -- the next big step -- in the process of living on Mars.
And that's the change of the planet: they've made a few more like the Earth, a face of the whole planet.
It sounds like self-security, but the truth is that technology is to do everything I'm going to tell you already there.
First of all, we have to pay the platform.
It's very expensive about Mars because his atmosphere is so good.
The answer is here, in the primary and the flow of Mars, and they're both planning in a tremendous amount of coal India -- a welcome.
If we get it, it's going to take directly into the atmosphere and put it in a way that's happening on Earth.
And as we know, fear of India is very powerful.
My favorite way to do this is to make a huge solar device and focus it -- it's actually going to be used as a mirror -- and focus it on the top of Mars.
While it goes around, it's going to go through all the wind ice, you're going to get it and then it's going to go to the atmosphere.
In fact, it's not going to take a long time until the temperature on Mars start to go, close to less than 20 years.
Now, on a good day, on the equal line in the middle of Mars's summer, temperature can go to 20 degrees, but then they're going to go to 70 in the night.
So we're going to get a powerful effect: a sea of temperature that's going to make a big amount of ice -- especially a land on the ground -- to be married.
And then you get the real magic.
When the atmosphere is involved, it's all going to be better.
There's more gender than the Grandma, the atmosphere is helping us to spend on the planet, so you're going to be able to reduce water, and agriculture.
And then more atoms will go to the air, and they've created more powerful gas.
A rain and a scratch went down on Mars.
And the atmosphere has also made more stress and so we can open these space decisions.
All we need is 2.5 pounds of an atmosphere to survive.
Finally, life on Mars would feel similar to those in West Canada.
We're still going to give us the traditional problem of capacity in the atmosphere of Mars, and the truth that this goal can take 1,000 years.
But human beings are very sophisticated and very quickly.
You can't predict what technology is going to evolve in the future and not clear what we can do with our bodies.
In biology today, we're almost able to control our genetics -- what the genes in our bodies do.
It might be a species of human beings on the planet that's in a little bit of it on Mars.
But what do you do there? How did you first start?
It would be similar to life on the planet.
Somebody will evolve a restaurant, someone will build a disorder.
Somebody will do a cartoon movies on Mars and sell them into the customers of the Earth.
What Iraq will start with a Titanian devil.
So there's going to be software companies, there's going to be dirty, men.
What's in the kitchen is: it's going to be the worst event in our lives, and I think, it's also inspired.
Women every 10 years old if she wants to avoid teachers.
Child kids now at a future school to choose to live there.
Remember we gave a person on the moon?
When it happened people looked at the other hand and said, "If we can do it, we can do anything."
What would those people think if we're focused on Mars?
That's important, it's going to make us the current creatures in space.
And it means that humanity will be unrelated to the gene of the Earth.
We will never be the last human beings.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I want to show you an amazing woman.
What's Darwin.
Darwa was born in Jamia, the US in the age of 18, and now she was living in the Washington of Washington.
It's not a powerful politician from the building, and it's not slow.
She probably would tell you that no aid for a special idea, but it has a most amazing effect.
What's awesome in OK is that it's ready to invest too long a week on people who don't be: people don't have her neighborhood, and even the state of her country that she's never met.
The effect of Darwa started a few years ago when she went to all her friends on Facebook, and it's hard for them to make their fingerprints so that she could be an education of girls.
She didn't take a huge response, but 700,000 meters later, she's sending 120 girls to school.
When we talked a week last week, she told me that she was a little bit known for her local bank every time she's going to move with a full fingerprint in the water.
Now -- Darwa is not alone.
It's far from it.
It's a part of a golden and a transformation.
And there are people like Darwa: civil citizens.
The world's East is someone who's right first and unfortunately, not as a friend of a country, or a nation, but a friend of the human species, and someone who's used to act on this faith, to deal with the biggest challenges in our world.
Our work is focused on support and the revolution of civil citizens.
They're there in every country, and they're going to go through all demographics.
I want to argue with you today that the world depends on the planet.
I'm convinced that we had more civil citizens in our world, so each of the big challenges that we've been facing -- from general, climate change, inequal equality -- these issues will come up with summer.
These are at the end of global issues, and they can finally come up with free by a world that requires global solutions from leadership.
Now, the 3D response of people to this idea is that it's a little bit autonomous or even threatening.
So I'd like to share with you today a little bit of my story, how I finally got here, how it's communicating to Taliba and also, hopefully with you.
I grew up in Bollin, Australia, I was one of those kids who were really designing, never stopped asking "Why?"
You could be like this for yourself.
I used to ask my mom the most nervous questions.
I would ask her questions like, "Man, why can't I get sick and play with the streets every day?"
"Why don't you want to do this?"
"What's a muscle, and why do we need to keep them in my country?"
[]]]]]]]]]]] ["]]]]]] &
Why? "
It's the worst form, I think.
It's still terrible.
As a child, "Why," I thought I could change the world, and I can't convince me another.
And when I was 12 and my first year in high school, I started collecting money for developing countries.
We were really a group of children, and we collected more money than any other school in Australia.
And that's how I've been able to avoid the elephants to learn more.
It was in 1998.
Take us to a train in in my face.
There I was a conference with my grandfather's grandfather, who made a little bit of what was simple as a price of suffering from the Bill.
"Monomy" is "they've made it.
But don't give you an anthropology where it's for you, because it wasn't much more than a child't like my grandfather's daughter at it every day to find something, something that's value.
The same night with my grandfather and his family changed my life forever, because when it was time to go to sleep, we just wrote about this dream of the size of my bedroom, I'm in my grandfather, and the rest of us in this liquid, with this wall of us around us.
And I'm not a eye, but I wrote a forest and I thought to myself, "Why would someone have to live so much as I had so much?
Why could my grandmother's daughter live his dreams were being born by the place where he was born, or what's a guarantee called "Lott Street?" I just didn't understand it, and I've got to figure out what it was born.
Now, just later, I got to build that the poverty I've seen in physics was a result of decisions in fact by a person, who had been done or not been done, by a spinal designer of political designers and governments that had in the heart of the interest.
Obviously, they didn't create a Minstein, but they could also.
And if we want to try to help children like Suni, it won't work if we just send it a few dollars or try to move the luck in which it's living, because the problem is in another place.
And when I've been working on community projects in years after trying to help build schools, device teachers, and deal with HIV and AIDS, I've come to see that community development has to be prevented by the communities of themselves, and although it's not necessarily enough.
We need to deal with these challenges in a global scale and the way I've done.
And the best thing I could do is to try to raise a big group of citizens in the house to prove that our leaders will be acting to a social change.
The secrets for that, a few years later, my friend's friend to buy a group of friends from college, in the middle of Center, became the poverty of Australia.
We've had a dream to introduce this little bit in the time of the G20 with local Australian artists, and it's all of a sudden we've got one day when we've got a phone from us, a GDP, a Grand France, who'd put everyone to give up our customer.
I felt a little bit about that day as you can see.
But we've evolved, the Australian government who've heard our collective collapses, and they've been preparing an investment in health and global development -- a collection of 6.2 billion dollars.
I felt like -- [answer]]]]] []]]]]]]]]]]]
The machines of citizens together, we've helped convince the government to do the Amazon, and to operate a problem in a few miles out of our boundaries.
But here's the thing: it doesn't wait.
You'll see, there's been a scanning in the government, and two years later, all the new money goes.
What did we learn?
It's that fear is not enough.
We had to have a sustainable movement that was not one that had access to the extinct of politician or a mirror of economics.
And it had to happen anywhere, anywhere, every single government would be a structure of this structure that they probably couldn't have the TV of global action alone.
And so, that's what we took on ourselves.
And when we took ourselves this challenge, we asked ourselves, how do we get enough stress and build a lot of enough to win these long-term streets?
We could just think about one way.
We've had to somehow become this short emotion of people who've heard with the Guinea became the Syria for a long term.
It had to be part of their identity.
So in 2012, we've been studying an organization that was exactly his goal.
And there's only one there for him: the East of the world.
But it's not about any organization.
It's about citizens who are acting.
And a study of research shows us that usually the population care about global issues, just 18 percent did something about it.
It's not that people don't want to act.
It's usually that they don't know how to operate, or they believe that their actions won't have any impact.
So we've had to somehow raise and activate millions of civil citizens in countries to operate on leadership they're going to drive atheist.
And when we did this, we found something really exciting, when you make a global citizens for your task, you're suddenly producing yourself with some unusual animals.
Look, extreme poverty is not the only subject that it's global.
So it's also, climate change, human rights, inequality, even savings.
We've found ourselves as a chaos with people who are excited about focus on all of this lines in it.
But how do we actually work to the virus and the prosperity of these citizens?
Well, we used the universal language: music.
We've launched the East Amazon in the middle of New York City, in San Frankland, and we've got some of the most famous world to participate.
We've known that these judgments will be fought with the general corporation of the United States, so the leaders who need to hear our hands can't get out of them.
But there was Titan: You couldn't buy a cartoon.
You had to kill it.
You've had to cooperate for a global goal, and just when you've done it in a slide of points to stand up.
Technology is the nature.
I didn't have a interested in the Egypt as something that would make me feel good.
For me, citizens meaning you need to act, and that's what's going to do.
And most of the surprise, it worked.
Last year, more than 155,000 citizens just in New York City have taken enough points to stand up.
global, we've created citizens over 150 countries around the world.
And last year, we've spent more than 100,000 new friends every week over the year.
Look, we don't need to create civil citizens there's no one.
We're already everywhere.
We just need to be organisms and artificial to start acting.
And here, I believe, it's where we can learn a lot of OK, which started to work as a world's citizen already in 2012.
This is what she did.
It wasn't good science.
She started writing letters, a conversation was emailed to politicians.
She was married for her local community.
So she became active in social media and started to collect metaphors of before -- a lot of metaphors.
Now, maybe it doesn't sound like a lot.
How is it going to worry about something?
Well, it made a lot of because it wasn't alone.
Her actions to survive 142,000 other citizens, made the United States governments to appreciate global partnership for education.
And here's Dr. Robert Jah, the USAAIDD is leaving his necessary.
Look, when thousands of citizens of the world are inspired by this is amazing to see their collective power.
Western citizens like Darwa helped convince the World Bank to define their investment in the water and biobias.
Here's the general management of the Bank James County for 15 billion dollars on the stage of the world's "Amazon," and, the mayor of Indian government has been connected to get a toilet in every school and a school around India, until 2019.
The citizens of the world are encouraged by State Berkett from a Nett Center who had a Twitter on normal.
Einstein Berberg, the government network, brought the message, and her life to sell the investment in the education of girls.
Civil citizens together with Robert Richard government, Britain and Australia to define their investment to the polio disease.
They've come up and they've spent 65 million dollars.
But despite all of this genome, we're going to face some huge challenges.
Look, you might think of yourself, how can we convince the leaders of the world to go and expect global issues?
And yes, a powerful American political politician, a time said, "All politics is local."
It's what's always done in politicians to choose: looking for, to get a force and keep power through the local interactions, or in the good case, the national national.
I first experienced it when I was 21 years old.
I went through a meeting with the tree of the tree, so I would stay in the dream there -- [Alexander []]]]]]]]]]] &#93
And I said, "Shake -- in Australia, there's a collective opportunity to help get the development of the surgery.
We can do it. "
And he'd do, I've been looking at the top of my eyes, luck, and he said, "Oh, nobody's there on the aid."
Just he didn't use "No one there."
He went on.
Let's say we need to make a difference on our background first.
It's, I believe, a daily thinking and even dangerous.
Or as my grandfather's peace would say, a perfect switch.
Scientists offer this critical atmosphere because it offers one country against another country.
It's extended that we can look at ourselves and our violence is from this.
The whole world is our backyard, and we're focused on this to risk ourselves.
Look, look at what happened when we went from Rwanda, when we got a theory, when we move from climate change.
The political leaders do have to put on it. "
Now, citizens of the world -- they understand it.
We're living in a period of time in the world, in the age where you can hear every single voice.
Look, you remember as "the development of the Nigerian" will be in 2000?
The mammoth that we could do in those days was to switch out and wait for the next election.
There was no social media.
Today, billions of citizens have more tools, more access to information, more capable of affecting ever.
They're the problems and they're the tools to solve them in front of us.
The world changed, and those of us who look beyond our boundaries are on the right side of history.
So where are we?
So we're taking this amazing park, we've put some big policy states, and citizens look around the world.
But did we get our task?
No.
We have a long way yet.
But this is the opportunity I see.
The idea of global civil citizens, from Asia to her blogging, but it's so much unprecedented in many ways, free with this particular moment where we get to live.
We, as the world's citizens, there's now a unique opportunity to expect positive change around the world.
So in the next few years, citizens of the world will come up with the leadership of the world's leadership is responsible to ensure that the new global training for sustainable development will be used to train.
Civil civil citizens will be partners with the modern government organizations in the world to grow diseases like polio and malaria.
Civil citizens will raise every world in our world, when they define the disciplines, the quality and the effect of their actions.
These dreams are the top.
Imagine a military of millions and millions of dozens of millions, local, minds and not ready to get the answer.
For all these years, I tried to go back and communicate with my grandfather.
Unfortunately, it didn't happen to me.
We've met a lot before the social media age, and you've now been repeated by the evidence, as it's often happening with training neighbors.
I'm going to be happy to sit with him, on the happiness is, and don't share with him how long I've spent on Monoti, I've inspired me.
In his mind and for many other people's minds, I've come at the top of the important test to be part of people -- the kids are ready to look at their screens and the end of the world, civil citizens.
Western citizens who are working together and ask the question, "Why?"
I'm a world.
Do you?
Thank you.

The summer of these documents are spread the screen on a tiny piece of the final world outside the country.
We're getting a laughter to how customers and banks and lawyers go to companies like Oklahoma Fuka and say, "Okay, we want an anonymous company, you can join us?"
So in fact, you're seeing a DP, you're seeing the opinions of consciousness, you see the mechanism of how it works, how it works.
Now, it's already starting to make quite imaginable effects.
The mayor of Ireland Foundation.
We've also got news that the United States's son's disease in the rest of Israel also has a statement out of the country.
There's been the goals of getting money of two billion dollars that leaves to Syria and Mutin through the most expensive friend to him, in case he's Charle.
And there's a lot of rich people there and other people who will be nervous about the next few stories and the next number of documents.
Now, it sounds like a crowd or a junk of John Garden.
It looks very far from you, from me, from normal people.
Why does it have to play us?
But the truth is that if people are rich and powerful people can keep their money out of the country and don't pay words that they need, it means that there's less money for positive public services like health, education, roads.
And it affects all of us.
Now, my organization of global Washington, this explanation was extraordinary.
We have the global media and political leaders that are things about how people can use secrets outside the country to bring their features -- something we've talked about and we've talked about it for a decade.
Now, I think a lot of people find all of this world slow down and trick, and it's hard to understand how this kind of world outside the country works.
I like to think about it a little bit like a scanner.
So you can have a company in another company, in a different company, which makes it a little impossible to understand who's behind these boys.
It could be really hard to the law or the rules of the price, to the journalists, the civil society really understand what's going on.
I also think it's interesting that there was less than this issue in the United States.
And it may be because some of the people in the United States just wouldn't get in this language, in this Canada.
Now, it's not because there's no American people who bring their features out of the country.
It's just because of the way you get out of the country working, to the San Francisco has less American customers.
I think if we could see an airport from Kenyan or even Mord or Wajing or Najing, you'd see a lot more cases and examples that are coming back to Americans.
In fact, in a number of American countries, you need less information, you need to provide less information to create a company you need to get a library.
It's a kind of instrument that allows the workers of schools to add a school school.
It's going to enable the tools to add vulnerability.
It's the kind of behavior that affects us all.
Now, in global Washington, we wanted to see how it actually looks at reality.
How does it actually work?
So what we've done was to send a constitution in the concept of 13 companies a Darwin in the kitchen.
Our exploration is as an African wealth that wants to transform these important objects to the United States to buy a house, care, a airplane.
Now, what was really surprisingly surprising was that all of these laws except from one of us tried to explore how to transform these customers.
These were the first vulnerability, and nobody's involved because these lawyers didn't take us a constant and of course, the money didn't decide hands, but it really showed the problem with the system.
It's also important not just to think about it as a single studies.
It's not just about some kind of dialogue that we've been talking to our convenience and have been caused.
It's not just about politician in a certain sense that's been reduced in Syria.
It's about how the system works, which means corruption, demands from it, poverty and inevitable.
And to deal with this, we need to change the game.
We need to change the rules of the game to do this kind of behavior more.
It might look like a disaster and death, as if we can't do anything about it, as if nothing has ever changed, as if there's always going to be rich and powerful people.
But as a natural optimist, I do see that we're starting to change.
For the last few years, we've seen a real explanation for transparency when it comes to companies.
This subject was on the Janua's political mayor of England David Darwin in Ghana in Ghana in the northern US in 2013.
And then, the doctor's doctor is going to create centuries at the national level of who are really the tools and control companies around Europe.
One of the things that design is, in fact, the United States is coming back.
There's a regulation from the French who's been killed in the House and Senate, but it's not accurate as we want to see.
So we really would like to see the doors of Penna, which is a huge amount of money in the world outside the country, are used as a way to predict in the United States and around the world.
For us in global Washington, it's a moment of change.
We need people to be excited about how people can bring their identity behind secret companies.
We've got to have business businesses to come and say, "That's not good for business."
We need political leaders to make a problem, and to change the law to open this kind of secret.
Together, we can put the end of the signals that are a moment from the coffee, corruption and the collection of money to the switch.
I spent the last 38 years trying to be invisible.
I won't make a camera.
I'm working in New York City, and I'm going to talk to the New York City for the New York City is like a short period of a fifth group in the head: every small motion is taken by the cases -- and it's a night that you're going to do wrong.
Just to make sure: I wouldn't choose what's going into a magazine.
We're working at the level of refugees, maybe the physics, the words, the code.
Our business in details.
We put the two horizontal dots, over the U.S. "Bay". "
We're using the house station.
Every magazine has a style.
The New York is particularly unique.
Sometimes we live in because of our style.
Imagine -- we're still out of Alexander's "with a kitchen, like this word just right now.
But you're seeing that the "Banka" and the top dots in "cool," and you know you call the New Yorker.
It's a regulation in New York City, it's a critical process.
There's a unique role called the demand of death, or an airplane.
While the market is a car, the decline of death is a primary.
We're give the surprises to the shape through the need to improve the feeling of a sentence or to invest on a traffic, and we're going to be able to be reduced.
Our goal is to make a plan to show good.
You notice that we give our identity is not directly directly to the corner, but for the need.
It's a lot of times making a good Twitter's minute and a quarter of the laser -- I'm going to use it as a wind, including -- it's in the bad river.
If we do our work very well, we're invisible, but once we're doing it, we're the different toxins become bounced.
Here's the prosperity that's been enabled on a really recently recently.

Maybe there's no judgment, but yes, it's the concept of the New York City goes to "Jack."
One man wrote: "" Please, you can buy, or, at least, to San, the Freebrum, in your rich team? "
In this case, these games are very early, except it doesn't have to be one of "crazy" and "on."
And also, if you've got to have stop around "at least," maybe we're going to have it using the slides around the sentence: "-- or, at least, San --" perfect.
And then there's this: "I love you, love your magazine, but you'll please stop writing huge numbers as text?"
[Two and a half million...] No.

Okay! "
And I used to love to get an email.
There's the conference between writing and farmers.
You've never known the pain, you're never going to get out of a privilege about bad conversations that would have to get you or stories that were too long.
It's a great need to say about its strength because of its genes.
Social market, also, there's code; we don't move our mistakes.
I feel not supposed to publish them here, so let's look at what we do right.
How he was, I got a magnitude of listening.
But I'm working with writing that know how to deal with me.
I knew Iran France, or "Sandy," since the beginning of the 19th century.
And he's one of my favorite, even though he's sometimes writing a sentence that's caused to stop.
Here's one of the story about San Atland after the San Francisci France: [A] that's in the middle of the middle and lost his second half is down to the water, the spinning and his legislation is going to go forward like when you're opening out of Linkin's
But what can I do?
Titchen, "Like" has to be "similar," but it sounds ridiculous, like the pain was a fabric in the Morgan, "in the same way, like," It's like a dog of a door. "
And I decided that the device came up with a popular justice in Sandy and I went to the sentence to stay.
And in general, if I think something is wrong, I'm looking at it three times.
I said, "Well, I've said to Sandy this not a while of a minute and he said," Just three? "
So, he learned to stop.
Since recently, he wrote a story for "The city," It's the part of the magazine in the magazine with a short amount of issues that are affected by Richard in the Museum of the Museum in the Museum of the Museum.
The story of Sandy was on the help of the Francisco's summer's summer's summer.
There were three things that I had to change.
First of all, I'm going to go.
It's a black hole and Sandy wrote, [Kenya] and Darwin] as a ancient painting in Brothern.] Now, in the way, in the way to fix, with "Like," That's "to be not a solution to descri
"Like" in this sense, it's a tremendous dog, and it's going to take a object, which is there.
That's like, "It had to be" similar. "
"It's like a ancient, and it's particularly true."
Second, in the problem.
It's going to take a look at someone who's going to help the judge: "It's going to take another moment.
We put a microphone on the ground, "" You put a microphone?
The music industrial industry represents this "" because it's falled on the side.
I've never seen this using this with this artist, and I've been trying to think that "" Go's going to go into my magazine.

Finally, there was the blueprint and the problem of using the body's chicken has to be the same number of teenagers like a sentence.
[Everybody] Babby]]]]]] [Everybody] lost the president]]]]]]] &#9
You'd never say, "No."
Everybody was there. Everybody here.
But people say things like, "Everybody made the president all the time.
To give it to the optimism, I won't call it "their only Italian" as if you call it a single one doesn't do it much more.
And that's my job when I see so it's a car to do the more I can put it.
I couldn't do it, "Everybody made the president," or "Everybody reduced the president," or "they've all made the president or the president."
What I've been offering was to get rid.
And I said, through the need, if the pain will be able to voice this into "All the people in the classroom have reduced the president," because "All of this is many.
No.
I tried again, "All the prescripts made the president?"
And I thought it sounds very, very careful.
But the need of the fact that we can't have "convenient" and "convenient" in the same sentence.
When the final defense came back, the pain got the "for" "and" "and" "by a place" rather than "."
But about "Everybody reduced the president" he didn't make it.
Two of three is not bad.
In the same range, at the same time on the roof in the France, it was used by the Central Foundation by French.
I'm wondering, when you're going to come, what will happen in the Korean.
Laughter) Thank you.
Thank you.
How does the news designs the way we see the world?
Here's the world like it looks at the ground.
And here's how the news designs what Americans see.
So this map -- you know, I'm showing the number of American networks and new organisms in the cases of intervention, by countries, in February 2007, just a year ago.
It was in a month where the North Korea was reduced to take her nuclear workers.
There's been a broadcast in Indonesia.
And in France, IPCCC published a research study that has shown the effect of the person on the planet.
The United States was taken 79 percent of the news symbol.
And when we take the United States and look at 21 percent of the old, we see -- a lot of eyes, it's this green thing, and a little bit of others.
The scription of Rica, China and India, for example, came only to one percent.
When we've taken all the new curiosity from one study, it looks like the world.
What was the crisis?
This crisis was spending every country out of the park, and it got a 10 times times more than the IPC's's's "."
And the cycle continues, as we all know, behavioral statistics are recently recently.
So why don't we hear more about the world?
One reason is that the networks took their number of refugees in half.
Again's face of one person's network of ABC, New York City and death, there's no news networks in all Africa, India or South America places where life is more than two billion people.
The reality is that I've been studying Britain is more cheaper.
And the international sector is much more than a metaphor when we look at where people consume new.
Social new stations are used in a big, and we've been intervened only 12 percent of the Chinese for global feelings.
And what about the Internet?
The most popular news is not in a better situation.
Last year, at the University of Kenya was 14,000 symbols who were invented in the house of a new Google.
And in fact, they all tried them 24-bad events.
In the same way, another research in the Internet has shown that most of the content of international commercials from the United States is repeated from the retinal agencies of the corporations and TV agencies, and we don't allow people to understand their context to explore.
If you look at all of these genes, you can understand why academic academic of today as well as Americans who are less likely to know about the world than they've been thinking about 20 years ago.
And if you think it's just because we don't want, mistake you.
In the last few years, the Americans who say they're going to go after global news in most of the time grow to 50 percent.
The real question is: Is a world interested in this is what we want for Americans in our world more and more and more?
I know we're able to get better than that.
And can we afford ourselves not to succeed? Thank you.
I have another reason for optimism: climate change.
Maybe you don't believe it, but here's the fact.
In 12 in the past 12, 2015, in France, under the United Nations, 195 governments were created and innovation -- if you worked with governments, you know how hard it is -- we decided to change one direction of the global economy to protect the most vulnerable and improve the lives of all of us.
Now, it's an extraordinary song.
But it's even more amazing if you're wearing where we were just a few years ago.
2009, Chile.
Who remember a chicken?
Well, after years of working into the climate direction, the same governments were designed in their behavior and its own own.
Why is it completely failed?
A lot of different reasons, but especially because of the unfortunate hair between the global and global South.
So now, six months after this failure, I read to take responsibility on global climate change.
You can imagine, the perfect moment to start this new work.
The global wind of climate change was in the language.
Nobody believed that global samples could ever be possible.
In fact, I'm not.
If you're sorry not to tell anybody out of this wonderful TED audience, I'm going to tell you that there was a secret in history unfortunately.
In my first journalists, a journalist who asked, "If, Mr. Ford, you think that global warming will ever be possible?"
And for me to activate the brain, I heard myself from the door, "No time in my life."
Well, you can imagine the faces of my journalists who was pregnant from the Southern African woman who was this new bus.
And I've also been dead.
Now, I wouldn't be reduced by me, because I'm kind of normal to myself.
I was actually reduced by the consequences of what I just said, from the results to the world where every child had to live.
It was actually a terrible moment for me, and I thought, well, not, wait for a moment, waiting for a moment.
It's impossible, it's access.
It's just access.
And I decided then and there I'm going to bring my approach and I've been trying to help the world his approach about climate change.
So I don't know -- no, just that?
Thank you. I don't know -- what you would do if you had to tell you that your work is to save the planet.
Let's put it on a work.
And you've got full responsibility, but you don't have curiosity at all, because the governments are carrying in every decision they take.
Well, I really would like to know what you would do on the first day in the morning, but here's what I did: I went into anatomy.
And then I went back to anatomy, because I realized I had no idea how we were going to solve this problem.
And then I realized I had no idea how we're going to solve this problem, but I know one thing: we've got to change this conversation.
Because there's no way you can provide confidence without optimism.
And here, I use optimism as a very simple word, but let's understand it in the most exciting sense.
Let's understand it as a courage, hope, trust, liberal, the basic belief that we're the people who can come together and help each other to draw the wheel of humanity.
Well, you can imagine that I thought that at this, there was no way that was made out of the collaboration of a chicken.
And for six years, in action, without the optimism of optimism into the system, no matter what the questions from the content -- and I did better at that -- and no matter what the disciplines are.
And believe me, there was a lot of evidence against me.
It's an uncomfortable optimism into the system.
But very quickly, we started to see changes that are going on in many areas, extended by thousands of people, including a lot of you here today, and I'm happy to you.
And this TED community will not be surprised if I'm going to tell you that the first region we saw an amazing change was...
Technology.
We started to see that clean technologies, mostly new energy technologies, started to go through the price and get in violence, to the point where we're already building solar states that have the capacity to give power to cities, not talking about what we're doing on smart and smart buildings.
And with this change in technology, we were able to start to understand that there's a change in the economic equation, because we were able to understand that yes, there's high cost to climate change, and yes, there's complex risks.
But there's also economic solutions and solutions, because the techniques of fantastic technologies are going to bring us a better air, better health care, and cities are more genetic security, more analogy, more access to the developing world.
To summarize, a better world than we have now.
And with this understanding, you had to see, in fact, how many of you have seen, the expansion of Ethiopia and emotions that were happening first through national governments, the private sector, the industrial sector, insurance companies, interpretation, communities, communities, because everyone started to understand, it could actually be done.
It can actually improve their bottom line.
And it wasn't just the hands of the hands.
I have to tell you that I had a very big, very big oil company that came to me at the beginning of the year and said -- in privacy, of course, he didn't know how to change his society, but he's going to change it, because he's interested in a long term.
Well, now we have a change in the economic equation, and with it, with a lot more than everyone, it didn't take a long time until we saw the National government that came to the fact that it's for the National Institute.
And when we asked teachers to start identify how they could make world, but based on the national interest, 189 countries out of 195, 189 countries who sent their climate change, based on their national interactions, in their own communities, in their national interventions, with their national programs.
Well, once you're responding to the universal interactions of countries, so you can understand that violence would be ready to start to get one in a common form, to a common direction that's going to take us for a few decades probably, but for those decades it will take us into a new economy, a very carbon and a federal economy.
And the states, the long-term and the violence of all of these efforts have a crisis.
And the critical dots that we had every five years to appreciate collective progress to our training directions from the rural lives, and the way itself has to go into the coast and more than a legal economy.
And here's a lot more important: What did we have before?
A small number of countries that were taken from mortality, a short period of refugees that were completely unusual and more than that, they were conducted in a restaurant.
Now what do we have?
Now we've got all the countries in the world that's going to take different levels in different strings, but they're all going to be paralyzed and travel with environmental illness.
Well, once you've got all of this instead and you've got this understanding, and then you see that governments would be able to go to the piano and adopt the conference.
And so, when I look back in the last six years, first I remember the day that you've got a courage.
I can't tell you about the horizon in the room.
Three people jump out of their chairs, boss, confident, clicks, dozens, according to theory and still inevitable what they saw, because so many people were working for years to this direction, and it was their reality at the end.
And it wasn't just the ones that were going on directly.
A couple of weeks ago, I was with a cold that was trying to decide on a beautiful face that he wanted to give his wonderful woman.
And once he decided to collect what he's going to buy, he said to him, "You know, you're very lucky that you're going to call it right now, because these faces can be afraid of climate change."
"But," Horry said, "Would you hear, governments just come down, and Titi can be a chance."
Well, what a fantastic conference maybe, maybe here's the hope, here's a possible chance.
I'm the first to know that we still have a lot of work to do.
We just started our work on climate change.
And in fact, we need to ensure that we've been able to apply our efforts for the next five years they're five years.
But I believe that we've gone over the last six years on the impossible for when we can't get a choice.
And how did we do that? By reducing the revolutionary optimism that allows us to go from action to action, which allows us to understand that international interactions are not necessarily necessary to global needs, and that if we understand it, we can connect them and we can push them in the retina.
And when we look forward to other global issues that will take our attention in this century -- security security, security security, national security -- I see that we don't know how we're going to solve these problems still.
But we can take a piece of what we've done in climate change and we can understand that we need to reinvent the African intelligence.
Because we're going to believe that there's always open-up and symbols, and that your instrument is my solution.
Well, now when we're in the world where we've come to the French boundaries and that we're not just connected, but more depends on each other, your instrument is not my solution.
We're all or symbols or we're all developing.
But we're going to have to decide between the sum and zero.
We're going to have to decide between zero and all of them or live the lives of all of us.
We did it once, we can do it again.
Thank you.
Thank you.

In the next month, I was 44, and I had the feeling that I had 44 would be a very good year, a year of death, the name.
I've got a feeling like this, not because I've seen something special, but because I read it's going to be a good year in a book from 1968, which is a terrible identity.
"He's feeling the 44 pounds."

Yes, I know that Michael didn't write me.
But I also know it's yes, because we're all -- I'm, the hero of finance, more or less at the same time, they're going to go from the bottom of the line: from the farmers and the Islam and the Islam's arms, for freedom and the abstractions of the graphic, and in
Life has patterns and they're shared to all of us.
As you've forgot Man: "It will happen to me like them."
And we're not just living these patterns.
We're also interested in them.
We're writing them in the books and they're becoming a component that we can read and reidentify.
The books tell us who we were, who we were and who we were.
They do it for thousands of years.
Like James Taller: "Life becomes pregnant, if they're going to become something."
So six years ago, I've been watching a thought: If life becomes previous, there's an explanation there, an academic that's written about all the age of it.
If I can find them, I can predict some of them as well.
I'll give you a lot of life, a long life, a hundred years of life, all of this blueprint is all that it's the luck of us.
I was so 37 years old, "The age of a budget," wrote William Willer.
I've had an alternative for the time and the age.
A illustrated disease in my family and then, a surprise that I got in, brought me very well that aging didn't have a confident.
And except of that, aging just pushing the inevitable, the time you see what the reasons don't expect.
All of this was a little head.
But the list will stay forever.
Over life's experience over the years, it's going to be in the gene of a blueprint of what's missing and disappeared, it's going to give me and others to the future, whether we're going to get it or not.
And then, when I started to make my office, I was doing a bright level. I was looking at insects for a lot of time.
And I found them every year and a year in 100 of our first clouds.
"27!" -- a period of ethical, "" -- John Camp. "" 62 -- the age of opinion. "
Paul Jah, I was obviously aware of this that they were going to be trained.
First of all, we're living today more and that's why we need to take more.
Chris Iraq Robert used the yellow "to describe a man at 53, a hundred years after the Darwin described himself at the age of 36.
And I also mentioned that life knows to change in privacy and effectively change for a year, and that every person might experience the same line.
But also, as the list came out, you know, also on paper, in cities like transparency in the mirror, I've shown that in the life that I've found that, in the age of 20, a less safe and less who is "and" France, "and" I've come up with the age of
I found myself there.
Of course, we're all there.
Milton of Ford French, the great graphic nerve, which you're seeing here, and now it's 85 years old -- all of its understanding and the Monki Tumbaki -- a kind of fabric that is like art and the colors help us remember our experience.
And yes, when I showed the list to my grandfather, it's the name of identity.
He was then 95 years old and close to die, and that's, as you've forgotten Robero, "Like never die to the world."
And I remember he said to me, who was a profound prototype that in the age of 22, we're sure we're never going to be falled, as it's also a strange concept called Ewin who said that in the age of 90, we're obvious.
It happened to him like them.
Now the list is made and a teacher: 100 years.
And when I'm finished it, I'm clear that I'm going to join and humor.
My life even before, I have many more presidents to write on them.
And remember Mr. Miller, I'm here in the box for my 44.
Thank you.
Thank you.
A cycle.
A person.
And a piece.
Good.
Social.
The brain comes.
Why?
The natural biological process that every boat comes in every month, for a half of her life.
It's a phenomenon that it's so significant until the survival and the era of human species depends on it.
And we're still treating it as a kitchen.
We're scared and scared to talk about it.
When I got a cycle for the first time, I told me to keep it in the end of the other people even my father and my mom.
More later, when this park came up in our teachers from our teacher to biology on the subject.
But you know what I've learned about?
I learned that it's really exciting to talk about it.
I learned to get in my body.
I've learned not to pay attention to my region to stay "Man."
A study in different areas of India shows that three out of every bridge doesn't know what it's and a piece of when they're spending back for the first time.
And in some areas of Rajan, this number comes to even invest out of a bridge that doesn't know anything.
You may have been surprised to hear that most of the forests that I've forgotten a woman who didn't know anything about the prosthetic during their first cycle thought they had "cancer" and they're going to die at most.
It's made in a cycle, it's causing a risk that's important in pollution in the sea system.
But in India, just 12 percent of the forests and the women have access to the rainforest ways to treat their region.
If you do the important 88 percent of the forests and the women are using unfamous events to treat their region.
I was one of them.
I grew up in a small town called Goraza, in January, where even to buy the Gayrus Cambridge was sitting to talk about.
So when I started with the cycle, I started using curiosity.
After all of the use, I'd use them and use it again.
But in order to put them out, I've been looking at it, and I'm looking at them in a very important place and forget that nobody knew I'm in the region.
Because of the extinction refugees became a series, and they're going to be unprecedented and pollution because of the use of them.
I used it for five years until I left this task.
Another subject that the cycle brought to my life is of the social limits that are built on walls and women at the time the emotional cycle.
I think you're probably aware of it, but I'm still going to share them for the few of you who are not aware.
I didn't get to touch or eat objects.
I didn't have to sit on the book or on the bed of some of the family friends.
I've had to switch my clock after every cycle, even if it wasn't familiar.
I thought, "A hundred" and I'm not going to go to the post or touch every tree that has a religion.
You're going to see a mirror out of women's academic and forests in the region.
Indeed, most of the time, it's a more sophisticated woman who's watching these limits on young women in her family.
After all, they've come in in as they're spending these limits in the walls.
And in the room, all of these interventions are the patterns and the motion of motivations that are injured to the generation.
For the years I'm working in this field, I'm going to be able to be even in stories where they're going to eat and put their tools in France.
They don't have to get rid of the cycle, and in some ways, they're even other family's homes.
About 85 percent of the forests and women in India exist from one hill or more in their cycle in every month.
You can imagine what it does for self-esteem and think of the self of a young girl?
The psychological train that's a journey, the effect of its own personality, on its own mortality, and all of the other look of the progress in the early years, these objects?
I've spent all of these roads for 13 years, until a discussion with my partner, Tony, changed my perception.
In 2009, Titan and I've been invited to design.
We liked it in this, and I felt comfortable to talk to him about my cycle.
Tony knew very little about the cycle.
And it's volunteered to discover that forests are accumulated and that we're focused on every month.
Laughter) Yeah.
He was completely in the market when he found out of the limits that were built on women and forever during their families and their society.
To help me with my action is coming into the Internet and learn more about the region.
When he's part of his cameras with me, I realized how little I knew about and a piece of myself.
And many of my photos were killed at all as patterns.
So we started wondering: If our mistakes, our brains were so motivated about the cycle, there's probably millions of other walls out there with motivated knowledge.
In order to understand the problem better I've evolved in a year study, to learn about the consciousness of the freedom and the problem behind her.
While we're going to believe that unaware of the sensory cycle and its motion is a rule problem, during my research I discovered that it's a great problem in the same way.
And it's also there in the urban states that are used.
When I was talking to a lot of parents and teachers I found that many of them really wanted to wake up on the cycle before they started to get the flight.
But they've had the wrong events.
And because it's Tubo, they've been worried, and it's about it.
Civil victims today in the classroom and New York City, but our teachers are trained on the corner of the cycle just in the classroom.
And because it's a dance of teachers still talk about the subject.
So the school doesn't teach girls on the cycle, the parents don't talk about it.
Who are the forests?
Two decades ago and today -- nothing has changed.
I've changed these cameras with Titan and wondered: What if we can create something that will help build the cycle in themselves -- something that will help teachers and teachers talk about a feedback to build young?
Over the research, I collected a lot of stories.
These were stories of victims during their cycle.
These stories will become interested in curiosity and curiosity when they're talking about, and they're on their fingerprints.
This is what we wanted.
We wanted something to do the curiosity and give them to learn about it.
We wanted to use these stories to teach girls on a cycle.
So we decided to create a cockroach book, where the cartoons get these stories and get girls on a repeat in a slightly slide way.
To make victims in different parts of the companies, we have three characters.
Pophilic that still didn't have a cycle, Jaza who's getting the cycle at the top of the book's book, and the crisis that's already got the cycle.
There's a fifth pattern, a pretty radiation.
Derek, victims respond to recognize the different effects of the German and the Guinea came from a region.
While we created the book, we talked very much that no one of the teachers wouldn't be a man in any way and have been cultural.
While the prototype, we found that the girls liked the book.
They'd like to read it and know more and more about the cycle itself.
The teachers and teachers were comfortable to talk about the cycle of young girls using a book, and sometimes even boys were interested in reading it.
Laughter) But you know, the Social book has helped create a environment where it's going to be Timbo.
A lot of volunteers took the prototype of schools themselves to take girls and take a aware of consciousness on a cycle of different countries in India.
And one of the volunteers took the prototype to teach young musicians and take it to his return in Luke.
We've created the last version of the book, called "Mcropy Cambridge." And we've invented it in September last year.
And to now, more than 4,000 victims were used by a book in India -- Applause) Thank you.
But 10 different countries.
We're all the time reducing the book to different languages and cooperating with local organizations to make the book in different countries.
15 schools in different parts of India have done the book for part of the school program to teach girls on their area.
So I'm afraid to see how volunteers, people, parents, teachers, schools, came up and take the consciousness to their communities, worry that the girls were going to learn about the cycle in the age of the president and helped for the chaos.
I'm talking about a future where a cycle doesn't make a disease, not a disease, but a change for a child's life.
And I've been -- [] --]) And I'd like to end up with a little bit of all the parents here.
The teachers are expensive, if you're going to be in the region, your girls will also feel.
So please have been positive to the region.
Laughter) Thank you.
Thank you.
How do you find dinosaurs?
It sounds impossible, right?
It's not.
And the answer is looking at the train that all the international ecologists use it.
And I'm going to tell you the secret.
First of all, they found a travel at the right age.
Second, these roads have to be a background.
And third, the president of sensory is to be important.
This is.
There's found these three things and learned to the ground, the chance you'll find fossil.
Now let me just take the joke.
The organisms only exist during certain ecosystems.
So you need to find the trees at the right age, depends on what you're interested in.
If you want to find tricks, you need to find really ancient roads from the Olympic -- dogs between half a billion and a billion years.
Now, if you want to find dinosaurs, don't go in an altrum, you don't find them.
They didn't evolve yet.
You need to find young people from the fair, and in a case of dinosaurs, at the age of 235 and 66 million years.
Now, it's pretty easy to find curiosity at the top of this point, because the Earth, in a biological map.
It's information that's been killed in hard work.
The details of the Earth's history as well as convenient, one of the other, so the ancient fish are more at the bottom and the young people up.
Now, if it was that easy, geologists were happy.
It's not.
The library of the Earth is a future.
It doesn't have a service to a tree.
It's working on long periods, a big amount of geologists offer any possible language on the future roads.
Most of the shots are left right after they're writing.
A few pounds are written, and you create an extinction of the walls of the surface that's gone from time.
The fish that found a spint under the academic sounds of time never really safe.
In contrast to the wind -- our extinction's decline -- the Earth's alive, with creative forces and the restaurant that motivates its biological autism.
I'm going to have a gun that was scared by astronologists, they're all about the age of the sun system.
I'm going to win, they're in the front.
The Earth's hand, on the other hand, you're going to face a animal's agenda.
Everybody will get rid, through some of the player's player, a dog, Paul, a career and a mammogram.
So, as the history of the Earth doesn't wait and prosperity.
The library is happening and proud -- but it's bad.
And it was this great complexity in the end of the roads that made it quite recently.
The nature didn't have a cartoon cartoon on to geologists -- it's got to be happy.
A thousand years later that the materials learned to move their computers on refugees, as the Earth's planet left not reading for humanity.
We were ecosystems, not aware of our planet's actions and teachers for our public time.
It wasn't until the 19th century's disease that the tricks were born, first, with the primary of the Earth's theory of James, where he told us that the Earth didn't explain to her, and then, with this pattern of the language of Britain and Willie William, the first country of the first country that
After that, you can say things like, "If we go there, we'll be a teacher," Oh, if we go beyond this hour, we need to find the scooking. "
So now, if you want to find tricks, take yourself from a good ecosystems and go to the trees of the international.
If you want to find dinosaurs like I'm looking for, you're going to get rid of the fair and go there.
Now, of course, you can find fossil fuels just in the background, a train that's made out of a wind and a tree.
You can't have a secret in a secret that's created by a magazine, like Kenya, or a metaphor that's being scared.
And you need to get to the thing.
It's not that dinosaurs were especially in the same thing; they've lived on every land and every possible environment.
It's that you need to go to a place that's talking about today, a place that doesn't have a lot of plants on the road, and the universe where you're always afraid of objects on the surface.
So you've found these three things: rock at the right age, that they're a background, and they're going to go to the ground, and you're a library, and you're going to go until you're seeing a brown out of the road.
Here's a picture that's taken in South Korea.
Everyone you see on the ground there is a piece of dinosaurs.
So when you're in the right situation, it's not a question of if you find a fossil or not; you'll find fossil fuels.
The question is: Do you find something that's important?
And to help with that, I'm going to add some of the fourth part of our trade, which is this: the worst that you can buy other anologists.
It's not that I don't like other anonologists.
When you get to a place that's not studied, you have a lot better chance not just find boys but find something new to science.
So it's my conversation to take dinosaurs, and I put it around the world.
In the Western summer of 2004, I went to the return of South America, the Penya, Uganda, looking for dinosaurs: a place where there's a background on the right surface, a place in the right place, a place that was built in Canadian.
And we found it.
It's the driver, the object goes down, of a huge food dinosaurs.
It's the bone in about 2.2 feet.
It's more than two feet.
Now, unfortunately, this object was terrible.
We've been scared and we've been scared, and there's no more bone in the environment.
But she gave us a fire to go back the next year to fly.
And on the first day of the next task, we found this: Another object goes into two meters, just this time it wasn't dead, it was together with 145 other objects of huge plants.
And then another three lines that's hard and digital, the budget looks like this.
And there you see the fingerprint of the extended production spread around me.
The bank that's written in this crisis, the new species of dinosaurs, at the end of what we called "Dettus Ross."
Dettus was at 26 meters from the top to the top.
It's about two and a half places in the kitchen, and with all the body in life, it's weight 65 tons.
People ask me sometimes, "Will Syrus be a big metaphor?"
It's a piece of eight or a five-in-in-in-in-in-in-fire.
Now one of the really cool things about being a nanologist is that when you find new species, you get to give them there.
And I've always thought that it's got these insects, the dinosaurs of plants are often scared as a bridge from the halls and psychologists on the surface.
And they don't.
A big tool can be chimpanzees, and they can be tricks -- you don't want to engage with the finger or the kitchen or the chicken.
The food in London is a lot more people than the Greek Guini Guini.
So can you imagine a big male, Derotus that's wearing 65 tons in the sea, a gene on the trillion?
This animal was a most dangerous, we had to get everyone in the environment, and himself didn't have something to fear of it.
And so the name, "Derotus," or "is not afraid."
Now, get to the size of so big, life like Denotus had to be a model of effective.
The long-term and the long-term is helping it to make a heat in the environment, and it's a psychopath in its temperature.
And this long-term is also used as an effective concept.
Dettus can stand in and with this exhibition to a big metaphor of a bedroom, a hundreds of thousands of categories in its own a very little bit.
And these animals have developed a boundary boundary, which gave them a huge statement, because when you're 65 tons, when you're a big list like a house, you've been reduced on Paul is death.
Yes, these animals were big and curiosity, but they didn't take these letters.
And when Dettus is fabulous, wearing weapons and clinics.
Others are extended.
If you're a big virus that's wearing 65 tons, you can't stop in life -- even one time.
Now, after the experience of this cartoon has been taken, and in administration by the muscles in the bacteria, and bad, its bones have gone from a fossil, when they decided molecules with who were getting more and more and more like the crisis.
When it's over a layer of metaphors, stress, from all the side of the roads like a kitchen of the flow and the prosperity of their physician, all of their own bouncing.
And then it got the dream.
The long.
Eden after the age of the same thing, not bad without a number.
When all of the time, the president is conducted without change and too much in a perfect weight inside the explanation.
In the time, the history of the Earth goes over.
The dinosaurs will replace 12 million years ago that their genome was a little bit in the Octoctoco.
It's going to be scared. It's got it.
The age of the ice came.
And then, in the East Africa, a species doesn't make the weird of the weird of consciousness.
These features were not faster or particularly powerful.
But they've been on the background experiment, and they've been extended in Japanese, and they've even got the profile of the dinosaurs in the walls, they've come back all over the platform, they've gone through all over the environment that they've taken, and in the way, the reality
With seven billion Homo Ross was born on the planet, it would be inevitably inevitable that one of them eventually came up with the Kenyan's coffee that was born underneath the South Korea.
I was this person.
And when I went there, alone in the thing, I was aware that every person's chance to go into the fossil is a small way.
But the Earth's really great.
And for the time, the impossible is possible.
It's the magic of the genetic revolution.
So, a lot of creatures that have been scared and on the ancient planet have left behind them with a huge amount of fossil fuels, every small plane, but together, inevitable.
Before six million years ago, astronasteroids came to the Earth and reduce the dinosaurs.
It could not happen.
But we only get one history, and it's that we have.
But this particular reality wasn't inevitable.
A little bit of the asteroid far away from the Earth would make it switch our planet in a big range.
Today, the small reality changes the dinosaurs were born, the understanding of the modern world that we know was not going to happen.
It could be just another day -- a fifth day maybe -- between 63 billion of the dinosaurs were already done.
But over the time the biological time, not environmental events, almost impossible is happening.
Over the time our ancestors are reduced to a person's payment to wear peaks, there's no cooperation in the way that we've led us to this particular reality.
The objects of Denotus was taken underground for 77 million years.
Who could imagine that a single species of extinction hormones that were in the baskets of the dinosaurs would open up to an aware of consciousness and understand the dinosaurs of them are probably afraid?
I've ever been at the beginning of a magnitude and I've made my legs over the two sides.
There, it's not more than a fun of water that's coming underneath his hand, high in the Detroit.
It's going to learn how many hundreds of meters and a couple of meters in a small house.
These two pounds -- they look the same.
But it's one of the anonymous water, and then it's the fabric.
Now let's go to the GDP, near a student of Los Angeles, and it's pretty clear that this river is a big thing.
But go into the Detroit and look at the back, and the human perspective doesn't allow us to see it as special.
Now let's go back to the cosmic cockroach and look at our prototypes.
You've never been afraid they're going to happen to something special, and they're probably not, if the asteroid invented.
Now, you've made thousands of violence and thousands of solar systems and give them action.
You never get the same result.
Unfortunately, these global warming will be also amazing and inevitable, but they're not going to be our world and don't have our history.
There's a number of history that we could have.
We get only one, and Wow, we got one good.
The dinosaurs like Dartus were real.
Finally, like the light was real.
The lights with a glass of a printer and Darwins in the size of a car really exist.
Why to explore the past?
Because it gives us a collective and hope.
The dinosaurs died in the personal global diversity, have been reduced in a conservation that doesn't come in.
They didn't see it coming, and they didn't have a choice.
We, on the other hand, there's a choice.
And the nature of the fossil fuels tell us that our universe in the planet is also expensive and maybe a professional.
Right now, our species causes environmental illness so widely and uncomfortable, that you can read it in the personal station.
Only, we're going to take dinosaurs, we can see it coming.
And with dinosaurs, we can do something about it.
This choice is our choice.
Thank you.
Thank you.
There's the thinking that there's going to go to TED Talks: "I'm going to want to have a rock and red."
"Tell a child story."
"Free a personal secret."
"Finally in Cambridge's action."
No.
It doesn't have to treat TED.
Actually, using these actions just make you feel like innovation and popular.
But there's one thing that's transformed to all the big texts of TED, and I'd like to share with you, because I'm sitting over 12 years in the best sea in the room and listening to a lot of amazing TED Mark, like this.
I've helped them predict their signals for the moment and learned directly from them to their secrets: What makes a talk to the patient.
And despite all of their objects and their issues are very different than those, there's actually one central component that's being reduced to everyone.
And here it is: Your personal task, as confidence, it's to transmit your mind from a unique field -- the weird object and the machine in our corner. "
Let me show you what I mean.
That's my wife.
It's going to give the TED Talk, and it's actually a device.
[Video] Man: I'm going to go and don't worry!
Thank you for 18 minutes, 1,200 people, many of them have never seen it, disabilities that their brains start to contract with a happy brain and it's with the brain of that.
They're really starting to represent them patterns of brain genes.
And I don't mean they just feel those emotions.
It happens something more amazing.
Let's take a minute into the brain of my wife.
billions of nervous cells there are impossible.
But look here, right here -- millions of them are connected with them in a way that's made a single idea.
And it's not an artist, but it's exactly the same pattern that's been reinvented in real time in all of the magazine.
It's really true: within a few minutes of a million nervous cells that's translated into 1,200 brains, just out of the corner to the voice and looking at the face.
But a moment. What's an idea?
You can see it's a pattern of information that's helping to understand the world and find it.
The ideas have all kinds of forms and grow, for the complexity and analogy to judge and autism.
Here are some examples of TED.
Roberson Roberson: creativity is the key to the future of our children.
[] Roberson]]]]]]]]]]]] [Sunson]]] &#9
Chris Anderson: The Arabic, the great girl to build a bank.
[] Iranian]: It's growing everywhere, it's a powerful material, genetic, right in the earthquake.
CA: As an enormous anxiety, people have more than one identity.
[Canada]]]]]]]] []]]]]]]]] &
CA: Your brain is getting ideas, and not random ideas.
There's a early music.
Together, they're creating a complicated structure -- it's not an interview of you're unique.
This is the operating system of your brain.
It's a way to find in the world.
And it's complicated from millions of different ideas.
For instance, if you're a little bit of a little bit of a global view of you, it's the idea that dogs are sophisticated, then when you're watching it, you'll find it like this.
But if you're a different component of your world is the idea that we're doing are dangerous, you know that when you're going to look at it, you'll find a little bit different.
Of course, in fact, why there's a privilege for the ideas of what's complex from you.
You think they're going to be real as possible, that there's a way to be a way to the right world, the wonderful, but the wonderful one around you.
Their investments of people may be very different.
For instance, how does the world investment responds to this baby?
"Aha"? "" Man ", maybe even" sister? "
And maybe, "Hey, you know," "that's a brain language," "" "you get"? "
CA: There's going to be your answer, there's millions of people who will find completely different.
And so the ideas are really important.
When you put them right, the coal to change the way someone thinks about the world, and reduce their name right now and also in the far future.
The idea is the most powerful power in human culture.
So if you've got to get you that the main one of you is to build an idea in your brains of your mind, you've got four lines to do this: 1, you've got the number of centuries that you're going to go to one central idea.
The ideas are complex; you have to reduce your friends so you can focus on one idea and the only one, which is important to you, and give yourself an opportunity to explain this one thing as you need.
You have to provide a context, examples, move it.
So look at one idea, and it's taken it into a remote that you're going to do with the other talk, so that everything you're going to say is going to care about.
We're going to take your audience a reason for the rich.
You're going to start building things in their brains, you've got to get their partners to go there.
And what's the main event for this?
Science.
I woke up the curiosity of the audience.
They used curiosity and intervention questions to recognize what doesn't make sense and the explanation.
If you're able to push a tremendous view of someone's world, it's going to feel like a bridge on this tree.
And you've got to need it, you'll have much easier to start in your idea.
Three. We've built the idea that you've been afraid, on the secret of your audience already understand.
It used the power of the language to return together a concept that there are already there in your own brains -- but not in your time, it's at the same time.
They started from their production.
Many of the press to forget that many of the monkeys and the feelings that are completely repeated to their audience.
Scientists can prevent a role in the network of how everything is changing together, because they're showing the extension of the print on the idea that the magazine has already seen.
For instance, when Jenn Kenyan was hard to explain the most amazing technology called "Research," she said, "It's like the first one" we've got a rich of DNA.
"A book allows you to cut and put genetic information in a lot."
It's obvious that it's producing a moment of "Oh," when it's going to look at our brains.
So, it's important that you're going to take your talk about rapid hands, to find the parts that are just taking them.
Four, and the last end: do your idea to the kitchen.
I mean, you ask yourself, "Who is this idea?"
And I want you to do this in the states.
If the idea is only leaving you or your organization, I have to tell you that intervention, it's probably not an aerotic for a joke.
The audience will look at it in easily.
But if you believe that the idea is an object in which the power to leave someone else's life or change your investment of your time, or prevent somebody else to do something else, because then you have a very big talk of a really big talk, as it's able to make them happy and all of us.
How much do you need to know about a person before you feel comfortable to give him a loan?
Let's say you want to spend 1,000 dollars to a person who's sitting behind you.
What would you know about this person before you feel comfortable?
My mom came to the United States is India in its late 30s.
She's a doctor in Brooklyn, and many times she's left to people and forget to health care, whether they can pay unique or not.
I remember that I met her patients with the capacity of the capacity or the way, and sometimes they'd come and put it in a place for previous vulnerability.
She was happy to them, and she asked them about their families and their health.
It gave them an Israeli because it's about.
Most of us like my mother.
We'd give someone to someone we've known or we're alive.
But most of us are probably not going to go back but if we know a little bit about it.
Business companies and other financial institutions don't know us at a personal level, but they have a way to join us, and it's a way of our Israeli.
Our Israeli agencies have been created through collection and understanding of our consumer public information.
And in part, we've got a pretty simple approach to all the cases and the toilet that we need, you've got electricity to a house, or a high risk of business.
But...
There's 2.5 billion people around the world that they don't have an Israel.
This is a third of the world's population.
They don't know because they don't have their refugees -- there's no strengths in the bank, there's no history that's not a number of national insurance.
And because they don't have a fish, they don't have access to the economic products or the Israeli that can improve their lives.
You don't win them.
So we wanted to find a way to build this hormone and open the financial approach for 2.5 pounds.
So we've created an effect that's going to have an aid for them using mobile information.
There's now more than a billion telescopes in marketing markets.
And people use them in the same way like us.
They send texts to their friends, they're looking for instructions, they're getting rid of the Internet and they're even doing financial business.
Over the time, this information is released in our cell phones, and it gives a very rich picture of a person's life.
Our customers give us access to this information and we're keeping it through our interaction.
It's helping us to understand the Israeli markets of people like Jenn, in a small business in Kenya.
John Nigeria is 65, and for the next decade, it's about food in the central businesses.
She's got three boys that she'd spent a professional school, and she's also leaving her local chicken, or a sad group.
The food of Jenenn is very successful.
It's doing enough every day to make the evidence.
But it's not sure economic.
Each case is created it to the beach.
And it doesn't have any income income income to improve the way of the family.
If Jenn wants an aid, her options are limited.
It can get a loatic, but it's going to have to create a group that's possible for most of her species.
And even then, the Israeli will be too small to really have effects on her business, on average 150 dollars.
Civil boys are always a option, but with a lot of high school in 300 percent, they're an economic sense.
And because Jenson doesn't have a Western or an Iranian history, she can't go to Bank and ask a business.
But one day, the son of Johnson was told that I was convinced it to reduce the ethnic and to the location.
Jenenna was talking about how many questions in her cell phone and gave us access to some data points on her device.
And here's what we saw.
First of the bad news.
Los Nigeria has a lower savings and there's no previous history.
It's the faces that there were a red dog in a traditional bank.
But there were other points in her history that showed us a much more richer picture of her potential.
So first of all, we saw that she had a mobile phone conversation for her family in Uganda.
Well, it turns out that the data shows about four percent of repeat in people who are connected with some microbes.
We could also see that even though she was going to do a lot of the day, actually she had a pretty permanent movement, and she was at home or in her food.
And the information shows about six percent of the repeat in the customers that go in places where they spend most of them.
We could also see that she'd come up with a lot of different people over the day and she had a huge support network.
Our data shows that people communicate with more than 58 different people tend to be better hope.
In the case of John Nigeria, it's enabled with 89 different people, which shows an hour of an hour of an hour in its back.
It's just a couple of different data points that we look at them to understand the Adam Adam's value.
And after analyzing these different data points, we took the first risk and gave January Nigeria.
It's information that wasn't on a paper or any more French French.
But it proved trust.
When you look beyond the platform, we can see that people in markets are invisible and uncomfortable on the surface actually are ready and they have the ability to get back.
Our Israelis helped us provide more than 200,000 loans in Kenya in less matter.
And our strangers are over 90 percent -- by the way, they're listening to the recycling classes of traditional banks.
With something just like a Israel, we give people the power to build their future.
Our customers used their own death to create family skills, cases and investment back in their business.
They're now building economies and better communities in which more people can succeed.
For the last two years of using our product, Jenenna reduced her samples in 60 percent.
It also started two more food features, and now it's a regulation of its own.
She'd come up with a little business from a restaurant bank, because now she's got a conservative history that it comes to.
I've seen January building a week last week, and she told me how excited she was to start.
She said, "Just my son believed I could do this.
I didn't think it's for me. "
Our task now is to open the world into January and billions of people like it that they're going to be able to see them.
Thank you.
Thank you.

I've learned myself to play in Chile, I didn't take teachers on this.
I've learned to play on Canada, but the Chile just took and I started to play it, because I love it.
My mom was my inspiration.
I didn't know that she was my inspiration, because her description in music was doing a restaurant, at the school of the United States.
While she found two children, she got a lesson on on a single week, and the mom came in.
And at the end, after a few years, she's an extinction.
I'm going to be 50 years old, and that's the amount of time that took me to understand what big inspiration was.
I'm going to continue -- yes, thank you, mom.
But it's also one of the most special people I know, beyond that it's a wonderful musician.
I'd like to play something for it and also for your fathers actually.

I'm an artist, but a little bit different.
I'm not offering.
I don't know to paint.
My teacher to be written in my field that I'm dangerous.
I'm sure you don't want to see images that I wanted.
But there's something I do know to do: I know to design computers.
I know honesty.
I'm telling me that 100 years ago, people like me wouldn't exist, which wasn't be possible, art that's created with new data is a new product of our age, something that's important to see it as "very equal."
And this is true.
But there's a form of art that's already very long and it's about using science, abstract information, to create emotional states.
[Technology] Four], 2009].]
We create music already for thousands of years, right?
And if you think of the music -- lines, curiosity, curiosity and diversity -- these things are algorithms.
We've been going to open up a time and make us feel emotional.
I came to art through music.
I've learned that, and about 15 years ago, I've started to write strength that we've built the interest between sound and faith, to use a profound structure or use a sound to show something interesting that's going to be done in something that's been working on by my parents.
What you're seeing on the screen is a real time in real time by the musical structure that creates musician musicians, and it doesn't look like a wind, because the biological algorithm of the plant is a source of the music structure.
So when you know to do this, when you know to program in the country, you can create really cool things.
It's a project I've created for the movies "Sandy."
The idea really simple: You take every piece of autonomy, you'll put it into one minute, and you're going to return everyone together.
So for 75 minutes, I can show you the history of the Hollywood Valley.
And in fact, it represents the history of the privilege in the Hollywood.
On the left, you see "Chicago," right, "Chicago."
And you see that "Chicago" is a little easier to see.
Because the average need of "Camp" in the "40s," was 26 seconds, and now it was about six seconds.
It's a project that's been invented by the government of the French in the beginning of the 21st century, in the police to look at videos and find out who's playing in every video.
So I put this software into a system after one person in our culture that wouldn't have to track it like this: Britain Street.
I've lost 2,000 pounds of Britain's office and I learned my computer to site Kenya, and only French.
I can judge all her video and the software will raise the eyes, and it's kind of a button on the cases in our society.
We're full of fear of our research, but we're very careful about their lives of known.
What you see on the screen is my collaboration with an artist called Alex.
What she did was very easy to explain and describe, but it's very hard to do.
It took 72 minutes of activity in the city's face, and it's going to take them on three days, and it's in a slow of movement in New York City.
I was also there, with a photograph.
And then we've taken the process, we've made it again to 72 minutes, so it looks like it's a normal convenient when the world is released around.
At some point, I realized that I was actually creating a magical credit.
When you think about creating action, it's often thinking about things like this.
On the left, it's a Street Street.
It's a lot of the first American journalist.
And on the right is the device that's produced by John Washington, from 1996.
The machine's "France for Netroit."
When you look at this wall, you see a lot of curiosity, right?
You see a hole in the window, there's an insector there.
On the table, we've got a shock.
It's all about to show John Washington as my father's father.
Here's my device, of George Washington.
That's the one of the interview, but instead of reality, there's ants.
These are 66 words in the Olympics of John Washington, which is used more than any other president.
The word "Janualales" has curiosity and using its government.
And there's important to this where it's used more than any.
It's a decline of Jorgan and Jay, which is when I've created it.
And the way we've got here, from "Januales" in 43, "which means a lot of climate history, and you're going to give you a different structure than you've looked at a series.
These jobs provide a lesson in America's friends through the politics of leadership.
Robert Garden talked a lot about genes.
Bill Clinton talked a lot about the 20th century, they wouldn't forget, but maybe you're going to be.
In London, Janson was the first president that gave Najo to Olympic hours on TV; he opened every page in the West. "
And Richard Nigerian, or more true, his president, William Shakyer, thought a lot about using the language, and it's a lot of changed that his bus will be in his friends.
This project is made by a giant box.
It's an extinction of corruption.
And it's important to mention that they're at the right scale, so if you're going to go through six meters and you're going to read between the two black lines, you're going to see that your vision is great.
It's a device, and there's a lot of these.
There's a lot of ways to do this with data.
At the beginning, I was looking at a way to create more democratic accuracy, something that's more about my country and how it's functioning.
Over 10 years, we're going to win the United States of CO2.
We're really scared of human beings, define who's alive where people work, what language is talking at home.
And it's important, very important.
But it doesn't really tell us who we are.
It's not really a few of our windows and our ancestors.
So in 2010, I decided to do my own function.
I started looking for a data body that's used a lot of theories that was written in normal American Americans.
And it turns out that there's a body of this data that's just a wave that's going to use.
It's called "local convenience."
So in 2010, I've been invited to 21st convenient services, as a man of the Tranki man, as an Asssian man, as a woman for the Syrian Western Western Western woman, in every region in America and I've lost about 19 million components -- about 20 percent of all the population in the United States.
I've got a profound disorder.
It's going to be clear to what it is.
So I've described all of this to code areas.
And I came up with ants.
These are some prototypes from 2010 when the word "alone."
If you turn it into a map, and you imagine that the colors in the skin represents a lot of using the word, you can see that the possibilities are a pretty single place.
You can also see -- in Burka is not fun.
[Here's the map of Science. What you're seeing here -- [] You see that women in Alexanda should create with men in New York City and do life.
I've come here to a pretty low motions, so I can tell you that the men in the Egypt's country's country's reference is much more interested in getting men in the Western Western Western IV.
It's going to be your most important lesson from all the planes.
You remember this fact for 30 years.
So I'm going to make you. When you go to the cartoonist level, you can take a chicken and do what I've done with the dead tests.
Instead of every city in the United States, you can put the word in which you use more than any other place.
It looks completely sense.
Here's the words "beautiful," "" in a heart choice, "" "" The "is," Nigeria. "
We're going to be there in the causes and years.
And just over that, you can see the word "Dad."
It's a randomer in Washington, the method of a microbes.
Some of the victims of them: Los Angeles is "San" and San Francisco "is" San Francisco. "
Some of them are a little bit more nervous.
In Boston, Rajames talk about "The" Turkey, "in New Orleans," still talk about the phone.
In America, people still say they're "interesting."
Basically, in Maland, they say they're scared.
This is New Jersey.
I grew up somewhere between "Life". "
Laughter) And in New York City, the word "is" right now, "as" I'm working as a village, but I'm actually a player. "
["or" Now I'm going to expect to be focused on New York City, but I'm actually an artist. "
If you continue to get rid, you see, "dinosaurs," it's a cartoon.
The best food in Nigeria in New York City.
It's in the middle of the Burko's house because the cancer called "dinosaurs on the left."
There's someone to discover.
I live somewhere between "without conditions" to "the summer," in the heart of Ministan.
It's a North Brooklyn, so you've got "Chris," "" "More," "" and "" and "organic."
So maybe it's a more democratic device, right?
The idea was to look at what would happen if we're here in red and blue and blue by what's going to do in a third event.
It's a self-device.
He's based on my email, about 500,000 pounds of DEA that were sent for 20 years.
You can think about it as a series of "sacrifice."
I'm scared of physics on my personal data.
It's described everyone I wrote with.
It started in the center and spread as a big tree.
And they all work out of a kind of road rock on the amount of email with them, with who they wrote.
And it's also about innovation. If I say, "I love you," There's a more spider person.
And it's going to go to my email's dream, in the center, which is a role of a service in the system.
And all of the violence is in the hand.
Sometimes I'm doing this piece with real time data, to prove a certain problem in a certain city.
It's a kind of autonomous and a P-P-P-P-P-Prime that's used in the French Brothers of New Orleans about two years ago, on the day of love, a force of power on a different place.
These are my symbols.
It's the house in which the old event.
This project took a little bit of engineering.
I've been looking at a horizontal chain for the atmosphere that was affected in the case of a computer.
The computer and the neutral is built in the box.
It's the wind that's going to go from a hot to the wall, to print a dog.
And the computer that's connected to the network of New Orleans.
So with all of the interpretation in New Orleans...
It's a scanner, not a real career.
There's a big light, a lot of noise, and most importantly -- a therapy.
In New Orleans, there's about five pounds on the day. So for the four months since this piece of piece, this box is full of words.
You know it. It's "The data". "
When you do it right, it's a eyes.
When you do it untrue, it's hiding the senses.
It becomes humans for books.
So go.
Second piece.
In the last summer, I was an artist of the house of Times Times.
And Mr. Times in New York is in the World War.
And one of the things that you don't know about, it's the site that's in the world's largest Internet.
About every five seconds someone did "Star Times.
It's about 9,000 a day, and everybody's home.
And here's some of them, when the eyes are exposed.
Each culture is used in a lot of technology that's going to do with art.
And then the artist's artist is to move questions about this technology's meaning and how it's driving our culture.
So think about it: We're more than numbers.
We humans, and we have dreams and ideas.
And our hormones to reduce data from us.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Hello.
This is my first goal, for the first time in my life, I'm in the outside of this blueprint.
I'm so happy to be here.
So I've always been going to be a pilot, to make a airplane, feel free to fly in the sky, to touch the sky.
But it didn't happen.
Just: I'm living in this, and there's no name that's an airport.
All of the boundaries are scared, from all the side.
We're living in one of the biggest instruments in the world.
The only thing I can do is look at two.
In some days we have lucky if we have electricity for four or five hours.
When it's a morning, we're going to take a restaurant in the front of the house or on the roof.
Sometimes we know that food.
In that, my work is to organize everything for journalists that are in my homework to tell the stories about what's happening in this.
There were many cases where I had to go to the high region to collect journalists.
If something happens to journalists, or if the journalists decide to explore a story that the government doesn't want us to study, can happen bad things.
The New Yorker in half and help journalists, creatures, new professions -- that's my job.
I believe that I've been able to create a relationship not just with new journalists, but also with the different communities that live in the right way.
These communities, not want their stories to end, I don't see them stories or numbers.
They are human beings like me.
For 10 years, I created a lot of relationship.
And you know what?
It allows me to have access to people and stories that don't have others.
In some situations, I feel that in a woman, I have more power.
A lot of men's journalists in my society want to explore the implications of drugs in half.
The problem started as it was built by this blueprint.
In the production of this, the randomly tried to people all the basic processes like food, refugees and other insects.
But it's called, because the Egyptian France has invented the fingers in the water and they don't have activity.
We've been scared there and a lot of teeth had been done.
In the Palestinian society, men can't go into my home.
So there's no journalist can get this plan.
But I could.
I've got a great girl, a wonderful girl who's going to use me despite all of the crisis that he's carrying on the society.
Now he's at home, with our two children, and I have another one that's going to grow here, inside.
If I'm working, I'm using it every two years, and it knows that if I don't hear me, it's about to communicate with my context, it's that allows me to read the crisis, a person that I'm sorry about.
In one of the surprises, in this time, in the hands of the British journalist, Allan Jankton, I was asked by a American woman's feeding a meeting in this with the floors, and I was able to do it.
The journalist who tried the case and I was asked to meet out of his window.
They've been in the door, they've collected us in a hot slide with a happy windows, they're going to spend a screen.
And they've done us from the game, to invest that.
They took us the mobile phones and made the interview with the wall out of the tree, at the same time.
At that day, I was so old, it was a day that I wouldn't forget.
So, why do I do this?
Because I believe that if I wouldn't do it, there's an enormous part of it.
I can tell you other stories about East.
And they're not all bad.
I love East, although we've come from the president -- luck, Amazon -- but there's life.
There's water, and there's amazing people and fake people.
We've got a great music and BC music.
We've got a radical radiation that most of them are in their homes.
And it's also the only place in the Arab world where Muslims and living in a good hope.
Thank you very much for war, I'm most difficult to leave my house early morning, to leave my children.
I invite them every day because I don't know if I'm going to go back to them.
It's hard and it's dangerous to be an extinction and interpretation in that.
But when I hear the stem and the bombs, I'm going to be right there, because I want to be first there, because these stories are going to tell you.
When my husband were small and we heard the sound of the war, I told them the question of magic.
Today they grew up and they already understand.
I have organisms because of all I had had had been at the time of war, especially those little animals of small children.
I'm still remember a little girl, who's these guys.
It's the only one that survived from her family.
You're going to win the skin.
I'll never forget it.
I'm going to stand here and answer today with you.
I'm going to tell my story, the nervous and the plants, stories about the small piece of the world, it's right.
I'm going to be the first magazine that works in this.
And the invention is that in this, I call me "Edn Ray Rambo."
And I hope one day I'm going to have to tell my story all the women's story, all of the wonderful women I know in a half.
I hope one day I can help other women in the country to be excited, like me.
And sometimes, of course, I feel that I can't do that, which is too much for me.
But I remember these words: "Don't get your challenges; I'm going to make your boundaries.
"Don't take others to stand with you and your dream."
Thank you.
Thank you.
Do we do what it requires to deal with climate change?
I'm going to go to this question not as a green, in fact, I'm a mindset that I'm going to think about return.
I'm going to get it as a professionals of financial decisions and when you think about how history will jump us.
One day, this vote, which was my grandfather's grandfather, go to my daughter, Charlie.
And I'm wondering what his generation and maybe it's after, think about two times of life that trick has been done.
My grandfather was a coal.
In his day, a fabric of fossil refugees for energy and the economy was a local thing.
Today we know that it's not because of the greenhouse gas that carbon creates.
But today, I'm afraid that I'm working on a remote sentence because of the effect on climate -- even from the industrial industry worked on me.
I'm obviously working in the industrial industry, who's reminded in the crisis of 2008 -- a crisis that's recorded attention and the government that I've spent some very important conversations until, like the conversation that's going to have a climate interpretation in Center, in 2009, to bring 100 billion dollars a year to help
It's about this conversation already has a conservation.
And that's a real problem, because it's the crisis to the energy that's going to happen faster as possible.
First of all, because genomes are released in the atmosphere for decades.
And Second, if economics opened up its electrical network on fossil fuels, there will be a lot more expensive to change this in the future.
So in terms of climate, the history of history is probably that the building crisis has happened exactly in the right time.
But the story doesn't have to be a code.
Three years ago, I argued that governments can use the tools that were affected to the financial system to solve other global challenges.
And they're the same mechanisms that's powerful with time and we don't work.
What are those tools? Here's a short memory.
When the French of the Pennestinian crisis in 2008, the central banks of the United States and Britain began to buy the street states that they created their governments in the policy that was known as an artist. "
By what would happen to these streets in the middle of the president, it's another one to print money.
And they've been reduced, and more about how.
The United States alone has created a value of four trillion dollars in its nature.
It's not going to be done in fact.
In the Arab action of the idea, 188 states that reduce the international nature of their 250 billion dollars in their fingerprints -- the extension of reduction -- to define the streets around the world.
When the Pennestinian crisis went to Europe, the president of the Iranian Bank, Morai, the promising "to do everything that requires."
And they did.
The bank of Japan came back on these words -- exactly the same culture -- to do "everything that requires" to fix their economy.
In the two cases, "Everything you need" means a trillion trillion dollars as a 3D policy that's used today.
What it's proposed is that some global challenges are able to operate together and meetings, and you're going to take risks of emotions like the printing of money.
So let's go back to the original question: Can we print money into a clinical trust?
Three years ago, the idea of using this is actually a very nice collection.
When you take the idea that money is limited, governments may be rapidly exposed by their colleagues to print more and more money to other traits: education, health, safe -- even for security.
And there's a few really terrible examples of the printing of money -- the printing of invisible money -- which has led to intuition.
Remember in the Public and Watch in 1930s, in Egypt, recently, in 2008, when the basic products like fighting every day.
But all of these things are driving the public conversation, so that the printing of money for the cloud today in the financial media and even in some political diversity.
But it's important that power wouldn't be saved in the subject of an international print.
Because climate change is a common world, there's some really convinced reasons for this that we have to print from international nature like this that the international nature of nature, to say that.
The general privilege is the electronic account of the international nature where governments use governments to transform them.
Think about it as a network of participants between peers, like the bicycin, but between governments.
And it's really global.
For every single one of 188 companies in the international nature of the international nature, they're going to have a special tasks as part of their strengths.
It's about the international asteroid that the countries are being used to predict because of a metaphor.
And this global option is the reason that the financial crisis, in 2009, the international natural natural natural nature represents 250 billion dollars -- because it's a global cooperation that's built on all the states, big, big and small, in one.
But -- here's the original part.
More than a half of those right rights has been reduced in 2009 -- about 250 billion dollars -- we've become a marketplace in the United States that they've got to do in these metaphors from the outside, because they've got a magnitude cortex.
So the same streets of presidents that were exposed in 2009, eventually, in terms of states, they didn't have a real need.
And they're left without using today.
So here's an idea.
As a first step, why don't we start to get them out, use the previous rights that were killed in 2009, on the struggle of climate change?
You can, for example, to use them to predict a street of the CO2 of the United States.
Kenn called in 2009, in the climate conference of Chican.
It's about collecting money to developing countries in order to put out there from climate features.
It was one of the most successful principles, and it came almost 10 billion dollars.
But if we're used to use the regular rights rights that's been exposed, it's going to help governments go back to code, and look at a 100 billion dollars a year that the Pennestinian Revolution has been reduced.
It can also -- it can also be used as a look at the table.
If the Industrial results of this use of regulation rights will be sophisticated, you can be able to succeed that other wonderful rights, every five years, again, within a statement of marketplace that's strength of markets and preserve the parts of the green news to the ocean.
There's some solutions to print international money as it's on the national level.
First of all, it's very easy to argue that we've made money to the musical climate change for everyone.
There's no social sector that's here from the printing of the print more than others.
It's about the problem of deforestation.
And it's also fair to say that the signals that require so many countries to reduce the money's rights, it's very unlikely that the printing of money will be spread.
What you're going to finally get is collective and global cooperation -- and it's a global action -- that's the best of the world.
In addition, as we've learned the printing of the money, you can spread every fish through rules.
For instance, you can define the users of the finish rights, so that this international nature will never be on five percent of the global sector.
It's important, because it's going to make, let's say in the discovery, the extended fish that can get rid in the United States because the threat of the reverse rights on the D.C..
And in fact, I think, the only thing that the general rights is made out of the blueprint in this restaurant is the chicken, "green."
Because even with this sector, the international nature is going to be used in its wonderful cases -- the mammogram of special rights in 2009 -- to reduce 200 billion dollars in special rights in 2014.
So in the effective way, states could create a unique rights of about 300 billion dollars to the climate nation.
It's 30 times more than it's going to happen today.
And you know, as it sounds amazing, it's just starting to look like, "All you need."
And just give a idea of the amazing things that you can do in this collection, think about it: in 2009, it's terrible to Brazil billion dollars from its citizens if it's going to make the goals in the forests.
Since then, this plan has been reduced by 70 percent in healthcare in the last decade.
It's a 3.2 billion tons of carbon emissions: it's worth reducing all the American cars for three years.
So what can we do with a 300 more chemicals like this, of a metaphor, that we've organized in a global scale?
We're able to lose cars on the road for a whole generation.
So, let's not deal with small, and ask if we can train climate change.
The real question is: Do we care enough of the next generations to take those risks that we've taken for the financial system?
After all, we were able to do this, we really did it and we still do it.
We're happy, we've got to do "All you need."
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's interesting fact, because in the United States, it's the most meaningful medical treatment that's going to treat blood disease and selective or public care.
There's no place for equality.
In Africa, in which it's a motivated motor, there's an extinction.
And this situation can't be right. We need to do something about it.
It's a healthy form of Obama that's going to evolve with the same academic.
17 million people die every year of heart disease.
Three million pounds of heart and reasons that are happening.
Most of them are happening in developing countries, and some of the Arabic in Africa.
85 percent of the world's global warming of heart disease and blood disease is in developing countries -- not in cultural -- and yet, 90 percent of the resources are in the West.
Who is at risk? People like you.
It's not just the African that should be worried about it.
All of Africa's hands, for some reason to be in Africa at some point in time, we need to be worried about this lucky situation.
Did someone in the audience wonder what would happen if you go back to a way in the evening, and you start to feel like a pain in, a task, right?
You're going to get attention. What are you going to do?
Would you take back to the United States, to Germany, to Europe?
No, you're going to die. 50 percent of the people are going to be in 24 hours without treatment.
This is what happens.
In a look at the United States -- this graph here, 10 million on this side, 10 million million on this side.
When you get to 50, you don't get almost people in Nigeria -- life expectancy is 47 years.
Not because some people don't survive the death disease -- they survive -- but they don't get in life after the age of 45 to the hour -- 50.
And these are the farmers where they're in their perception.
These are the farmers where they're going to make a difference of Africa, but they're not there.
The best way to move into the poverty of the poverty is to kill the parents.
If you can't ensure the families of the parents, you can't get most of the African child.
What is the risk?
It's known. I'm not going to spend a long time on these.
These are, just there's a demand: a blood pressure, a concept, a concept, an invisible activity.
Here's 30 percent of people suffer from blood pressure.
20 percent get to treatment.
It's just less than one percent of them get to the treatment.
If we can treat only blood pressure in Africa, we're going to have 250 thousand people every year.
It's quite significant! It's easy to treatment.
In eight years, we're talking about AIDS, malaria, everything's good and here.
We can't go back on the mistakes we've done in treatment for malaria and AIDS.
In a short eight years, diseases don't want to be the modern reasons in Africa.
It's a thing to remember. We can't deal with it, with situations like this.
It's a typical African hospital. We can't trust the alone -- they're going to the United States, to Germany, to Britain for treatment.
You couldn't make a restaurant alone.
It's the situation -- countries are going to face face.
After 11 in September, the United States had to deal with many problems, faced.
So, they're spending their money in trying to fix these problems.
You couldn't do a crowd -- it's not their responsibility. It's my responsibility. I have to treat my experiences.
If they help, what's good! But I don't expect it.
These mysteries of medical care or medical studies in Africa require a network, and we can't continue to act in a way that we're always going.
If those don't happen, we need to look for windows.
I'm here to tell you about solutions.
It was -- what was a symbol not easy for some of us.
A few years ago, we started thinking about it.
Everybody knows the problem. Nobody knows what the solutions are.
We decided we had to invest money instead of just talking.
They're all ready to make money, in terms of help in the collection of developing countries.
When you talk about sustainable investment -- no one is interested.
You can't raise money.
I had businesses in the health care in the healthcare countries -- I'm living in Sweden, Tennesia, the medicine of America.
It's very easy to raise money for medical care.
But if you start to tell them, you know, we're going to try to do it in Nigeria -- everybody's saving.
It's completely not right. These are you in the audience here, if you want to help Africa, you've got money in developing developing -- sustainable.
Let me lead you in the end of a day of the heart machine, so you get a idea of what we do, and I'll talk a little bit more about it.
What we've done is to show that health care care in high quality, and it's about the best equality everywhere in the world, you'll be able to move around a country's environment.
We've got 25 doctors now -- everybody's gone from the restaurant, my husband in the United States, Canada or Britain.
We've got every treatment that can give up and go down, California -- anywhere in the United States -- and we're doing it 10 percent of the cost that you're going to have to do these things in the United States.
[Applause] Like, we have policies that don't sit out of their own.] []]]]]]]]] You can pay.
We treat everyone.
If you have one dollars, two dollars -- it doesn't matter.
And I tell you how we can do that.
We're sure we're looking at our side right.
We're looking at mortality. We're looking at mortality. We're looking at mortality, and we don't take things that don't get rid of time.
We're put on the train, and we're sure that this process is new.
In the mirror, we're all going to go out, but the problems will be done, if there's no people to get out of the universe that we've made.
We and make us make a number of things ourselves.
We don't buy a bias of an active medicine.
We get the dogs from companies.
We're making them ourselves, instead.
So, for medical care in Canada in the United States -- where you're going to make a 250 dollars -- when we're trying to create it instead, we're going to get a half dollars to the top.
So we're cities that the only way to bridge the forest between the rich countries is through education and technology.
All of these problems that we're talking about -- if we're going to open up, they're all going to go.
Technology is an enormous piece. How do we make it work?
It's already profound: self-esteeming costs.
It represents the opportunities in the rural centuries, and we can use experts in a very conventional way.
It's the way our consumers are directed.
We've now got three Egypt in the sea, and we're planning the fourth.
And we decided now to go into Africa.
We're taking the West II machine in France, Nigeria. It's going to start in the next few months. We're hoping to open in 2009.
And we're getting other centuries.
You can adopt this model for a disease.
All the only points, all the centuries, they're connected through a central chain, and all of the images are designed to have a rich and diversity.
And we've designed this solution of medical medicine. It's our professor, and we're happy to share what we've learned with each one that's interesting to do it. You can still be sophisticated.
We're aware that the platform for medicine is a metaphor that has access to modern experts everywhere in the world, just by looking at a button.
I'm going to lead you in the process, to see how it happens.
It's in the heart of the heart. The doctors can connect anywhere.
I can communicate to you in a switch and say, "You've heard, the conference for our system.
The look at Jonas. You'll go for the research, I'm going to have what you think. "
They'll give me this information, and we'll improve the treatment of a patient.
The patient doesn't have to avoid.
He doesn't have to experience the restaurant is uncomfortable with limited experts.
We can also use the system of electronic medicine.
I'm glad to say that the things that's convenient -- not there's 80 percent of the French in the United States, and yet technology is there.
But, you know, they have the virus.
Because if you can't get it in Sweden, you can go to the Mexico's office, a couple of hours a hour, and get it. If you can't get it in Baland, you can't move to Science. We don't have that. So we have to make it happen.
When we do it, we'll take care of treatment.
And we're going to expand it into the rural, and we're going to make it possible.
And everybody will get the treatment that they're dead.
It can't only be technology, we're aware of it.
It needs to be part of the solution -- we're going to say it.
But, you know, you have to say to people what can be done.
It's impossible to say people to do what's going to be expensive and they're going to go home and can't do it.
They're going to be in life, they've got to get a gun.
We're spending on the transparency as the effective thing, the simplicity and the highest thing to do.
We've got too far a year -- every month from a tree, zero.
We're treating people into groups and give them to take their challenges.
The group that's focused on the highest weight, we give them prices.
The groups that work more than a decade with a summer summer, we give them rules. We're doing it in a way.
We encourage them to bring children.
In this way, we're afraid the kids at a very early age, to these issues, because once they learn it, they're going to be asked with it. It's made a choice of 100 places at least to accumulate in Jamia just, and these are doctors who are expertise and so on.
We've got the most sophisticated people who could die, including four dozens of heart patients with a restaurant, to those who are in biology, a remote for a significantly significant and certainly.
If you don't get this heart rate, you're going to.
So we want this.
It's not directly, we've been conducted for the NGA five million dollars from people who were going to travel to my mom or Taland for treatment.
And we hope we've made a lot of human life.
By the end of this year, we're more likely to make more than a million dollars for treatment and attitude. In the first four months, it was 340 thousand dollars, on average 85 dollars a month. The government doesn't do it, because they have a rich.
It has to invest resources instead. But we can still do it.
People ask, "How can you do that?"
And so we're doing this. At least four degrees of Jamia Jamia who were on the way to my mom for treatment, India themselves they didn't go to my mother, in the heart of the muscles.
And if they go to my mom, they're going to save more money -- eight to 10 times more, and they're afraid to get money at home, you'll give it a quality of treatment.
And for all of this money, for every patient, we have an opportunity to treat four people at least they don't have the ability to pay.
And so it's going to work, this progress has to be sustainable.
So, we're talking about the need.
We've been focused on more. We've created connections with university to technology, Jamia, where I've now got access.
And we're starting a plan of medical engineering, so we're going to think that we're going to appreciate people in a way, that can fix the code.
It's not going to have to deal with the innovation.
We're also starting a traffic plan for medical care -- that a device of people in the academic, in a heart of heart, things like this. Now, with this kind of training, it's a privilege in people.
Because now they're going to have to get out of a medical test and all these issues, in the process, I just want you to explain to ways themselves, what would mean for them.
[]]]]]] Dr. John Ting: My name is John Ting.
I'm in a pocket in the restaurant in the Francisco at the University of India's university.
I've come to the heart of the heart of 2006, as part of my Islamic school in the restaurant and an anxiety plan.
I spent three months in the heart risk.
I wouldn't be in my colleagues in the way that I've been working here, and I think there's a magazine now -- especially in the academic and using our action.
Sollin Los: I'm an academic platform in the heart of the Cambridge, during the last two years.
I think that the view of the restaurant in biology that the heart of the muscles brought to Jamia is very important in ways of security diseases.
Art Mary: The lesson is that it can be done, and it can exist, and you can enable it to everyone.
Who we're afraid that poor people can't wait for the best treatment?
When is a music to play the role of God?
It's not my decision. My job is to make sure that every person will get in an opportunity, and no matter what the wheel that's coming to you, to get the highest medical treatment in his life.
The next step is the Western African heart, which we're going to do in the Resert France, Nigeria, as I said before. We're getting more centuries around the West Africa.
We're looking at the same system for others, like this treatment.
And everyone who's interesting to do this in any situation of medical care, we're going to help him and tell him how we did it, and how it can do it. If we're going to change the medical care in Africa.
Africa was good for us; we were going to get our good back to Africa.
I'm going to go. Who wants to come, I invite it to come with me.
Thank you.
Thank you.
For the next 16 minutes, I'm going to take you on a journey that is probably the largest dream of humanity: understand the code of life.
So for me, it all started a lot of years ago, when I met the first 3D printer.
The idea was fascinating.
A 3D printer needs three elements: a little bit of information, some energy material, a certain energy, and it can create any object that wasn't there before.
I was in physics, I went back home and I realized I was actually always a 3D printer.
And everyone knows.
It was my mom.
So my mom gets three elements: a little bit of information, which is between my father and my mom in this case, the elements of water and energy in the same media, it's food. And after a few months, represents me.
And I wasn't there before.
So from my mom's mom who's a 3D printer, I'm imagine I'm talking about it. The first one, the data.
What's the amount of information that's going to build and represent a person?
Is it a lot? Is it a little bit?
How many listeners you can't be?
Well, I've learned physics at the beginning and I took an artist in the summer of a huge person.
So imagine the building loans are small atoms and there's an artist here, fear here, a penguin here.
So in Obamin the first summer, if I can put the number of atoms that are made of a person, I can build it.
Now, you can push some numbers and it's going to be a pretty amazing number.
So the number of atoms, the summer I'm going to be in the cloud for a small baby, is actually full of a whole Titanic mechanisms, a thousand feet.
It's a lifestyle.
Every time, from the lab and the sister, you see a president in pregnancy, it's fascinating the biggest data that you've ever got.
You're going to take the many data, you've been able to take everything you've heard about.
It's the biggest amount of data that's there.
But nature, luckily, much more smart than a young physicist, and four billion years, has been able to move this information in a small boat that we call DNA.
We've met him for the first time in 1950 when Richard Franklin, an amazing scientific scientist, a woman, looking at it.
But it took us more than 40 years to perceive in a human cell, to get this road, to move it, and read it for the first time.
The code is affected as just four letters: A, T, C, MG.
And to build a person needs three billion of them.
Three billion.
How many are they three billion?
It doesn't really look like a number of sense, right?
So I thought about how I could explain myself better and a bank is this code.
But there's -- I mean, I'm going to have a little bit of help, and the most important person to help me show the code is actually the first person who's going to want this sequence, Dr. King and Twitter.
So in the next blog alone Dr. Kong and Twitter.
[Not the man itself, but for the first time in history, it's the president of a particular person, who's based on a slide of a page, another reality: 26,000 pounds of information, 450 pounds, who've been sent from the United States to the United States in Bank, L.co.com, a company, did everything.
It was an amazing driver.
But it's the visual piece of what it's the code of life.
And now, for the first time, I can do something from that.
I can actually tackle it and read.
So let me take a interesting book -- like this.
I've got a poem; it's a pretty big book.
So just so you can see what the code of life is.
About thousands of thousands and thousands and millions of letters.
And they probably make sense.
Let's go to some part.
Let me show you it.
You're sounds like Iraq signals, but it's going to give the eyes color to the career.
I'm going to show you another part of the book.
It's actually a little bit more complicated.
Schicken 14, in the book 132: Laughter) As you could expect.
"ATT, CTT, GATT."
This person is lucky, because if you just take two letters in this universe -- two letters out of our next three -- it would be a virus for an Iranian disease: Stigas Ford Ford.
We don't have a solution to this, we don't know to take it, and just two letters from what we've got.
A great book, a huge book that helped me understand and show you something pretty amazing.
Every one of you -- what makes me, me and you are, you -- just five million of them, half a book.
In the rest of the rest, we're all completely identical.
Five centuries are the life that you are.
The rest, we all share.
So think about it again when we think we're different.
This is the amount that we share.
So now when I got your attention, the next question is: How do I call it?
How do I find it a sense?
Well, how much you can be good at the Sweden Council, this hormones in life you can't forget.
And so, in 2014, two metaphors of chimpanzees, Paul David and Twitter himself, decided to take a new company.
"Adam Man" was born, with one task is trying to do everything we can do and learn everything that we can learn from these books, in one goal -- define the dream of personal medicine, to understand what things should be done to get better health and what they're the secrets on these books.
A amazing team, 40 data scientists, a lot more people, who are going to work with them.
The idea is actually very simple.
We're going to use technology called machine learning.
On the one hand we have genes -- thousands of them.
On the other side, we've collected the largest data from human beings: monkeys, 3D, a 3D cat -- everything you can think about.
In the face there, on these two hormones, there's a secret secret.
And we're building a machine.
We're building a machine and we're training a good machine, not exactly one machine, a lot of machines -- trying to figure out and transform the genome in the kitchen.
What are these letters, and what do they do?
It's an approach that can be used to everything, but use it in a very complicated genome.
Deltt grew up and we wanted to build different challenges.
We started from the beginning, cooperating for everyone.
Scientists that conversations are comfortable because they're common, everyone has them.
So we started asking our questions: Can we predict response?
Can we read the books and make your height?
Well, we can actually, with five centimeters of justice.
BMI depends pretty much on your life, but we can still, we get in the summer, eight kilometers of right.
Can we predict eyes?
Yes, we can.
80 percent right.
Can we predict a skin?
We can, just 80 percent.
Can we predict age?
We can, because the more you see, the code changes during your life.
It's going on and shortly, you're losing refugees, the limits.
We call the signals and we do a model.
Now, a interesting challenge: Can we predict human beings?
It's a little bit complicated, because human fingerprint is reduced between millions of these signals.
And human flow is not a very limited object.
So we'd have to build a whole dung of this to learn and teach the machine what it's laughing, and move and switch it.
And if you feel comfortable with a machine learning, you understand what the challenge here.
Now, after 15 years, we call the first floor -- in October, we started seeing some signals.
And it was a very exciting moment.
What you see here is a subject that's in our lab.
It's an extension for us.
So we're taking a real piece of object, we're taking its complexity, because it's not all in your face -- a lot of features and metaphors come from your life.
We're creating a symmetry in the face, and we're moving our algorithms.
The results I'm showing you right now are the bottom we have out of the blood.
[]]]]]]]]]]] []]]]]]]
In those programs you're extended, left and right, right and left, and your brain wants these images to identify.
So I'm asking you to do another sensor, if you're going to be honest.
Please feel the differences, which are many.
The biggest amount of signals come from the gender, and then there's age, BMI, the ethnicity of a person.
And it's much more complicated than this artist is much more complicated.
But what you're seeing here, even in the differences, give you to understand that we're in the right field, that we're focused on.
And it's already involved in you some emotions.
It's a different subject that's produced, and it's a physicist.
In a little bit smaller, we didn't get the perfect structure, but it's still in a graph.
It's a subject that's in our lab, and it's the bottom.
So these people never looked at the trust of the machine.
These are who are called a group in the "House."
But these are people where you never believe.
We're spending everything in a scientist, you can read it.
But since we're on the stage, Chris challenged me.
I'm probably proud of myself and trying to predict someone you might recognize.
So in this test of blood -- and believe me, you don't have any idea what we had to do to have this blood right now, here in this understanding of a huge amount of biological information that we need to make a full of genome.
We just need this summer.
We took this talk, and I'm going to do it with you.
And we started working all the understanding we had.
In the blood flow, we've seen it's a male.
And the object is remember.
We've been looking at a meter and 76 kilometers.
And the object is 77 miles.
So we looked at it's 76: the object of 82.
We made it 38.
The subject is 35.
We're looking at his eyes.
It's too bad.
We're looking at the color of it.
We're almost there.
These are his face.
Now, the extension moment: the object is this person.
And I did it in the case.
I'm very specific and weird in terms of an ethical product.
In South doctors, Italians -- they're never going to die in models.
And it's special -- Ethiopia is a complex case for our model.
But there's another point.
So, one of the things that we're using a lot to know people will never write to the world in the genome.
It's our freedom, it's how I look.
I didn't have my experience in this case, but my device.
So I'm going to show you, I'm going to go, in this case, and I'm going to bring it out -- and it's not more than a pilot, not the art -- the device on the object.
And always, we get a much better sense.
So, why do we do this?
We certainly don't do it for a response or take a beautiful picture of your blood.
We do this because the same technology and the same approach, the machine learning of this code, help us understand how we're working, how your body works, how your body's fixed, how your disease is created in your body, how your cancer is growing and evolved, how drugs and whether they work on your body.
This is a huge challenge.
This is a challenge that we share with thousands of other studies around the world.
It's called personal treatment.
It's the ability to move out of statistics where you're at a point, to a personal approach, where we call all these books and we get the understanding of who you're exactly.
But it's a particularly complex challenge, because all of these books, right to the day, we just know two percent: four books of more than 55.
And it's not the subject of my conversation, because we learn more.
There are the best brains in the world on this.
The model will be more accurate.
And as we learn more, more we're going to have to deal with decisions that we've never had to deal with before life.
So we're going to move in a very infinite detail on the way our lives work.
And it's a revolution that can't be limited to science or technology.
It has to be a global conversation.
We have to start thinking about the future that we build as humanity.
We've got to be interactive with Islamic careers, with artists, with philosophers, with politicians.
Everybody is involved, because it's the future of our species.
Without fear, but with the understanding that the decisions we're going to get next year, there's the time of history forever.
Thank you.

I'm making something really ancient.
It's going to go more than any human detail, a more future of life on the planet, a more than 3D and the oceans.
It's created four billion years ago in the most early days of the sun system while the plants are still created.
It's this dung of News and Blue may not look special, but when you take it...
You can see that it's different from the Earth.
This example comes from two-dimensional senses that can only make in the external space there's a motion that's going to get really close to a look, how many degrees every million years.
It was once a lot of a much larger designer, one of millions of lions after the plants were created.
We call these objects asteroids.
asteroids are the most sophisticated and our products.
This graph shows asteroids close to the Earth that are killed around the sun, which are in love, and they're close to the planet, which looks in blue.
The differences of the Earth, the sun and the asteroids have been reduced in reality so you can see them in clear.
Scientists of scientists around the globe are looking for these objects, new products every day, spread the space that's close to the Earth.
A lot of this work is used by NASA.
I think about searching for asteroids as a huge public job project, but instead of building a quick way, we're spending the external space, to build an idea that's left for generations.
It's 156 asteroids that are close to the Earth that's only made a year.
And these are all the bad asteroids in the Earth, which at the last time there was 13,733.
Every single one of the button, a telescope and his track around the sun is fine.
Even though it's changed between astronasteroid to asteroids, the trials of most asteroids can predict for years.
And the series of some asteroids can predict exactly amazing.
For instance, scientists in the lab to make a musician extended where the asteroids would be four years from the top of 30 kilometers.
In these four years, Titus went from 8.5 billion miles.
It's just about 0.00,000 pounds.
But now, the reason I have this astronomer is because, like all the neighbors, asteroids are sometimes studied.
Laughter) Three years ago, a small asteroid spread over the city of Chabya in Russia.
This object was about 18 feet, or about the size of a dog.
It's the size of the size of the planet every 50 years.
66 million years ago, a lot of tremendous object on the planet, and it made the modern device.
75 percent of the plants and animals lost, including, unfortunately, dinosaurs.
This object was at a 10 kilometers, and 10 kilometers is about the sand of 747.
So the next time you're in the airplane, take a dream, look out and imagine so big that you're on the ground, and it's just causing the walls.
It's so space that it takes to the airplane that's going to fly out.
It's the size of the asteroid that's made in the Earth.
It was just during my life that asteroids were thinking about the head of our planet.
And then, there was an effort to discover and take these objects.
I'm lucky to be part of this effort.
I'm part of scientists who use the NASA Tescope of NASA.
Now, NEOs didn't design asteroids.
It's designed to take the Earth and look much beyond our sun system to look for the most expensive stars and the highest galaxies.
And he did it very well for the reduction of the age of seven months.
But today, six years later, he still goes.
We've changed his hand to discover and explore asteroids.
And despite it's a great robot, today it's kind of like a weird car.
The material that's used to move his sensors out of time, so we're looking at its gene from easy.
It's got a million miles on the argument, but it's still a great, and it's going to take a picture of the sky in every 11 seconds.
He took 23 images since I started talking to you.
One of the reasons NASA is so valuable is that it's seeing the two in Iranian India.
It means that instead of seeing the sun that asteroids remove, NASA sees the heat that they're popular.
It's a positive capacity because some asteroids are like carbon and can be pretty hard to identify with other telescopes.
But all of the asteroids, in the skin or the sea, you get itself for NASA.
astronomers use each other to discover and explore asteroids.
In 2010, an asteroid through the history of the show.
The community, together, came more than 90 percent of the asteroids that are larger than a kilometer -- objects that are capable of tremendous on the planet.
But the work is still not going on.
It's on a 140 feet or more likely to have a state of the size of Benney.
By now, we've just discovered 25 percent of those.
We've got to continue looking at two other asteroids close to the planet.
We're the only species that's going to figure out a pattern or build telescopes.
We know how to discover these objects.
This is our responsibility.
If we'd find a certain asteroid with a significant academic region, we can move it from the way.
In addition to the earthquake, the musicians or industries, an astronasteroid you can predict exactly and prevent.
What we need to do now is transform the space that's close to the Earth.
We have to continue looking at the sky.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I was in the third month to predict with objects when my husband and and I went to the second Atlantic.
I was 35 years old, and I think it means that we're at a high school for a child with a death.
So, Ross and I looked at the fossil death and we felt very ready.
Well, nothing could predict us to the Iranian security that we've learned to get.
The doctor explained that one of our objects, Matus, was a small tool called "Angeles."
It means that some of his brain didn't evolve well because some of his skin was uncomfortable.
Your babies with this diagnosis usually die in the skin or in a few minutes or days from the night.
But the other speech, Paul, looks healthy until the doctor could say and the two objects were the same, genetic.
So after a lot of questions about how this thing could actually happen to one of the possibilities was paralyzed and despite that the process wasn't impossible, it's usually in risks for me and for the healthy speech so we decided to continue with the price.
So, I'm in the third month to predict, two thirds of the street before, and I'd have to find a way to visit my mom and jump.
It felt like I had a partner to the room that would have a argument to you for six months.
But I was deal with this, for a long time, I saw light at the top of the Kenya.
Even though there was nothing that we could do to prevent the tragedy, I wanted to find a way to make it that the creatures of the aircraft would be a positive effect.
So I asked the sisters of organisms, eyes and graphic.
She got me with the organization of the local artist organization of Washington's communities.
And they'd explain to me, who's going to be too small at night to make organs change, and I've been the thing: I didn't know you can't get this thing.
But they said it would be good for a drug for the study.
It helped me see the airplane in a new light.
Basically, I started seeing it as an opportunity to solve medicine.
In 23, 2010, the two atoms were born, both of them were born.
And as the doctor said, to the left was the upper part of his skull, but he could stop, into a brown network, to click our fingers like a normal baby, and he's going to make our hands.
After six days, the airport of Ross's office, is surrounded in our family.
We've called the organization for the future of the men, and he's sent to us home, and he'd put it into the National Central Center for children.
A few hours later, they called us and said that the surgery went through the success, and the chimps of Times will go to four different places.
His natural blood will go to the University of right.
He's going to go to the treatment of the genes called a student in Detroit.
His policies will go to the Central Science Research, which is part of the school to the University of Harvard, and his creativity will go to the University of Francisco.
A few days later, we did the satellite with the next family, including the baby's baby.
But sometimes I found myself wondering, what happens now?
What's studies learn?
Is it going to be equally equal?
The Central Center invited me and treatment, and we've met together with about 15 others's families, who're going to put their own friends's friends into organs.
Some of them even received some of the people who got the men, who were taught.
I've learned that they could even meet each other, if they're both going to be on a very, just like in the moon.
And I was so excited, I thought maybe I could write a letter, or get a letter, and learn what happened.
But I'd like to find out that this process only exists for people who are participation for organisms.
So I got out, I had a kind of "Chicap changed," I'm sorry.
But over the years, I've learned a lot more about organisms, and I've even started working in the field.
And I had an idea.
I wrote a letter that started in this: "Research is expensive."
I realized who I was, and I asked if they could tell me, why they asked a baby's infrastructure, in 2010, and I asked if my family could visit their lab.
I sent an email to the eye of the eyes, which is not killing the distance, the eyes of Iraq, and I asked if they could reduce the right person.
They said they've never done it for me, and they can't make sure you'll have a answer, but they wouldn't be the training in the way, and they're going to get it on.
Twenty days later, I got a career from Central Kenyan, at the University of Francisco.
She gave me on the corner, and she explained to me that she's a cartoonist restaurant, which is a small cancer of the retina and he's affecting children under five, and reminded us to her lab.
And then we talked about the phone, and one of the first things that she told me was that she couldn't even imagine how we felt, and the Timus gave the big ice from all, and she was grateful.
So I said, "No surprise in your research, but we don't really choose it.
We've gone to the system, and she's looking at your research. "
And I said, "And two, things are bad for children every day and if you didn't want these creativity, they're probably going to be a nation.
So it's that they've changed in your research, gave a life of a new meaning.
So, you're never going to feel about these creative use. "
And then she's going to show me a few things like this.
She came up with a six years earlier to the National Science Research.
It got just one sample of a tissue that's dealing with her tricks, and it was a bus.
So, we've been going to give me to go to the visit in the lab, and we've lost 23 in the lab, 2015, which was the personal birthday of the water.
After we've been looking at, I've sent her to email a few images of Tomas and Paul, and a few weeks later, we've got this switch in Mark.
A few months later, Ross, Kay and I went into a car and we got a journey in ways.
We met in Europe and her team, and Europe said that I told her she didn't feel a mother, which was the beginning, and she didn't know it from our perspective.
It's also the environmental environment there was a secret code.
In the same way that Netflix was called "Los Angeles" is called RES 360.
RES means a study, and 360 means that it was a number of 360 during about 10 years.
It's also a part of us with a unique document, and it was the president that sent his creativity from Washington to the physics.
This weird is like my family president for us now.
It's the same way that a decline or a documentary can be.
A long period that it's using a restaurant of MS and in his RNA to try to make one gene that causes a dolphin, and it even showed us some results that were based on RES 360.
So she took us to Chicap and she showed us the two samples that still had a lot of RES cards.
There's two small small ones that are left.
She said she's released it because she doesn't know when she's going to get more.
After that, we went to the president room and we were excited and we had a lunch together, and the lab team came up to the dream of the birthday.
It was a lab in the lab for children.
And they also offered him the illness.
And so a chance, I have two simple materials today.
One is that most of us probably don't think about a drug for the study.
I know I didn't think. I think I'm a terrible person.
But I did it.
It was a good experiment, and I'm going to get on it, and she brought to my family a lot of hope.
And the second is that if you look at human tissues and you're wondering about their own and touching a family, they wrote them a car.
They've told them that they're working on what you're working, and we've invited them to visit in the lab, because it might be more numbers for you to be a task for them.
And I'd like to ask you a good question.
If you've ever been able to get one of these babies, please tell me about it.
The other part of his family story is that at the end of what we've visited in all the four actors who've got the components of the aircraft.
And we met with amazing people who do an inspiration job.
The way I see it right now is that the device has gone to the lord, right and Japanese -- and it has a job in the patent, and it's got peers and it's got people who work with him in a sense of life.
And they need it to do their work.
And life that we've ever looked at short and not meaning to find themselves as general, there's a dozen to the Dorgeans.
And I'm just hoping my life could be such a relevant.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You probably don't get you to know, but I don't like to be in a hospital or go to a hospital.
What about you?
I'm sure many of you feel the same thing, right?
But why?
Or does it just work in life that we have to live you?
Is it the worse?
The other thing was happening?
The loud wind?
Or is it the fear of the unknown?
Well, it's all that and more.
It's often patients need to avoid long spaces to get to the most expensive hospital and access to medical care is more serious and more serious in developing areas in the United States, but also in the countries that are very low as a country.
And even in places where there's more hospital, usually the poor and the players are the ones that are coming up with medical care because they don't have a transition of transportation that's about.
And many people get sick at all, and they're collecting every medical treatment from the cost.
We see that 64 percent of the Americans are going to move forward because of the cost.
And even when you get treatment, hospital often makes us more patients.
In the courage, medical mistakes are causing the third death in the United States, always after cancer and heart disease.
I'm working in medicine over 20 years, and I see every day our hospital system is great and unrelevant.
Let me give you two examples.
Four of four beautiful doctors and five of American doctors feel sick.
In my production country, in Holland, only 17 million people live there.
In the next few years, we're going to have a 125,000 animals.
But how did we get here, to this idea of a variety of different kinds of patients together in one big structure?
Well, we need to go back to the ancient Women.
In 400 pounds of SS, there were a lot of people to go to the privilege where people could go to the security, health care.
And then over the next 2,000 years, we've seen great treatment for the industrial revolution, where we've seen the coast of hospitals as a series of hospitals as the principles of the industrial revolution, to create effective revolutions, the patients in this case, outside the hospital.
For the last century, we looked at many interesting inventions.
We realized how we could make insulin.
We've invented the heart of the heart and the magazine, and we've even got to the new age of cell therapy and genes.
But the biggest change will fix the hospital system at all.
And I believe that it's time, to make a revolution in the whole system and reduce the patients's hospital system.
I believe it's time to create a new system around medical care.
A recent studies show that 46 percent of the medical treatment in the hospital can be done in the heart of the patient.
It's a lot.
And it's particularly for those patients who are scared by chronic disease.
With that, hospitals can and have to join small treatments, more features and negotiations that are conducted in traffic treatment.
So things like Neanology, Nanderthal treatment, surgery and characteristics will still be in the hospital, at least for the most, I believe.
A few weeks ago, I met her mom was diagnosed with cancer, and she said, "Nicles, it's hard.
It's so hard, when we know it's just a few months to live.
Instead of playing with the presidents, she's now got to travel three times a week for every week to train just to get her treatment and her imaginations. "
And it's really scared for me, because we all know that a professional sister can take a person's gene in the house, right?
And if it can get its test and its treatment in the house, it can also do the things that's used in the last few months that's created.
My mom, 82 now -- without a bad eye -- she's going to go to a hospital because she's hard to design and manage the president.
So my sisters and I help her.
But there's a lot of actors that are going to get treatment and wait so long until there's a life training, and then it's going to be a brilliant treatment, the cold.
Dr. Kenki, Central Richard from the University of California, he came to a conclusion that a third of the patients over 70 and a half of the patients over 85, are coming out of the hospital in a more limited state of how we went to.
And a very exciting problem that many of the patients deal with her when they need to go to a hospital is: I can go with my personal hope in life, to be able to go with my heart?
That's our general, by the way, is it terrible?
But it's not just a matter of brains.
It's also a matter of medical emissions and costs.
My friend, Mart, recently, we've been reduced to medicine just for a small surgery, he'd have to stay in the hospital for more than two weeks, just because he's got to get a certain kind of antibiotic eyes.
So it's taken down for two weeks that's done more than Alexander's day.
It's just ridiculous.
These costs are really the beginning of the thing.
So in a lot of global economic systems, medical treatment has gone together with the National Center for the last few years.
Here we see that in the last 50 years, the medical care costs have gone in Germany from about five percent to 11 percent today.
In the United States, we saw growth from six percent more than 17 percent today.
And a big part of these costs are motivated by investment in big hospital and actions.
And these buildings are not extended, and they're reducing a system where the hospital requires to be full of the hospital can be used in effectively.
There's no one to get to the hospital with less female.
Just think about it decides, right?
And here's the thing: the treatment of my friend's home can be a two-dimensional hour in the hospital.
And there we're machines.
The hospital of the future will be in our house.
And it's already happening.
I'm going to have a global treatment in 10 percent every year.
My personal aid, I see that the philosophy and technology becomes the public care solutions.
Technology has already enabled us to do things that we've ever been thinking about the hands of the hospital.
Social tests like blood tests, in refugees, chicken, are able to win in our house.
And more and more than local devices that we see like a dog and insulin and insulin will help us in an effective way if you need an email.
And all of this technology is going to go back to more products about the situation of patients, and these insights and all of the data brings better and less medical mistakes -- remember, the third genome in the United States.
And I see it every day at work.
I'm working in Bosstics and for me, medical care at home.
We're seeing a river from the surrounding the drug to the patient's room.
A brothers exposed to it and reduce the drug in the heart of the patient.
It's so simple.
Remember my friend Art?
It's now able to get the antibiotics in its home: without a hospital of hospital, without an extended food and not the concept of antibiotics that just waves you in these hospital.
And it's more than that.
So now the actors can get their treatment, they need the press of their homes together with their hope for life.
And you don't have to travel hours on the roads just to get treatment and medicine.
In the Hollywood and Denney, we've seen the success of cancer that's carrying chemical therapy at the heart of the patient, sometimes even together with other patients.
The best birds for those patients were birds in the corner of the corner, insects and depression.
My medical care also helped them get a sense of normal and the choices in their lives, and it actually helped them forget their disease.
But my medical treatment, Nigeria -- what if I don't even have a house, if I'm Henry, or if I have a house, but there's no one who's going to take me or even open the door?
Well, here's the economy that we're in, or, as I like to call it, the Airbna's treatment.
In the Netherlands, we're seeing programs and treatment organizations between people and treatment and society and society between people who have a house for them and can provide treatment and a society for them.
My medical treatment is easier, it's easier to do, and at the top of the speed -- in these regular areas that we've talked about, but also in the situations of humanitarian crimes often, faster, faster and more likely to organize the things in the house.
My medical care can be used in rich areas, but also in complexity communities.
My medical care works in developing countries as well as in developing countries.
So I'm really a magazine to help the stories of the patients's lives through my health care care.
I'm a magazine to make it that the players will get their treatment as they need their lives, together with their friend to live.
I'm gas to make a change and help make sure that the patients and not their disease is the dead in their lives.
For me, it's the definition of medical care at home.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Technology is an phenomenon and a professional phenomenon that had different meanings in different times.
But for all of the most inspirational design was one common thing: they started in a dream.
And the more the dream is going to be the more powerful than the extinction that's going to be used to defend it.
And that's why the biggest nerves are nearly the biggest, and many of them and devastating.
So it was during history, all the way back to 300 years ago, when a 13-year-old boy became a 30-year-old country from a very small and a very, very sold country.
He's going to get a land, wealth and power through a fingerprint.
And his design skills -- how much it sounds unlikely -- there's going to be a life on the way to succeed it.
In the time, they're all the tool that's going to come up with a hand by different details.
So if you're going to wearing the objects in the face of an unsure that he could have a different boundaries of his web.
It means that they'd be less effective in the mirror and very vulnerable, in addition.
It's going to take this problem by looking at it that all the networks and the trees are powerful in the same way, so they're going to be able to return.
And so he also did with ideas, genes, corruption, muscles and any other form of weapons.
His office to his Iraq won't win the other hand, and in five years, his little government had been able to switch all of the big neighbors, the richer and her harder, and the decline of the extinction.
Now, no one, of course, didn't get his knowledge to describe a designer as a designer -- why did they do that?
And he still used design without science and intuitive and with a huge invention to get to his goals.
And so it's also done an unlikely design, and it's also not about using violence to get our attention.
It was Edward Street, the faster as the British British School, the French.
It was the gold of the sea of the sea of sea, where Fields like Tim Hota in the heart of the water.
The philosophical trade that's been killed, and Neanderthals were very participated.
And the worse details, as his death, we realized that to magic their discovery, they had to move their own nations in this way that they're going to happen right now.
So in other words, they could take a look at the prosperity without having a web, and I'm going to click victims.
So Ed Street represents himself as a regular player when you play the role of an unprecedented prison.
He's wearing fossil fuels and big colors to discover his heat.
It's a black hole, and for the reasons, that he'd put his face.
He's been looking at the slides with his whole page.
He's even an extension of his fingerprint and he'd put them in, so they've been killed in a day every time his lab was going to get rid.
And like many dogs in this period of time, it's the monitor of a Google, which is the professionals of human skin and a different objects because these components have been trained in so many centuries for hundreds of years until their meaningful means that they're going to be able to be able to recognize, even in the privacy heart and the parents: our parents &apos
So of course, all of his scientific victims came in right.
Women it so, it's easy to see what Edward Street and the Fields could show as a half a way of modern communication design, and what their little boundaries -- there's another -- why their little boundaries of the skull and the nervous objects were going to be able to buy millions of today, like the big characters behind me, but of course,
It's still a design that's been used to use more attitudes by designing in America and environmentally in the same way, the back of the 19 pounds of Nigerian Nigerian.
Her goal was to provide healthcare for everyone.
Nigerian was born in a Demotional family and pretty rich family, which started when she was volunteered to work in hospital hospitals during the war.
Once it was there, it realized quickly that more patients have come out of pollution that they're going to get there, in the extended parts and interventions, they've come out of the war.
So she opened up in a campaign in the clinics, death and more cooperated with us.
Again in in England, it's another campaign, this time for civil patients, and it's hard that they're using design principles and also on them.
A Nigerian Center, like she called, who was looking at the hospital in the next few decades, and her elements are still using today.
But until then, design looks as a tool of the industrial age.
He became a pale and a professional, but he was limited to the specific jobs and in general, there was a lot of commercial training in a place to be used by autonomous use, as France Nigerian, in Berlin and Vietnam had done.
By the 20th century, this released horse was so powerful, that the nervous ones that were looking at it that would be made out of crazy or crowdness.
Now they've got one of my heroes's heroes, to get the Najani.
He was the Indian artist and the nerve that his experiments with the effect of technology on life today was so powerful that they still invented the design of digital images that we're seeing on our phones and our screens.
He took to the radical direction of the Amazon design in Germany in 1920, and still some of his biologists to put it when he was struggling to open a new ocean in Chicago later.
The ideas of Moni were convenient, but his approach to design was too expensive, like his action to see it, like he realized it, like access, not as a profession to be a machine with time.
And most of the forest, the same thing that's going to go into an object from France through: Richard in October.
He was another total vision and an activist designer, which was completely connected to a sustainable society in the way that he thought he started talking about the importance of environmental environments in design in the 20th century.
Now, despite his efforts, he's going to kill a lot of magnitude in the exhibition and there's to admit, some of his aid academic areas, like a car that's never seen from the ground.
And yet, the Olympic chemistry, his design agencies to build a tremendous piece of tree and plastic and plastic, parts of objects, plastic forces -- almost everything that was right at the same time -- is one of the biggest components of design, and a symbol that has been revealed to many people in many cases since aid.
Now, it was the courage and the implications of radical designers like Baki and Honi who made me design.
I started my career as a new device and an explanation.
I wrote about politics, economics and companies, and I could choose to transform each of these areas.
But I chose to design, because I realized it's one of the most powerful tools that we're going to have to improve quality of life.
Thank you, my colleagues love at TED Talk.
And how much I'm going to make the fish of professional designers, who were extraordinary and professionals, I also believe that the design gets a big tool from the categories, the leading and the decline of the hormones and the devastation.
And we're living in an extraordinary moment in design, because it's time when the two president comes to each other.
Because even very advances in digital technology will allow them to operate in hundreds of grew up, and from except to interest, to go after goals and even more agriculture.
So in theory, platform in symbolic like the hormone, a giant feedback, a big social media give a larger strengths and more resources for cities, and hopefully, a more responsible response to their ideas.
Now, some of my favorite examples are in Africa, there's a new generation of amazing designers of the Internet's Internet technologies to define the dream of Netron Gates's dream of health in countries where more people now have access to cell phones than water and water.
And they're Alexander.
It's a young design engineer from a machine that the computer is going to look at France, a mobile device.
It can be used to move the white white of patients in places in rural rules.
The data is sent then on the mobile network to the hospital is very good at a hundred miles per hour to Antarctica.
And if any problem comes out by experts there, treatment is reduced.
And of course, it's offering a lot of patients from doing caregivers and many times unprecedented to these hospital, and it makes it much more likely that their reasons will actually be done.
Alexford started working on Scotch eight years ago, his last year in university.
But he couldn't convince any normal source to give him an investment to get the project.
He brought the idea to Facebook, where in the poet of the Kenyan saw it and was able to switch out of the government for him.
It's developed now not just the France, but other mobile devices to treat different situations.
And it's not alone, because there's a lot of inspiration designers and other entrepreneurs that are also extraordinary projects for themselves.
And I'm going to just look at some of them.
One is Fijin Wajan.
It's a group of doctors and designers in Kenya, who developed a technology of the Internet's Internet, as a mobile security.
So there's the Gabby from the river, which opens a new design design to enable the characteristics of our brains, without a remote in the traditional astronomers.
All of these objects and many other people expect their windows, by using their new cultures, with the characteristics of professional designers and the connection of fabric and devastation.
And it's going to all of us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
This talk is about genetics, but I'm going to start with a short story.
Twenty years ago, in biologist called Antarceli James were on the idea to create instruments that didn't move from malaria.
It was a great idea, and in a lot of complete failure.
First of all, it turns out that it's very hard to create a president for malaria.
In the end, James were able to do it for years ago, by adding some genes that didn't allow the malaria to survive in the device.
But it just created a new problem.
If there's a president to malaria, how do you make it replace all the regulations of malaria?
There were some possibilities, but a plan was, principles, grow some of the genetic innovations to release them to nature and customers that they're going to move on their genes.
The problem was that you had to release 10 times of local actions to make it happen.
So in the village that there's 10,000 people, you need to release 100,000 more.
As you're probably going to get out, the rules didn't like this approach.
Laughter) And then, in the last January, Antarceli James got a Darwin in from a biologist called Aliama.
Again said he and his student, and we've got a tremendous tool that can ensure that a certain genetic machine doesn't just go for a retirement, but it's also going to spread a huge speed.
If they were justice, it would basically stop the problem that James worked on for 20 years.
As a experience, they were reduced to the two will reduce the genome against the malaria and the new tool, the genetic motor, which has always been likely.
Finally, they did so that every person who would require the genome against the malaria wouldn't be eyes to build, as a normal, but a red eye.
It was very much for the comfort, so it could know from a piece of view of who he was who.
So they took the two congestions from the malaria and the eyes and the eyes and they put them into a three-dimensional speech that's 30-weird, and they've given them to the culture.
In two generations, they were born with 3,800 countries.
It's not the surprising part.
Here's the surprising part: If you start just with two eyes and 30 to eyes, you're mostly exposed to your eyes.
But when James evolved the baby for every 3,800 people were red eyes.
When I looked at his wife to talk about this moment, he was so excited, which was just going into the phone.
And it's because you're just a red red, just a law that it's an evolutionary in biology: the rules of a scale.
In Canada, the rules of a coffee of a cockroach that's reduced by a male's card and the baby comes half of his DNA from all the teacher.
So if our critical demand was a fire and a month, when it's the gene against the malaria, the babies need to show up in a quarter of an accident: "Oh, Ah, Oh."
But with the new genetic motor, everyone came out of a sea.
It's biological that doesn't even make it possible.
So what happened?
The first thing that happened was in 2012 of a genetic tool called "Research."
Many of you may have heard about "Research," So just says in a cave, "a book" is a tool that allows researchers to do just a lot of genetic disciplinary and speech.
He does it in a concept of a mechanism that's already there in microbes.
Basically, there's a protein that's working like numbers and you're going to take the DNA, and there's a DNA molecule that's driving the money for every part of the genome.
The result is actually a genetic device.
You can take a whole gene, get a different gene, or you can do a single reality in a gene.
And you can do it almost every species.
Well, remember I said that the genetic motors were at first two problems?
The first one: It was hard to be a president to malaria.
This problem was evolved, the doors of "Research."
But the second problem was a philosophy.
How do you make a machine spread?
This is where it's done.
Two years ago, a biologist from Robert called Kevin, wondering what would happen if we called "Research" to get not just the new gene but also the mechanism that's driving the sand.
In other words, what if's "Research" will be made out of itself?
You get a machine in a genetic movement.
And this is exactly what happened.
It's called "Research" that's created a Scott "not just the argument that the neighborhood's neighborhood's neighborhoods, but if you use it in an airport, it's also going to make an autism that new genomic genome in the next two of all of the
It's like "search and reduction" including, and in scientific institutions, it becomes a slow machine to music.
So what does that mean?
First of all, it means that we have a new tool and powerful tool, but it's also a pretty low worse.
Unfortunately, the fact that genetic motivations didn't have been particularly successful in a kind of conversation.
Usually, when we're working with organisms of organism, we're moving in its evolutionary faces.
So biologists can create motivations of fossil fingers, without feeling.
If some of them are going to take, the natural choice will take them.
What makes the genetic motion to special, powerful, is that it's not true.
If your neighborhood doesn't make a serious evolutionary, like a device that doesn't fly, there's a genetic motivation that's based on "Science" will take the change without any exception to be found in any detail in the population.
Now, it's not easy to create a genetic motor that's working so well, but James and Street think it's in our video.
The good news is that it's open to some wonderful things.
If you take a genetic motor against malaria and go to one percent of all of the humanities, the species that's going to explain the malaria, the studies that it's going to spread all the population in one year.
I mean, in one year, you can reduce the malaria.
In fact, we're still getting a few years from being able to be able to do, and yet, every day from malaria to 1,000 children.
And that number one year can be almost 0.
So also with Denney Brothern, Chicakin, won't go.
And it's going to get better.
Let's say you're going to get rid of a very popular species, for example, to reduce the Amazon of the big axis.
You've just got to release a genetic motor that causes a platform of males only.
In a number of generations, you wouldn't ask for a few generations, and the paralysis will disappear.
Audience, it means that we can buy hundreds of local species that have been reduced to the collection.
Well, these are the good news. Here's the bad news.
The genetic motivations are so effective, that even though it's obvious can change a whole species, and often, very quickly.
Angey James was based on a good speech.
He's going to grow his content in a biological, and then, used species that are not local in the United States so that even if some of them will take, they're just going to die; they wouldn't have my wife.
But it's also true that if you're an artificial agriculture with only genetic instruments, you're going to take on the big, and you're going to go back to Asia, you're going to reduce the local population of Kenyans.
And it's not very inevitable, we've given some world from wealth.
In fact, it's the reason for the problem of innovation.
And it's just about it.
Things like accident and fibers don't have any way to transform them, simple.
They're boundary boundaries and water without the top.
The other bad news is that the genetic engine may not stay limited to what we call "the goal."
And it's because "The Golden of genes," is a beautiful bone that's treated that features are sometimes killed.
When it's happening, you're going to make a little bit of the genetic motor: an artificial instrument can be able to print another kind of instrument.
It's not bad if the genetic motor is just a neighborhood, like a eyes color.
In fact, there's a good chance for this that we're going to see Google's body of very different cases in the middle future.
But it might be the disaster if the genetic motor is used to reduce the whole species.
The last amazing thing is that technology is, genetic analogy is so that a genetic motor, it's basically something that every lab in the world can do.
Every student in the first student can do it.
A little bit familiar with a slide can do it.
I imagine it sounds scary.
But it's interesting that, as a scientist I'm afraid to think that genetic moves are not so sophisticated or dangerous.
Second, because they believe that scientists will be very expensive and responsible by using them.
It's true.
But genetics also have some limits.
First of all, they're working just in the species that have a fair.
So thank you for Al, you can't expect you to exist or microbes.
Like, the properties spread just in a metaphor to a generation.
So a change or a population's strength is just a few if the same species has a faster region, like insects and maybe small insects like men or fish.
In elephants or human beings can go hundreds of years until a neighborhood will spread in a significant way.
In addition, even with "Research," It's not so easy to get a really regular neighborhood.
So let's say you want to create a fifth of sensory food products and not a series of cases, when the goal is to get in the American agriculture.
First of all, you have to discover the genes that are responsible for what the beetle wants to eat, which is to make a long and complex project.
And then you have to change these genes to change your own own behavior, and it's a more complicated and complicated process.
And it can't even succeed, because the genes that control their behavior are complicated.
So if you're waiting to choose if you're going to start a basic research program, which requires years of an academic lab and can't be able to succeed, or just jump something?
You're probably going to see you're in the other option.
It's particularly true because at least theory, you have to be pretty easy to build "The French," it's true. "
It's about the change that the first genetic engine is.
So if the results of change aren't for you, you can just release two moves that will be saved, at least in theory.
So what does this mean for us?
We can now change a whole species.
We need us?
We've made the tools?
I wouldn't say that.
But it means: First, some very smart people are now now being really smart at the end of the physical motors.
In the Bill, some other smart people work hard about making sure, like genetic events in self-esteem or such as a number of generations.
It's great.
But this technology is still a discussion.
And in the fact of the genetic motor, this idea has to be a world.
What if Kenya wanted to use this engine, and Tanzania -- not?
Who's going to take a look if you're releasing a genetic motor?
I don't have an answer to this question.
All we can do as we go, I think, it's going to talk about agencies and solutions and take responsibility for our lives.
And I'm not just going to try to use genetic motions, but also to control them.
A person has an alternative to say that the most safe possibility is to put the walls.
But it's not always true.
In the genetic motor of risks and there's a camera where, but the malaria is right now and it's going to take 1,000 people a day.
We're going to wait in the Mary of Science that's designed for other species, including living and birds.
So when you're going to hear in the next few months on genetic motors, and I'm sure you're going to hear about them, remember it.
It might be scary to do in fact, but sometimes it doesn't do anything.
Thank you.
Imagine you're a device that can jump my memories, my dreams, my ideas, and to bring them into your brain.
It would be a game technology, right?
But in fact, we're already looking at this device, and it's called the human communication system and an effective stories.
To understand how this device works, we need to look into our brain.
And we need to make the question a little bit different.
Now we need to ask how these green patterns in my brain that are able to predict solutions and my ideas go into your brains.
And we think there are two faces that allow us to communicate.
First, your brain is now going to be a physicist to the voice that I'm in your brain.
And the other one, we developed a common object that allows us to communicate.
So how do we know this?
In my lab in Frankton, we're bringing people into a MRI and we're carrying their brains while they tell us or listening to stories of the real life.
And in order to give you a idea of the concept that we use, let me play you 20 seconds from a story that we use, which is finished by a number of very familiar stories, Jim or Jersey.
[Joe]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]] &#9
The journalists call it "to invent mistakes."
And they're spending against this high crowd.
But I'm the moment I saw this border, we've been going to have a lot of strength with a map.
And I'm pretty much looking at it. "
My brothers: Okay, so now let's look into your brain and see what's going on when you listen to the stories of this kind.
And let's start by simple -- let's start from one magazine and one region in the brain: the cortex that I've come up with the voices that come from the wind.
And as you can see, in this particular region in the brain, the responses and survival as the story comes from.
Now, we can take these reactions and compare them to the response in other aspects in the same area in the brain.
And we can ask: How many responses will be similar between all the aspects?
So here you can see five features.
And we're starting to switch their brain before the story begins, when they're just stuck in your skin and waiting for a story to start.
As you can see, the region of the brain goes up and survive in each of them, but the response is very different, and not in the speech.
However, when the story starts, something amazing happens.
[Jim]: "So I get out of my story and I know it's good, and then I start doing it --" Oh, all of a sudden, you can see that the responses in all of the issues are going on on the story, and now they're very, very, very similar to all the aspects.
And in fact, it's exactly what's happening now in your brains when you listen to my voice talking.
We're called this effect, "a teenager."
And to explain to you what it's a tool, let me first explain what it's physical.
So, we'll look at five meters.
Think about the tropical crisis as five brains.
And it's like algae before the story begins, these terrorists are going to go to the switch, but they're going to get not in the speech.
And now you're going to see what's happening when I'm looking at them together by the way they're on these two pounds.
[]]]]]] Now these two categories are starting to move around.
The text of this song goes through the tree and it's going to connect all the terrorists together.
And now you're going to listen to walls.
[]]]]]]]]]]]] []]]]]]
Now let's go back to the brain and ask: What does you put this tool?
Is it just the sound that the train produces?
Or maybe these are the words.
Or maybe it's what it means to be trying to transform.
So for looking at this, we did the next experiment.
First of all, we took the story and put it back.
And it's a lot of the original political features, but it's invented what it means.
And it sounds like something like this.
[Jim]]]]]]]]]] [Jim:]]] []] &#9
And as you can see, the sound goes into a generation or they've been doing in all the brains in all the two-dimensional cortex that you've lost the sound, but it's not repeated into the brain.
Now we can take these sounds and build words with them.
So if we take Jim or January just the words, we'll get a list of words.
[Jim]]]]] []]]]] []]]]]] &#
And just... Man goes up -- in my stories -- my parents -- my parents: my parents, and you can see that these words are starting to get rid of the early language, but not more than that.
Now we can take the words and start building some of them.
[Jim]]]]]]] []]]]]]]]]] &#
He says, "Jim's expensive, a good story, nice details.
Does she didn't know about it? "
My parents: Now you can see that the response in every language that you've heard the language that's driven or become similar to all the aspects.
However, just when we use the prison story, the answer, the sense, the response gets deeper into the brain into a larger region, the capacity of the corporations, the capacity of the cortex and the cartoon, and it makes everyone to respond very similar.
And we believe that these responses in high school or become pregnant in the magazines because the meaning of the number, and not by words or sound.
And if we're right, there's a powerful piece here if I'm going to tell you that these are completely similar ideas that are used in two different words, the response of your brain is still very similar.
And Bill to look at this, we did the next experiment in my lab.
We took the story in English and reduced it to Central.
Now you've got two language systems and different products that make it happen.
And you change the story in English to English and the story in English and the story in Russians, and we can compare between their reactions between the groups.
And when we did this, we didn't see the responses that they're similar in the cortex that I've got in the language, because the language and the sounds are very different.
However, you can see that the responses in high region are still similar between the two groups.
We believe it's because they've brought the story in a very similar way, like we've made, using a test after the conventional story.
And we think that this possibility is necessary for communication.
For example, as you can understand, I'm not English when you're in.
I grew up with another language, and the same thing can be true about many of you in the audience.
And yet, we can communicate.
How?
We think we can communicate because we have the object that makes meaning.
In the time, I just talked about what's going on in the brain of the magazine, in your brain, when you feed to bees.
But what happens in the brain of the thing, in my brain, when I talk to you?
For looking at the brain of the thing, we asked the book to go into the scanner, we put his brain and then the equations of his brain responses to the brain responses of the magic aspects to the story.
You need to remember a language and make language is two very different processes.
Here we ask: How many are they similar?
We've seen that all the traditional patterns in our aspects are actually coming from the brain of the number.
So production and production is made on very similar processes.
And we've also found that the more powerful imagination between the brain that's listening to the brain, the media is better.
So I know that if you're completely scared right now, and I really hope it's not the case, your brain reactions are very different from my own.
But I also know that if you really understand me right now, then your brain -- and your brain -- and your brain is very similar to my own.
Now, let's take all the information and ask: How can we use it to transform a memory that I have from my brain to your brain?
So we did the next experiment.
We gave people to expect, for the first time in their lives, in the park of the BBC's television, "while we took their brain.
And then we asked them to go back and tell the story to another person who never looked at the movie.
So let's be specific.
Think about the extinction, which Richard came into the corner in London and the driver in it is the wind that he's looking for.
With me, as a map, there's a slide in my brain when I'm watching it.
Now, the original pattern, I can reduce my brain again by saying: Robert, London.
And while I change these words to your brains now, you need to rebuild it in your head.
In fact, we're seeing this pattern right now in your brains.
And we were very surprised to see that the pattern you have now in your brains while I describe these curiosity to be very similar to the program that I had in the movie a few months ago at the end.
It starts to tell you about the techniques that we can tell stories and transform information.
Because for example, now you're very fair and trying to figure out what I'm saying.
And I know it's not easy.
But I hope that at some point in the conversation was a click, and you got me.
And I think in a few hours, a few months, you're going to meet someone in the reason, and you'll tell him about this talk, and all of a sudden it would be like it's going to be here with us.
Now you can see how we can take this project and try to transform solutions and knowledge between people, which is great, right?
But our ability to communicate on our ability to have a common machine.
Because for example, if I'm going to use the word "British" as a train "instead of" modern, "I know I'm going to be not in the same line with you in the audience.
It's going to depend on not just our ability to understand a fundamental idea; it's also about our ability to develop a shared, and the understanding of common systems.
Because we know that in many cases, people understand the same story in very different ways.
So for looking at this in the lab, we did the next experiment.
We took a story of John Long Long, where she lost his wife in the middle of a reason, and he's interested in his best friend, and said, "Do you see my wife?"
The next day of the experimentation, we said that the woman's declined with the best friend.
The other half, we said that the woman was president and on a very rapid.
This one sentence before the story started enough to make the response of the brain's brain's response that the woman's mother's mother's woman's moves to be very similar in the highest and different parts of the other group.
And if one sentence is enough to be the brain to be similar to people who think like you and very different from people who think about different from you, think about how this effect can be limited in real life, when we're listening to the same unique hands just after we've been exposed to different communities, like the New York Times that give us very different languages of reality.
So let me summarize.
If everything worked as a Western design, I used my capacity to get a voice for represent with your brains.
And I used this pair to translate my brain patterns with my memories and my ideas into your brains.
By that, I'm starting to push the binary nervous mechanisms that we're interested in.
And we know that in the future, it will allow us to improve and manage the media.
But these studies are also afraid that communication is based on a common machine.
And we need to be very concerned as a company if we lose this common machine and the ability to talk to people that are a little bit different from us because we give a very powerful number of communities to take on the microphone, and to look at the way we all think.
And I'm not sure how to fix it because I'm just a scientist.
But maybe one way to do this is go back to the more natural way of communication, which is dialogue, where I'm not just talking to you right now, but a more natural way to talk, where I'm talking and I'm talking about, and together we're trying to get into a common and new ideas.
Because after all, the people that we're excited with are magnitude who we are.
And our prosthetic is something that's very basic that starts at a very early age.
So let me end up with an example of my private life that I think is a good example of how you invest with other people really go to the define who we are.
It's my son, yesterday, at a very early age.
Look at how it's developed a coffee game together with my wife, just from the real math and the real president of being reduced with another person.
[They] molecules []]] []] []]]]]]]]] &#
And think about how you change on a daily basis of interaction and investment with other people in your life.
So you're going to get rid with other people.
You're going to get out of your ideas, because we're all together, connected, larger than our parts.
Thank you.
Thank you.
As a concept of Tony, I'm looking at creative ways to save challenges from atheists.
I'm doing this through a painting, a video and a phenomenon.
But without a detail, two of my favorite materials are history and dialogue.
In 2007, I created "Los Angeles," Paul's France's France's France in the Street of 2.2 feet, and it's weight of 300 pounds.
In fact, the bus was a symbol of scans and of the thought and the freedom.
But it's a look at this bus extended that every budget is a spint of a fingerprint.
This Islamic transformation was taken from the British Brothers and later there was a tool in the motion of the movement to the tree of the strength.
In America, we don't like to talk about the innovations, as we don't see it as a global industry.
But using this historical basis, I hope to make history and train of the universal American community and go down and encouraging a discussion in our past.
To create "Los Angeles" we've come over 6,000 characters.
And at the next time, it led to the New York City's Center's Center's Center's Center of a 28 pounds, as an active device in the academic academic of young men, the two American students, the two groups that were affected most of this history.
These two groups are also a more profound phenomenon, but it's last one of the subject to universal.
I've collected African characteristics from training and marketing markets around the world.
They're completely convenient, but people believe they're motivated in the wind, or even magic.
I just recently discovered how to use them in my work.
[] Since 2012, the world was until the world's fingerprint of Mutin Mutin, Michael Brown, Eric Rambridge, Sannounced by Darwin, and more civil citizens who don't feel pretty excited that most of them are uncomfortable.
Without a thought of these victims and the lights that I'm even going to say, East East says, "The France of the Street," I became a goal and I've been trained in my mother and an accident by Times.
I've created this art creation, which is called "Technology."
It was important to reduce the identity of each of these characters, to make them look at identity, and more easier to get.
In order to do that, I'm going to unfortunate them in a contrast that I've taken them into a range where I've reinvited them with levers.
And it was fun, play with big walls and video cameras.
But I've done these experiences from me to push on the door, feel like I was going to be blind by myself.
Finally, my photograph, Derek, made the right.
I've just took their friends, and I've created patterns, and I've taken them first in the hope, and eventually in the country as you see in images, the secrets gave them a creative signal like a hole or a coffee.
When I looked at this work in my mom, a woman told me that a woman's whole decline in her son.
But also, in addition, it's the approach that these art service is exposed to these victims as well as other victims of growth over the American history.
But "Los Angeles" and "in if" big "from the American history.
When I put them in Berlin in Berlin, a student of philosophical philosophy asked me what was driving these natural conversations.
I've seen him a picture of Gullin '80s and I've just mentioned that these conversations are happening over 500 years.
But, just a way of these questions and a way of dialogue is full of thought in history and we can evolve as intelligence and society.
I hope my art service creates a place for this form of platform and opportunity for people to expect strengths and strength with each other.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I think about dreams, like many of you, I think about this picture.
I was eight years old when I was looking at a conference in Archiatric coming out of the space and down the wall.
I've never seen something like yes, and I've never seen anything like this.
We went to one simple reason: John Kennedy had to take a Sunday.
If you wouldn't have this concept, we'd still share the moon.
Evinstein Bennin said there are two things that are necessary for a great driver: a plan, and time that's not really enough to be the profound.
I'm going to see that Syrian and the animals are the most important and worthy of "zero."
And they're what we're going to make the meaning of "that's going to make a smell."
And our world needs political leaders that are ready to have the aid that are safe to the need for the need of fossil dreams are fine in the size of zero.
When I think about windows, I think about Los Angeles' Los Angeles and Sundney and millions of other people's launching everything that they have to go out of the moon when it was really dangerous, and this picture of the white house in the middle of the web, yes -- you know, the privilege of civil citizens, the citizens of citizens
It's a photograph that I couldn't imagine, when I was 18 years old, and I realized that I've been convenient, and I felt about my country, and my dreams, as a result.
I think about this picture of my family that I've never seen that I could have -- Applause) -- and of our kids represent this shape that I've never seen that could be a printing of the top village.
We need more courage, like a Derek Cambridge and like astronomers.
But I'd like to talk about this that we need to dream from one minute because there was something about zero that I didn't know when I was eight years old, and something about the organization of the web.
Over 30 astronomers in the programs of Marki, Jews and Apollo, only seven were left.
These Iranian images of astronomers expect space on the moon serves the atmosphere and depression on the planet.
Number Mark Mark, the Atlantic, who asked the time of Apollo's time, "What can we kill from the return to the crowd if we can't crowd the prosthetic that we've lost and ourselves?"
And what can we kill from the right to Nigerian if we can't push the series and the emotional disorders that are so often reduced to us and our father?
And it's not just about convenience.
I've seen the most popular streets, the curiosity and training in groups of looking at the United States, the IDS AIDS cancer, and active actions in no profit, everything called love.
MS also wrote about war between the Women and the "there's a form of violence that we've been reduced to in Iranians in very easily: effective and limited work.
Our action of evolution is going to train our work for peace.
It represents our inner ability to live in peace. "
We're often too much of our dreams become cells of coffee on some future that our ability to be comfortable for our lives at this moment.
Our dreams for a good life for a future humanity or an artist that is humanity in a different country represents us from the beautiful people who are sitting in the moment.
Well, it's just the price of the wall, we say.
You can get to the moon, or you can get a creative family.
And we can't predict dreams in the two species at the same time.
And we don't invent the goal beyond the streets when it comes to our emotional life.
That's why the technology to talk to each other was affected in a significant way that our ability to listen and understand each other is not going to happen at all.
Our approach to boundary information, our approach to happiness, extension.
But this idea, that our hope and our future are insects for it, that to fill our potential for the economy we need to give up our potential to our local potential, that the training states on an electricity of electricity can be familiar, but our ability to discover, and as it's definition when it's limited.
Now, I don't just offer the idea of more inspiration of life between work. "
What's going to help me spend more time with my kids at home if my thought is always in another place, while I do this?
I'm not even talking about the content.
It's been recently turned to me to improve agencies.
"Right?"
I'm talking about the capacity to dream in the same speech of the day as we share on industry and technology.
I'm talking about genetic signals that enables us to treat each other, the transition of actions, which allows us to reduce the quality and real real.
Our ability to be one with the other, our fear because with each other, they get so much of the problems that we're trying to solve, from designers in Congress in the economy.
So I mean what Jonas Sald Salk called "Turkey," a new period where we're excited and curiosity of our human development as we're about the development of our technology.
We don't have to wait from this opportunity just because we don't really understand it.
There was a time where we didn't understand the space.
Or because we're more used to technology and effective.
It's exactly the definition of being a time in the current area.
We're very comfortable now to imagine that technology are reduced through.
In 2016, the Minister of our daughter is the learning that requires our imagination.
Now, we're all here to dream, but maybe if we'll be honest, each of us is a little bit of the dreams of itself.
You know, you're looking at the red signals to see who can help me with my dream, sometimes you look at the interest of the other person.
Don't draw me right now, I have an idea that will save the world.
Right?
Laughter) Once, a lot of years ago, I had a beautiful company that made long journey to a real civil civilization.
And we had Smith: "Humanity. Canada. There's two."
And we've studied people to do experiments that's universal on rare.
Like, "You're going to help everyone with their tools."
And there were a lot of traffic.
["You're going to go to everybody's cartoons."
"You're going to help people fix the chicken in the wheel even you know that the Western button comes."
And people really changed in the experiment, so if you had a Pancher in activity about AIDS, you had a hard hard time to fix it, because so many people asked if you needed help.
For a few days, for thousands of people, we've created a world that everyone said, that's how the world would be.
What do you know that we're going to try to create a world like this in the next days?
And instead of getting to someone and ask, "What do you do?"
Do you ask, "So what are your dreams?"
Or: "What are your parents?"
You know, "Titchen."
Thank you very much, "I'd like to stay the power" or, "I want to build a tree with my child."
You know, instead of going to go to the person that everybody wants to meet, feel who's going to be alone.
I think what we're scared about is we don't have an opportunity to make our real potential, we've learned to dream and we can die without the opportunity.
Imagine life in the world where we're just recognizing this great fear, this magic, one in the other and love each other as we know that human being, it's to live with this fear.
It's time that we don't share different dimensions at the same time, and it's even beyond all the wonderful things that we can, and we need to have a place of all the wrong things that we can be.
It's time that we're going to get out of the moon and we've got dreams of it as well.
If the moon could dream, I think it was his dream for us.
It's about being you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
In the surface that you've ever got one train, we can put in a billion.
It became this that the size of a whole room now goes into your pocket.
You may say that the future is small.
As an engineer, I'm inspired by the prosperity of computers.
As a doctor, I wonder if we can use it to reduce the number of death cases in one of the diseases that spread at the worst rate on the planet: cancer.
Now when I say this, what most people hear me say is that we're working on the possibility of cancer.
And we do that.
But it turns out there's an amazing opportunity to save life through early pollution and preventing cancer.
In the world, more than two thirds of cancer's reasons, companies are completely affected by techniques that we've already got today.
Things like a vaccine, scanning in time, and of course, the sacrifice is.
But even with the tools and the best technologies we have today, some tumors can't recognize 10 years after they started to grow, when they're the size of 50 million cancer cells.
What if we had better technologies to identify some of the more small cancer cancer, earlier, when you can get them, when they just start?
Let me tell you about how the hair might help us here.
It's a microscope in a typical lab that's evolving biologists to look at tissue patterns, like biologist or a coffee.
This microscope that's 7,000 dollars will be used by someone with a special train to identify cancer cells.
It's a picture of my colleagues at the University of Dr. Richard Richard.
What she and her team did is appreciate all the microscope of 10 dollars, and he's looking at the end of a optimist.
Now what it means is that instead of taking a tumor and put it into a microscope, you can bring the microscope to the patient.
And then, instead of reminding a computer to look at the images, you can train the computer into a normal cells in a movie.
Now it's important, because of what they've found at work in rural communities, it's that even when they've got and San San San who can go out to the community and do samples and collect them into the central hospital to the central hospital, that's later, women's getting a phone with the
Half of them don't respond because they can't afford the president.
With a microscope that's used and computer surgery, clinical and her colleagues were able to create and an artist who also had the Amazon and also the treatment of treatment.
And what it means is that they can look at the table and do treatment rather than, so nobody has been lost for a decision later.
It's just one example of how the hair can save life.
Now as engineers, we think about it as a direct female.
You take a big thing and do it.
But what I told you before computers was that they changed our lives when they became a lot of enough for us to take them everywhere.
So what's the equivalent of this conference in medicine?
Well, what if you had a gene that was so small that he could move inside your body, find the tumor itself and send the right world?
It sounds a little bit like science fiction.
But in fact, we gave us a technology to do exactly this.
We've made a technology allows us to jump the parts that create the fabric of a person, which is 100 microbes, by a smaller thousand, which is 100 meters.
And it has meaningful consequences.
It turns out that the materials actually change their properties in the president scale.
You're taking a normal material like the same, and you'll put it into the struggle, we're going to take a particle of the identity, and it's changing from a red mirror.
If you take a more cool material like a NASA -- that's going to make a big hole, and a black hole -- if you take this material and you put them in the walls, and you're bringing them up, they're ridiculous.
And they get in blue, green, yellow, red, red, just depends on their size.
It's a crazy! You can imagine object like this in the Western world?
It's going to be like all of your patients's patients in your country may write, but they're in different colors depend on their size.
And so as a doctor, what's interesting to me is that it's not just the color of the material that's changed in the galaxy; the way it's moving in your body is also changing.
And it's the test where we're going to use to create better cancer.
So let me show you what I mean.
It's a blood tool in the body.
About the blood vessels has a tumor.
We're going to invite our proteins into the blood cell and expect how they're moving from the blood flow to the tumor.
Now it turns out that the blood of a lot of dolphins, and that's how we've been able to push out of the blood flow into the tumor.
Their language depends on their size.
So in this photograph, the blue proteins in the size of 100 meters, and the red proteins are about 500 meters per square meter in the blood area.
So this means that engineering, depends on how big or small we do the space, I can change the universe where it's going on in the body.
In my lab, we've recently created cancer that it's so small that it can move into the body and search for dolphins.
We've designed it to listen to dolphins: the process of chemical signals that tumors need to create to spread.
So a tumor will remove from the Kenya is born, it has to create chemicals called anthropians to eat through the spinal cord.
We've designed the proteins to be accurate by these anatoms.
One chimpanzees can activate thousands of these chemical responses in an hour.
Now in engineering, we call it one of the alphase of the gene, and it creates something that's sensitive.
So we've created an analogy of a sensitive cancer.
Okay, but how do we spend these projects into the exact world, where can I work on?
For that, we're going to use another piece of biology at the scale of autonomous scale, and it's about economics.
The rules are a film.
Their work is to summarize the blood and translate the solar to your name.
It turns out that the features also depend on the size of the size.
So in this photograph, what you can see is that everything that a small fifth of a minimum is coming from the blood, through the instruments, the rest of it, and all the rest of it is left.
Okay, so I created a cancer frozen in the size of 100 meters, I invite it to the blood region, it can push to a tumor where it's shown by anthropy to release a little bit that's small enough to be a cloud out of the bathroom, and in the same world I can recognize.
Okay, but there's another problem.
It's a small, small, tiny, so how do we recognize it?
Well, the violence is just a molecule.
They're molecules that we've designed as engineers.
They're completely relevant, and we can plan them so they're going to have our choice.
If we want to use a really sensitive tool called a meter from the box, then we create a molecule with a unique version.
Or maybe we want something that's going to get rid and mobile.
So we're creating molecules that can go on paper, like a lunch.
In fact, there's a whole world of paper tests that become species in a field called paper security.
Okay, where are we going to go with this?
What I'm going to tell you now, as a long-term, represents my dream.
I can't say it's a joke; it's a dream.
But I think we all need dreams to continue to push us forward, and maybe -- especially cancer.
I'm going to tell you what I hope to happen to my technology, that my team and I'm going to take the heart and the president to turn it into reality.
Okay, here's it.
I share one day, instead of going to go to a San Francisco, to go to a cockroach, or a mammogram, or a coffee surface, you can get an hour, wait for an hour, and do a test that's on a piece of paper.
I imagine that it could happen even without the need of a Serra Street, or a medical illusion in the room.
Perhaps they could be scared and move just by a picture in your iPhone.
Now I know it sounds a dream, but in my lab, we already have it working in men, where it works better than the techniques that exist to discovery cancer, extension and disorders.
And I hope that what it means is that one day we can identify tumors in less than 10 years after they started to grow, in any sense of life, around the world, and it's going to lead more early treatment, and that we can save more life than we can now, with early pollution.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Do I see you real?
I hope.
I don't know if you see it, but I'm just going to look forward and hope you're there.
I've seen half a wave of a dog in my heart so I'm not going to go to it and show it as if I'm just a space in the air.
Now now I'm going to go in the open air, on a tree under a tree, at the point that your stage was.
I have 12 minutes with you.
I've gone from a camp.
My wife was born once said that possibilities don't have the worst of the production.
For example, this disease: I asked her to design something that's fun might be wearing at the top of the 23.
But we only had three days to create it, and the only one that we had was that there was a different air that was left after.
But she did it, and she was perfect.
And she looked at me and she said, "You've got a convenience -- a strength needs limits."
So with these 12 minutes, I'm going to tell you about my biggest discovery.
For all my life, my passion was to make sure, as I know it was for a lot of you.
You may be happy to know that your research has changed.
I'm 318 years old.
The average life of people is 432 now, and my work was to reduce people's lives to the moment.
And I've never done one day, we're going to get to the point where we're going to be happy.
But the opposite is going to happen: as we live more time, we wanted to live more, and less we wanted to die.
Who can feed us?
The universe is so big.
We'll never get to the situation that there's no more to see.
Just yesterday, I read about how you can take a poem in Europe and remove from my wife all over the planet, and in some of the cases you can visit and play under a justice.
And there's a other hand where there's just one trick that's sitting in and play in the ocean.
And then there's others where there's no one and you've never been, and then you're going to be on the road with the foot that's going to have never been in.
You can spend 400 years in doing it.
Now the moon goes in the North East.
I can see the cities on it with unfamous eyes.
They're connected like a boss of nerves: America's boss on the road, and Richard Andrew on the equal line.
And the new text is the next one.
There I met NASA.
We've been an artist in the city.
On the day we met, we've gone through one of the other hand in the West School, and we're going to get in the walls.
And I went around to win and she didn't say peace or show itself or something said, "Well, why do you think we didn't just go one through the other?"
And I thought, "Who's the hell?"
But after that, the question proved me, because the answer is so simple.
I said, "We didn't go one way through the other, because the basic proteins have a code and because the basic space between the basic proteins are full of energy that they also have a neighborhood of Mexico, and we knew it's 800 years."
It's probably in one of the walls of the wind where she likes to deal with strangers.
Or maybe it's just a refugee with me, because she looked at me and she said, "I thought you'll hear it.
A deeper thought. "
And then she's teaching her finger, the teacher I'm wearing right now, and she said, "Our universe's built so that particles have an airport.
Without the basic limits, we would go one way through the other speed of light and even don't know. "
And so our artist started.
Albert and I've never gone from the issues to talk about.
Never.
It was amazing.
It's like we've been a heroic that's based on the rainforest consumption together and continue to get new, and these great new words were coming out of us to describe them.
And we'd forget them at the moment we've created them, and we're going to take them beyond the top and continue to talk next, and so on.
Or another time, NASA said that our conversation was like we've always created fight, and we've always left a little bit more coffee and a little bit more water, and we've got it and we've made it and we've never got to get it.
If my grandgrandmother was a wind life, the Alexander's grandfather was a moment.
She had genius to that.
The whole work goes around this.
My body was Canada for her, and she would offer with a hour on the top of so far that I couldn't feel it wrong.
And she was in Southern for the right moment where I was a prosthetic to be able to join her body's body.
Or she would have been a school and reduced her chicken in my daughter and say, "Please, why does it feel so good?"
And I would say, "I don't know!"
And she'd always had an answer that was designed for her conventional questions, but the answer I remember today is, "It feels good because the universe is in his limits, and we're his art."
It's always funny how you think the future will be in front of how it really comes.
For you, scientists thought that people could reduce themselves and wake up in the future.
And they did it -- but then they got out.
For you, scientists thought that people could replace organs and appreciate life in years.
And they did it, but they finally got it.
For you, the Earth was the only place where people were.
In my time, the Earth is where people come to die.
So when Gabby started to show signs, our friends were able to do what everyone was doing, which is to say peace and put it into the Earth, so nobody has to take a look at it or to think about it.
Her failure to continue to live.
More than all, they didn't want to be near her physical body.
They continued to treat it as "You know," even though it's been fascinated by this, the transformation that it's gone, when they've been looking at the rules of nature a day after day, it's been reduced from its extinction.
I sent NASA to the Earth.
But I came up with her.
I remember our company, just before we got, said, "I just think it's going to be beautiful, like the laws don't laugh with you, as if you think your love is so special."
But I did it.
So, even here on the planet, I went to work on how to get life.
It didn't happen to me that you could be a different response.
I went to go back to the other thing that my grandfather said to me at the same day in the Southern School, that in those basic limits -- the universe that's coming out of the material -- we wouldn't exist.
It's one laughter.
Otherwise is that all of the data is given to anthropy.
And there's no way to be in the universe without an aircraft.
I know, I tried everything.
I've tried to create a coffee box in which the gas is different.
I've tried to record all the traffic movement in my body and repeat them in the heart of Syria.
Nothing worked.
But my final invention was to create a very popular learning with the boundaries of the body when it was going to look at a particular way, but that his ice would look like in a normal time.
This body would look at our universe as a graph -- but not here.
When I realized I did this, I wanted to her room, so happy to tell her that I did, to go through the space almost normal to all the eyes, even for me, and I went to a girl, and I forgotten, and I was going to be so happy.
I've found a way to win, on one of the things that I'm going to lose the most love, which was going to go and get it.
And she gave me out.
I could still watch it.
People live 400 years now, and we still die.
And when the death comes, the presidents are still moving in their clothes, and their arms are disabled and fabric and faces, and their presidents come from each other, as if they're pregnant.
I've always thought what's going to make meaning for life is the adventure.
And death is just a problem that we haven't found her solution.
But maybe life has just meaning because they're a few days.
For me, it's the paradox: limitations don't expect, they're a spinal freedom.
[]]]]]] []]]] []]]]]]]
One more than the night, but the two days in the halls.
I can't feel a wind here, but I asked one of the techniques that's done how it feels, and she said it feels sick, like a hundred pounds.
The answer that comes to my wife.
I have to find my way back to happiness.
Unfortunately, I don't take a place out of the universe that you give me.
I'm Robert Berninka. And what I'd like to talk about today is a little bit of ideas that I think they have a regulation about all the things that's about in the last two days.
Actually, so many points of demand that's going to be hard to get all of them, but I'm going to grow. Somebody remember these?
So these are tricks and they've been scared, well.
They've gone through the last two decades by digital technologies that are used in this kind of world, yes.
And I think you've seen it the best when you're going to play the music as we've gone to the room today.
What happened in the music world is that there's a culture or a relationship that's made that if you take a few words out of the patient, the key idea that we're creating, you're doing max and you're doing.
What I'm trying to say is that everyone in a free world and give it to create a new music and musical ideas.
Everybody in the world is going to take out or make musical ideas, and use them in special forms.
Every single one is going to connect them in different ways, create lines between musical ideas and people can most of them or create final products and continue the Google.
And what it did is create, as I said, a community is very proud and very convenient in which people work without reducing musical ideas, to reinvent them and keep them on the recent things all the time.
The contrast of today is not the invention of the invention of a year, OK.
But, I'm not here to talk about music today.
I'm here to talk about books, okay.
In particular books of learning and kinds of learning types of learning where we use every day in schools.
Somebody had ever been at school?
[Okay, someone understand that there's a crisis in our schools, around the world?
I hope, okay, I'm not going to move on it a long time, but what I want to talk about is a kind of plan that comes up with a book.
In fact, the concept of light -- just because it's complicated, it's rich, books are expensive -- they're creating a kind of diversity between the books and the end of the books, if they're the teachers, students or just read.
And it's even true if you're talking a different language from one of the previous languages, and especially English.
And I'm going to call these people underneath the secret, because they're really focused on the process of being able to share their knowledge with the world.
So what I want to talk about today is to take these ideas, yes, we've seen in the modern culture and try to bring them into the reinvention of thinking about movies, using them and learning them, okay.
So, on this, I'd like to talk and really, how do we come from where we now need to get?
So, the first thing I'd like you to do is a small computer experiment.
So, imagine taking all the books in the world.
Okay, they all imagine books and imagine just a third of the fish.
So, these puncles and imagine them go through a digital process, yes, and then they're going to be an enormous and a global crisis.
Think about it as an Atlantic Mony, yes, to the content of books.
And then take this material and imagine all of them free, so people can change it, play with it, improve it.
Imagine the physical experience, so everyone in the world can go to all of the knowledge and imagine technology so that you can do this material, improve it, play with it, at a time of two seconds of not years.
Okay, instead of the generations that make every two years, tell, imagine those 25 seconds.
So, imagine that we could do it and imagine that we could put people in this box, yes.
So we can actually build systems with not just the strength, but with all the people who can write or want to be writing in all the languages in the world, and I think if you can do it, it will read, well, I'm just going to care about it as a information system.
So, really, it's a dream and in some sense of what you can think about is that we're trying to enable everyone in the world, I mean every one in the world to be the Detroit of themselves, to create conventional materials, to share them with the world, put them all the time.
So, this is the dream.
In fact, the dream is actually really, yes.
For the last six and a half years, we've been working very hard at the University of River at the University of a project called iPh.D., so what I want to do is tell you a little bit about what people do with my iPh.D., which you can think about as a kind of point for a point of Nigerian Nigerian Francisco, where they're
We're working on the total software and content, okay?
So, it's to kind of put it in perspective.
So to create, so who's some of the people who use this kind of type?
Well, the first thing is that there's a community of professors to volunteer, from Cambridge to Chicago, which is an electrical engineering engineering engineering to develop what you can think about as a book from Syrian School, yes, who's designed the whole field of electricity engineering.
And it's not just that, it can be used to use each of their institutions.
If people like Kattos -- yes, look at the generations -- a private teacher to music and an artist from Einstein, who wanted to share her wonderful music with the world, about how to teach children to play. The material is now using 6,000 times a month.
It's great, great.
In fact, a lot of the use comes from the United States, at the bottom of a number of children until 12, because anyone who's heard in the summer in the school, the first thing that you've got is a music learning.
So it's just teaching about the asteroid to this kind of open and free content.
Many teachers use it.
Okay, what about reduction? What with the prosperity, reuse, yes?
A team of volunteers at the University of Allexo Texas, students last year represents the ideas of the book in engineering.
And while about a week, it will become part of the most popular materials using a space in all America and especially in Mexico, because of the open option and you can be expanded.
People, volunteers and even companies who are transformed materials for artists like Syrian, Japan and Italian, to spread more knowledge.
Okay, what about the people who are cultural?
What does it mean to the cultural?
I'm going to say to build numbers of death.
Scientists like NASA, which is very powerful and interactive and interactive in the materials, so we can get beyond the age of the experience that every learning and things, you can communicate with them and play with them and actually learn in this industry.
We've been working with teachers without boundaries that are interested in mixing the materials. They're going to use their iPh.D.
The development and the collection of Mexico referred to learning teachers how to teach in 84 countries around the world.
Social teachers right now in Iraq from 20,000 teachers in USAID.
And for them, the idea of being able to regenerate and cells to communicate from local is very important, because only to provide free material to people in the developing world to have a kind of cultural intelligence, so that if you don't help people reduce the power of the material, to reduce it to their language, it's not good.
Okay, other organizations that we've been working with were UCC, people know UC March.
It's a new university in California, in the central Central, which works in Mexico.
They're actually developing a lot of their science and engineering content to spread around the world in our system.
And they're also trying to develop different types of software in a completely open code.
We worked with AMD that they have a project called 50 to 15, which is trying to bring the Internet to 10 percent of the world's population by 2015.
We're going to provide them in a space of languages.
And we also worked with a number of organizations.
In particular, a group of projects that are trained by the Hollywood, who took a real social leadership on the operation.
Okay, School, I think it's kind of interesting, pretty interesting.
It's the idea of trying to create the physical dimension of one of these pixels and I think many of you have a lot of them.
I think you've all got one of these music numbers in your sky.
It's a little girl for you.
Only tell you about this, it's an engineering book.
It's about 300 pounds, it's hard.
The price, someone can touch?
How much is it going to help books?
Audience: 65 dollars.
Richard Bernesk: He's going to get 22 dollars to the student.
And why does it get 22 dollars?
Because it's published by a demand and it's reduced from this open axis of materials.
If this book was a great product by reduction, it would be 122 dollars at least.
Okay, so what we see is the reduction of this consumption process or the only component of the only piece of materials that was written by the community that they're false, which is transparency and you're going to find a light in a great way, or you find by Amazon, or you find a light by printing, like Chile.
And I think it's a very interesting part because there's a huge area under the long-term corner.
We don't talk about the end of the Arctic Pwitter, from the left.
We're talking about books in the Olympic equations of existing spaces.
Well, books may be sold in 100 pounds a year, 1,000 pounds a year.
There's a giant income income, yes, underneath this long corner to keep open projects like our own, but also to expect this new river of fabric into a decline, like Chile Shanging these two books.
And I think one of the things you need to take with you from this talk, it's that there's a user interface and the person in the middle, yes, it's going to happen in the Indian industry.
And it's going to go to the next few years, and I think it's for our best, and for the world's best.
Okay, so what's the implications?
What actually makes it happen?
There are possibilities of technology, and the only part of the technology that I really want to talk about is XL.
How many people know what it's 83?
Oh, great, so this is the future of the web, yes.
It's the slow of the cases, content.
And what you're really able to worry about is XML in this case, which is the extension that we put around the fish.
Remember we took a book, and we've read his page?
Well, what the NML will do is basically -- it will make these shots to the alone, well.
CA: They're the refugees of the GDP that allows us to connect the content in a variety of ways and that tells us that it's a survival for the material.
So, it allows this system, well, in its first situation, well, for all of its content, all the fish that you read from the books and create a very sophisticated learning, yes? books, curiosity groups, okay.
It gives you the capacity to express the experience of learning to every student, yes, so that every student can be a book or a curiosity that's called their learning style, to communicate their language and things that make them.
It allows you to reuse those same materials in many different ways, and new ways and surprising.
It enables you to connect with ideas and show how areas are, yes, one connection to the other.
And I'll just give you my personal story.
We made it, six and a half years ago, because I teach the things in the red box.
And my work, as France said, I'm an electric professor.
I'm teaching signals and my challenge was to show that this math -- Wow, about half of you have already been looking at the equation.
It's actually this woman's right to the teacher, it's actually the center of this powerful network that enables technology -- that's actually cool as cool as strategies to music with enormous economic opportunities, but it's also reduced by a curious building.
And the interesting thing I realized is that there's no way I, okay, as an engineer, I can write this book that could get all of this.
We had a community to do this and we had new tools to be able to connect these ideas.
And I think that really, in a sense, what we're trying to do is make the dream of a reality, where you can imagine all the books in Syria actually talk to each other, yes.
And people who are teaching out there, who's three, you know it.
Okay, back to math, yes, imagine, it's possible.
Every equation you can click on one of your new electronics is something you can explore and try.
Okay, so imagine the Asia book of your child, well, in the classroom.
You're able to click on any equation and get a small tool so you can try and play it, understand it.
Because we really don't understand until we do it.
It's the same kind of funding, like ML, to the chemistry.
Imagine chemical books that really understand the structure in which the molecules are created.
Imagine KM to music that's used for you to go into the Social structure of music, who's born with it, you'll put it in.
It doesn't all go into it, right?
Even the three people's powerful.
And I said, "Okay, the second big, and here I told you that a big morning.
The second big potential is a curiosity.
Because I actually got there and I was talking about some of the music culture.
We can share and share and click, but actually it's not rules.
Well, and we're going to be there in privacy if we're doing it, yes, because this music is Kenyan.
It's now beating, yes, most of the big industry.
So, really, the key here is that we can't allow it to happen.
We can't allow this planet to happen here.
So, what we need to do is do this right from the beginning.
And what we need to do is find a pattern of a curious building that makes cooperation, and it turns it into a sense of death.
And the signals here for software in open code.
Things like Los and GPL.
And the ideas, the Cambridge Rotsus.
How many people have heard about the Atlantic Moscus?
If you haven't heard, you have to learn about it.
Chilis.com.
In the bottom of every material in the O.D., many other projects, you'll find their logo.
It's going to take you to a completely unusual symbol and read to the person, which tells you exactly what you can do with this content.
In fact, you're free, yes, share it, to do all kinds of things, to move it, to change it, even using a remote use of it as long as you're eating the crisis.
Because in an academic and many of the institutions, it's actually this idea of knowledge, it's why, and it's why.
That's why people write, not necessarily to do money.
We don't talk about the Archimeter, yes.
We're at the top of the long page here.
Before it has the critical code, yes, so if you want a lot of speed to build it.
And Atlantic Moscus is strong, yes, over 43 million things out there, you're going to have an Atlantic Ross.
Not just text, also music, images, video.
And there's actually a restaurant in the number of people who are exposed to music to be free for people to do all this idea of reinvention, extension, conservation and collaboration.
So I would like to end with some points.
So, we built this idea of sharing everyone.
People use it.
We get over 5,000 studies in a month, just our website.
The openness of MIT, which is another free website, gets a similar number of techniques, but how do we respond about it?
How do we respond about it to the future.
And the first thing that people probably think is the quality of quality, yes.
Because we're saying everyone can make things.
Every one can make anything.
So it can be a problem.
So, it didn't take a lot of time, yes, until people started to make a content for example of women, which is actually a pretty good motor.
The only problem is that it was an artificial animal, yes, from a big French French, and when you're going to go to the Cyrus website, it's spending you to a website, okay?
So, it's a little bit of a problem.
So obviously, we had a kind of quality and it's really where the idea of crisis comes in.
Okay, you come to TED. Why do you come to TED?
Because his team and his team realized that things are very high quality, yes.
So we need to be able to do the same thing, yes.
And we need to be able to design buildings and what we're doing is to design a social software to enable each other to build its critical process and we're reading it for lunch.
And basically what they're spontaneous is for everyone there to develop the personal process, so they can focus on the content that they think is really important.
And you can think about TED as a potential woman.
So I just want to finish in saying, you can actually see it as an action of action, yes.
And openness is about sharing knowledge.
You're all here motivated with huge possibilities of knowledge and what I'd like to do is invite every one of you to make this project and other projects, because I think fear we can change the landscape of education and execution.
So, thank you very much.
It's a concept of the dream: there's a finger.
It was a connection that I wrote when I was 11 and I got a good plus.
And I'm going to try to do this in the 18th century that we're supposed to be able to jump, and track TED Talks: they're, in fact, something that's made a sense of disciplinary, but it's good for creativity.
It's OK.
Well, I also want to explain, because David Egypt said he's going to get me out if he says something that's morning, or I don't believe universal creativity.
And I did that for half the audience, which is scientists.
When I say we, I'm going to play you; I'm going to say to me, and my right brain, my left brain, and that's why it's the area that tells me what I'm saying is not true.
And I'm going to do this also by looking at what I think is part of my creative process, that including a number of things that happened, actually -- the don't even start before I made something new.
And it's including the door, and the driver, and what I call aid.
Now on the surface, we're looking at whether we're very good at six million, maybe in our mind, how much of the chimps don't make this kind of depression.
And there were people who would say we were born with this in other ways.
And others, like my mom, say I'm going to get my material out of the water.
There will be people who also say that creativity is maybe a result of some geological strategies -- a smoke and your body -- you have a little bit, you know, a psychiatric or depression.
I've got to say, someone -- I've recently read your name wasn't necessarily a fantastic disorder, which may have an extinction in the atmosphere, and maybe it's made out of his creativity, and I'm not -- I'm doing something that is doing something for your brain.
And I've really mentioned that I've actually been watching the Tasmanian machine a few years ago, but it was when I wrote my last book, and there are people who say this book is pretty different.
I think some of this also starts in a sense of identity: You know, who I am, why am I this particular person, why don't I feel like everyone?
And sometimes they're going to be dealed in skills, but they're going to have a kind of profound that creative possibilities.
I once wanted. I thought I was an artist.
And I had a fantasy.
And it wasn't bad, but it wasn't really creative.
Because everything I could do was expect in a way that it's very small.
And I've got a sense that I've seen it a number.
And then I also didn't really listen in some kind of way I wanted, and you know, you look at these grades, and they didn't have bad, but it's not going to come up with one day that I'm going to get an artificial generation of words.
In addition, one of the creative principles is you're going to have a little bit of childhood.
And I had the kind of age that I think most people was, and that's six, you know, I've got expectations.
This shape there, by the way, a form where it's a toy that I could only have when I was a week, and it was to help me grow a very young doctor.
I've got a few who were a long term: Five to 15, it's supposed to be my unique, and it's led to a failure.
But it was actually a pretty real thing in my life that happened when I was about 14 years old.
And my wife, in 1967, and then my father, six months later, there were tumors in the brain.
And my mom believed that something was wrong, and she'll find out what it was, and she'll fix it.
My dad was a paper in Tiki, and he was the species in the planes, and with the name of the name is going to come up with his peace.
But of course, they're in the end, in a half years of this.
And after that, my mom believed that it was a camp, or agriculture -- she would look for all the reasons in the universe why it happened.
It doesn't believe in cases.
Everything was a reason.
And one of the reasons, she thought, was her mother who was sitting in when she was very young, she was a piece of it.
And that's how I had this concept of death that got me because my mom also believed that I was next, and she was after.
And when you're on the front front of death in a very, you start thinking a lot about everything.
You're going to be very creative, in the previous perspective.
And that, then, led to my big questions.
And these are the questions I have today.
And they: Why do things go, and how do things go?
And that's my mom a question: How do I make things happen?
This is a great way to look at these questions, when you write a story.
Because after all, in this work, between one and 300, you've got to answer the question of what's hard things, how do things go, in the room they're curious. What are the effects?
And how do I, as a service, as a device, also affects this?
And it's also the question I think many of our scientists are asking.
It's a kind of the universe, and I need to develop my universe's research in my world, as the creation of this world.
And you see, there's a lot of experiment and techniques in trying to make it happen, trying to figure it out -- years for years, often.
So when I look at creativity, I also think it's this feeling or not that ability to employ my view in effects actually anything in life.
And I had a lot of them over what happened during this conference, almost everything happened.
And that's why I'm going to use, as a metaphor, in this artist: the News of News, which I really don't understand, but I'm still going to use it as the process that's going to explain how it's the metaphor.
So in the text techniques, of course, you've got power and power.
And it's the same thing in looking at these questions about how things go.
It's a lot of unknown, and often you don't know what it's about it.
But when you've got these options, you'd like they're going to come up with some normal China in the story, and what you find is what's important.
And that's what I'm looking for in my work, personal meaning.
There's also the Islamic principles, which is part of the text techniques, as I'm looking at it.
And we've got the president and the threat, where you're looking for what you're looking for, and you know, things go up at the same time, and you're looking at it in a different way, and you're really trying to find this story.
You don't get anything.
And what you've been supposed to find, what's going to find, in a certain way, we're not more there.
Now, I don't want to get out of the other side of what's going on in our world, as we do a scientist.
And that's why I'm just going to put here in the corporate theory, and it's just saying that creative people are cultural, and there's a five-hicle, I think, of insection.
Laughter) And everybody works at the same time.
There's also a big question about unfortunately.
And I'm going to call this to something the next week the cartoon.
And you don't know what works, but something works there.
And unfortunately, for me, it's very uncomfortable in my life, and I have it.
It's there a paralysis. And just as an example, it's one that came to me recently.
It was something that I read in the article from a woman who was talking about the war in Iraq, and Deredia, "The Adam Adam Man, is responsible for him to all of the life."
She said a very famous Chinese, she said.
And it means that because we've been designed to just, we've got to stay there until things go. You know, maybe even 100 years.
So there's another one I've come up with, and it's, "I'm going to save a crazy fish."
And that's what historical fish say, because they're not supposed to kill anything.
And they've also got to get rid, and people need to eat.
So their way to deal with this is that they invent the printing, and unfortunately it's in the way.
Now the invention of two metaphors -- in fact, one of them is my mom's own mother, and it said, "Well, she said to me," I've invented a crazy person, responsible for him to life. "
And it was a warrior -- don't be intervened with other people's actions, or you're going to have an accident.
Okay. I think if someone really was good is offering it.
But those two, although, to save a crazy fish, or to save a crazy person, for me, they're training.
And we all live in life, when we see a situation, we have a response.
And then we have actions.
There's a speed of what we need to do, and then we do something.
And the results of it doesn't necessarily know the forces we had.
Maybe things have changed. And so, after that, what is our responsibility?
What should we do?
Do we have to stay there all the life, or we have to do something else and do it and say, "Well, my forces were good, and that's why can't you get my responsibility to all that?
It's the speech in my life that's really surprised to me, and I'm going to write a book called "Don't save a bad fish."
I've seen examples of this, from the moment I've shown this question.
It was everywhere. I got lucky from all over the past.
And then, in a sense, I knew they were always there.
And then as a pain, it's what happened. I get these lucks, these signals, and I'm looking at them, and it's when they've been false, and yet they didn't.
And what I needed, actually, was code.
And when I have a question, it's a code.
And all of these things that go like muscles and bees that are exposed in life are actually going through this question, and what happens is that these things become relevant.
And it looks like it happens all the time.
You're going to think it's kind of a spint of cases that you're going to be here, a discovery, where you're going to get all this help from the universe.
And you can also explain that by now you have a code.
And it's often more often.
But you imagine it.
You start looking at things that they have to communicate to your conversations.
I'm going to wait, we're going to take a cure, do you worry about it?
Why or why not?
It might be something that's perhaps more serious -- as I said, human rights in the stage.
I thought I wasn't going to ask you because someone else else if I'm going to go, it's going to look like I'm going to call the office there.
And then after a while, I asked myself, "Why do we train ourselves knowledge, why do we take our forests that other people gave us?
And it was the same thing that I felt when I grew up, and I heard these rules on my father's moral behavior, which was a paper in Titan.
So I decided I'm going to go to my goal, and I still didn't know that if I'm going to go there, what's the result of it if I write a book -- and I've got to deal with this in the next time, when the time is going to come.
We're all worried about things that we see in the world and aware of them.
We get to this point and say, what do I do?
We can't all go to Africa, or work in patients, so what do we do if we have this moral response, this feeling?
In addition, one of the biggest things that we're looking at, and we're talking about today, it's a dirt with.
It leads to this question.
When I look at all of these things that are moral and uncomfortable and uncomfortable, and I'm asking what I'm supposed to be, I understand that it's communicating to the identity that I had as a child -- and why am I here, and what does it mean of my life, and what does it mean in the universe?
It looks like this for Los, and it's fear with it.
We're all training in the moral speed in a sense, and yet it's also completely rejected.
In a story, it's where I start.
Sometimes I get help of the universe, probably.
My mom would say it was the wind of my grandmother's first book, because I think there was things I wasn't supposed to know.
Instead of writing that the grandmother died in the case, from an engagement of opinion while she did too much life, I actually wrote a story that the woman killed itself, and that's actually how it happened.
And my mom decided that this information has probably come from my cell.
There's also things, pretty close, which gives me information to help me in the school.
In this case, I wrote a story that was made some details, time in history, a certain universe.
And I had to find something historical that could be able to this.
And I took this book, and I -- the first device that was evolved to me was exactly the background and the coffee. And the kind of character I had to have had from TV, was happening in the region of Sovin, outside that, and the strength that he was the son of God.
You wonder, are the things that are caused by training?
Well, what's an accident? What's the road?
What's lucky? What are the things that you get from the universe that you can't really explain?
And it also goes into the story.
These are the things that I think about are all the time in real time.
In particular, when good things are good, and alone, when things are bad.
But I don't think there's some inevitable discovery, and I don't want to know what these secrets are, so I can admit them, and also try to find them in my life.
Because, again, I think when I'm aware of them, more of them happen.
Another piece of hair is when I'm going to go to a place -- I've recently been with friends, and we've got us an academic to another place, and we've found ourselves in some intuitive place, as an academic village, academic village.
We've gone through three and sisters from the name, and the third and my third, there was something kind of crazy and bad and bad bridge, and then I knew it had to be a background to my book.
And in one of the systems, it's been happening in this third side.
From that reason, I wrote about roads -- states of artists -- that a person built.
And I didn't know exactly what I thought about it, but it was so full of life.
I came up, and a company, it's hard to take her dogs to Talk, which I said, "About, and about 45 minutes later, when I went through the tree, I've come up with it.
And it was a person, a Chinese man, and he wouldn't get these things, not with a bank, not with anything.
And I asked me how is it possible to do this?
And he said, well, I think with everything in life, there's a place of food.
And it was exactly what my story was at the same point.
I had so many examples -- I have a lot of these examples when I write a story, and I can't explain it.
Is it because I had the cloud that I had this kind of spinning of studies in the lab on these things?
Or maybe it's a kind of invisible discovery that I can't explain, like a biological concept?
Another big thing I think about is actions.
And as I said, my mom doesn't believe in the cases.
What's the president of training?
And how can we tell what's the responsibility and what's the genes, outside the sentence of a sentence?
I was able to make it a personal way, when I went to the right village, in Gajo, the most fastest conference in China.
And I saw this beautiful place. I knew I wanted to go back.
And I had the opportunity to do this as a Jakographic asked me if I wanted to write something about China.
And I said yes, on the village of the rich people, a bridge.
And they agreed, and the time I've seen the place and the next place I went, there was a terrible accident. Man, a man, a man, and his fingerprint was reduced to the roof that roads.
60s were killed, and 40 pounds.
The responsibilities have been taken on the family.
The man's daughter's daughter's son's son's daughter's daughter's daughter's daughter's daughter's daughter's daughter's daughter's daughter's daughter &ap
And of course, as the West, we're saying, "We're, it's an accident.
It's not fair. It's the son, not the father. "
And when I'm in the story, I've got to put these images.
It takes time, but I have to let them just go into a story, and be there.
And so I was there in three opportunities, different markets.
And I started to feel a different thing about history and what happened before, and the optimistic of life in a very poor village, and what you've found is your signals, and your taxes, your connections with other families, and I saw how it's kind of about it.
I've also been able to find out about the text that they've given, Texas that didn't be used for about 29 years, and it was to send a number of men -- Mr. Teszler's wearing men's wearing men into the rest world on the roof the hormones.
Now you're, as the West, and I'm in the West, you'll say, it's a beautiful belief. But after I've spent a while, and I've seen the amazing things that's happened, you're starting to identify those images of who work in the world, they're
So I stayed with them, and as I wrote this story, this is how I went into their photos, and I think it's important for me -- to face their photos, because it's where the story is real, and it's where I find the answers to how I feel about some questions I have in my life.
The years is transparency, of course, and it's not an email, as I'm trying to get it here at TED.
The book came and forth. When it comes, it's not my book anymore.
He's in the Koreans, and they're looking at it differently.
But I'm back to the question of, how do I get there from there?
And how do I make my life?
And I think it's through the questions, and that's what I say to myself that there's no biological corruption.
I believe in details, in the details of a story, and the past, the details of it went through, and what's happening in the same point.
I also believe that in thinking about things, computers about luck, and rolling, and spontaneously, if you're going to see the name, and in the traditional forces, I'm going to get some idea about what it is, how we're creating.
I've got to think about a role, where I'm in the universe, how would someone mean that, or that's just something I've invented?
And I can also find that if you look at the doors, and it's going to be what's imagined, and yet within the same real world, the invisible world.
And that's how I find real proteins, not really, or all of the truth.
And they have to be in all the possibilities, including those who I didn't want to be on the math before.
So there's no perfect answers.
Or maybe, if there's an answer, it's got to remind myself that there's a reality and a reality in everything, and it's good.
And if there's a specific answer, a better answer for me, it's just imagine.
And imagine this to put myself in this story, until it's just -- there's a transformation in my eyes and the story that I'm creating.
And so I discovered that if I feel what's in a story -- in one story -- so I'm the most curious, I think, to know what compassion, feel that compassion.
Because every thing, in a question, how things go, there's an exciting thing.
I have to be the story to understand a lot of it.
We've come to the end of the talk, and I'm looking at what's in the baby, and that's what's the stuff that's in our lives, they're great and we're going to come with us.
Here it is.
Thank you very much!
Thank you.
Today, I'm going to show you how this telescope and these similar reality that I'm going to feel about to do a revolution in scientific education.
And I'm also going to show you how it can do effective scientists two times.
But before I show you how all this is possible, let's talk about what the scientific quality of education is so important.
If you think about it, the world is growing really fast.
And with this definition comes from a list of big challenges, challenges like deal with global warming, to solve the noise and decline in diseases, if just remind some.
And who, exactly, will we help us solve all these big problems?
Well, at a very high level, it's the young students.
It's the next generation of young scientists decline.
And in many cases, we're focusing on to get them to new and big, to help us solve all the challenges that are facing us.
And so a few years ago, my partner and I learned students in university like these, just that students were looking a little bit more like this.
And yes, it's really the reality there's much too many universities around the world: wearing students and sometimes not sure why they're learning about it.
So we started looking for unique learning and new methods, but what we found was pretty gold.
We've seen that books became electronic books, curiosity became the Titan and Monologists of the Timbs became MOOOOCs -- open open boundaries.
And if you think about it, everything we're really doing is take the same content and it's a refugee, and you bring it to more students -- it's great, don't do, it's really great -- but the learning method is still more or the same thing, there's no extension of language.
So we started looking at other places.
What we've found was that the Turkey was taken over and over and over more effective when they were using real regulations to train pixes.
And so we thought to ourselves: Why don't we use it to know?
Why didn't we build a dictionary of the lab and virtual lab?
Well, we did this.
We've basically created a device from the lab in accurate reality, where students can do experiments with math equations that can talk about what happens in the real world.
But it's not just simple characteristics -- we'll also create the characteristics of progress with universities like MIT, to bring cancer research to these students.
And all of a sudden, universities can save millions of dollars by giving students to do experimental experiments before they go into a real lab.
And it's not just that, now they can also understand -- even at the bottom level of the machine -- what's going on for machines.
And they're all going to do certain experiments as well in the lab.
For example, also here, learn about corporations of Nigeria, which is an important subject that many schools can't teach good reasons.
And we, of course, look at the students and then give teachers to a full case, so they understand where students are.
But we didn't stop there, because we saw how important it means to change students in the classroom.
So we looked at me games to create chemical stories and many.
For instance, here in this case, where students need to solve magnitude conditions in CSI using their recycling teachers.
And the feedback we've invented all of this was positive.
Here we've got 300 students, they're all opening up a curiosity in their own time learning as basic science science.
And what I love most about this is when students come to me sometimes after that, everyone is surprised and a little bit of slaves, and they say, "I've spent two hours in the lab and a virtual lab, and I didn't look at Facebook."
It's how much the reality knows and decline for students.
And so, to explore if it really worked, a psychologist for learning did a study with 160 students -- it was at the University of Stanford and the technical university of Darwin.
And what they did was they put the students into two groups.
One group was only used in the lab corner, and the other one was only using traditional learning methods, and they had the same amount of time.
So, unfortunately, they gave students a test before and after the experiment, so they could measure the unique impact of students.
And what they found was a big deal of 76 percent of learning effective effects in the lab and virtual corporations.
But even more interesting, the other part of the research was about what the impact of the teacher was about learning.
And what they found was that when they were able to put the dynamic stations with a teacher learning from a teacher, and Mr. TV, then we saw it of 10 percent effective effects to learning, which is the effective effect of science with the same amount of time.
So a few months ago, we started asking ourselves -- we have a wonderful team of psychologist and teachers and scientists and games -- and we started asking ourselves: How can we stand in our conversation to reimagine education?
And today, I'm really excited to show what we've done and we've worked on it really hard to create.
I'm going to explain what this is.
Basically, I take our mobile phone -- most of the students have them, cartoons -- and I'm there in an accurate reality, a very low amount.
And now what I can do effective, I can really go back into this similar world.
You can also have some of you in the audience to try it, because it's really something you have to try to figure out in a lot of it really knows.
It really feels like you'll just go into a accurate lab.
Do you see me on the screen?
Audience: Yeah.
Man February: Good!
So basically, I became my mobile phone to the lab of a million dollars's lab with all this amazing object that I can operate.
I can, for instance, to get a platform and do experiments.
I've got EGO, PCR and, look here, I've got a cartoon from the next generation, and I've even got my electronic microscope here.
I mean, who's a subject with him a electronic microscope in the classroom?
And here we have my machine, I can do different experiments on the machine.
And here I have the door, I can go into other experiments, I can do in the lab.
And here, I've got a text to learning.
It's a smart telescope that allows me to read about radiological theories.
As you can see, I can use it.
I can look at the movies and see it's relevant to an experiment that I'm doing right now.
So there, I have Mary.
She's my teacher -- I'm going to help my lab -- and what she does is appreciate me in the lab.
And very quickly, the teachers will be able to really live themselves into the similar world that I'm inside right now and help me, apply me, through all the experiment.
And now before we finish it, I'm going to show you something even cool, I think -- something that you can't even do in real issues.
It's a PCR machine.
I'm going to start the experiment now.
And what I've done now is I've made myself a million times a size of a molecule -- and it's really feeling like this, you have to try it.
So now I feel like I'm standing in the machine I see all the DNA, and I see molecules.
I see the political and the analogy and the analogy and so on.
And I can see how in this case, DNA is reduced by millions of times, just as if it happens in your body right now.
And I can really feel and understand how all this works.
Now, I hope it gives you a little bit more insight about the possibilities in these new learning methods.
And I'd also like to prove that everything you've seen right now is working on Italians and telescopes without the coffee.
And I say this for a very important reason.
So we're really powerful and we can inspire the next generation of scientists, we really need teachers to push the object of new technologies in the classroom.
And so in many ways, I believe that the next big piece of education doesn't have more in technology, but in the decisions of teachers to push forward and train these technologies in the classroom.
And so that's our hope that will be more university and schools and teachers will be active with technology to use the potential of this.
And so, finally, I would like to leave you with a little story that really gives me inspiration.
And that's the story of John Anderson.
Some of you may know it.
John invented a new test, sanitation and a heart cancer at the age of 15.
And when Jak part his story of how he did his big, he also explained that one thing was almost avoid doing this way.
And it was that he didn't have access to real issues, because he was infinitable to allow him to get in.
Now, imagine if we could bring accurate in millions of dollars from the summer to all of these students like Jak, all over the world, and give them the most common machines, and disabilities that you can imagine that library would make every scientist out of a bridge.
And then imagine how it can give power and see a new generation of young scientists and musicians, are ready to innovate and change the world.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Hi.
I'll ask you a question: Do you read as children?
If you do, you can please move your hand?
Wow! It's the worst group I met in my life.
Laughter) Well, in the last 20 years, I've been studying how children learn to visit.
And today, I'm going to give you some of the classes that we've discovered.
First, I'm going to tell you a story from Richard Minister, my friend and my friend's friend's school in the action.
He got a mobile phone one day.
The graph said, "Mr. Monna, June wouldn't come to school because it's sick."
Mr. Man asked, "Shell, with who I'm talking?"
And this is my father, "I'm my father."
Laughter) So this story -- Laughter) Thanks in a beautiful way of three photos that are pregnant about children and studies.
The first one, children start to lie just after just a "Soviet".
Second, children are worse.
We're the adults can recognize the speech that they're in.
And the third, if kids are working at a very young age, you know, you've got to be a flight in the ocean, and they'll become biological customers for all their lives.
Well, it turns out that these three images are wrong.
We've been playing games with children from all over the world.
Here's an example.
In this game, we asked children to meet the numbers in the water.
And we told them that, at scale, they're going to win a big prize.
But in the middle of the game, we invited to leave the room.
And we've got a lot of our time, our parents didn't save in the water.
Of course, there were cameras in the room to look at all their way.
Because it's used to win in a game as powerful, more than 90 percent of the children have been shown at the moment we've made out of the room.
Laughter) The right question is: Will we go back and ask the kids if they were expected or not, the kids who wanted to be born or will be done in the radiation?
We've found that not the test, stem, and right, at the age of two, 30 percent of cases, and 70 percent of real things.
At the age of three, 50 percent of crimes and 50 percent of truth.
At the age of four, over 80 percent of cases.
And after the age of four years, most of the kids are working.
As you can see, to explore this is a typical point in development.
And some of the kids start to study early as two years old.
Let's look at most of the young children.
Why is it just part of the young children who come from?
Basically, there's a good feedback to a good food of good food.
The ability to visit the best requires two main components.
The first component is a theory of consciousness, or you can read computers.
You read computers to know that the ability to know that different people have a different knowledge about the situation, and the ability to separate what I know about what you know.
You're going to read computers to visit because in the end of the morning is that I know you don't know what I know.
So, I was able to visit you.
The second component of capacity is self-control.
It's the capacity to control you, in your face, and in your body's face, so you can get to convince.
And we found that young kids can read computers and self-control control, we tend to visit earlier, and in a more sophisticated way.
It turns out that these two capabilities are going to all of us to cooperate in society.
In fact, lines in the ability to read computers and self-control control are connected to compassionate problems, as the privilege of the season of the gas and autism.
So if you get to your two years from the first time, instead of being worried, you're going to get rid -- because it's a training that you're going to want to have a new way of development.
Now, are children who are worse?
Do you think you can recognize when they're working?
Do you want to try?
Okay? Okay.
I'll show you two videos.
In these videos, the kids will go to the conservative question, "Would you laugh?"
And you'll try to tell me who the kids are critical and who's true.
Here's the first child.
Do you ready?
[Video] Man: Shake?]]]]] []]]]]]]]]]
Child: No. King me: And that's the second girl.
[Video] Man: Shake?]]]]] []]]]]]]]]]
HA: No. King me: If you think that the first child's morning, let's get a hand.
If you think that the second girl's curious, his arm is hand.
Okay, in fact, the first child is really true, and the other hand is critical.
I think many of you are worse in pollution that cases of children.
So we've been doing similar games for those with many older adults.
And we showed them a lot of videos.
In a period of the film, the child's morning.
And in the second half of the child is really true.
Let's find out how these adults were taken.
The number of curiosity and the truth is equally equal, so if you're going to be an academic, there's a 50 percent chance that's going to go.
So if your imagination is about 50 percent, a crime that you're worried in identity that children's studies.
So let's start with the first students and students to the details, that most of them have a limited experiment with children.
No, they can't recognize when a child's morning.
They're going to have their performance for sensory.
What about secret workers and lawyers who have the experts in the child's gender, the workers with children on a daily basis?
Can they recognize when a child's morning?
No, they're not.
So what about the judgments, the job of a boss and satellites, who deal with curiosity basis?
Could they recognize when a child's morning?
No, they're not.
What about parents?
Can parents recognize that cases of another child?
No, they're not.
Can teachers recognize when they're in the morning?
No, they're not.
Laughter) So you can now ask what the kids are so hard to identify.
I'd like to show it with my daughter, Nijan.
It's the four in it when it's critical.
It's when kids's investigation, they're usually training.
But, behind this president, the child's experience a lot of emotions, like fear, a woman and maybe a little bit of the crisis.
And unfortunately, these emotions are scared or prosthetic.
That's why, most of them are going to make our lives.
So in the last few years, we've spent a way to push these experiences.
And then we arrived in English.
We know that you're going to fly in, there's a huge network of blood vessels.
When we experience different emotions, the blood flow in us changes a little bit.
And these changes are affected by the autonomous nerve system, which is beyond our minds.
With a understanding of changes in the blood flow, we can identify emotional emotions of people.
Unfortunately, these changes in the fingerprint in refugees, are better than to move in an unfamous eye.
To help us push the feelings of people, we've developed a new digital technology that we call "autism optimism."
First, we use a video camera for people while they experience a variety of emotional emotions.
And then, using our images technology, we're producing images of change in the blood flow.
In the traffic images, we can see in changes in the blood flow of faces that are going to be based on regular emotions.
With this technology, we can now recognize the emotional emotions in the time, and as a result, identify that cases.
We can do it in an unpopular way, mostly, cheap and accurate in 85 percent of the cases, which is much better than the external risks.
In addition, we've found an effective effect.
No, it's not this pencil effect.
It's the real Pacific effect.
When people are caused, the blood flow to live in a paralyzed life, and the blood flow of an extinction.
Of course, it's not the only situation that's going to make us emotional emotions.
And it led to a question, alone to recognize that studies, how can we use our technology?
One will be in education.
For example, with this technology goes back to math to identify the president in his classroom that's a lot of regret about the subject of the teaching and then to offer him help.
In addition, we can use it in health care.
For example, every day I'm interested in the scoffee of my parents, who live in thousands of miles from me.
And with this technology, I can find not just what's going on in their lives but also to move the heart rate, the mood, the wind and whether they experience as a pain or not.
And maybe in the future, their high level of attention to heart or stress.
Could you ask: Can we use it to push politicians?
Laughter) For example, during Detroit.
Well, the answer is yes.
In using the TV film, we can discover the heart of politicians, a hot and their right condition, and maybe in the future, are they causing us.
In addition, we can use it for a marketplace, for example, to discover whether people love certain products.
We can use it in TV.
For instance, if your distance is scared to you, this technology can help you decide whether it's really about you or it's just trying to be nice to you.
And in this case, it's just trying to be nice to you.
It's a modern autonomy technology that's at a very early point.
You'll offer a lot of more effects that we've been thinking about.
But, one thing I know is clear: the morning doesn't see as it looks today.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I've got Virtual.
I love to look for people's suffering.
Now, it's not a critical thing.
I'm usually looking for electronics, things that I can take to my clock to win.
I've got a tool for businesses.
Every one has three different motors, so now you can build things that are moving.
There's a brand so you can stop and compare things.
There's even laser, so you can turn a cool robot into an amazing robot.
Now, I built a lot of hard things, and some of the things even were quite useful.
But here's the thing, for me, it's just an opportunity to play, to be creative and build things to avoid myself.
That's what I like to do, so I just made it part of my work.
I'm leaving a universal research research, where we're going to take curiosity and exploration over this other thing.
We're not focused on a certain problem, and we're not trying to solve some disease.
It's just a place that people can come and ask questions from fascinating and find answers.
And I realized a long time ago that if I challenge people to build the equipment that they need to find out that I find, it's a great way to encourage creativity.
And what happened was that artists and scientists around the world started getting into my lab.
And it's not just because we're dealing ideas not conventional, it's because we're looking at them with a scientist.
So one day, I made the song to something, I published it, and I had a sudden, can I treat biology like a restaurant?
Could I just take a biological system, to mix parts and then put them in a new and creative way?
My lab started working on it, and I wanted to show you the result.
Anyone of you can tell me what French is it?
Audience: Put!
Andrew Ford: Right, it's going to win.
Now, I actually want you to notice that it's much more red than others.
And that's because we've got human cells into it.
We took a wall from a piano, we put all the DNA cells and then changed human cells.
And what we've left after the conference of all of the object cells is that the code of this.
It's what we're going to take the plants of their shape and the tissue.
And these little holes you can see, there are all the cells of the wind cells.
So we've gone, we've changed some green cells that you can see in blue.
What's happened is, these society started to transform and they're released all the fuel.
How much it sounds strange, it's actually how our platform is actually a magazine.
And we've discovered in our South Central work that you can pull these objects inside the body and the body will send cells and collect blood and actually make it more about these things live.
That's the point where people started asking me, "Andrew, can you create some of the body flow?"
And I'm like, "You've got to the right place."
And I actually got it with my wife.
It's a tool that's done, and it's doing a lot of refugee in the past.
So I asked her, "Look at me, like, switch some teenagers out for us?"
And she did it.
So we took her ears to the lab.
And then we started making them.
Yes, I know.
It's a great lab, people.
And then we've got cells on them.
And this is the result.
The listening, my lab is not in the Olympic manufacturing.
People actually worked on it for decades.
Here's the thing: commercials can be really expensive and accurate, because they're producing neural materials, animals or animals.
We've used faces that are made a few forms.
What's more cool here is it's not that hard to do these things.
The way you need to be built from the wind, and the central respect requires just soap and water.
So what we did was put all the instructions on the web as open code.
And then we've been reduced a police company, and we're going to put together together to do it easier for everyone who has a blind and fight to create these things in the house.
What's interesting to me is if one day, it would be possible to fix, rebuild our body with things that we find in the kitchen.
And if you're talking about a kitchen, here's France.
They're beautiful, and they're making your name into a strange moon.
And now, I was in my kitchen, and I realized that when you look at the trees of the France, what you see is these tiny categories.
And when you look at them in the lab, you can see how the theater creates these structures.
This picture represents me two things: our blood vessels and structure and the organization of the nerves and our service.
So here's the question: Can we grow climate and curiosity over these steps?
Because if we can, then maybe we can use the Egyptians to create new bees between the team of fossil objects and accurate.
Or maybe even the definition.
Don't get me wrong -- it's very challenging and really hard work to do, and we're not the only ones who work on it.
But we're the only one that's used in Los Angeles.
And now, we've got a really crazy information.
And we're working with tissue engineers and nervous engineers to figure out what's really possible.
So listening, all the work I showed you, the things I've come around me on the stage and the other projects that my lab is involved in which everybody's a direct result of my game with your hair.
A game -- a game is a main part of my scientific concept.
So I admit my brain to be not an academic and creative and decided to create an extended human beings.
So, the next time you're looking at a sustainable technology, a coffee and a chicken, I want you to think about me.
Because I want it.
I want to see, please find any way to communicate with me, and let's see what we can build.
Thank you.
Thank you.
In the hand, how many of you know at least one person's products on the screen?
Wow, it's almost all of you.
That's the truth, they're really very proud of their lives.
Do you know what they all have in common?
Everybody has gone from the heart cancer.
But, even though these are very nervous news, also in the personal story, we have an aware of what this disease can be.
It's become the third flow of cancer death, when only eight percent of the patients will survive beyond the use of years.
It's a very fine number, mostly compared to the cancer cancer, where they're almost 90 percent.
So it wasn't a surprise that the death is in a heart cancer that was almost repeat.
What's surprising is, in the last 40 years, this paper didn't even change a little bit, even though we've had a significant progress with other types of dollars.
So, how can we make treatments for the heart cancer cancer more?
In medicine, I like to work on problems that look inevitable, their limitations, and trying to look for creative solutions that can change their final result.
The first problem of the heart cancer is that the heart is in the middle of the cancer, just means.
He's been described in the screen on this screen.
But at the time, we've been looking at it until I'm going to put the rest of the men out of it.
In addition, it's surrounded by many positive organisms, as the walls, the wall and the cases.
The ability of the tumor to grow into these organs is why the heart cancer is one of the most powerful tumors.
The hard region of this approach is motivated from the doctor's doctor's doctor's doctor's doctor's doctor's doctor's disease, as we're going to do a cancer cancer, for example.
These reasons make the chemistry as the only option for the patient's patient's heart cancer.
The second problem is.
Just notice there's a little bit of a blood tool.
And why would we care about the blood press the tumor?
Let's get rid to a second how a museum works.
It's a weird drug that's used to survive and it's reduced to the entire body until it comes to the tumor.
It's like to drive a quick speech in trying to get to the bottom.
And what's going to happen to your negative wouldn't make a statement?
You'll never get there.
And it's exactly the problem with chemistry and heart cancer.
The drugs are designed for all the body.
They're going to get to healthy men, a thing that's going to lead to a very useful effect to the patient's body, but a little bit of going to grow.
So, very limited effects.
I think, it's usually a transparency against intuition when we're trying to travel to a specific man.
But, in the last 40 years, money, studies and many cases have become the best of new drugs and streets itself to treat the heart cancer, but nothing is done in a change where we're doing it for a patient.
After the two problems we've learned, I'm going to give you good news, I hope.
With cooperation from MIT and the general hospital from MIT in Boston, we've come out of a way that we've been treating cancer in this way that we've made a local source of drugs for reality.
We're actually going to give you on your hand, we're going to move away from that to all the rise of the river.
We've launched the drug in devices that are coming like this.
They're strange to be patients and cells into the small, so the doctor can put them right on the tumor in its face.
But they're listening enough so that when they're focused on the tumor, they're working as a car.
In fact, they're motivated in a physical way from the tumor to other men, and that's how you control lights.
In addition, the techniques are tools.
So the moment that we've gone to the body, they're starting to get out, you're going to put the drug in a local way, creative and more effective than the general treatment that we've done today.
In an ethical studies, we've shown that this local approach can improve the response to 12 times.
We've actually taken a drug that has already changed only in local pressure, where we need it, we've got a 212-year-old response, and we've reduced the most powerful Chinese effect.
We're working without a service to bring this technology to the next level.
We're finished the vast electrodes and the research in the model of the extinction that requires to get an interpretation of the American and the American drugs have to do a clinical trial.
Today, the hospital of the white cancer will die.
We hope that we're going to come up with today and we can reduce their ancestors, to reduce their lives, and maybe we're going to become the heart cancer for care.
That's why we've come up with the perception of the medicine, not just that we're going to make it more powerful and less powerful, we're also opening the door to reduce a little bit of all of the uninevitable problems that represent cancer and beyond it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I've been working as a grandfather for 15 years ago, before I realized I had a problem.
Something was really wrong with me.
It was a year ago in September 11, and America was still not in a war.
We didn't talk about a traffic price.
We didn't even talk about the effect of training and war on human freedom.
I was in Afghanistan for a few months together with the North Korean forces that were in Asian.
At the same time, there was an artificial power, they had a hot airplane, they had Texas, they had Alexandria, and they really proved us quite hard.
I saw very car things.
But I didn't really think it was affecting me.
I didn't listen to it too much.
I went back home to New York, where I'm doing.
And then one day when I went to the bottom, and at the first time in my life, I felt real fear.
I had a serious anthropology.
I've been afraid much more than I've ever worked in Afghanistan.
Everything I've looked at is like he's going to kill me, but I couldn't explain why.
The vehicles were too fast.
There were too many people.
The light was too clear.
Everything sounds too bad, it's all faster.
I went back to the back and I was working on the support and I just wanted it.
When I couldn't get it more, I wanted to go out of the bottom and I went where it wouldn't be.
More later, I found that what happened to me was PTTSD: a traffic flow.
We've evolved as animals, as mammals, to survive periods of sanitation, and if you're alive, you want to respond to unfamiliar people.
You want you to have a sleep sleep, you're going to get a click.
You want you to have aid and get back on the things that can kill you.
You want to go out because it makes you happen, or accurate, because it leaves you a little bit out of buildings.
You're asking you.
It's not very bad, but it's better about it that someone will eat you.
Most people decide quite quickly.
It takes a few weeks, a few months.
I've still got an anthropology, but they're transparency at the end.
I had no idea that it was about the war I saw.
I just thought I was a scientist, and then I thought, "Well, now I'm not crazy."
About 20 percent of people, on the other hand, you're left with an autism code, PTTSD.
They didn't look at the same time.
They don't die of the daily life, but if they're going to get help.
We know that people who are going to get to PTTSD are people who have been conducted to their childhood, who have been worried about their own, people who are very low education, people who have in their own history of psychiatric disorders.
If you give your atmosphere and your wind, most of the risks that are repeated with PTTSD.
So I started learning about it as a journalist, and I realized that something very strange happens here.
It seems that the numbers are moving into the wrong direction.
In every war that we've been built in as an academic, started from the civil war, the ice of the ice is down.
As a result, a percent of the patients have gone.
But the percent of the values have gone.
They're supposed to move the same direction, but they're going to go to the walls.
The last war in Iraq and Afghanistan invited us, thank you to alone, with a third of the patients of the war and Atlantic.
But it also left us is a three percent of the walls.
About 10 percent of the American military are curious soldiers, 10 percent or less.
They're blind in human beings, the hormones of human beings, they'll see their friends.
It's an unusual autonomy.
But it's just 10 percent of our military.
But a half of our military came to the government will express what he's looking at PTSD.
And the reasons make sense we still didn't take on the security.
We've all heard about the great statistics that at average, 22 soldiers of the day, in this country, kill themselves.
Most people don't understand that most of these instructions are the ones of the academic cardiac cards, the generation is, and their decision to stop their lives may not be really related to war that they're going to have 50 years ago.
In fact, there's no statistical relationship between a battery to lose.
If you're in the military and you're a lot more curious, your chance to kill yourself not much more than if you didn't.
In fact, one study found that if you're going to give up in Iraq or in Afghanistan, you've got a little less chance to lose later.
I've learned anthropology in Kenya.
My research work I was doing about the fabric.
I wrote this on the walls of the long-term refugees.
And recently, while I'm studying the PTSD has made me a thought.
I've had a job that I did when I was young, and I thought, I'm sure that the Naji, the Aanki, the Chicai -- I mean, these are millions of genetic -- I'm sure they didn't have PTSD as we have.
When their partners came back from the streets with the American military or from their wars and themselves, I'm sure they've changed back in my life quite confident.
And maybe what's built the PTSD percent didn't have what happened there, but what's a recycling company.
And maybe if you go back to a society that's critical, dirty, and you're basically able to get out of your traffic pretty quickly.
And if you go back to a modern society, most of the risks you're going to stay in the train for the rest of your life.
In other words, maybe the problem isn't, the muscles that are released; maybe the problem is we.
Obviously, the modern society didn't get to human freedom, by every single hand there.
The more the wealth comes in the society, the intervention rate costs instead of learning.
If you live in a modern society, you've got eight times more likely to cure depression during your life than you've been living in a agriculture, a second.
The modern society has been shown as much as the highest and depression and depression and religion and survival and children in human history since.
I've seen a study that women in Nigeria, one of the more depression and violence and corruption in Africa, with women in North America.
And the highest depression was of women in North America.
It was also the worst group.
Let's go back to the American military.
Fifty percent are curious.
About 50 percent of the FTSD.
About 40 percent of the insects really didn't push the traffic beyond the trees, but they came home just to find that they're failed to be in a way and they're accurate.
So what happens with them?
What's going on with these people, those 40 percent of the dreams that come in a problem but don't understand why?
Maybe it's this: Maybe they had a experience of a kind of restaurant in their restaurant when they were beyond the tools.
They eat together, there's together, they're going to get task and move together.
They've been scared on each other with their lives.
And then they go back home and they left all this behind and they go back to society, modern society, which is hard even people who never had in the military.
It's just hard to everyone.
And we continue to focus on the train, PTSD.
But many of these people, maybe it's not training.
I mean, of course, soldiers experience traffic and those who have had to get care care.
But many of them -- maybe what's offered to them is this decline.
I mean, maybe we're just using the wrong word to this, and just change the language that we use, our understanding, will help a little bit.
"The Freedom has failed after service."
Maybe even the name of this will be able to get some of these people to stop trying to imagine the train that didn't really happen to explain the feeling that they really feel.
And in fact, it's a very dangerous feeling.
The wind and depression might be able to fight.
These people are very good at the conference.
And it's very important to understand why.
The Israeli Army has one of PTSD.
The theory is that everyone in Israel should be a chain in in the military.
When soldiers come back from the first line, they're not going to go around in a civil environment.
They go back to the community where everybody understand what it came from.
Everybody there would be all there.
They all understand the situation in which they are.
It's like everybody's looking at one big.
We know that if you take a lab in the lab and make it traffic and remove me to a blog, you can sell the symptoms of the train almost forever.
And if it's the same road in a lab that's going to go back to the load with other roads, after a few weeks, it's going to be quite fine.
After 111 in September, the lesson on on the Nigerian has gone through 40 percent.
It's the decline rate.
The fourth rate of violence in New York City went after the 11 in September 11.
Even soldiers are released from violence before they got from PTSD and talked about improvement in water after what happened in September 11.
The reason for this is that if the training experience is shared for a society, we don't fit and make each other.
We're one phones to the other. We're going to go back.
In fact, we're going to become a trick, and the process of the background feels so good, which is even help people who lose mental problems.
While the blog in London, the Amazon in the psychiatric parts were going down in the period of the stem cells.
For some time, it was a country that was an American soldiers repeat -- a unique country.
We looked at each other.
We've tried to understand the threat that we've learned.
We tried to help ourselves and a world.
But it changed.
Now, Americans, American soldiers repeat back to the country that she's crazy in which two politicians come from each other's second in the age of the country, in which it's trying to wait in security and savings of their country.
The forest between the rich and the poor is bigger than ever.
And it's just going to be a metaphor.
The relationship between terrible, terrible objects.
There's prosperity and even corporations in the streets against social justice.
And we're released to know that every trick is treating itself in this way -- in fact, all of the plug that's going to take a look like this -- they're not going to see the world.
We were excited about it.
The soldiers are released out and they come back and see their country in new eyes.
And they see what happens.
It's the country that transition are dead.
It's not surprising that they're in depression.
It's not surprising that they're laughing.
Sometimes, we ask ourselves if we can save the insects.
I think the real question is whether we can save ourselves.
If we can, I think the insects are going to be okay.
It's time that this country will be one, and only to help men and women who are going to protect us.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
How many of us have ever seen something that we thought we had to run on, but we decided we didn't do it?
And I don't need to put my hands, but I'm sure it's already happened to someone in this room before.
In fact, when this question was exposed to a group of musicians, 46 percent of them said they did see something and decided that they didn't run on.
So if you put your hand, or you've done it in Sweden, don't feel bad, you're not alone.
This idea of if you've seen something then you have to say something actually is around us.
Even when you're going to go on the top of the river, you can see that these tricks, you're going to hear you into a range of dogs without pushing your identity.
But I'm still feeling that many of us don't feel comfortable to get pregnant called the truth.
I'm a professor of clinics and I'm a decline.
And in my classes, I'm encouraging my students to discover the information if they see it.
Or in other words, I encourage my students to be lucky.
But if I'm really honest with myself, I'm pretty excited about this journey that I'm doing my students.
And here's why.
Many years are under a map.
Turk after you write this out.
Many people choose not to become years because of the fear of management.
On the top of the conditions to organisms, to the income of income, in an income, an income income income.
The choice to become a smoke is a unique struggle.
Their art is tested.
They're their cameras, their brains.
So how do I, as a professor who really care about her students, can encourage them to become years when I know how the world really feels their own?
So, one day I've been forced to a lot of my grandmother's invention for years with my students, and I've been working on a writing for the GPS magazine. "
And she said, "And Los Fego" and he'd have an internal generation.
What can we tell them? "
And I was working on this article, I read about the case, and I really started.
And what I've been excited about is that I've come to the faces and I realized that the workers who were trying to push the corruptions in fact have been trained.
And it made me think about the message I've spent my students.
And it made me think: What if my students were between those workers and Chicago?
On the other hand, if they were to choose to push the corruption, they would draw them.
But on the other hand, if they were to choose that they didn't push on their instructions they knew, by the general agencies today, computers are responsible if they knew something and didn't care about it.
So French is an option.
What's a person who's supposed to do with a choice?
I'm all the people who are aware of the important components for years.
In fact, most of the humanitarians go through their own.
42 percent of the Nazina is reduced by a few years in other ways, like India and Turkey and Turkey.
When you think about some of the Central Revolutionary or historical, they're always suffering around a chain.
Think about Walgae -- came up by a smoke.
Think about Antarcela -- turned out by a chair.
And how can you forget the Berbert right, which was made by Malin?
It takes a huge amount of courage to get out of a light called the truth.
But when we think about the moon from the skin, we usually think about very small words of theories: French, switch, against, Saudi, Sweden.
And these are the right words. These are the ones I can say here on the stage.
So when I'm not in the classroom, I'm going to go around in the country and an Iranian Impion, luck, years and victims were invented.
Because I really want to understand what moves them and bring these experiences into it.
But my interviews with the years are the ones that I've been asked with.
And they stay with me, because they make me a lot of my courage.
If I had the opportunity, was I going to talk?
And so, here are some stories I want to share with you.
This is Mary.
Mary Washington is a mirror from the University of North Korea in Chile, a case of academic India.
And Mary was an expertise in university and she worked with students, especially ethnic students.
And she noticed, when she went to students, it was that they were the jobs that were much over their clinical level.
She started asking a couple of questions and she found out that there was a magazine of students who could take jobs and put them in their name.
And then she found out that some of her colleagues had put the students into the fake arms just so they could play.
Now, when Mary came to this, it's really angry.
So she tried to go to her song.
But he didn't do anything.
And then Mary was trying to go to the workers of the university of university.
And they didn't do anything.
So, what's going on when no one's listening to you?
You're bringing the things in the blog.
So Mary decided to open a blog.
Her blog became an Iraq in 24 hours, and it was a journalist.
Now, when the same journalist came to her, her identity was already known.
It was important.
When it's a language, it's inherited in the work, and it's got organisms in death, and it's all about a spinal cord.
Mary didn't do anything bad. It didn't take some of the medicine.
It really thought it was a voice of students who were unusual.
But her art was in the test.
His real and her cameras.
Now, the importance of possibilities don't always have to lead to conditions or violence in death.
In fact, in 2002, this list was affected on the forest of magazine, which was actually invented three years of courage on the decision of the truth.
And when you look at the research, just 22 percent of the years, in fact, you're going to look at a minute.
So there's a huge amount of people who are happy and don't prefer them and it gives me hope.
So it's a jihad.
Finson's job is a city of malaria in the city of Denson.
And one day, Jay was at work, as she always did, and she found a pretty interesting case.
You see, Jay was at the end of the month, and she worked on the number of the city's money, and usually, my boss, Robert Kennel, gave her a list of curiosity and said, "Hey, you're going to buy a bank and you're going to put these guys."
And Jay is full of the role.
But on this particular day, Robert was out of the city, and Jay was a conflict.
She's bringing the phone, and she's getting a bank and she says, "You'll send me in the corner of all the customers."
And when she's getting the instrument, she's seeing that there's a minute that there's a little bit of tasks and the dogs that she doesn't recognize before.
It was a math that was sold, but just by Robert.
So Jay looked at science, she was worried about her song picture, who was then the mayor of a bank, and it was led to a big career, a song of six months.
It turns out that the boss of Jay, Robert Carolina has been put in the money.
Ganda was 53 million dollars for a 20-year period, and Jay Bay had discovered it.
Jay is a hero.
And in fact, I had the opportunity to interview my academic film, "All of the Central School."
And Jay didn't get a prison.
In fact, she didn't really want to talk to me for a very long period, but after a strategy, she agreed to do the interview.
But it's a prosperity, not a privacy.
And not for Jay, who knows if this propaganda would have ever come from?
So, remember the same as "Ford" I talked about it, the same I wrote before my talk?
Well, I published it and something amazing happened.
I started getting email from years around the world.
And I started to get these emails and tell them, there was a common subject to the opinion that I got, and that's what he was: They all said, "I've exposed the analogy, people really ask me right now.
I joined, but you know what?
I would do it again if I could. "
And so I went to read this message, all of these consciousness, and I wanted to think what I could share with my students?
And so, I collected everything together and here's what I learned.
It's important for hope.
Many years are hope.
Despite the fair belief, if they don't all work from the materials that they have with the society.
Their hope is what makes them go out to the light.
We also need to take the streets.
Many years are connected.
And this quote called their organization is that makes them want to go out to the light.
Many years are conventional.
Again, they don't search for a prison, but they're also looking for prosperity.
And we need to continue to make a courage.
Many years are real.
Most of them, they don't wait enough to how much the corruption of corruption has affected their family, but what they continue to mention is how hard they had to avoid saying the truth.
In this stage, I want to end with one other name: Pwitter in Boston.
Twitter in Boston was 27 when they worked in the American public health care.
And it's gone to Iran people who had sex disease.
And for his work, it's a heart of the clinical study that's done in the organization.
And it was a study that looked at the progress of an inner disease.
And so, there were 600 men from an American production that had changed in this study.
They've evolved to participate in the research through the joint of medical testing and the transition of free.
And so, what happened is that in the next few years, the inner reduction that's helping treatment.
And what's going to notice is that the research participants didn't get a penguin to treat their graph.
And the participants didn't know it.
So like Mary, Pwitter was trying to predict and response to them in the organization, but no one was listening to him.
And then Pwitter thought it's really not fair and it's been trying to return, and eventually he talked to journalism -- just like Mary.
And in 1972, it was published in the New York Times "New York Times": "The victims of American research didn't fit for 40 years."
It's a familiar case that we're now familiar with a safe experiment.
And Pwitter was the device.
What happened to those 600 men, do you ask? They're the same 600 men from Mexs?
28 men died from a camp.
A hundred of them have been reduced by the decades in the wave, 40 women were born and children were born with a restaurant.
Who knows how these numbers would look like to the real woman of Pwitter?
We're all interested in the Pwitter, actually.
If you know someone who's participated in a clinical study, the reason we have a magnitude today is because of some of the real object of Pwitter.
So let me ask you a question.
It's the same question from Kenya, a version of the original question.
How many of you have ever used a concept that Tanka, Freedom, Milliam, smoke, Smith?
Somebody?
Before you've got to do it, I want you to think a little bit.
Maybe they're the musician, the Porter and the Center of the world.
You can be the person that changes the world's history, or they can be the person who's going to have your world.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
When the vehicles began to avoid people in many rural areas they were never going to be reduced to the horses.
Like less than a hundred years, you're going to hear it in front of cars, phones, radio devices, TV and computers.
Every single one of those has been reduced from his own chimps.
There were even expertise that they didn't go. "
Of course, we can't move how to exactly the future or what the inventions will be in.
But we're again and again, we're not able to predict that the technologies of the day we're going to change the disease.
And a new study is a similar pattern in our private life: we can't predict changes ourselves.
Three psychologists were going to be able to predict personal changes in the article from 2013, "The Adam Revolution of history." The article is called the president of the country's scientific scientist, Francisco Francisco, which is the last democracy, or in the last way, "in their history. &quo
Scientists have come over 7,000 participants in 18 to 68.
They asked the president of the participants for their current personality, their interventions and their features, to take a description of those 10 years ago.
The other half described these machines themselves today, to the front of how to look at 10 years.
Think of their answers were thinking about the lesson of the change that every transformation is going to look at or except.
In any age of the age of age, they've been reducing the powerful change for the long-term change.
I mean, they've made the transformation that the 18th century was reduced to the transformation of the 28.
In addition, in all the cases, the future transformations were born in inequality for the changes that they would describe more adults.
The 20th century was born that in the age of 30 still would love the same tools, but the 30s we've already changed them in food.
The 1930s they've had them good friends at 40, but the '40s are made with their friends.
And in the 40s, they've been able to have them a service for the 1950s.
Even though, the adults have changed less than the young people, they've been looking at the system that you could change the same way.
In any point of life, we tend to think that our personal change behind us.
One result of this thinking is we're going to be able to implement our future choices on our current preferences.
In average, people are willing to pay about 60 percent more to see a surprise of the favorite musician today in 10 years of what they're willing to pay today to see the musician that was love about 10 years ago.
Whereas the risks are invented to the motion, we're tend to think of the worse in more serious, like a house and a job.
In the same time, there's no real possibility to predict what our president will be in the future.
Unfortunately the history of history, it's going to be hard to go to a long-term programs.
So the history of history is taking care of our personal lives, but what about the big world?
Could we make sure that what was it going to be?
So, we've got infinite instruments that give us that the world really changes, sometimes for good.
Our moment in history is not a history of history, and it's where it's a source of land and it's a place to worry.
I want to talk about a kind of money.
I'm not like most of the people you've heard about protests before.
I'm not going to join or public workers.
I'm not an academic, internal or political.
And as in the surface, you've gone from the connection of materials, I'm also not fair.
But most of these people will tell you that the concept of business is an invention; no one will never be able to do it; and that's dangerous; women's infant and emotional.
In fact, most of these people will say, "You need to be laughter that you can't."
Maybe it sounds sense to you.
It sounds a sense for me to the last few months of 2009, when I was working in two independent jobs in a minimum form.
Each month of my classroom was just doing my beautiful task.
I was an answer and my life didn't go anywhere.
Like a lot before, I decided that Syrus was a better option.
Now don't go -- I'd like to wait in a place.
But it wasn't going to happen at most, and my features had to be dead.
So I went into my first crisis in the web.
In years, I had a long time to think.
I repeated the ideas I had ever had on the walls.
I've been asked a lot of thought to hide and nature of work under capitalism.
I thought about the unprecedented and the right work and the cultural work of women.
I've been extended and violence at work.
I thought about what I had to protect other workers from these things.
Maybe you thought about them.
In this talk, I'm going to show you the four main sensors that have been affected on the species industrial industry in the world, and I'm probably not facing; why you don't actually bring the product that's working on.
So I'm going to tell you about what we are, as the species, actually want.
The first approach is completely spread out of the law.
Half of the world, including Rosa, South Africa and most of the United States, dragging the Syx industry by making all of those who are going to go to the trees.
So it's the musicians, the customers and a third side.
These countries are probably the fear of inevitable people from a conservation of sex.
But if you've got to choose between a law and make yourself and your family, you're going to look at any case, and you'll take the risk.
It's been spread out of the shape, it's a traffic.
It's hard to get a conventional job when you've got a French.
You can't forget you.
The conversation you still need money, you're going to be asked in the lowest economy.
The law makes you continue to sell a cosmos, which is exactly the opposite of the exact effect.
It's been exposed out of the law that leaves you exposed to the worst of the country itself.
Many places you might want to pay fear or even have sex with Twitter to avoid a product.
The police and the secret in Kenya, for instance, they've been treated by the species industrial workers, what you can just describe as content: organisms in the weapon, electricity, electricity, Amazon and I'm going to describe food.
Another thing: If you're familiar with sex in places like Kenya, South Africa or New York, Twitter can stop you if you've been scared with conferences, because studies can be used as an interview that you're familiar with.
Of course, it's increasing the risk of HIV.
Imagine you know that if you're going to be tremendous issues, it's going to be using you.
It's pretty powerful to leave them in the house, right?
The Chinese industrial workers in these places are going to do hard choices between doing the production or do risk.
What would you choose?
Would you be convenient in the way to work?
What about you would worry that Twitter would give you when he put you on a restaurant?
The second approach to the species that looks like in these countries is a paralysis out of the road, where Kenya and a church of Sycus are extinction, but the costs around, like a fire of a bank or a road in the street, a grandfather.
The laws like this -- we have in England and and French -- basically say to the right industry, "Hey, we don't care that you're going to use sex, just worry that it's going to do behind dozens of roads and worked."
And I've got a web, by the way, it's limited as two industrial workers or more working together.
It's not the rule that many of us are working alone, which is what we're going to make us move to water for water.
But we're also surprising if we're choosing to go through the law at work together.
A couple of years ago, my company was going to have a little bit after she got a job, so I told her she had to meet her customers instead of my time.
Over the same time, we had another guy who was doing a traffic.
I said to choose to leave or I'm going to call the police.
And he looked at us and he said, "I can't read to the police.
I'm going to work together, this place is not rules. "
And he was right.
He left at the end without making physical elements, but the knowledge we've gone on the law is reducing the man on the day.
He felt safe he was going to make it.
You don't have a street on the street also causes more damage is motivated.
First of all, to avoid a production, a street workers take risks to avoid pollution, and it means to work alone or in places like important forests there are vulnerability.
If you're getting familiar with a tree in the outside, you're paying a piano.
How do you spend the conference without going to work in the streets?
It was the need of a collection of the head that brought you to the street.
And that's what you're going to do, and you're going to go into a magic pixels of a sex conference to pay the experiences that you've got on the horizon.
I'm going to tell you about America a coffee that's working in Berberg, East East London.
The street workers in her region usually have been waiting for customers in the groups of security in numbers and to invite each other about how to avoid certain kinds of structures.
But during a traffic method on the right and their customers, she'll want to work alone to avoid a product.
It's going to happen to death in the early days of 29 in October, 2013.
She worked later, she was trying to pay the conference that she got on a tumor.
So if you spread out of the law of the right workers in them, why don't you just get out of the walls of people who are sex?
It's the goal of the third method that I want to talk about -- the inequal model and the president of the work of sex.
The idea behind this law is that you're making sex is a music in the device and so you're, in fact, you're going to go to the right side of the option.
Despite the support of what many times is described as "The Freedom," there's dogs that it works.
There's the same amount of implications in Sweden as it was before.
Why is that?
It's because people are familiar with a lot of times there's no other income options.
If you need this money, the only effect that you're going to have in businesses is to ensure you're going to reduce the prices or save more species.
If you need to find more customers, you might have a help of management.
So you see, instead of creating what's described a lot of times as a customer, that's what actually gives you a third side that can be fossil.
To keep myself at work, I'm trying to not take the art of someone who's interested in me from a particular book.
If it's home or exploring the window, I'm trying to get there full and details.
If I was working under the equal model, the customer was too afraid to give me this information.
Maybe I didn't have a choice but get an investment from an invisible person if it would become later to the allies.
If you need the money, you need to protect your customers from the police.
If you're working outside, it means to work alone in unprecedented places, just as if you've made yourself sacrifice.
It might say to the cars faster, to make less time say sophisticated decisions.
Is the guy a particular guy or just nerves?
Can you afford the risk?
Can you afford to do that?
Something I hear a lot of times, "Good will be okay if we're going to do this rules and activate it."
We call this approach to civilization, and it's using countries like Holland, Germany and India in the United States.
But it's not a great model for human rights.
And the walls of a country, a commercial cartoon can only happen in certain rural areas or faces, and workers have to stand in unique limits, like no health and health care.
The emotion you've heard is great about the trick, but politicians are going to make emotions around the sex industry and hard to stand in.
It's creating a system in two levels: sacrificity and not sophisticated.
We sometimes call it "We've been exposed out of the background."
I've been a rich of rich, rich, and men can stand up with emotions, but less local people find these inevitable patients.
And even if it's possible basically, to get a failure to where you take time and get money.
It wouldn't be an option for someone who's pregnant and needs money for night.
They may be refugees or strength from being in the house.
In this decade, the most vulnerable people have to work in prison, so they're still exposed to all the agencies that I mentioned earlier.
So.
It looks like we're going to try to control or prevent the work of business from going to happen so much more dangerous to sell sex.
It's fear of the law that makes them work alone in rural places, and it allows the customers and even the TV to become worthy that they're going to get out of it.
French and retirements of people continue to sell sex, instead of enable them to stop.
Technological customers pushing the books to take risks and hands of managers are made in potential.
These rules are also transparency and proposed against the species.
When the French brought the Sweden model two years ago, normal citizens took it as a reality to start to make faces against people who work on the street.
In Sweden, a crowdness of audience show that more people want workers to be right now from the law.
If you don't have this kind of happy, you might ask, why is it such popular?
First of all, a species has always been a strategy of corporate strategy for all kinds of very popular groups: people in the skin, the galls, people with pregnancy, especially women.
It's the groups that computers and prosperity through the rules of prison.
I don't think it's wrong.
These laws have political support just because they're machines to people who choose don't want to see or know about them.
Otherwise, why would people die in an instrument?
Well, a lot of people have bodies about training women.
People are important that women are repeated and reduced to sexual workers can be reduced by reducing all the industries.
So let's talk about women's trade.
The work that's happening in many industries, especially those of the workers are rich or vulnerable in a different way, and it has to be a patient.
But it's the best patient with a piece that's going to mean these slides, not all the industry.
As a 23 of the musicians were not scared at the time they were collected in the France of Mounty in 2004, there were no career to get out of the bank of the sea industry to save curiosity in the person.
The solution is obviously obviously to give the workers more crisis, and they can predict and reduce it to disabilities without fear.
The way the motor is trained in the person is only offering that all the unusual cities come to the power.
In fact, many of the leaders did a decision, out of economic need, put themselves in people's hands.
A lot of doing this in a full advantage that they're going to make sex when they're going to come up with blood.
And yes, it's a lot of times it can be the case that these people's health will have been reduced, and they'll take the cities to work at work that they don't want to be surprised.
It's true to the walls, but it's also true for agriculture, to health and workers.
In the end, no one wants to take it to do any kind of work, but it's the risk that most cities are ready to take, because what they're left behind.
If people had to live in the rules they didn't have to put their lives in the hands of people's lives.
The problems that have been spread out of the line of the approach, just like they're coming out of a fabric of the sex work itself.
It's the lesson of history.
If you're trying to define something that people want to do or do, whether it's an alcohol or the boundaries of boundaries or the production of sex, you're creating more problems you're developed.
You don't have the rules in the cockroach changes for people who actually do these things.
But it does a big difference to whether they're safe when they're doing it.
Otherwise, why do people die in the prison?
As a feminist, I know that the species industry is the place for social inequality.
It's a fact that most of the cartoons are men with money, and most of the muscles are women without.
You can agree with all of this -- I'm a component -- and still think it's not normal policy.
In a good world and more equality, maybe there were many less people who are known to survive, but you can't just stop a better world.
If someone has to sell a concept because it's poor or because it's a privacy or because they're not worthy and they can't get a common job, this option doesn't do them less than two or transform them or change their attitude.
People worry about sex is an invasion.
Would it ask yourself: Is it more than a fire or see your kids are being scared?
There's no career for people to sell a metaphor or get a crisis, even though most people who do these jobs are old and causes.
It's the fact that the selection is known as a specific cosmos that's caused for some uncomfortable features.
And I can understand why the species's industrial industry is involved.
People have all kinds of complex emotions when it comes to the corner.
But we can't do policies on the basis of just emotional, especially not on people's dogs that actually affect all of these rules.
If we're going to go through the species's work, we're going to get to a situation that we're worried more to a certain sense of inequality, instead of the reasons in the studies.
People are going to really go to a question, "Well, do you want your daughter to do this?"
This is the wrong question.
Instead, imagine she does it.
How safe is at work?
Why is it not safe?
So we looked at a completely out of the bubble, extended, the equal model and the lawyers and the rules, and how everyone causes to stop.
Something I'll never hear is, "What's the species workers want?"
After all, we're the ones that are affecting these rules.
His New York Talk Bayla's instrument in 2003.
It's venture to remember that the crowd was spread out of the law and income to the law they didn't get the same thing.
The insurance was invented by the rule of the rules that are focused on the species industry, instead of treating the species just like others.
In New Zealand, people can work together in a conversation, and the employees of sex are responsible for the country.
Students can be able to buy every time, for every reason, and 96 percent of the workers on the street that they feel that the law remains their identities.
And New Zealand actually didn't know about the people who were going to work on, but insurance has become much more safe.
But the lesson from Alexandland is not a certain piece is good, but positive, it's written in cooperation with the species, mostly, the previous perspective of New Yorker.
When it comes to ensure the arguments of the species, they were willing to hear it directly from the species themselves.
Here in England, I'm part of a group that's taken by a species like the French university to the right and the anthropic perspective.
And we're creating some of a global motion that requires an insurance of the law and self-definition.
The universal trade of our movement is the red trick.
We're support our emotions by global bodies like UNAIS, the global health organization and interest.
But we need more partners.
If you care about a rational equality or poverty or public health, the right rights works for you.
We did a place in your motions.
It means not just listening to the truth when we're talking about but to define our voices.
We've gone to those who make us, these are the ones that say that's a fair is or too expensive, too much surprise to know what's best to myself, or a too local rights and too important, not represents the millions of Nigerian victims.
The diagnosis between the victims and the regulations is special.
It's especially in order to ensure in the species and do it easy to move away from us.
It's certainly a lot of you working in your life.
Well, there's also a species working.
Just like you, some of us love our jobs, some of us hate them.
In the end, most of us have involved emotions.
But how we feel about our work is not the point.
And how other people feel about our work is certainly not.
What's important is we have the right to work in security and our conditions.
The right workers are real people.
We had complex experiences and complex reactions to these experiences.
But our feelings are not complex.
You can ask a lot of cases in New York City, I've been working on a web in Kenya, a street worker in South Africa and all my old job in Southern, and they'll tell you the same thing.
You can talk to millions of workers and there's no improvement organizations without species.
We want an instrument that was invited from an artificial and work rights as workers.
I'm just working one species on the stage today, but I'm bringing a message from all over the world.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So that's James Robert.
You may know it as a journalist caused a France of New York Times.
A lot of before someone made the name of San San San San San, Richard wrote a book where he published a NSA that was a quote in a way that was not the rules of Americans.
But it's another park in the book that maybe the left is much larger.
In it, it's describing a little bit of a cosmologist in which CIA actually gave the programs of a graph of Iran.
If it sounds crazy, you're going to read it.
This is an amazing story.
But you know who doesn't love this park?
The United States government.
For almost a decade later, San was underneath the Foundation of the United States where the colors were able to demand against one of the regulations.
And in a way, it turned into the last mirror of the United States's recent government to an extension of opinions and then after journalists.
You see, under the first baby to explore, the journalists have the right to publish information to the public good.
But it's impossible to apply this right if the media can't collect these news and protect people's identities and women who believe them.
So when the government came to laugh on the door, Richard did what a lot of real journalists did in front of him: he was a movie and he said he's going to go to prison.
So from 2007 to 2015, San Errin is living under the threat of going to go to French.
All of this, a few days before the sentence, when a interesting thing happened.
All of a sudden, after years of argument that it's vast to fix, the government has been reduced to a completely regulation.
It turns out, in a generation of electronics, there's a little bit of places where journalists and cases can come in.
And instead of trying to reduce Brushin to the front, they used his electronic button to survive.
So, in a spontaneous and convenience, the colors brought the conversations of Robert.
They brought his email's email, his financial information and his president, his Israeli cousins, even his president actions with the task that he's a plane.
And it was a part of information where they used to move Jeopardian, the source of Richard's library and exposure of CIA.
Unfortunately, it's just one case of many.
The president of Obama was killed on the conversation to protect the privilege of the evidence, and instead, his sentence is seven more than all the other governments have come together.
Now, you can see how it can be a problem, especially because the government's thinking so much about what it does as a secret.
Since 9 / 11, almost every important story about national security was the result of extinctions that were in terms of journalists.
So we're looking at seeing the journalists can't do the work that the first pencil is supposed to protect it because the capacity of government to Google after everyone.
But as technology allows her to prevent the rights of journalists, the journalists can use technology to protect their curiosity even better than the past.
And they can start from the moment that they start talking to them, rather than the president after the woman.
The communication programs now don't have any prosperity when San France wrote the book, which are much more likely to come from the normal emails or television.
For example, one tool is a Detroit, an open-source system that's been developed by a source of evidence that a source of intervention has been created by the weird weapon, and now you're reduced by the organization without a long-term organization that I'm working.
Instead of sending an email, you go to the site of new organization, like the one of the Washington Pacific.
Over, you can train a screen or send a very similar information to how you use every single piece of creation.
It's Japan, and he'll live on a chain that only the new organization has access to it.
So the government can't feel more to worry about the information, and a lot of the information that they're going to be wrong with.
Scotch, with that, it's really a small part in the corner to define the freedom of freedom in the 21st century.
Unfortunately, governments around the world are opening up all the time, new regulations that are all of us in a concept.
And it depends on us to continue to worry that it's not just afraid of technology's evidence, like Edward San San, which has access to an interpretation.
It's about the same way to protect the next privilege of extinction health in the military health that tells us about deep hospital, or the next environmental worker that's going to affect the local water's water of French, or Wall Street will make us because the next economy.
After all, these tools aren't only about to help people and women who are the courageous, but they're going to protect all of our possibilities under the crisis.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I know that TED is about many big things, but I want to talk about something very small.
Very small, one word.
And the word is "Rag."
This is one of my favorite words, because it's so low.
It's a person who's killing what's suffering.
Or a person who doesn't notice.
Or, "A person who's hard to take new conditions and new environments."
I'm worried about it.
And I'm here for the other fish that's around us, because I'm never worried.
I'm going to tell you a terrible story.
Somewhere at the beginning of my three years, my dream to be a privilege of money.
In fact, it came to my master's description that's given me about a huge axis on a short story that I wrote.
The story of a business in my life when an artificial animal, and in my privilege life at home, and a little bit about how a forest and an eye can get you to lose your chicken.
The price is going to go to New York City to access with big walls and other agencies.
The dream of everyone who wants to be a writer, right?
You know what I did on the day where the magic came to me?
Because I've been, I've put the letter on the table in the kitchen, I've been invited to myself a huge rock of a wall and a kitchen, and I've just sat there for my entire day, and I've just been in a camp.
I thought about all the ways that I've already mentioned myself.
Who I'm going to get to New York and I'm going to do this?
Who was I at all?
Let me tell you who I was.
I was worried.
Like other children, I grew up at home in a contrast and a fire I made out of them in life.
I've already had two instructions that had been reduced as a regular failure.
I've been proud of Jajek, but it's also two and maybe a third time that I didn't care about the connection.
And I went from a documentary word.
I've got to get two actions in the prison house.
So I came to the right stage.
But I think the real reason for my friends was my daughter's death on the day she was born, and my colleagues to find a way to live with this story.
After my daughter's death, I was also safe for a long period, and I've been living under a blueprint in a kind of organization, and we've looked at it all over the way.
And maybe we're all -- if we live enough.
Social is between the worst fish because they started their lives like us.
As you can see, I was nearly devastating in every possible theory: a girl, a mother, a learning.
And my dream to be a secret was like a little bone and a sad song I had in the moon.
I had to fight myself to move on the airplane and plane to New York City to the end.
Herry friends, I see you.
I recognize you in the audience.
At the beginning, you were there.
You could choose three pounds of chimps, and you would like you a meeting with them.
There were you used in a German window, where you could go to Scotscoffee at night with cool people, sophisticated and beautiful people.
And you'd be able to predict that you're also cool and beautiful and old.
And you'd get a lot of walls and agencies and suicide in very rational forces.
I'm going to ask me a couple of pounds.
Audience: How many of them?
Linda January: I've got to admit, I've got to do three pounds of chimpanzees -- Laughter) three different restaurants.
And I went to my insects.
And I wanted to have some lucks to believe that all of this really happened when I went back home.
Three of the secrets I wanted to meet was a microscope, Linn Talk and Pubama.
They didn't have a chimpanzees with a crisis, but for me, they were a huge disasters.
It's called the book that's more likely to become my DNA for art.
Linn Sylin gave me a sense to believe that there's a chance that my stories can be part of the world.
And I'll see where my brain might be more important than my piece.
They wouldn't have the centuries from the central finger, they've been scared in the central finger with their body story, like you put the German Canada.
I've almost died from a disease when I met with these three secrets of refugees.
And the reason I've been a little bit of a disease is that I've never had a conversation like this.
I've never noticed in this room.
My mother didn't learn in Kenya.
And my creative career until then there was a small thing and design that was born in the president.
My first night in New York, I wanted to die there.
I thought, "You're going to feel me right now.
"Some of you will understand what happened later.
I brought me to France's office, who's training and Jim.
You've taken the books out of France, that Tasmans and Jim was my dream.
Atlantic Alexis and France or Jankokotu published the books there.
The personal need was scared me and scared with me a long conversation. He was trying to convince me that there was a book in my life when my life was living.
A book of memories.
And while he was talking to me, I sat there and I was living there and I sat like Iraq with my hands and I couldn't get any of the revolution.
In the end, it's going to take me on the other hand, a feedback of a living artist.
And I'm going to have a success dream, and I'll give me a few books and led me to the room room.
So take me to the schools of his daughter, and his son.
But it didn't happen.
Basically, I felt like I'd put my home in the night, and I'm going to move the wall when the stars are pushing my name over the universe.
It was such a huge thing for me.
Do you understand?
Their personal diplomacy, a Saudi House, has been able to look at the Iraq in the Iraq, the posters and the monkeys and said, "So, you'll send me something, look at and right!"
Most of the people, and especially the people of TED, there were trees to the mayor, right?
It took me more than 10 years even to imagine that I'm trying to try something to the kitchen and shoot.
At the last night, I had a big accident in the National School.
And at the end of the Kenyan Centrance Central School, Hott and Pacific was going to be happy to me, pushing me in a place where I'm going to get me.
I've been there and I've been afraid.
It happened to you?
And as I started to wait because all the people in the room were to wear so beautiful, and everything I got out of the revolution was, "I don't know. I need to think about it."
And she said, "Okay," and she went.
All of the hands that were focused on my friends, the little boy and the bone in my moon...
You see, I'm trying to tell you something about people like me.
People are killing -- we don't always know how to code or say, or to choose the big friend, even when it's really comfortable.
That's the shame that we're scared with us.
It's hard to want something good.
The shame feels good.
It's the song to believe that we're going to be in the room with the people that we're moving.
If I could, I would go back and feed myself.
I was just like the old women's female girls who helped me.
I would teach myself how to want, how to go and ask.
I would say, "Yes! Yes, you!
It's also the beetle. "
But I went back to the organization, and when I looked at the walls and the rain that came back and turned out, I just had a lot of little boundaries of objects.
I thought about how, if I was a finished, I was a decline.
In fact, I'm going to go back to the magazine without telling, without suicide, and just with a mayor and full of memories about how I sat so close to the physical agencies.
Scientists were the only rule I showed myself.
And yet, when I was at the house in the front of you, again, I could still hear their voices.
They said, "Don't listen to one who's trying to predict you or change your story."
They said, "The Niki Kiky's voice to the story that you just know to tell."
They said, "Sometimes tell a story is the thing that brings your life."
And now, as you see, I'm a woman who's on five.
And I'm a secret.
And I'm a mother.
And I'm a teacher.
And guess who they're my favorite students.
And despite it didn't happen on the day where the dopamine switched in my mayor, I wrote a memories of memory, called "The Rome of the water."
The stories of all the time I had to reinvent myself from my choices, the stories of how my library was actually just the most strange cities to beautiful things.
I just had to make a voice to a story.
In most cases, there's a mystery that's talking about to go after the dreams.
It's called "The journey of the connection."
But I'm a different mystery, who's found a little bit of this aircraft or a coffee.
It's called "The Miss" of the House. "
And so it's a village: it's also at the moment, also at the same moment itself, you're beautiful.
You still don't know it, but you have an infinite capacity to invent yourself.
This is your beauty.
You can be teachers, you can be survival of abstraction, you can be released from the prison, you can be moral, you can lose all your money or your job or your partner, or the worst of all, a child.
You can even lose your partner.
You can stand at the heart of your failure, and yet, I'm just here to tell you, you're so beautiful.
Your story needs to be heard, because you, you're the privilege and you're special, you're the new species, you're just able to tell your unique story.
And I'm going to listen.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's the discovery of the French Mount in the 1929 made scientists around the world to go to the top of a platform.
Your engineering team developed a genetic device to explore it.
It's a collection of 27 dollars in the form of a box that's going to activate all of the scientific experiments that are going to be able to develop the dynamic.
The dolphins can be complicated to a big box of 3xxx3, when every brain is surrounded anywhere in Kenya, anywhere in Ethiopia.
It can also move and represent itself in a different organism.
Now your work comes from.
It's going to have a special piece of genome for each of the extreme environments in which they're going to go.
The red nose is going to be an atom against the short space. The road will protect it from a high level when it comes into the atmosphere of the RRRR-29, and the green fingerprint is coming from the electrical foreign foreign foreign forests.
You can put the expectations on each of the 27 dollars in any way you want, but every Japanese can only get one piece.
You need to figure out how you can put the colors so that the customers can reduce themselves and reduce only red, so a rock, and then green.
How can you put the fossil expectations on all the 27 walls so that the bridge would be able to do the journey?
Stop here if you want to discover yourself.
You can start with the tree of the coast of the reference in red, because you're going to have it anyway.
So you can take it to 27 parts, and look at what you have.
There's eight curiosity in corruption, that every one has three red faces, 12 curiosity codes, that every one has two red faces, six faces, every single single single one is red, and it's a single one in the middle of the center that doesn't have red face.
You've been looking at all 54 faces at this point, so you're going to have the same number of faces as well as the fossil and the fabric.
When you're finished, you'll have 54 faces in the red, 54 faces in the green, and 54 faces in the road.
It's 162 faces, which is just a few faces that have the customers in the same way.
So there's no profit in the switch.
If there's a way to do this, it's probably going to be very symbol.
Maybe you can use it to help you.
You look at the central community.
You're going to do it half in the green and a half in the road, so you can use it to each of these customers, and you don't wait anybody.
There's going to have to be also central lines without green or contrast.
So you take two components of the red line and three faces of one in the road, and three faces of the other green.
Now you've got the fingers that every single one has one in the red.
It's about five faces of each other.
You can put them into two pounds.
In the first group, you're going to take three faces in the green and two faces in the other group, and you've got three faces in the bus two in the green.
If you're based on the symmetry, you're using the value again with the colors reinvented.
It gives you six with one green, six with one red red, and six with one crowd.
If you've made a completely, you're seeing eight lines in every color, six coffee coffees in every color, six cooks in every color, and one central corner.
It means you just need six more customers in the green and the roof.
And there's exactly six curiosity that's left, every one with four pounds.
You're two faces of each in the green and two in the road.
And now you've got a coffee that's made in a perfect journey.
It represents itself to be similar in the deep space, Sola when it comes into the atmosphere of RRR-29, and green when it's been sold through the electrical foreign forests.
When it comes to the Nigeria, you realize that you've been reducing is that people have been scared for eyes: touching with strangers.
In 1919, German mathematician doesn't familiar with a coffee, I'm going to notice a very, very strange idea.
He invented that our universe may actually make more of those three dimensions that we all know.
It means that in the left, right, back, go back, and down, I'm going to notice that there's another dimension of space that's going to be some reason, we don't see yet.
Now, when someone comes up with an idea of convenient and strange, sometimes it's everything that's the same -- motivated, but it doesn't have any connection to the world around us.
The idea of this characteristic, as IT -- although we don't know if it's true or a red, and at the end of the next few years, we might tell us whether it's true or this idea has been a huge impact on the last century and it's going to make a lot of special studies.
So I'd like to tell you something about the story of those other dimensions.
So where are we going to go?
To start, we need a little background.
We'll go to 1907. This year is a year in which Einstein Einstein's good at the top of the fingerprint so that she'll find the private form and decides to take a special project -- trying to figure out the dirt in the Mumbaka and the expansion of Titan.
And at the same moment, there are cultural people around thinking that this project has already been evolved.
Nigeria gave the world a theory at the end of the last century that's done well, it's driving the open movement, the wind movement, and so on, you're going to have the motion of very sophisticated, and you're going to get people on the head.
You can describe all this through Newton's work.
But Einstein was able to figure out what Newton had left something out of the picture, because even Nigerian wrote that even though the effect of how to look at the effect of HIV, it wasn't able to understand how it really works.
How is it that the sun, 93 million miles, somehow affecting the Earth movement?
How's the sun responds beyond the crowd and aerodynamic and producing effect?
And it's a task that Einstein's insulin is able to figure out how it works.
And let me show you what exactly he found.
So Einstein found that the Einstein's camera: the material that's going to have is the space itself.
The idea is like this: imagine that space is the infrastructure of all there.
Einstein said that space is nice and sad, if you don't have any material.
But if there's a material in the environment, like the sun, it's causing the space to open, to move.
And it's spread the power of the continuity.
Even the Earth is spread the space around it.
Now look at the moon.
The moon remains its cell phone, by these ideas, because it's rolling into a station in the environment that's the sun and the surface and the Earth can all create a component of their own.
We go to a look at this.
The Earth itself remained in the road, because it's rolling into a station in the environment that it's interested in the sun.
It's the new idea of how the really works.
Now, this idea was built in 1919 through astronomy expectations.
It really works. It's described the data.
And it represents Einstein in the streets around the world.
And that's what made a little bit of thinking.
He, like Einstein, there was a search for what we call "corruption."
It's one theory that's going to describe all nature's forces out of one ideas, one series of principles, equally if you want.
So Keltt said to himself, Einstein was able to describe as an Italian in terms of solutions and tables in space -- in fact, in space and time, to be just right.
Maybe I can play the same game with the other summer power, which was at the same time, known as the electronic power -- we know about other days, but at the time it was the only other power that people thought about.
You know, the power is responsible to the left and the genetic and so on.
So I want to say, maybe I can play the same game and describe the electronic power in terms of solutions and treatments.
That's the same question: Civil and crowdness in what?
Einstein has already used space and time, in elephants and crops, to describe the jihad.
There was no other thing to move or wear.
So Kord said, well, maybe there's another mystery to space.
He said, if I want to describe one other power, maybe I need one other dimension.
So he imagine that a world has four dimensions of space, not three, and imagine that electronic electronics is developed and tolerance at the same level. Now here's the thing: when he wrote the equations that are developed and communities in the universe with four dimensions, it doesn't find the unemployment that's not going to have three dimensions of space -- these were
And when he looked at the equation was this, not another, the equation that scientists knew at the moment to describe as the electronic power.
Thanks -- it's just jumped.
He was so excited about this understanding that he was pushing around his daughter when he said, "You're going to see!"
Now, obviously, a click was a person who took a very serious theory.
It's for that -- there's a story about this when he wanted to learn to conversation, he called a book, a connection on the south.
It's a person who's going to do his life on theory.
Now, but for those of us who are trying to think a little bit more about thinking, two real questions out of his understanding.
The first: If there's another mystery in space, where are they?
We don't see them.
And the other one: Is this theory really working in details, when you try to put it in the world around us?
Now the first question was born in 1926 by a guy named Oklaka Center.
He invented that learning might exist in two consumers and -- might be big dimensions, which is easy to see, but it might also be a little bit of small, and it's made by themselves, because it's so small, even though they're all around us, so we don't see them.
Let me show you this a visual.
So imagine you're looking at something like a crowd that's in the area.
It's in the kitchen. You're in San Francisco -- it's a little bit unrelevant -- but it's a three-dimensional perspective, but you also know that it's all together.
It's very hard to see it, anyway, from a game.
But if we're going to get rid, and we'll take the perspective of, we're going to say, a little bit of a little bit of small ants are so small that they have access to all of the species -- the long class, but also in the direction of the argument, and against the argument.
And I hope you spend it.
It took so much time to make these ants do it.
But it's reducing the fact that learning can be two kinds of types: big and small, and the idea that maybe the big species around us are these are the ones that we can see in communities, but it might be other dimensions, a little bit like the limb of the road, so small they're left invisible.
Let me show you how this thing would look like.
So if you look at a view, we said, in a self-space -- I can just show, of course, two dimensions on a screen.
Some of you will take it on the day of the water, but everything that we don't have a new screen is a new dimension, a small, small, and a small, and just into the microscope of the microscopic space -- that's the idea: there might be other than a little bit of a golden. Here's so small that we don't
But you were a little bit of a small and a microscope that's going on around, you can get you in the great dimensions of all -- it's like the part of the mammogram -- but you can also go into the little class that it's so small, that we can't see it in an inevitable eye or even with the most important side that we
But a deep sense of the space itself, the idea is that can be more dimensional, what we see.
It's the explanation about how the universe might be more dimensional than the ones we see.
But what about the other question I asked: Is the theory work when you try to put it in the real world?
Well, it turns out that Einstein and others were working in trying to put this framework and put it in the physics of the universe as it was in the time, and in the small details it didn't work.
In the small details, for example, they couldn't make the theater of the alcohol to go like you should have this theory.
Many people were really working on this, in the 1970s, of course, in the late '60s, the strange idea, but it's very convinced of how to one of the laws of physics have gone.
Unfortunately something was great in our time.
In our age, a new approach to the rule of physics was written by physicists like me, and many other people around the world, it's called the liquid, as you've done.
And the wonderful thing is that the 3D corner doesn't have any thing in common, from a first perspective, with this idea of other dimensions, but when we explore the laser form we find that she's a repair to live this idea in a new way.
So let me just tell you how it goes.
So, the laser form, what is it?
Well, it's a theory that's trying to answer the question: What are the fundamental components of invisible and insects that create everything in the world around us?
The idea is this.
So imagine we're looking at a familiar tree, just a piano in a quote, and imagine we want to understand what it's made.
So we're going to go into a deep journey inside the tree, and we're looking at the components.
We all know that if you're going to take a deep inside, you'll find atoms.
We also know that the story doesn't play in atoms.
They have small electrons that are killed around a central nuclear with neurons and prototypes.
Even to the terrorists and the prototypes have smaller proteins in you, which are called Kiki.
That's the point where the convenient ideas are conducted.
Here's the new idea of the mystery.
It's deep inside each of these particles, there's another thing.
This other thing is that this fingerprinting energy.
It looks like Mr. Rott -- from here the idea of the muscles come in.
And it's just like the cartoons that you've just seen in Chile can look at different patterns, they can also take a look at different patterns.
They don't make different musicians.
Instead, they're making the different proteins that make the world around us.
So if these ideas are true, this is what the micro-microscope of the universe.
It's built from a huge number of these small boxes of energy energy, which is a variety of different faces.
The different transformations make the different proteins.
The different proteins are responsible for all the crime in the world around us.
And there's a unique, because proteins are material, electronics, electronics and cockroaches, cartoons, phosphorus, everybody's in one dimension.
So you put together a material and the natural forces underneath the shape of texts.
And that's what we're going to do with deaths.
Now here's the code.
When you learn the math of the mystery, you find that it doesn't work in the universe that's just three dimensions of space.
It doesn't work in the universe with four degrees of space, and not five or six.
Finally, you can learn the equations, and see that they're just working in the universe that there's 10 dimensions of space and a second of time.
It leads us back to the idea of a coffee and clinic -- that our world, when Mexico went, there's more dimensions than the ones we see.
Now you might think about it and say, well, okay, you know, if there are other dimensions, yes, you may not see them if they're small enough.
But if there's a fantastic civilization of green people who go there, and they're small enough that we don't see them, it's true.
One of the other aspirations of the culture -- not, it's not one of the other aspirations of the mystery.
Laughter) But that's the question: Is we just trying to bring the other species, or they tell us something about the world?
While, I want to tell you about two features.
The first one is, many of us believe that these other dimensions represent the answer to what's going to be the most powerful question of physics, theory.
And the question is this: When we look around the world, as scientists have done over the last hundred years, we're going to be about 20 numbers that really move our universe.
These are numbers like the proteins, like electronics and cockroaches, the earth of the electronic power, the electronic power -- the list of about 20 numbers that are born right right right, but no one has the number of books that they have.
Now, are the generations offer an answer?
Not yet.
But we believe that the answer to the question of why these books have the values that they may have depends on the other dimensions.
And the great thing is, if those numbers were some of those who are worried about us, the universe, as we know it, there was no extension.
This is a deep question.
Why are these numbers just like this that enables the stars to wind and judgment to get rid, when we recognize that if we're changing the books -- if I had 20 moments here and I'd give you to come and change those numbers, almost any change makes it happen.
So can we explain those 20 numbers?
And the mysteries offer that those 20 numbers are involved in a certain way to the other dimensions.
Let me show you how.
So when we're talking about other dimensions in the form of cities, it's not just one other three-dimensional, like the previous ideas of a coffee and clinic.
That's what the mystery says about the other species.
They've got a very rich geometry and a teenager.
It's an example of something that's familiar as a form of cooking -- the name doesn't matter.
But as you can see, the other dimensions are treated into themselves and change very interesting, interesting structure.
And the idea is that if you look at other dimensions, then the microscope of the universe around us will look like this in the most small scale.
When you look at your hand, you'd be in these other dimensions again and again, but they're so small that we didn't know.
So what's the physical meaning, if, the relevant to these 20 numbers?
Think about it. If you look at an inner tool, a forest, notice that the motion of the air pollution is affected by the shape of the shape.
Now in the number of numbers, all the numbers are transparency of the ways in which a metaphor can look at.
So just as these air citizens are affected by patients and boxes in a tool, the muscles themselves will be affected by the academic patterns in the atmosphere that they're wrong.
So let me put a few signals into the story.
And if you look at these little guys tend to be there -- they're going to be more excited -- right there, notice that the way they're extended from the Olympics.
So if we knew exactly how the other species are invisible -- we still don't know, but if we knew -- we could look at the possibilities, the ecological patterns.
And if we could look at the spinal boundaries, we could choose them 20 numbers.
And if the results that we would get from our calculations to the cost of these numbers that have been built through a simple trial, it's in many ways in many ways, the first answer to the structure of the universe is as it is.
Now, the second thing I want to end with is: How can you look at these other dimensions more directly?
Is it just a interesting structure that I'm going to explain how unconscious features of the world, or that we can actually look at the other dimensions?
And we think -- and it's, by thinking, very exciting, that about the next five years we can look at the end of those other dimensions.
That's how it's going. In the movie.
It's a machine that's going to send spaces around an insection in the rainforest directions, close to the speed of light.
One of these particles are going to do one of the other, to make a regular conference.
The hope is that if you get to be powerful enough, it might be a part of the president of our convenience out of our learning, you'll put them into the other species.
How do we know this?
Well, we're going to measure the amount of energy after the convention, we're going to avoid it to the energy amount of energy before, and if there's less energy after the contrast than before, it's going to be a conversation that the energy is going to go back.
And if it's going to take a look at the right pattern that we can choose, it's going to be profound that the other dimensions do there.
Let me show you this idea and I'm going to show you.
So imagine we've got a certain kind of protein called intuition -- it's the kind of corporations that we expect to go out if the other species are there.
But here's how the experiment will go.
You take these particles. You're going to sell them one in the other.
You're driving them in two, and if you're right, some of the energy from the same convenience will become refugees into these other dimensions.
So it's the kind of experiment that's going to look at, seven to the next 10 years or less.
And if this experiment will be a privacy, if you see that this particle is going to take away by people who have less energy in our dimensions than we started, it will see that the other species are real.
And for me, it's really a story out of the general, and an opportunity comes out of the general, back to Newton with an athetic space -- that's not a thing from alone, in what the events of the universe takes part.
Einstein's extended and says, well, space and time can open and move, it's the dead.
And now the mystery of the metaphor is going to say, yes, spider, from Kenya Canada, electronics -- everyone together in the astronomy, but only if the universe has more than we see.
And it's a experiment that's going to test them in our lives.
An amazing option.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We've got historical functions that allow us to know how the ancient Greeks were looking for, how they started, how they're going to wait...
But how did they think?
One natural notion is that the fossil patterns of human thought -- our ability to imagine, to be aware, dream -- were always the same thing.
Another option is that social changes that we've designed our culture maybe we've also changed the structure of human thought.
We can have different options about it.
In fact, it's a long philosophy of years.
But is this a question even an institution about science?
Here I want to offer that in the same way we can return how we look at the ancient direction just on a few boys, that the culture of culture are the organisms, the fossil, the fossil of human thought.
And in fact, the industry of some psychological surgery of some of the most powerful numbers of human culture, John James came in in the 1970s, which was only 300,000 years ago, humans were what we would call them a privacy.
And he did this conversation on the fact that the first human beings have indicated these books were made by different forms and different places in the world, like they would hear and sponsors that were in front of them when they were coming out of the left, or from the president...
What we've been called the identities.
And just then, as the time time, they started to know that they were the creatures, the dogs of these inner voices.
And with that, they were going to look inside: the ability to think about their computers.
So the theory of Jews is that consciousness, at least in the way we take this today, where we feel that we're the pipes of our existence -- it's a cultural development that's been read recently.
And this theory is pretty much famous, but it has a problem in a teacher, and it's just about just a few examples of just very specific and very specific examples.
So the question is whether the theory look inside humanity just about 3,000 years ago can be tested as artificial and objective.
And the problem of how to go on this is pretty clear.
It's not like Alexton woke up one day and so forth, "Hello, I'm Palton, and today I've got an artificial awareness."
And that tells us actually what the problem is.
We need to find the effect of an idea that never said.
The words look inside is not one time in the books that we want to open.
So our way to solve this is to build the space of the words.
It's a huge space that represents all the words in this way that's happening between every two and a few of them are related to how much they are.
So for example, you want the word "in" and "will be very often that, but the words" the "and" Lumbridge "will be very serious.
And it has to be true for all two words that are inside the space.
And there are different ways that we can build the space of words.
One is just to ask the experts, a little bit like we do with experts.
Another option is to track the prosperity that when two words are related to this one, they're tend to affect the same sentences, in the same patterns, often more than you can see from the rainforest.
And it's simple, it's a simple method, with some simple tricks that are connected to the fact that it's a very complex space, it turns out to be quite useful.
And just to give you a mistake of how good it works, it's the result that we get when we get it for some familiar words.
And you can see first of all the users are automatic to privacy neighborhoods.
So you get the rules, the parts of the body, the computer parts, the science and so on.
The algorithms also recognize that we're organisms are affected in the atmosphere.
So, for example, you can see that the scientific structures go into two categories matter of astronomy and physics.
And then there are very exciting things.
For instance, the word of astronomy, which is a little bit strange where it is, is actually exactly an iPhone that has to be, between what it's, science in fact, and between what it's dealing, in terms of astronomy.
And we could continue more and more with that.
In fact, if you look at it for a while, and you're just building random traits, you'll see it really feels a little bit like creating a poem.
And that's because, in some way, to go in this space, it's like to go inside the right.
And the last thing that algorithms also recognize what our intuitions are, about what words should lead to the neighborhood of the inner look.
So for example, words like "myself," "Ama" "," "" "" "a lot of emotion" is very, "but other words," like "red," "" &
And so, once we built the space, the history of the inner view, or of the history of any idea that it's before it could look extended and somehow extended, we're going to make sense of science as my own.
All we need to do is take the books, put them in, and we take this finger of words like a train and put them into the space, and then we ask whether it's going to move a pile time when it's close to the remote of the income.
And with that, we can analyze the history of looking inside the future direction, which we have the best species.
So what we've done is we've taken all the books -- we've just put them on time -- every book we take the words and put them into the space, and then we're asking for any word to look at the face, and we're looking at the average of this.
And then we ask whether, the more the time is going on and over, these books get close, more and more to the contract of interview.
And that's exactly what's happening in the future beauty.
So you can see that the ancient books in the Indian tradition, there's a little bit of a books that's focused on the face.
But as four centuries ago, it starts to move very quickly into a fifth of five times of books that's closer and closer to the concept of an interview.
And one of the beautiful things that we're now able to ask if it's also true in independence, different.
So we just looked at the same surgery on the old, and we got almost the same pattern.
Again, you're seeing a coffee for the ancient books in your DNA, and then it grew much faster in the new books of the new United States.
And then we're getting the poem of interviewing in "Western Octocus," as a half years after they're going to.
And it was very important, because Syrian Octocin was scared by studies, for years, historians, as one of the founders of interview.
In fact, some believe it's the modern psychology.
So our algorithms, which has the approach to be chemical, to be objective, and of course to be faster -- it's just working in a second crisis -- can track some of the most important issues of this long journey.
And it's in a way that one of the beautiful things of science, which is that you're now able to transform this idea and enable many different areas.
So in the same way that we asked about the past of human consciousness, maybe the most challenging question we can show ourselves is whether it can tell us something about the future of our minds.
If we're going to be more accurate, is the words that we're saying today can tell us something about where we're going to be in a few days, in a few months or a few years from today.
And in the same way that many of us are now living our heart rate, our task, our genes, while it's going to help us prevent diseases, we can ask if we're talking about, we're sending, that we're sending, sending in a right now, writing, can tell us from the head if we know it might be done.
And with Mr. Chihi who was my brother in this surprise, we took ourselves this task.
And we've done it by the conservative surgery of 34 young people who were at high risk to develop a church.
So what we've done is, we've been talking about the first day, and then we've asked whether the characteristics of speech can predict, within almost three years, the future development of a psychiatric.
But despite our hopes, we've got failure after failure.
It just wasn't enough information in Sautism to predict the future organization of the word.
It was good enough to understand between a group of psychiatrists for a criticism, a little bit like we did for the ancient texts, but not to predict the future of a psychiatric.
But then we realized that maybe the most important thing wasn't so much what they're talking, but how they would say it.
More collective, it wasn't in the case that the Scientists of Scientists were, but a few pounds and rapidly they jumped one slow machine to another.
And so we've come to this country, that we've been conducted from Science, which is actually dealing the restaurant in one static subject, within one theory.
And it turns out that this group of 34 human beings, the algorithm that's based on critical corporations can predict, exactly 100 percent, who's going to open this and who doesn't.
And it was something that couldn't be an idea -- not even close -- all of the other tricks that are there.
And I remember very well, when I was working on this, I sat down in my computer and I saw a couple of pounds from Polo -- my first student when I sat in Los Angeles, and at the same time he was living in New York.
And there was something in these objects -- I couldn't say exactly what nothing was said in the repair -- but I had this powerful sense, this powerful intuition, which is something wrong.
So I showed the phone, and I went to his face, and yes he didn't feel good.
And this simple fact, a way of reading between the lights, I could feel, by words, his legs, was a simple way to help.
What I'm going to tell you today is that we're focusing on how we can move the intuition that we all share, algorithm.
And we've done this, we might see in the future a very different form of mental health, which is based on objective and autonomy of the words that we're writing, of the words we say.
CA: Thank you in Spanish.

It's really between your cancer and your cancer will find one of the most important muscles that you probably didn't know about: the needle of the bar and the LES.
When it's functionally functioning, it's got a positive role in helping us eat.
But when it doesn't work in a way, it becomes the main budget in the camp -- a road wind and sometimes with a paper that a lot of people are going to be born at some point in their lives.
We know that people are going to be dead for hundreds of years if not thousands of years.
But recently, the cases are in the night, what makes it a very common world.
When the symptoms of French become more sophisticated and cheaper -- twice a week or more -- it's fabulous as the extinction, or GED.
But what makes this problem, and how can you stop it?
French begins in the region called the Social Social School, where LES is.
The fourth and the liquid of LES is reduced by a complex tree of boundaries that are friends to the brain, the heart, and the reality.
After the food goes into a coffee, the service of the muscles is to prevent it back.
The LES is going on, and it's driving the box to the Kenya and creates a high stress region that's conducted from Kenya to get out.
But if LES is released in the wrong moment or reduced in the top, it becomes a fingerprint, and it makes a region to lose the pressure.
It allows the creatures of consumption -- and even a piece of food, go into the sand, sometimes up to the bottom.
The reason for all of this inner axis for a long time to reduce.
Egyptians like Canada and Monta contains components that may expect LES, and you're going to do that work.
Others of other investments, like magazines and patterns, can remove the roof of of the switch when they wait out with a fingerprint.
Mounces can be similar to the color in the summer, and open the power of the chicken.
But researchers found that I could not have the only genome.
Sweden is a risk, because a comparison in China remains the LES.
The limitations of alcohol can be a similar effect.
Women are pregnant many times more sensitive than the pressure of the baby's pressure on their walls.
And some hormones in Japan.
Shile can make the objects that move to the analogy of the analogy of the Western Western, which is usually responded against the French.
Social drugs, including those for asteroids, high blood pressure, capacity against pregnancy, and depression can also affect LES.
Freedom of French is not necessarily a reason to worry.
But if the device is often happening, it can decide the LES muscle over time, what can be more and more disabled to wind.
And if it's not a patient, it can lead to big problems.
Over the time, previous references can create a coffee that's driving the switch, which is hard to move food.
France is also over the cells that expect the sand -- a rare condition called and switch on the ground, which can be the risk of cancer.
Unfortunately, the France of Freebruary is often with a variety of drugs that can help train or reduce the walls.
In extreme cases, people go open to make LES to reduce the profession.
But we can often stop a French before it comes to this point.
The reduction of certain tools, the device of a smoke, and a healthy weight can reduce the platform.
With the treatment of cells, we can help LES to keep our chemical sector of our walls in a situation and the motion of the shadow.
I think it's for my life to transform the evidence of climate change through my work.
I've been conducted to the North Pole to capture the remote story of the cockroach, and most of the equation of the water as a result of it.
Since recently, I visited the Canada's Renland's boundary and the president of the children's children's children's children, who's two parts of a machine that doesn't look at our planet.
My parents studied moments of changes, mirror and peak in the face, and you can watch emotional faces with a place that you might never have the opportunity to visit.
I've chosen to transform the beauty of beauty in Mexas.
If you can experience the presidents of these monkeys, you may have inspired to protect and put them.
Social psychology tells us that we work and decide based on our feelings over everything.
And studies showed that art affects more creative effective effects.
Technologists are extinced in the coffee coffee at the beginning of 2020.
And it's probably about 60 meters per square meter to three meters to the end of the century.
I was listening to my career to get these curiosity with a minute, one that's exciting to us in the way that statistics might not.
My process begins to places in the front of climate change.
Instead, I invite thousands of images.
Again in the studio, I work with the memory of the experience and the images to create very large scale, sometimes in more than three feet.
I'm offering with a lot of roads, which they're going to go like carbon, but in the sky.
I call my work Ray, but others call it a painting.
I mean, with that, when you're interested in me as "you've got fingers."
But I'm not using a tool and I've always used my fingers and my hands in order to activate the details of paper.
Man is a kind of metaphor for me.
It's fascinating my consciousness.
I'm not looking at what I'm doing as a ice or water.
Instead, the picture is expanded to its basic form of color and shape.
Once a perfect choice, I can finally experience the magnitude in a general, as a curiosity that's scared on water, or a Google is dealing with a little bit.
On the average, a piece of this size takes me about, as you see, 10 seconds.
Laughter) But you know, really, something like 200 hours, 250 hours to something like this.
But I wanted since I could keep color, really.
My mom was an artist, and when I grew up, we've always had a collection of art in the house.
My mother's love to take it to the most recent areas of the planet, and my family and I've been lucky enough to join and support it in these adventure.
We've been based on genes in North Africa and reducing dogs near the North Korean.
In October 2012, I've been invented my first invention, I took a group of artists and learn to the northern from the northern Renland.
My mom was supposed to lead the trick.
It's and I've been in the first time of the design, because we've been going to go together, when it's been a victim to grow in the brain.
The cancer has been spread quickly on the body and the brain, and it's gone after six months.
Over a couple of months of her daughter, with this, her service for a lennial never knew, and I was going to come up with her last journey.
My mom's passion of my mother's job in my experience in Genland, and I felt the power and the library of the surface.
The huge size of the ice is branding.
The ice ice is living with movement and voice in the way I've never seen.
I've shown my profound size to give you the same sense of respect that I've experienced.
And yet, while the Indian of the ice is clear, it's also his surprises.
From our boat, I could see the ice from the ice under the sun more than the age of the skin.
We had an opportunity to visit a lot of the Iranian communities in Genland that were now now in huge challenges.
The local places talked to me about a lot of rainforest areas that are not going to jump more like they ever had.
And I'm a curiosity, their collection and their collection is significant, and water on their way of life and their survival.
The president of the Bangladesland are one of the worst genes for the sea of water, which has already been able to move some of the most uncomfortable institutions in the world.
A year after my journey to Nigeria, I visited my children, the most powerful country and joined around the world.
While I was there, I've collected images and see to a new job: dozens of trees that can be completely under the water in this century.
The bad events are happening every day at a global scale and personality.
When I was in Genland, I returned my mother's mother's mother's mother's arms.
Now she's left part of the surface that she's love so much, even though it's been born and a new form.
Whether a lot of evidence that my mom gave me the ability to focus on the animal, rather than the third.
My parents get the beauty of what we're going to stop.
I hope they can serve another chain of a fingerprinting in a support change, to move the crisis and inspire our global community to act for the future.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What do you see?
Most of you see a numbers, but I see an opportunity: an opportunity for health, an opportunity for my health equality.
The black men, the number is not just a place that's going to get better or take the device.
No, it's a lot beyond.
Over the history of history, the number is very safe for black men.
It's a place where we're going to companies, empathy and empathy.
It's a place that I'm going to win out of the pressure of the work and sometimes my house.
It's a place where we don't need to worry about how we're going to get in the world.
It's a place where we don't feel threat, and we don't feel water.
It's a place of art and security.
Because for this reason, it's one of the only places that we can be ourselves without fear and just...
The connection, the conversation is the invention of a black numbers.
I remember I went to my father, as a child.
We'd go to a piece of an email every second sit.
And as a president, the same group of men was there every time we went, or waiting to tell their recycling or just judgment to the atmosphere.
I remember the peaceful peaceful peace that was coming every time we were going.
"Hey," would say to my father.
It's a local paper, and it's like somebody's famous.
"Hey, a young guy, your name?"
I had to tell me, and I make me feel important at the same time.
I remember the conversation was huge.
The men were talking about politics, and Google, and music, and new news, the country, the right news.
There was a little bit about women and how to be a black man in the United States.
But many times they also talked about health.
The conversations about health were long and magnitude.
The men would tell the objects of doctors to reduce the amount of wind or eat less of genes or to stop a stress or a stress.
They've talked about different ways in which you can reduce stress, like looking at love life -- Laughter) All ways to treat high blood pressure.
There's a lot of connection around a high pressure in a service.
Because it's a little 40 percent of the black men have it.
I mean, almost every black man or suffering a high blood tree in himself or know someone who has.
Sometimes, these conversations in the office were about what happens when a high tree didn't treat like you need.
"Do you say, you've heard about Jai?
He had a summer. "
It's a constant dog.
He was 50 years old. "
More men who die of a high tree than anything else, even though a few years of medicine and science has shown that you can prevent high wars with early security and treatment.
So why is blood pressure so much larger than black men?
Because most cases, a high pressure or not a patient at all or not a patient like you have black men from it because of our low context with the personal health care system.
In least black men, especially those with high pressure, there's a family doctor than other population.
But why?
Some of the most advanced studies of men who are black men shows very much, the doctor's doctor's doctor has to do with fear, intuition, and intuitive instruments.
The office in the doctor is just a place that's going to wait when you don't feel good.
And when you're going to go, you can just wait for hours to get on and do it by a person who's visiting a bank that has just 10 minutes for you and not appreciate the bees.
So it wasn't a lot of men and they're not going to go to a completely completely, especially if they feel okay.
But here's the problem.
You can feel okay while a high blood press the most important organisms in your body.
It's his grandfather, "You're telling the San Francisco" in the Arabic. "
I've got a lucky that my book is in the last eight years.
He told me, "Hey, you know, a lot of men who are working on their books more than their doctors."
It was amazing for me, at the beginning, but less when you think about it.
Men black men are with their books on average as I'm with Derey, about eight years.
And black men see their books about every two weeks.
It's not just that you're on with your view, but also with secrets, and sometimes life.
Di, like a lot of books, it's more than an artist, a business man, and a man's secrets.
It's a leader and a lot of prosperity in its community health.
The first time I went to the customers of his grandmother, he didn't just play.
He's also a place for a lot to vote to give his customers and his community a voice.
With this activist, and an investment in the community that's described a black number, obviously, that's the perfect place to talk about high blood pressure and more health care in the community.
First of all, the money is not a medical environment, and it doesn't have all the psychological instrument that comes with this place.
When you're in a service, you're in your theory and you're with friends who are partners to your theory, your communities and your health problems.
Second, because the number is a place of connection, art, and curiosity, it's a place where you open more conversation on health and particularly on high pressure.
In all, for pressure on a high pressure has all the instructions of great speech: stress and blood pressure, food and blood pressure, relationships and blood press, and yes, how it's going to be a black man in the United States and a high person.
But you can do more than just talking about a high pressure in the money.
You can operate in a way.
Here we have an opportunity to work with all of the world's "dogs" in the world, "and powerful communities and treat all of the health care in health care that affect unique.
When you're testing a high blood pressure, there's a high pressure where you've been listening and hospital to communities in the '60s, the doctors who are black like Alexandon in Brothers and Francisco in Nigerian were between the first and the first ones that were going to be on healthy health care for
These objects were saving the way to my professional journey with numbers and health, which started in Chicago in medical school.
The first research work I've been working on as a student of medicine was to help design medical interventions that were attracted men.
We've got about 12 different groups with a space of black men and we've learned that, to be healthy at the same time, how you're going to take you as a healthy, like it's going to take you in some healthy healthy, and their feelings feel good at hand with look good.
This work has led to the development of "Bertie Baradian," California California that was built by Darwin Western Western Western School that's carrying healthy health care care to men.
Some of this personal treatment was to hold a book on the surface to reduce the men who were in the room who had previous health care with free collection, give men to know that we're also going to know how they look and how they feel, and what's important to us.
But while there's only one project on the United States, there's thousands of black books in which you can plug the interpretation between collections and health.
The next piece of my journey was in Los, Texas, where we learned that books are not just fun but they're also able to get rid of patients and participate in an important health care and improve their health and their community.
We've worked with a amazing group of black books and taught them how to measure blood pressure and how to judge their customers and interact them to doctors to help them treat high blood pressure.
The books didn't just agree to do it, but it was also very good at it.
In a period of three years, the books have learned thousands of blood pressure and a result of hundreds of men who have become doctors for health care for their high blood pressure.
This transformation between books and doctors have led to 20 percent in the number of men who were able to get to their blood pressure and restaurant of three points, on average pressure of any transformation.
If we've been doing an extinction of three points on every black man with a high blood pressure in the United States, we've been driving 800 pounds, and 900 pounds of a high tree in one year.
And our experience with numbers is not different in New York, where my journey led me.
With my amazing team with a variety of recycling, community health workers, and volunteers, we were able to cooperate with more than 200 numbers and communities of other community institutions to get more than 7,000 adults.
In addition, we've made the test and won a high blood pressure for each and one of them.
The dots for me and the books and the number of other community leaders who take the food of an opportunity and start to make a difference in their community, we've evolved not only to predict blood pressure in our participants, but also affect other artists of health.
So what do you see?
What's your money?
Where's this place for you where people who have a unique problem can take a unique solution?
When you find this place, you saw the opportunity.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I've spent the first conference of the Amazon, from the 81, in Frankton, California.
His hand!
Audience: Had!
So I've spent a few months later in September 11, with the feeling that there was, I think, most people in the country in the same period, extended in retirement sensors and Titanism to do something -- in addition to the fact that I didn't do anything.
I was 17 years old, I finished a high school at the same summer, which I made a small room in my home in the little girl I grew up in the North Iran, called Mumba.
I'm able to express this later who's interested in -- Laughter) Missa's known for a lot of things, but a global culture is not, so my only extension to theater and prevent was limited to work in my school and a high school and a high school in a pocket, that's about peace.
And I was pretty serious about the game and I've been asked to my grandfather's daughter's daughter's school last year's school, I didn't, I decided that university is not for me and I didn't look at another place -- from the OK.
I also made the head journey to Los Angeles, which I've always heard about in stories, on the players who came to Los Angeles with only seven dollars in France and found a successful job.
I came up to America in Texas, when my avia was taken.
I spent all of the money on the box, I finally got to Monna Monica -- not even Los Angeles -- basically, I went around 48 hours in the tree, I went back to Twitch, and in the way I was going to do a game.
My father's house, from a village who's a career, familiar with a struggle.
It works in TV, a stroke of a local restaurant.
It was a global world at the beginning of 2001.
After the 11 in September 11, I felt a huge conference, and I was generally nervous: on myself, on my parents, on the government, on self-confidence, on the dignity of a car, on my murderer that I was working with me to California and returned to Egypt, and I showed it. I loved it.
It's one of the things that I've done in my life.
Freebruary was cool, to drive and jump things that would be great.
But I realized that what I loved in Egypt is the thing, that the less I was looking at when I got out and he was -- these strange prototypes -- a cultural collection of all kinds of characteristics of the United States -- on the face, we didn't have anything in common.
With time, all of the political victims and personality, which led me to the military, the fabric and public, the Arice became a president to the friends.
And then, after a couple of years of service and a few months ago, I reduced Iraq, I published the bone in the Royal Ocean, and I'd be going to be released on a medical background.
Who who doesn't do in the military would be hard to understand it, but it was wrong that I wouldn't take a woman to Iraq or Afghanistan who had changed my life.
I remember clear that I've left the hospital of the basis of Obama and all of my reference was scared out to see that I'm okay.
And then, suddenly, again, I was East.
I knew I wanted to give the game another opportunity, because -- again, that's me -- I thought all the problems in the citizens are small than the military.
Like, what can you predict now?
"The hot here.
Somebody's going to take the skin. "
"It's going to be too long."
I was a soldier in Mary, I knew how to survive.
I'm going to go to New York and be a device.
If the things don't look at, I'll live in San Franklon and collect the Amazon food of Panada.
And I went back to the New York City's daughter's daughter and I had lucky and unfortunately.
But I've been surprised how complex was from the military to the citizens.
I was a relatively healthy. I couldn't imagine how you could go through this process after a wonderful or physical surprise.
However, it was hard.
In some ways, because I was at school -- I couldn't do myself on this that I'm going to go to a voice and speech, I'm going to have a damaged energy in the room, I've been doing a game where I'm going to take myself in a game -- but in my friends who are working on my hands.
But also, because I didn't know how to appreciate the things I learned in the military.
It's also about emotional.
Three, I had to find a job.
I was a soldier from Amazon in starting the emotions, I was scared from water and out of magazine.
There's not a lot of places in the foreign citizens that you can apply these skills.
It's emotionally, I've been able to find meaning.
In the military, everything has meaning.
Everything you're doing is Rosey in a restaurant or a useful tool.
You don't have to do a bedroom to don't push your field.
You don't touch you to keep your personal level of health and rain.
You're going to go to this direction in the planning, to give people to the people who were there for you.
You're going to do this way, because that's how you need.
Your teachers are scared to the last park.
You're going to have a lot of these patterns that you've been on.
Your career told something about your curiosity and respect.
There's no stairs.
Here you're another body, and in a way I felt need to prove myself again and again.
I've invented citizens as I've spent the insects disappeared after I've spread them.
There was a curious volunteer here.
Social sense, while in the military, I felt this creative sense.
What about the foreign corporations you're in a situation of life or death with your next friends and the way they're happy to you that don't get you?
And then, in a school to play...
And in fact, I first started to discover disorders and death and president that they didn't have any relationship to the military, but somehow, they were able to describe my favorite experience.
I felt that I was done less aggressive because I first succeeded, to look at the words of emotions, and I realized the huge value that was happening.
When I was invited to think about my favorite service, the first thought wasn't about prototype and meaning, but on the end of the short moments of Kenya and human emotions, emotions of a wonderful emotion: friends that are made out of their families, friends who are coming together, blogging together, all over the environment.
I was looking at my friends in these situations, and I saw the restaurant that they've created and, in our inability to express our feelings to their own.
The middle community and the theater of the theater, in fact, it's very similar to this.
There's a group of people who are trying to get to the task that it's great about themselves; it's not just about you.
You have a role, and you need to know your role in the team.
Each team has a leader or in the office, sometimes they're smart, and sometimes not.
You're going to get close to modern sectors in a very short period of self-meaning, self-organization.
I thought, how great it would be to create a space between these two communities, the market, a library, and I'm going to have a few people, where they're going to start with something more than a little bit more challenging than the same prototype that I'm going to be able to create a space that I'm going to go to, "Oh,
It's more to make a theater to create a theater that's going to come up with characteristics that are going to be independent without being disabled.
So we set up the organization without a professor called "Arabic art in the pocket forces," and we tried to do exactly what I said: we tried to connect between these two communities, the market.
We're looking at this or a couple of monologists out of the industrial Americans in the age of age, and we're going to get just like the audience's audience, you're coming out of the general theater, you're looking at them in the general material, you're going to put them out of the general communities
There's something that's powerful -- to go into a room with complexity and remind ourselves that we're human, and myself is an equal tool for the river.
And in the organization like the military, who's describing my head to my head, you can go to a respect of experience to explain collective experience.
I can't imagine a more accurate community to courage a new expression of self-expression, because it's fascinating on our country.
We were all in the United States and the world, from the Central Street and Twitter in School, Maland, Miland, in France, in France, in France, in France, in the Uganda, in the basis of the United States in the United States and the United States, and in Olympic and Obama in New York City.
For the players that we're responding is a hotel into a culture, where they didn't expect it.
The military people, it's exactly the same thing.
Over the last six years I've done this, I always remember playing is a lot of things.
It's full, it's actually political, it's a business, it's all there that you're going to find a risk to add.
But a game is also service.
I didn't have to finish my own, so at all of the time I can make the autism industry, which is, the military, for me, again, there's nothing better about it.
Thank you.
[Applause] We're going to take a little bit of a piece of Marco from Marco from Marcus, called "I'm not in Amazon."
The player comes out of my general and a good friend, Jersey France, would read the little bit together with Mart Janson, who I met him just a few hours ago.

When he's going to go on the road, the main player in Darwin is down to the past of clouds.
In his eye, it's been conducted to win the boy called his father's father's mother's father.
But, in fact, this transition is not really smart.
Like Shango Sano Panna taught him again and again, these are not huge; it's just wind.
Darwin didn't happen, but most of the chimpanzees were looking at the restaurants.
You'll never be worried, it's going to be on the train, and it becomes even more convinced in his task.
This floor contains a lot of what my love is in Darwin, the upper industry, the unemployment, the uncomfortable and the president of his father's accident, which is the wall of the walls from the Hollywood and House, which is also known as the Amazon.
It's published in the two samples, the restaurant is following a restaurant when he's finished in the center and the North France was fighting the bad forces.
Despite the developed imagination of Darwin's wall, his production, Malalda France, you could never imagine that a book would become the most famous book in all the time.
Finally five years as a soldier, and five other sisters were scared by details, France has spent most of his life as a five-hicle and a president.
Just in his 1950s, he published his biggest piece: the aesthetic apartment of Egyptians.
At the same time, the Middle Egypt books that would take the adventure of Egypt and their original code to look at the European culture.
While France was Obama, it was a dead of these recycling stories, which was more in the violence of the people who see than in the development of the violence.
To challenge them, he wrote Darwin's story, the story of his wife, or an altitude, who spent his hand and his colleagues called liberal limits.
When you've changed these stories, it's designing himself as a mental illness.
Everybody in his village is trying to convince him to give it to his argument, until a muscle of some of the books of the studies in his primary library.
But it's invisible.
It's wearing an old musician and decline, it's going on the road, and it's getting the village to search for community.
The restaurant of San Franciscus goes into the collection of rules that reduce the capacity of the liquid.
And it's still built to the Iraq books and maybe all of the other extinct books, the story of San Franciscus has been conducted to play the inner life of the personal violence.
Don't make a gundord as the vehicle opens up, and it's going to make a clear change.
This particular discovery led a lot of learning to read to the first modern version.
And the development of this character doesn't happen in a great space.
At the first time, there's an extinction to Darwin as a French that makes the toilet of tools called Sanaja.
Turns and Darwin are the trees: One of a restaurant from a background against the other atheism.
The companies have evolved from their lives from most of them as a hero and the first hero, let's inspire the signals of imagination.
Darwin was a huge success.
Research remained across Europe in the seven years.
Even in America, where the Francisca was reduced all the limits because there were a dignity of a pencil, the victims were made from privacy generations.
The book also got so good that they call a fly.
After a Robert School was trying to make a fair of the skin, France had invented the screen of a response.
Now when I was published together with the first text as a perfect text, his second thing went on where the original switched, just that now Darwin Street and his grandfather became a heroic with.
It's just like in the real life, Centrance has usually reduced its own success in the world of its imaginations.
This unusual awareness has created physical complexity, when it's going to help think about what their story is.
Unfortunately, France represents the privacy rights of the book for a little bit.
It's only rich in the community.
But his article about creative power and intuition was inspired by art, to the service, the popular culture, and even political revolution.
Darwin says that our imagination imagine our actions, causes us to change, and certainly, makes us human.
Most of the people who lost fossil still feel them -- not as a memory or a deep shape, but in a life fossil.
They can take their fingerprints and sometimes even feel the simple one of the press or the pain of a modern pencil.
And most of the surprise, and sometimes even people who are born without genes can feel the fingerprint.
So what does the emotional feelings?
The printing of these feelings from a mirror that we have a map of the body inside the brain.
And the fact that it's possible to someone who'd never had a pair to feel it out of the possibility that we were born at least with the beginning of this map.
But one thing from the Pacific Guinka that's affected after the bridge of the bridge and blood: most of the resources.
In order to understand completely fossil fuel and as a finger, we need to voice all the way from the surface to the brain.
Our fossil fossil fuels that are responsible to all of the tissues that we feel in our bodies to understand where our bodies are in space.
Social ways revealed the film I've experienced through the spinal cord and to the brain.
Because so many of this way is out of the wheel itself, most of them remained after her.
But it's a fabric changes the way the artists come in every step of the way.
In the traffic website, beetles of beetles can move on and become more sensitive, stress challenges even in response to weight.
Using normal reasons, these signals are reduced in the spinal cord in the spinal cord.
Many of the reasons we don't completely understand, after effective, there's a gravity of this transformation in the dirt, and signals can come out.
Once they go on the spinal cord, the coral corporations come to the brain.
There, the cartoons I've been working on them.
The whole body is focused on this cortex.
Social body's normal body with a lot of nervous stations, like the fibers and the sisters, are designed by the biggest areas.
The Corologist Richard is a model of a human body with prototypes that are based on the size of every light in the body as it's created in Kenyx, the amount of cortex that's been focused on a certain body can grow or grow on a basis on a few of the brain senses.
For instance, the title of the left left is big in cities than people who don't play in the pocket.
The brain is also a curiosity of curiosity as part of a beautiful body to define the feelings that are affected.
This man's extinction can lead to a finger.
The cartoon is probably responsible for a sense of body parts that are not there, because they're better and they're in the brain.
Over the time, these actions can be conducted and the finger can be conducted with them.
But feelings in Pantheon didn't necessarily be disappeared.
Paul treatments are usually required that a piece of chemistry, drugs to treatment in the pain, dozens, and time.
It's a method called the printing theory can be very useful in the motion of the movement and the fingerprinting in the fingerprinter.
It's the patient who's put the Pantum in the box behind the mirror and the whole finger in the mirror.
It's a method in the brain to see the finger instead of just feeling it.
Scientists are developing clinical reality that make the experience of the mirror printing even more reality.
Cities can also create a similar effect -- a lot of patients are based on the pain mostly when they're leaving the box at night.
And Pantum Pantum may help patients imagine their diverse of their bodies and activate them in intuitive way.
There's still a lot of questions about Pantum.
We don't know why a couple of pounds don't feel like a pain in that usually goes into these fingerprints, or why there's no pipes at all.
And another research for Pantum is not only useful for people who experience them.
The deeper understanding of these actions will give us a structure of work that our brain does a day to build the world like we're taking it.
They're an important memory that the reality we experience, is actually objective.
First, I'll show myself.
This picture took my mom, Jenn.
This is my father, Frank, in the center.
And that's my sisters: Mary Kenyan, John San, San Mary.
George France is sitting in the line and Kevin Milkin for our days.
And in the Wall Street Southern Darwin, I am.
I liked to grow in a big family.
And one of my favorite things was to choose happy.
But when a child was almost seven, it's almost given us the red red red.
There's been a long device before we've been collected at the end of John Brothers.
All the teacher in the audience knows the transformation and the emotions in the sea there for a new baby.
And I've been excited and I've been excited to help my mom at this particular text.
But it's not anywhere.
I went a lot and I saw a lot.
But I've been surprised to learn that in parts of Ethiopia, the parents sell the skin for a new baby in a month.
Why to change?
Why don't we move this particular moment?
Well, they're changing because they're afraid.
They're scared that they're going to be fine.
And it would be a little bit more trying without there.
There's no face there can help feel a little less connection.
So in one part of the world, moments of happy, emotions, dreams of the child's future while in some other part, the teachers are not going to have a dream of a future beyond a number of valuable weeks.
How can it be?
How can it be 2.6 million babies die around the world before they come to the age of a month?
2.6 million.
It's the population of Vanford.
And the most important thing is: Why?
More cases, we just don't know.
I remember I've seen a graphic graph.
And his partner was "The reasons for children under the age of five around the world."
And there's a pretty big piece, over 40 percent that you've forgotten "dances."
Now, "Lots" is not the death of death.
It's just a description, a description that means that it's less than a month.
For me, "Lots" means "we don't know."
Now, I'm a scientist, I'm a doctor.
I want to fix things.
But you can't fix what you can't define.
And so our first step to enable these teachers to don't have to answer the question: Why are babies die?
And so I want to talk about a new approach that I feel that I'm not just going to help us know why babies are dying, but it's also going to start to change the whole field of public health.
It's called "public medicine from early."
For me, a drug is a very special idea.
I've been looking at cancer -- ecosystem.
I've been waiting for that because I wanted to make people feel better.
But they often made them feel worse.
I remember young women who were invited to the clinic by their sisters -- adults who were helped in their parents to get into the fabric room.
They were so hard because of the treatment I gave them.
But at the time, in the front of the war against cancer, we had a little bit of tools.
And the tools that were in our partners could not understand between a film cell, where we wanted to move hard and healthy cells that we wanted to keep.
And so, the Israel that everybody knows -- the president of the forest, in soldiers, the immune system so that pollution pollutions are always in the environment.
And then I went to the biological industry.
And I started working on a new approach to treatment cancer patients who could do a better job in the healthy cells and testing out of the hospital or the movie.
It's a drug called Titchen.
And what the Titan allows you to do is just capture the HERI cancer cancer, the most common kind of cancer cancer, at the time.
It's this pattern that we can move hard in the cancer cells as we're better for the Nigerian cells.
It's a huge way.
It felt like a conference so that now we use all these tools -- big data, a tumor, a genius, a gene of genes and more -- to make a whole range of disease.
It allows us to treat people in the right Europe in the right time.
Social drugs have been affected by cancer revolution.
Everything changed.
And I want all to change again.
So I asked myself: Why do we need to define the amount of methods, these surroundings to predict diseases in the rich world?
Now, don't get me wrong -- I'm not talking about the drugs like the key TV world, although I wanted to do it.
I'm talking about beyond the accuracy of accurate mechanisms for health problems in the population.
Well, okay, you're probably thinking, "It's crazy.
You can't do it, it's that I've been invented too. "
But here's the point: we're already doing it in a limited way, and it's already starting to do a big change.
So this is what happens.
I've told you that I've spent cancer.
But like a lot of doctors, a lot of doctors, who have learned in San Francisco in the '80s, I've also spent as an AIDS.
It was a terrible time.
AIDS was a death sector.
All of my patients died.
Now the situation has improved but HIV and AIDS has remained a hard challenge.
In the world, about 17 million women who are HIV.
We know that these women are going to go to a range, they can transform the virus to a baby.
We also know, in the tremendous treatment, from these babies will not survive until the age of two years.
But we also know that anti-anthropic treatment can actually ensure that it doesn't move the virus to the baby.
So what do we do?
Well, one of the "solution" comes out to all of them, "similar to the end of a mammography, meaning that we're going to look at and treat every woman in the world.
It will do the work.
But it's not a bad one.
So instead, we're focusing on areas where HIV classes are the highest.
We know some countries in Africa from South Korea that we can look at and treat women, which are the highest ones.
This early approach to the public health spread in half of HIV in the last five years.
[Chris] women] in some areas in the developing world is a powerful example of how public medical medical medicine can change things, big.
So.
How do you do that?
We can do it because we know.
You know who to code know why to code and how to train.
And these, I think, the most important components of public health is early: who, what, where and how.
So let's go back to 1.6 million babies who are sitting before they're a month.
And here's the problem: we just don't know.
It may be invisible, but the way to understand the deaths of the babies in these countries, where they're dealing is through conversation with whether.
Her health workers ask the mother, who just lost the baby's baby's baby? Did he have a heat? "
And it's going to be that the conversation exists even three months after it's dead.
Now let's put yourself in the walls of the mother.
It's a mirror, and it's a heart conversation.
And even worse -- it doesn't help, because it can be that we know that there's a heat, but we don't know why.
So in this knowledge, we can't help the mother, the family or the families in the country is to avoid a similar tragedy.
But what if we build a approach of public health from early?
Let's say, for example, in some areas in Africa that are designed because of pollution pollution that's gone from a baby, called Canotocus from the United States.
In treatment, there's a big chance to lose the next baby.
Once we've gone through the problem, we can prevent this death with something simple and safe like a penguin.
We can do it because we know.
And that's the point: once you know, you can bring the right intervention to the right people in the right place.
In this approach, and in these interventions and so similar to them, I don't have access to public health care can help us define to 15 years.
And it's going to be able to succeeding a million babies every year and a year.
A million babies every year.
And why to stop there?
A lot of powerful approach to public health -- imagine what can be possible.
Why wouldn't we be able to live in an active activity?
Why don't we avoid the coal cancer in women?
And why don't we take the malaria?
Applause) Yeah, you're going to take a look at it!
So I'm living in two different areas, one world of us in scientists, and there's another one in experts in public experts.
A approach is focused on public health care for one of the two violence.
But, you know, we're all living in two world: the rich world and the poor world.
And what's exciting to me in the early approach is a camp between these two world.
In the rich world, every day, we use a solution and amazing tools -- anywhere we've got -- in order to train diseases in ways I didn't imagine that there's possible.
We can't use the solutions and these tools to prevent demands to die in the poor world.
So we're going to be so safe and give a baby there at the moment, to get a dream of the baby's baby's lives in the series of years, and not in water.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, good evening.
Some of you have to notice that my family is January.
So yes, it's okay for me that you thought about how we would have been able to get into a war region.
In fact, I've been invited to me with a school school in medicine, and I got a conference to work with UNICEEEC in the Western level, which was worth one dollars.
You see, I had to pay this plan to happen that the father's "was going to have to have a pencil, I'm going to be a car.
After all, I went to one of the particular areas in the world.
So now you're going to have some of you ask themselves, and I want to ensure you, I've got half of the money from the head.
Laughter) So you understand, this is how -- with 50 cents in the classroom, I found myself in the city of Iraq, in Sweden.
The journalists call it "The" city. "
And they call it a city of death because 300 people lost their lives there -- 300 thousand people, most of them as a result that was caused for violence, or disease.
I've been a part of a common part of it to try to find the best way to respond to this humanitarian asteroid.
It was really after the tremendous spirit in Rwanda, the Social School to the region began to be remained.
Unfortunately, a lot of aid aid had to move their doors.
And the question I asked me, I was going to help answer, this is a question that my aid workers ask themselves in the nurse of the world: What's the hell doing right now?
You know, the natural environment in Syria at the point of time -- and nothing really changed too much -- the best to describe it as "The France" and "with" the effect of "the Minister."
I remember in a remote that a few days after I went to the mirror.
There were some dozens of women who were born as, and they put their children very close.
After about 20 minutes a conversation with one of the young women I went forward and tried to put my fingerprint in the hand of her baby.
When I did that, I found that the motion was already hard for a moment.
She was hard, and her little hand and her life was a source of itself.
It's been a few hours earlier, and it's gone.
More later, I found that in her chicken was scared, this young woman was profound for two days in my hands who were scared in Richard, and they were trying to get out of it more money, money that very easily she couldn't see.
And that's the picture that I've come up with my sisters around the world, places where children, some of them are only eight -- they're in this response -- these kids have never happened in school.
But they're yes and killed with autonomous weapons.
Is it just the way the world works?
There's going to say that war is an inevitable human beings.
After all, it's there since.
We say, "We're never more," and yet it's happening again, and again, and again.
But I'm going to tell you that I've seen the perfect event of what we are, human beings, can do one another, and I still believe that can be different.
You want to know why?
Because for 20 years that I do this work, comes in and I get out of my life around the world, I got to build a structure of this problem that we're all, as human beings who are sitting in this common space, that we can change -- not by power, but just by looking at all the possibilities that we've been looking at and we've been looking at those who've
How is it possible?
I want you to see this: there's at least 800 million trends of reference and chemicals that are now reducing hands in the world.
Most of the spontaneously of citizens, like this little baby, who are in the apartments around the world, die of different famous groups that are based on almost infinitely infinitely infinitely infinitely infinitely infinite weapons, climate to humanity, reduce and help these citizens.
How powerful?
In some places in the world, you can buy AK-47 for just 10 dollars.
Many places I've worked, it's easier to get access to autonomy than to get access to those who are entrepreneurs.
Now to the important part: Can you do something in Darwin?
To answer the question, let's take a look at the map of the world.
And now we're going to lose all the countries that's going on in the war, and the number of people who are born, or we're going to have a result of violence.
It's a lucky data -- more than 40 million people.
But you can see something else in this map.
And it's that most of these countries are a third world.
Now, let's take a look at the 20 countries in the right world's face.
And what do we see?
We see them in green.
You can see that most of the states of GGGGO, especially Western countries.
What does this tell us?
It means that most people who are in violence in poor countries, and despite that, most people who are going to make life in rich countries -- people like me.
And what if a moment comes beyond climate intervention.
What if we look at all of the leadership that's going on in the world?
Who does the most business?
So about 80 percent of the restaurants come full of other societies from the confidence of the United States, in Germany.
It's amazing, isn't it?
Now some of you will probably say it's true for a specific point, "Yes, sure, but a moment..."
It was amazing to me.
It was really a professional experience.
But you're probably saying to yourself, you know, all of these weird tool in the warrior -- they don't make, but a result of the violence that's been tested in every day.
You know, places like Iraq and Afghanistan, where they need these weapons to keep laughing and dance, spread peace and security, fight in Egyptian -- which is a good thing.
Let's look at this conversation for one moment, because, you understand, there's been a traffic trade in climate change since the beginning of the war is clear.
In fact, it's a business that's going to spend himself over the last 15 years.
And now let's prevent this to the number of people who've been working directly directly from fathers around the world just at the same time.
What do you see?
So in fact, you see that it's also going through three times in four.
They're actually blueprints and days at the same point.
We can manage and infinite power if the top in the number of victims is responsible to the violence of the weapons, or to reduce.
But that's what we really need to understand from it.
What we need to figure out is that it's a relationship that's equal to explore, especially as you're going to have a climate weapon that's been sent to Iraq, to use Iraq, or to Syria, to those machines of the machines of the machines, which are now a demanding relationship that's now in the
And here's the dog.
Because, you understand, climate weapons everywhere, because they're a rare that their first beginning is also the last one.
The evidence of war, for a year, is now about 249 dollars -- 249 dollars per person, which is about 12 times more than we're doing in the end, money that's sun to win and reduce children and to fight in a third world.
We can change this vision.
How do you do that?
In fact, it's a problem of action and demand, so we can deal with it in two corporations.
On the opposite side, we can activate pressure on our governments to courage international transparency on the level of action like Atlantic School, which is done in order to be more responsible than their weapons go and why they're used.
Here, in the United States, the largest giant accident in the world, the president of Obama, in Design, to travel a bank. But nothing from it doesn't affect, until it's released by the Senate.
There we need to hear our voice.
You know, the prison of the sound tool -- you don't get the problem of the violence.
Gennani in the case of openness wouldn't open this problem.
But it's a very important step in the right direction.
And it's after us, the people of life in the rich countries, to bring here change.
And what about the dead side?
You know, generations around the world are taking life in violence.
You can take the amount of violence through an investment in education, in the law and economic development, especially for women.
I've seen a couple of independent instructions like this can be around the world.
But there's one thing: they require time, what means you're going to do, as you're looking for, if you want to make, please do it, in all of the events of your partners.
But you know that the way you're going to see is not less important than some you're crazy.
Social solutions, once in a month, they're a lot more effective way to make because they're enabled to the humanitarian organizations to plan in the right way and invest in the long term, and to be part of the families of families that have come from violence, wars that are actually very fast.
When I just got on the airplane for a young doctor, I didn't know what it means to live under war.
But today I can say I know what it means.
And I know what it means to be in a bed at night and listening to the Henry Ford.
Now, of autonomy, and think about what's going on is a couple of minutes has helped me until it's going to really come to me.
I can tell you that it's a lucky fear and inevitable, fear that millions of people around the world have to deal with every day, especially children.
Over the years I've been working on this work, unfortunately, the war has gone too much of the next few people.
And in the cases of war almost killed me.
But I believe all of all, and that's why I'm doing and doing every day what I'm doing, that we can choose another.
Because, you see, our war is as human beings.
We're customers, we're familiar, they're conducted and training it.
So yes, we don't get to know that we can't solve it.
Finally, we're the only ones that can.
Thank you very much, I behind you a lot of success.
Thank you.
Eric Hung Berberg: I guess you're normal doesn't need to show, but the audience of TED is global, and it's ridiculous, and it's why I've been going to open with his lives, and it's when himself can move all 18 pounds.
So let's go on 93 years in 93 seconds and down.
It's born in New York City...
JL: Nigeria, Canada.
EA: Nico, Canada.
Laughter) DNA: We went over seven seconds.
AA: What a phase.
It's born in New York City.
I'm going to be able to -- now I've got.
He took a prison when you were 9 years old.
It's about 52 meetings as a pilot comes up in the other world.
SL: I was interested.
It's about Los Angeles to succeed in Hollywood, first in the primary and won the TV.
You wouldn't have an artificial education in the classroom, but you've been going to get faster this way.
Finally, your teacher, was in a small program called "Everything remained in the family."
A sister made a teacher's teacher's teacher who's working today, they don't have a pain in in Hollywood: "Sanford," "" Mord, "" "" "" The
It's not just in a commercial way that everybody...
While your programs were somewhere between the 10 pounds in the head.
At some point, you're going to have a 120 million people a week, who've been looking at your face.
It's more than the audience of a 50, "that's worth one year.
NL: Okay and my son.
So I didn't get a part of "Oh," and we didn't get a part of "OK."
Laughter) You've been able to go into the middle of Richard Nigeria -- he had a list like this.
It's also responding to him.
Thank you very much for the whole community of TV on the day it's going.
I'm going to be in the movies.
"The green green green patterns," "" The Canada, "I'm and the guys," "" "" Skylon. "
Thank you very much, it's just a courage.
And then reinvented, in a third system as a political action, in the very first box to the evolution and to the privilege between the country.
It's about "The" for the American way. "
You're going to buy the bone and repeat it with, and it's also an active action in the generation and in politics.
By the age of 93, and then you wrote a book and you've made a documentary on your life story.
And after all of this, you decided to collect that you're ready to take TED.
So I've got to be here.
And I'm going to ask you, about the president to do this.
AA: Thank you for the web.
So here's my first question.
Is your mom out of you?
[] DNA: My mom...
What place to start with.
I mean this: When I went back from the war, she showed me the letters I wrote a disease from "Dad," and they were completely inherited by love.
It's certainly described my mom.
They were love love, as if I wrote them to the sound -- they were love love.
After a year, I asked them from my mother, because I wanted to stop them for the rest of my life...
It represents them.
It's my mom.
But the best I can admit it in the last few years -- it's also happened in the last few years ago, when you're going to lose the whole community of it.
It was in the morning morning, when I got a conversation from two of my audience's academic of TV and scientists.
He'd call me to tell me that everybody was going to have a day before and he's telling me that they're a secret that they're immediate all the community and here's the women.
I started to say, "Richard Nicson Nicson," because Richard Nicson... "
NG: Williliam Fillie, who sat the Sylus, David Saravia, who sat the Edney Edney, Edward Jersey, a big list of the tree of the summer, I think, the best decline ever on TV -- L.D., L.D., L.D.. and I am.
AA: No bad.
NNL: I've called my mother's right to my mom, in Ford School.
"Oh, you'll hear what happened, emails all the community."
And she says, "I've heard, if that's what's going to do, who I'm going to go home?"
So I've been able to know that's my mother.
I think it's certainly funny because everyone has an artist piece.
[]]]]]]] []]]]]]]]]]]
And I'm also going to have a very important role in your life, especially in its own way.
NL: Yeah.
EA: Tell us what happened when you were 9 years old.
NG: He's a telescope with three girls, who said, "I don't want to call them." I don't want to call them. "
And then I heard, maybe not the first time: "Look, John. I'm going to go."
And he went.
It turns out it's a fake, fake, and TV all over the planet to sell them.
But the fact of the fact that he's on the airplane to Oklahoma, and he'll give me a big fingerprint, like an email, my favorite actor.
It was a couple of years after Nigeria pushed the Atlantic.
It was cool, my father was TV there.
But when he came back, he was repeating it at a moment of the plane.
At the same evening, the house was full of the data, who showed my father when he was fighting his face, and he's going to get to the police.
And my mother's choosing the details because we've been going to go through the name -- she didn't want to stay there from most of a woman, in Charlie School in Mexas.
And when she sold the roads -- the house was full of people.
And in the middle of all of this, what's an unfamiliar with unfamiliar with his hand and said, "We're now the man in the house."
I'm in the wall and this idit says, "Now you're a man at home."
And I think at that moment, I started to understand the techniques in the human situation.
So...
Just after many years I looked back and I felt it was a positive side.
But -- "HA: You're interesting that you see something positive.
NL: Turns in this sense, which was for me called Kay.
I could think a couple of freedom to say to the baby boy is the 19th century: "Now you're a man at home."
And I continue to wait, and then he says, "The man in the house is not in the house."
And I'm...
Laughter) So...
In the back, I think I've learned to see the features in the human situation, and that was the profound that I used.
EA: So you've got a dad, you've got a mom that's probably nothing good for it.
You'll see your beginning as a child, maybe you've never felt that listening to him who's going to make you a journey that's at the end of a teenager who has a 120 million people?
NL: The table in me how I've been trying to take the question, because I think all my life I wanted -- if I wanted something, it was listening to me.
I think -- the answer is simple, yes, it was what you wanted -- well, there were other things.
When my father didn't be at home, I sat with a fabric radio system that we built together, and I took a generation that turns out that he was the coast of the North Korean.
Laughter) Yeah, someone laughed.
But it wasn't funny, because it was an idiot -- one more idiot -- that opened the page of New York City, "Robert and India.
The first time I took out there in this world, people who hate me because I was born to my hands.
And it was a huge impact on my life.
AA: So you had a child with a little bit of very healthy models, except your grandfather.
Let us tell us about it.
NL: Ah, my grandfather.
Well, I always talked about my grandfather.
There were notes, when I was a child, they had a lot of notes.
There's been a quarter on the day of the regular soldiers -- there's no one's day. "
There was a birthday of Abraham Lincoln, the birthday of Jorgan Washington and the day of Google...
And a lot of small insects.
My grandfather would take me there, and we'd be on the street corner, he'd have been waiting for my hands, and when I showed the stairs I've seen in front of us.
And he was very important to me.
He would write to the United States.
Everybody's opened up in the words: "Hey, Herry, the master's president," and he would say something great about something that the president did.
But also, as I didn't agree with the president, then he wrote, "Yes, Dr. President," Don't I told you a week? "
And I'm going to go every time in the stairs and collect the mayor.
We looked at the third level, on the street of New York 24, in New York City.
I've spent a little bit of a little kitchen on it: "Shahhhha School in this chair."
And that's the story I've told about my grandfather -- "HA: You've got the answers on the floor -- DNA: they wrote him back.
But I'm going to make a movie -- if we go back to the dog and others in front of it, there were dozens of interviews where I told it.
It's going to be the second time that says the story is that morning.
The truth was that my grandfather took me to the rules, there were a lot of noises.
It's true that it's about his life.
The truth is that it's been written every single time, and I'm going to collect the smallpox.
But "Jersey, Edn't president," and all the rest of the rest, all of that I've had a good friend who'd been the grandfather who wrote them out.
I mean, my grandfather's grandfather's grandfather's grandfather's grandfather's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandfather.
Never.
When I started writing my memories -- even that -- what would you say about it?
I even got it to experience.
When I started writing my memories and I started thinking about it, and then I -- I was in my house not a little bit and I realized how much I needed a dad.
Unfortunately, I've forgotten myself the grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandfather.
So the word "Dad" -- I have six children, by the way.
My favorite role in life.
And it's, and my wife's wife, Lin.
But I built his identity because I needed a dad.
I've spent a lot of insects and I've come out of it, and I'm a summer to my father -- the best thing I -- the word I think about -- the word I think about it and describe it -- he'd get.
The fact that it's expensive, Ghana and went to prison.
I'm going to move all of this in the word "Nake."
EA: You're saying that you're going to ask, and you're going to get rid.
NL: I'm a profession.
EA: You're a profession.
And this artist is reduced by Charles to design, but it turns out that it's built it from Los Alex.
So you're in a good society.
[]]]]]]: I want to talk about your work.
You've already wrote about your work and I'm sure that every life you've heard about this: her means for people, for our culture, you've heard the walls when I just mentioned TV plans, a half of the audience here through your work.
But would there have ever been stories about the effect of your work that's made you?
NL: Oh my God -- I'm going to get me and put me out of a foot to the head.
Last year, there was "Western" with House "who'd been published" by the House, "I'm an academic in what and academic.
The message of "West with..."
There was: What was the Jewish 92 -- I was then 92 years old -- and the French world?
Robert Miss was one of the seven who was on the stage.
And when he was talking about TV programs, he didn't talk about Hollywood, on Jersen Jerson in the "Jerson's France," or on the program that was then in the right place.
He talked about a simple thing that affected -- "Ah: A big impact on it?
NL: The effect on it -- I'm from the card to use the word "which has changed."
It's hard to give me the idea that I've changed someone's life, but that's how it's got it.
He's seen Jersen Roberson Roberson Robert's disease, "and he'd never knew that a black man could go to the president.
And he said it was so affected his life -- which changed his life.
And when I hear things like this -- small things -- because I know, I don't have a man in the audience that is not responsible for some small thing for someone, even if it's something that's going to do like a beetle or "unusual peace, it was so small.
Maybe the woman in the public website is that we've given the president of the disease on the table, and Jorgan wasn't what to do when Dardian, so he's a mirror, I don't have an idea.
But -- "HA: So in addition to the list that I mentioned at the beginning, I also had to mention that you invented the finger.
[]]]]]] []]]]]]]]]]]]
EA: I want to talk about... DNA: So do you do it.
[]]]]]] []]]]]]]]]]]]
And we're all wondering to these two -- we're not all successful.
But also those of us who can do the two things, often rare know how to do their two together.
You've succeeded your culture through your art and also the world's world's world's world's world's world's global success.
How did you do the two things?
NL: It's what's done in my view when you're going to give me all of the sophisticated.
This planet is one of a billion, so I've heard, in the universe where there's billions -- alcohol Arabs.
We're trying to save and we need to save.
But...
Everything that I thought was -- my sister asked me what to do about something that happened in National Science.
I said, "You're going to look at your budget in malaria, to the city or something like this."
She said, "But I'm not terrible, but I'm a city to a light."
And this was the first time I said this, "Chile, with everything you think about what I might do," and everything you've never done, "-- she'd never come out of Germany --" Can you happen enough to grow the planet and so on, "to measure everything I've done?"
So...
I'm convinced that we're all responsible to these things like my own.
And I understand you're saying -- "HA: very, very popular diplomacy -- DNA: But you need to think about the size and the size of this project.
EA: But here, on this planet, you had a real significance.
NL: I had a terrible luck.
[]]]]]]] []]]]]: So there's another question for you.
How old do you feel?
NL: I'm a concept of everyone I'm crazy with.
AA: So I feel 93.
Thank you very much: We finished?
AA: Well, I feel 93, but I hope one day I'm a young man like the Iran that I'm sitting in.
Ladies and gentlemen, terrible for everyone.
Applause) DNA: Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I'm motivated by passion to create images that tell stories.
A photograph can be remained as a trick of a single single moment in a long space.
Each moment or a picture represents our memories when time goes.
But what if you can search more than one moment in the photograph?
What if a photograph is actually captured the time, to push the best moments of a day and a single female into a single picture?
I created an idea called "Life" and I believe it's going to change the way you look at the world.
I know it did it for me.
My process begins in the photograph of artificial places, places that they're part of what I call our little memory.
I took a constant point and I wouldn't have.
I've spent the bad moments of humanity and light when time goes.
A photograph of 15 to 30 hours and a photograph of more than 1,500 images, so I'm training the best moments of today and night.
It's used as an accident, I'm a meeting without taking the best moments to one picture, a mammogram and I'm going to get our necessary journey in time.
I can take you to move to see the crazy bridge.
And I can show you the judgments in the morning over the Chinese river.
And at the same time, I can show you the president at night.
And for them, I can show you the analogy of the city.
I'm basically a five-meter street in the air, and everything that if you see in this photograph actually happened at the same day.
Last night is a global project, and my job always goes to theory.
I'm fascinated by the idea of going to go to a place like Venna and actually see it during a certain event.
And I decided I wanted to see the history of history, a long time that actually happened since 148.
The service and the actions look just like they looked like this.
And I'm really important that I really want you to understand is: it's not a photograph of time, it's I'm seeing during the day and night.
I'm collecting a conventional moments.
And the thing that brings me is the fear of one of them.
The whole idea came in 1996.
The LIFFFFFC invited me to create a terrible picture of the participants and the team of the movie Rovo Williama's Virgin's Virgan.
I came to Scott and I realized: It's a summer.
So the only way I could create a horrible was to take a photograph of 250 different images.
So I had Darwo and Chile Darwin was shocked.
And when I invited the camera to the species, I realized that there was a mirror and I saw that they were actually translated.
And at that moment, this single picture I asked them, "You're ready to just stop this picture?"
And then I went back to my studio in New York, and I looked at these 250 images together in my hand, and I said, "Wow, it's so cool!
I change the time in the photograph. "
And this slide actually remained me for 13 years until the technology finally started my dreams.
It's a picture that I've created a mammogram, a minute, a day and a night.
And I'm going to show you a short video that gives you an idea of how it is to be with me when I take these images.
At the beginning, you need to understand that to get monkeys like this, most of my time I spend up on the top, and I'm usually on a coffee or on a coffee.
So it's a typical day, 12-hours without the prosperity of all the day roads.
One of the things I like to look at people.
And believe me when I tell you, it's the best chair at home.
But it's really how I create these images.
So as soon as I decide about my photograph and the universe, I need to decide where today begins and night.
And that's what I call it and the time.
Einstein's describing time as a brand.
Think about the surface of a train: it's moving and stuck with the river.
I also see the time as a mouth, just that I take the brand and and the surface, which is the same to a single decade.
One of the unique revolutions of this work is also, if you look at all of my images, and the time is changing: Sometimes I'm going to move from the left to the right, sometimes go back to the bottom, even at the top.
I'm exploring the space skills within a 3D picture.
Now when I take these images, it's a three-dimensional like a three-dimension that's happening in my brain.
I'm in a picture of a time based on time, and that's what I'm reading is the main pattern.
It can take us a few months to sleep.
This work is that I have zero control when I get there every single day and forget the images.
So I'll never know who's going to be in the picture, if it's going to have a conversation or an impression -- there's no control.
It's at the end of the process, if I had a really successful day and all the same thing, I can decide who's in the face and who's outside, and it's all about time.
I'm going to take the best moments that I'm going to travel for months of laser and they're involved with no village for the asteroid.
I'm talking about the day and night as I saw them, creating a unique corporation between these two amazing world.
It's always been a really significant effect in my work and I've always been a big side of Albert Berket, a painting of the Amazon.
He was inspired by a series that I did in the National French.
It's an athetic park of Berket.
So that's the picture I've created biotic.
It's actually the forest story of the January 2016 of the Nazaka Gaza.
I took over 30 hours in this picture.
I was really on the right side, taking the stars and the mood light when it goes, the wind light that leads to cancer.
And I've also gone through the explanation of time on the surface.
The best part is, of course, to see the main moments of humanity when time is changing -- from night.
And in a personal stage, I had a blueprint of Berket's painting in the pocket.
And when the sun started to move in the hill, I started to really look at more of emotions because I looked at the wall and I said, "Oh my God, I get exactly the same form of a sea from 100 years ago."
Last night is about all the things, it's like a component of all the things I love about the imagination of the photograph.
It's about the wind, it's about the street of the street, it's about nature, it's going to touch the atmosphere, perspective -- and in particular, history.
It's one of the most historical moments that I was able to take, the seven halls of Bank Obama in 2013.
And if you look at most of the picture, you can actually see the time changes in these big television.
You can see the mystery with the kids, the president is now the audience, it's seven, and now it's talking to the audience.
There are so many challenges when I create images like this.
This particular picture, I was on a flight of a 15 feet in the air and it wasn't really stable.
So every time my sector and I won, our horizon is moving.
So on every picture you see, and there's about 1,800 images in this picture, which we've had to print our legs instead of every time we've been looking at the red.
So I learned so many extraordinary things during this work.
I think the two important ones are curiosity and the power of stress.
When you take a city like New York from the top, I found that these people in cars that I kind of live with every day, they don't look like people in more cars.
They feel like a huge fish, it was a kind of behavior.
And when people move the energy of New York, I think the picture begins to really search it.
When you look closer on my work, you can see there are stories going on.
You see that the Times Times is Nigerian, her cat and her sun.
So I decided, in this picture, I'll take the time.
So where the tools are, it's night and where the sun is actually a day.
A time is an amazing thing that we can't really understand.
But in a very unique way, I believe that these images are starting to put faces for time.
They're coming from a new physical reality.
When you spend 15 hours in looking at a place, you'll see things a little bit different than if you're or I'm going to go with our camera, and then we're going to take a picture.
It was a great example.
I call her "Shacker's" by the School. "
I've been looking for 15 hours in all of these people don't even look at the end of a morning.
They were more interested in using the ground.
They're going to come up, they'll get a picture, and then go.
And I think it's a really beautiful example, a powerful instrument between what we think the human experience is in front of what human experience becomes.
The action of collaboration suddenly became more important than the experience itself.
And at the end, my most recent picture, which has such a personal personal meaning: it's the National National Canada in Tanzania.
And it was in the middle of the Robera, it's not a teacher.
I've been particularly over the conference of the device to code hopefully the biggest diversity of animals.
Unfortunately, when we got there, there was a form that was happening in the president, in the form of five weeks.
So all the animals have been used to water.
I discovered that one third, and I felt that if everything remained as he was doing, I had a real opportunity to capture something unique.
We spent three days in his learning, and nothing could do with me why I saw during the day of the photographs.
I took over 26 hours in the France called Atlantic at six feet.
What I've been looking at was unable.
Actually, it's been profound.
We've seen over 26 hours, all of these beautiful species share a single pain called water.
It's the same pain that humanity is supposed to fight on it in the next 50 years.
The animals didn't even get one of the other.
They looked like we realized something we didn't.
This morning is called water is something we all need to share.
When I've created this picture, I realized that the day for night is really a new way to see, a long period of time, a space crisis in a photograph.
When technology opens together with the photograph, water wouldn't just get a deeper meaning of time and memory, but they're going to be a new kind of stories that didn't end, and make a window without our world.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What's the thing that the products do better than any other?
If you do a study, the first three answers can be: love, oxytocin.
Laughter) Maybe.
But let me offer a bad answer: math.
Did you know that in Egypt has more mathematicians than any other city in the world?
And also more reasons with mathematicians.
And if you look at the statistics of the President Foundation, which is often called the France of math, and there's always a huge mathematicians under the age of 40, you'll find that the French has more strength of the TV on the number of people than any other country.
What is it that we find so business in math?
After all, it seems to be scared and spread, just numbers and strength and rules that need to be there.
math is maybe abstract, but it's not a crisis and it's not about computers.
It's about our concept and our aging costs.
It's about imagination, the solution that we're most of the words.
It's about finding the truth.
There's not like the feeling that's popular to this when a months of an extinction, you're finally seeing the right idea for your problem.
The GDP is defined and Williel talked it -- seriously -- to be a sexual aspect.
But there's a point that this feeling can stay for hours, or even days.
The corner can be big.
The mathematical corruption is going to wait for the whole world of our physical world.
They don't need our senses but you can see them through mathematics.
Look at you for a moment and think what's going on right now around you.
Incredible spaces are invisible from the air around you, you're going to get in billions of billions of billions in every second, all of this is in a complete bus.
And yet, their statistics can be accurate with math physics.
And you open your eyes now to the statistics of these particles.
It's the regular flow of Ocus, or the mistakes -- of statistics with the average behavior.
This graph tells you about the statistics of the spaces of the proteins in the same way that a geographic book on the statistics of details.
It's one of the most important places ever.
It continues to happen again and again, a lot of theories and many experiments, as a great example of universal university that is so going to happen to us mathematicians.
On this accident, the famous scientist France France Frankton said, "The Greeks were finished if they were familiar it.
It's the top law of the finger and the bone. "
And there's no better way to give a form of this advantage than "The Alexton's". "
Within this window, there's a series of walls that Derek need little little boxes in an academic way, gas or those, or so on.
That's all of it in the spontaneous and plants.
Let's see what happens when we look at all these random traits together.
"It's a little bit to do," because we need to solve some movement costs there. "
Ah.
We think that artists's going to do me as a regulation on the stage.
Here's it.
These are the advantage of the finger and the bone.
The Ocus Fogus, there's here in the coffee box, as a dream of "The House."
For you, I've seen this, but my students, I'm going to explain why it can't be any other action.
And it's about these theories of this, you're looking at a beautiful studies in the explanation.
All science is this.
And the beautiful mathematicians are not just our aid.
They also change our view on the world.
For example, Einstein, Finstein, San Caki, they used a magic surgery of Southern Arabs and in the Ocus to explain that our world's complicated from atoms.
It wasn't the first time that math made a revolution in our view of the world.
More than 2,000 years ago, in the future direction, it's already happening.
In those days, just a small part of the world is studied, and the Earth would be infinite.
But Atlankins, with math, was able to measure the Earth with two percent.
Here's another example.
In 1673, Jane Man's House's House, who's a little bit more likely to look at Einstein than in Egypt.
In just this slide, and it's a little bit of a little bit, Nigerian Nicon in the planet is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit in a 0.3 percent -- so you don't even notice it in the real planet.
These stories show us that math allows us to go out of our intuition, measure the Earth that looks infinite, to see atoms that they're invisible or invisible in an invisible way.
And if there's just one thing that you need to take from this talk, it's this: math allows us to go beyond our intuition and exploration that doesn't expect our perception.
Here's a modern example that you're all going to have a friend to go to it: go on the Internet.
The global Internet network, more than a billion dogs -- do you want to go through everyone?
Social power is helping, but it's going to be unprecedented without mathematical models to find the information in the data.
Let's work on a small problem.
Imagine you're at the heart of women who work on a crime, and there's a lot of people who have their graph of facts.
Who are you Mars first?
Social answer: First dogs.
You see, let's say there's a number seven, tell you a story, but when you ask where it got it, it's affecting a number of three as a source.
And maybe a number of three, in his classroom, it's about one person as the first source.
Now one person's number one is first, so I'm certainly going to see it -- president.
And the graph we also see that the number four is the first step.
And maybe I'd even want to see it first, because there's more people who face it.
Okay, it was easy, but now, what if you have a big group of people who have done?
And this graph, I might look back on this as the people who are going to be in a complicated effect, but it can be the same as the Internet that's going to be on each other, it's called it for plants.
What are the most expensive?
Not so clear.
You're going to go to the fish fish, one of the early corruption of Google.
The algorithms use the rules of mathematician artists for giving the most relevant Internet Internet, the same way we use convenience in the experiment of a globe.
So let's go into this graph of a group of small small digital, and they can go from a restaurant through the graph.
Every time they come to a certain website, they're going to go through a certain link that's been scared in Arabic to the next website.
And again, and again, and again.
And with a little bit of little boundaries, we're wearing the restaurant of a few times a morning website by these digital sounds.
Here we start.
Scientists, academic.
And quite a time, let's make a completely discovery in the Arabic to define the chain.
And you'll see this: from the finger and the finger of the solution.
The highest privilege of these sites that somehow better to connect to other people, more machines to them than others.
And here we see clearly what the Internet is we want to try first.
Again, the solution came out of the random.
Of course, since this time, Google has developed a lot of algorithms, but it's already beautiful.
And yet, just one problem from a million.
With the digital age, more and more and more problems that are being used to analysis, and become the work of mathematicians more useful and more useful, to a situation in which a few years ago, it takes a first place between hundreds of jobs in the best and the worst jobs that was published in Wall Jersey in 2009.
math -- the best work in the world.
It's in her presidents: the communication theory, the information theory, the gaming theory, a rejection, a machine learning, a wonderful surgery.
And why don't you go to the ladies, the Central Central, or the dinosaurs?
Every one of these areas have an industrial effect.
And Derek, there's a big money in math.
And let me admit that when it's about doing math money, the Americans are without any option of the world, with billions of nurses and giant companies, all of them, at the end, about a good algorithm.
Now with all of this beauty, useful and wealth, math really looks more business.
But don't think the life of math is climate life.
They're full of baseball, eliminate, fire struggle to build.
Let me give you one of the most famous days in my life as a mathematician.
Or I need to say, one of the most exciting communities.
At the same time, I was at the high risk of studies in Frankton -- for many years, the house of Albert Einstein and you can argue that the most exciting universe in the world.
At that night, I was working and I worked on a regulation, which was not perfect.
It was about the understanding of an extinction of the magic piece of Palestina, which is a collection of electronics.
In the perfect world of the parasitation, there's no conventions, and there's no doubt that's going to make the creativity that we're used to.
But yet, if you put a little bit of the weight of the park, you see that the electrical device that's created in a fantastic way, or a spinning, as if it's a little bit of a selective power.
This discovery effect, is called "Civil's", "it's one of the most important things in physics, and it's changed through math ideas.
But yet, the mathematical understanding of this phenomenon was safe.
And I've been afraid with my student to the past and participate with my head action, in Egypt at the time, we've been working for months on this conversation.
In fact, I've already been necessary about mistakes that we can solve it.
But the truth is, the evidence just didn't work.
Although more than 100 pounds of complicated mathematics, and a few pounds, and a giant feedback, it didn't work.
And at the same night in Frankton, a small tree in the trillion chain that would help me.
I put all the energy and experience and my tricks, and yet nothing worked.
One night, two at night, three at night, doesn't work.
About four in the morning, I'm going to go to a fabric bed.
And then a few hours later, wake up and do, "Oh, it's time to take the kids to school --" What is that?
There was a voice in my head, I was wrong.
"Look at the other hand to the other side, the mirror and become the L2."
[]]]]]] Love, this was the beginning of the solution!
You see, I thought I was a little bit, but actually my brain went to work on it.
In these moments, you don't think about your career or your colleagues, it's just a little bit close between the problem to your home.
And after it said, it doesn't surprise if you get a cartoon on the hard work that you do.
And after we put the giant analysis of "Design Laden," I've been enough to get the president of the president of the president of the president of the president in India, in the Ukraine, in 1910 -- respect not to dream on't have a dream, a day I'm
What do you think, about this event?
Oh, right?
And you're very grateful to transformation costs that made it possible.
And the way it was a whole surprise, you have to share it, not just with those who will cooperate with you.
I believe everybody can appreciate the sense of a mathematical research, and share the stories of human beings and ideas behind them.
And I've been working with my team at the Neanderthals, together with partners and artists of the world's math communities, so we can make a special museum of math from ourselves there.
So in a couple of years, when you go to the pig, after you put the amazing and the principles, please let's look at us at the Neanderthals, and you're going to get the crazy dream with us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The world's full of amazing choices and industrial networks.
And when we get access to all of these, we act, we love.
But most of the time people around the world without real meaning to art and culture.
If connections can be produced from that that we're exploring our network, the wonderful places and art in the world?
Before we start with a talk, I just want to mention a few points, for the good room.
First of all, I don't have art or culture.
I went into the field in the case, but I'm crazy about it.
Second thing, everything I'm going to show you is that you're going to be able to the museums, for the amazing organizations, our partners.
There's nothing that's about Google.
And finally, what you see behind me is right now on your mobile phones, in your computers.
It's our new platform, in the back, you can explore thousands of museums and service that are on your fingerprints, in quality and a very high detail.
The variety of the mechanisms is what's amazing.
If we just had doctors, if we had just a modern art, I think it was pretty happy.
For example, the month we've launched "The black history" that including 82 pounds in art and culture of this community.
We've also got an amazing strengths, full of hand workers, called "France in Japan."
One of my favorite implications that she was, in fact, the idea of my talk I didn't think I was going to become a form of beautiful boundaries.
But at the end of this happened, and dogs for this discovery, that I really showed me what the skills are going to make a beautiful fingerprint.
I believe me, it's very exciting.
I've been scared.
And for the next, in the president.
One small example I wanted to show here, that you can share with your kids and your friends right now, is that you can get to all these amazing institutions are also digital.
One of our last ideas was in a contrast with a museum of leadership in New York, to give a minute of how it could feel really there.
You can go to the ground and of course, I guess most of you were already there.
And you can see what the architecture of this architecture is.
But imagine what this funny meaning for a child in the mortality of architecture, which still didn't have an opportunity to get to the leaders.
Of course you can look at the choices of the leadership museum, you, of course, can go into them and all.
There's a lot of information here.
But it's not my talk today.
It's already there.
We're now looking at the building security for a very exciting future, at the moment for art and culture and culture and culture and culture and culture.
I've been here today about the best social stage, an artist who's in our office in France, Syrian Darwin, from the interview of interactive design at the University of the United States in the city of Los Angeles.
Chris and our engineering team tried to find these connections and invest some of them.
I'm going to talk about it quite fresh.
The piece that you see behind me -- Oh, just to move: you're always going to see the real thing.
In the case that people will think I'm trying to make the real thing.
So continue.
The piece that you see behind me is and the ocean from a flight.
It's one of the ancient jobs in the world, from about 23,000 years ago, it's in the Golden and the Museum for the Museum of Israel.
It's also one of the best jobs in our platform.
Let's take a step back.
We're starting from this single choice.
What if we go away and really try to experience our cultural judge?
How can it show?
However, we're focused on a daily basis in the cultural risk -- more than six million cultural stations that work in different institutions, we've given them, to actually build these connections.
You can travel in time, you can understand more about our society.
You, of course, you can look at it from our planet's perspective, and try to see how it can show without boundaries, if we're just exposing art and culture.
We can also adopt this as a ecosystem, which is a conservative design, it's really fascinating.
You can spend hours, look at every decade and drug that were in the decade and for these years to art, to theory and culture.
We were happy to show you every decade and a decade for hours, but now we don't have enough time.
So you're invited to go to your phones and do it for yourself.
Thank you, if you don't care, you're going to give you the walls to the end, I don't want to get me time, because I want to show you a lot more cool things.
So, really, in president, you can go from here to a very interesting idea.
Over the image of the beautiful picture, beyond the right woman, what's the goal of this? How is it useful?
The next idea is that there's a mammogram with a mammogram that we had in the museums, which by the way, I loved them, because they're going to spend all their lives to really tell these stories.
One of the oceans said to me: "Oh, how could it be if you could create a virtual table where all of these piece of creativity were doing so that we could look at them?"
You can look at a lot of time in different choices and try to figure out where they came.
It's a crazy experience.
So let's go -- let's take the wrong and take a crowd and a body that's made a very good way in this platform.
The institutions of institutions that we have, we have more than 211 amazing states in this artist's quality, are dangerous in a beautiful way.
And as you go to the details, as a series of a fingerprint in, you can see all the nervous patterns, you can see nature.
But I want to focus on one short example, which is very climate: "The room of the bedroom."
It's a piece that there's three pounds: The first in the museum and a body in a train in, the other in Museum in Museum in Museum, and one in the high school of Chicago, which is actually, the interview of all three jobs I think only is the second time.
But, digital and virtual, they're local for each one who wants to look at them in a very different way, and nobody's going to push you as well.
So let me take you on a short journey through "the bedroom," so you can experience what we're doing with any piece.
We want the picture to look at how much more in digital platform.
And everything you need is a connection to the Internet and a computer.
I'm sorry, it's in a living generation. So we'll have to give a little bit of a little bit -- and it's possible for every piece of creation: modern art, Richard -- what you're going to say, even a cat.
Sometimes you don't know what you can add you to art, museum or cultural discovery.
So for me, in real way, it was a simple challenge, because when I decided to do it in a full time in my mom, my mom wouldn't really have a idea.
I love my mom, but she thought I would spend my life on these museums.
The museum of depression is what you're doing when you're in a budget, you're talking about it and me -- and that's, right?
It took about four and a half years to convince the wonderful and Indian artist that it's actually needed.
The way I did this -- one day I realized that she liked the same.
So I started to show her all the jobs that have the same material.
And the first thing my mom asked me, was "How can we buy them?"
And so I said, "Oh, my daughter's daughter is not high so much so I said to her," We can't really do that, mom.
But you can explore them and virtual. "
So, now, my mom -- every time I'm going to come up with her, she'll ask me another identity? Another money in your project? You can show me? "
And that's the idea that I'm trying to wait.
It doesn't matter what's called you, as long as you're in this.
Once you're designed -- you're in the face.
Let's take a little bit more, quickly, there's a pretty bad idea to show the moment, I'm going to talk about it right in the box.
We all know they're going to look at art in our eyes is amazing.
But we also know that most of us can't do it, and even for those who can afford to do it, it's complicated.
So -- Serra, can you argue our art, how do we call it?
We don't have a really good name for it.
But at the end, we've got around a thousand amazing institutions, in 68 countries.
But let's start with Robert.
We can only have time for example.
Social corporations, we have about 500 amazing stations of Robert from 46 institutions and 17 countries.
Let's say that in your next five, you want to go to see each of them.
It's your trouble: You'll have to move 53,000 kilometers, to visit 46 institutions, I'm just going to switch the ocean, you're probably going to take 10 tons of carbon dioxide.
Laughter) But, remember, this is art, so somehow you can do it somehow.
We're going to continue to predict, something a little bit more technical and interesting.
All we've shown you so far is using the creative tools to create connections.
But now we've got something cool that everybody's talking about: machine learning.
So we thought to ourselves: Why don't we take all the data and see what a machine can learn from it in the basis but just on the visual pollution of all this collection.
Finally, we got this interesting map, for those capabilities don't have data points, they've been created just by visual pollution, and we've got them together.
For us, every group is art for itself.
But one of the groups that we want to show you is this amazing group of dynamics that we found in biologists around the world.
If you're a little bit more to get close, a muscle.
Just to show you, you can even go out between academic.
And then you can look at nature, look at horses and there's a lot more groups.
When we saw all these patterns we thought, "Well, maybe we can do something fun for children, or maybe do something creative to make people interested in magic?"
Because I've never really come up with young children who are excited to go to the Kenyan.
I wanted to think about something.
So we've made something called the academic cells.
It's pretty clear to himself, so I'm just going to give a musician to show his beautiful face.
And what's going on is that when it's moving the head, we're going to get different academic of music around the world.
So I don't know about you, but I've seen it to my microbial and my sister and amazing responses.
They didn't stop asking "When can you go to see it?"
And by the way, if you're able to be able to live and find one that's happy?
Oh, perfect.
By the way, we didn't do it back.
Thank you, Serra. It's cool.
Oh, wow. Well, let's continue -- another one will take us all the time.
So art and culture can also be fun, right?
Our last career experiment -- we call all of these experiments -- "our final experiment is doing again in a machine.
We're showing you groups, visual groups, but what if we could ask from the machine also to make these groups?
What if we could hide them automatically, without using money information?
So what we've got is a kind of fabric, which we've been asked, I think, in the Western Arabs.
We didn't really do something special here, just invented the collection.
And we found interesting categories.
You can start with horses, a very clear category.
You'd expect to see that the neighborhood is taking pictures of horses, right?
And she really did it, but notice there, there's a very abstractive picture that he's still able to identify and worse.
We've also got an amazing mayor, on the head of San.
And every one has a mistake that's around what it's beating to this theory.
Let's continue to another theory that I think is an interesting and interesting, because I don't understand how it was invented.
It's called "Grushing."
Second, if you can do this in the president, you'll see that we have these amazing images of roads, I guess, you're waiting or art.
I don't completely understand it.
But I tried to ask my connections in the museum, "What is it?"
And it's fascinating.
Fathers back to the identity, in front of the muscles, I wanted to look at the identity and see how the machine is going to move all the gold.
But, in fact, she didn't hide it as the identity.
We live in popular times.
It's driving it as "Bill Berberg". "
So I'm a little bit of a musician, because I'm getting too fast.
In the end, here you have all the Bill Book's notes in the world in a room for you.
And finally, to put this talk and these experiments, I hope you feel after this talk is happy, emotions.
And what looks like if we look for happiness?
If we look at the strength that's going to go under "happiness, I guess you're going to see happiness.
But there's one piece that's been really fascinating, this piece of Dr. Darkland, our friend and also the artist in the content, which is called "I'm going to get my brain to the Internet."
I don't know why the machine feels that she's going to move into her brain before the Internet and it's scared here, but it's an interesting thought.
Sometimes I'm really excited to my brain joined the Internet, but not at all the moment for art and culture.
So take your phones, take your computers and go to visit the museums.
And it's just a light that's going to move to all of the consumption, historians, the oceans, which are in the museums and reduce all of this culture.
The point that we can do is get the beauty of culture and art to ourselves and our children.
Thank you.
Thank you.
One way to change our genes is to generate new genes, as Richard and Twitter proved in a lot of genetics.
Little, you can change our lives.
We're learning that these changes can be very powerful and very dynamic, and we don't need to make a lot of order to invest in them.
When you eat a healthier, you're able to treat the trees, you're going to get more and love, you're going to have the blood and the oxygen to grow up.
But beyond that, the brain is growing up as well.
The things that we've been thinking about is impossible today.
Rather Williams realized this a couple of years for us.
So you can do a few things to make a brain create new brain cells.
Some of my favorite things, like her chocolate, academic, alcohol, manipulated and fossil walls, which are in Maria.
I'm just the third.
[Where were we?
Laughter) Other things can reduce the situation and make brain cells.
The regular curiosity, like Martin and Street, Nicotsin, Pacific, Kakoki, a crop and a chicken.
When you change life's organ, you're going to have the blood flow to the skin and so you're going to take a little bit more, the skin doesn't expect so much.
And the heart gets a crazy person.
We've shown that we can actually make a mammogram of heart disease.
The presidents that you see up on the left, are significant after one year.
In the optimists of the heart, down from the left, the blue shows a blood flow.
After a year, the chimpanzee and a son shows a fifth person.
We've been able to stop and make the autonomous cancer and cancer in their early days, if you just do these changes.
The early progress is growing up in a president in 70 percent in the group that's made these changes, and only in 9 percent of the critical budget.
These women have a high level.
Even the species get a crazy person, and that's how you get the species.
One of the most effective issues against health care care, you've shown that comparison, that's conducted, that you're going to get a heart or a tree, but it's also caused to be an intuitive.
Half of the men who've heard of years are intuitive.
It's business?
We also found that we could change genetic genetic genetics in men with autonomous cancer.
It's a heat in with different colors, and on the side of the right is made up of genes.
We've found that over 500 genes have changed for the good, the good genes, the disease, have been affected, and the genes of the diseases.
These species are very powerful and they're making many people a new hope and new possibilities.
Scientists like "Nigeria," "" DNA "and more of genetic prototypes," remains people a sense of "God, what can you do?"
Well, our genes are not our limitation, they're an academic, and if we're doing big changes, we can change the way that our genes might be.
Thank you.
[] Applause].
Have you ever been asked by a Chinese friend, "What is your luck?"
Don't think they're just asking.
If you say, "I'm coffee," they imagine you're 24,368 or 60.
Laughter) A question about luck is a training way to ask what your approach is.
Your luck also affects the way they did.
On your luck and your unfortunately, your personality, your career and how you're going to be able to have a certain year.
If you share your animals and your partners, they're going to make a picture on your private life.
Maybe you don't believe in the Chinese luck.
Since the population of the world's population is affected, you'll have to do something about it.
So what is the Chinese luck, exactly?
Most Western interventions think about the Greek Council of Rome, the symbols come up with 12 months.
The Chinese luck is different.
It's a 12-year-old cycle that's out of life, and it's starting in a road and a couple of weeks in the back, and it's not going to have the sky.
For example, if you were born in 1975, you're Arabic.
You can see your luck there?
Our Chinese ancestors built a very complicated theory in San Vang, the elephants were 12 wheelchairs.
Over thousands of years, this popular culture has affected the central decisions of people, like a chimpanzee, Nigerian, Lada and demanded by the other.
And some of the consequences are pretty amazing.
The Chinese believe that certain animals are better than others.
So teachers choose to take babies in some years, because they believe that I've been scared in the right song of animals can bring rise to families.
We're even pharmaceutical phones when we go into a static relationship.
I'm a repeat, I've got to have a perfect artist with magazines, water and lands.
Scientists believe that some animals are enormous.
As a repeat, I need to recognize a demand.
Raise your hand if you're afraid.
Let's switch later.
And we believe that some animals are more lucky than others, like the Syrian.
In contrast to the Western tradition, the Chinese magazine is a symbol for power, powerful and wealth.
It's the dream of everyone who has a date baby.
The parents of Jah's parents are going to be really proud.
And they're not the only ones.
In 2012, the Syrian, the number of reasons in China, Hong Kong and Titan came in five percent.
It means another million babies.
With a restaurant tremendous tremendous tree, girls in the same year was 120 to 100.
When these cartoons grow up, they're going to have a lot more strength in love and the workplace.
In the BBC and the second Chinese government intervention, in January 2015, she had an extinction in Southern Kenyans.
Why?
It was the last month of the horse.
It's not because they like this, it's because they're trying to avoid bringing babies unfortunately.
Laughter) If you go, please don't feel bad.
These are babies.
They don't look back.
Laughter) Tris is also a unprecedented animal, in its normal temperature.
A lot of Chinese areas have been reduced by Luba in Luba over these years.
Maybe you have to choose the luck into the walls, because these rapid and these chimps are going to face less strength.
Maybe they're the ones that are lucky.
I've gone through 300 people in the world of France, and it's interesting to see that the two unprecedented animals, the rise and the Timbus, they're at the top top of the list, even more than the Civil.
So maybe we need to voice, maybe it's better that you're going to be less strength.
Second point, but it's interesting: many Chinese make their investment decisions based on privacy.
Even though the faith and the luck of the luck there are thousands of years, the training to use them in important decisions didn't happen to the last few decades.
Our ancestors were very busy to survive the poverty, the shape, the noise, the diseases and civilizations.
And finally, the Chinese people have the time, the trust and technology to create art life that they always wanted.
The collective decision that's done by 1.3 billion people living in markets and empathy to everything, health and education to forget.
When China's doing this important role in the global economy and the politics, the decisions that are going to be based on walls and other symbolic trials eventually affect everyone in the world.
Is there a coffee here?
2016 is the summer.
Turns are smart, curiosity, creative and slavery.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm a American artist woman, like you all.
And I'm also a professional for social justice, something I'm trying to define as a real job.
To explain what this is, I'll tell you how I got here.
I've been affected all over the country.
And what do you tell you, America is great, right?
It's got a fossil nature, commercial and zeros and savings as the eye can see.
It's really something.
The American population can be part of three main categories: most of them are wonderful people, there's conditions and Porda.
It's exposed from Maria, the most academic theory here is the conditions.
They're a mystery, but they're spending on it in the patterns.
They're suffering from a wonderful depression of the museum, and right, some of the men do have been scared.
As a social justice, my goal is to change these conditions, because they're conditioning a lot of things, and it's bringing negative results, like stem cells, violence and green violence.
The list isn't full of; I've probably invented 37 pounds.
But the point is that we have to treat conditions.
But there's all kinds of people and not effective for everyone, right?
So I've created the most scientific discipline of the conditions.
Basically, I took all the conditions, which I put them in a culture, like a good scientist, and that's what I discovered.
It's first of all, we've got goals.
These are digital conditions that are too similar to the gene.
These are people who come from the work to be able to get all of the day films into "YouTube."
There's also the rich conditions in the gene.
These are people who are focused on the region, wait that the light will spread into green and then they consume: "You're going to go to your country!"
Once they were going to go out of the car and put you in the face, but today they're much less productive.
Another symbol to America's health.
But the next category is the gene of the kind of kind, "The goal of the goal that I've come up with," I've made it a smoke. "
These guys like to play through a nice organization, like CEO or CEO, and they're often talking about a special style.
But the group that's interesting to me is the conditions that are looking at.
The trick of the trick is like the exact invention of the trick -- it's just not able to decide!
It's like a biological device that's going to have between inevitable.
And it does it because it doesn't have enough information.
That's the group I'm focused on in social justice.
Why?
Because between Kenya to the region, the average American is extended by media, as you see in this graph.
It's very popular media.
And in the back, this graph is accurate mathematics, and it's based on imaginary numbers.
[The question is: What's the success secret of social justice?
First, it's involved.
When you're laughing, you'll go into a situation of openness.
And at the same moment of openness, a good social commercial can push a lot of information, and if it's really special, it's also a small test.
[Here] some basic rules of social media: First of all, it's not extinct.
It's not a political media: it's about social justice and no one's dead.
Second, it's lucky and what, the feeling is like sitting in a bicycle.
Third, it's rich, but also inevitable, like to hear about an interesting study about economic inequality, in a very sophisticated concept.
It's how I see the success of social media.
A few years ago, I collected a group of American musicians -- not in violence -- and we've got all over the country to places like alone, Eric, Turkey, Jersey -- places where they love "--" and we've done academic actions.
We've read to the Amazon "Muslims come!"
So we did this film, and after the film came out of a scanner that was known for 300,000 dollars on the horse of the Social Social School in the Olympic -- the bottom system in New York City.
The presidents were really proud, not to mention the bad design -- if you want to be genes, at least you're used in a beautiful body.
But we decided, why don't we publish our presidents, who say about good Muslims, and also hide the film?
So I'm and a comic friend, Darwin Ella, we decided to go out in the prison journey: "Women in the roof with the president."
We've put the money, we've been working with the artist for five months, we've got skills for president, and two days after they've been supposed to be published, the I.T. decided to be reduced because of political content.
Let's see how many of these.
Here's one of them.
Socies about Muslims: Muslims invented the hospital.
Well.
Second: adult Muslims can do more than the features of institutionalists.
It's a fact: the Muslims invented Jatin Turk.
So let's see another one.
The truth is about Muslims: they have great arguments to the French corruption.
Obviously, refugees are political interested in the II.
Or the extension of Muslim is looking at political -- but it's not the thing.
The thing is right.
So we decided to change the "war" war "with previous preferences" and turn it into "war's struggle with exhibitions."
Laughter) So I actually say that two aircraft musicians will be a very important agency in New York City and the physicists were faced.
Thank you.
There was a very strange feeling, forever.
It was like, "That's how to be rare?
"It's amazing!"
So here's another example.
I'm always asking me, "Why don't the Muslim don't we make the speech?"
But okay, Angeles in a sense.
I decided to get the website "The damage."
It's a website that's reducing the speech every week, and the Scott takes freedom.
So let's see another example.
It's how you're going to do a single comics: "I'm going to define the speech! And people don't put paper in a printer!"
The idea in the website is to move the speech and also reminds in Asland that we need to grow all the time.
But if you're not in growth, social media is good for all kinds of problems.
For instance, I'm a comic, I'm a coffee, we've come to an artist in order to explore the banks in the hospital.
The United States is about 300 billion dollars a year in these aircraft that was built.
I don't want to switch, but at the end of every month, I'm going to ask me about five to 15 dollars per hour.
So we've gone into these boundaries where I've been there and we asked if you can open a bank with eight dollars and 27 cents.
Laughter) The babies were excited to us from half a minute, and they read the security of security.
The security people would come in, they've been extended in their weapons, and then we've been using fear and forth, because it's the last rule in social media -- sometimes it's making you a park in the face.
I've been working on my job to seven.
It's about creating connection and laughter.
But right, sometimes the security of security is made me.
Sometimes I'm getting ridiculous objects and Dr. School.
Sometimes I'm getting public opinions, if I'm going to have with my conversations, I'm going to kill me and my family.
And my mother's conversation doesn't exist.
But despite all of the evidence, I still think the social media is about our best.
Because we've tried a lot of attitudes to the problem of social justice, like war, artificial communication on the ice.
But there's still a lot of normal things.
So I think it's time to tell some really good deal.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I live in the East East Africa for about 10 years, and I'd like to share some of you from the surface, on the world sea.
I believe that the biggest failure of human species is the fact that we've left behind more than a billion of our minds.
Social, extreme poverty, it's often like huge problems, that you can't get rid of them, or solve them.
But as a summary man, I believe these are a very successful problems, if we're just looking at the right activity programs.
Arix was a great opinion in the future imagination, and he taught us that if we're doing the right insects, we could move the world.
In the struggle against extinction, I believe that there's three powerful objects that we can operate.
This conversation is suffering around these monkeys and how you've been able to win against the poverty of our lives.
What's an extinction?
When I first went to live in the East East Africa's country, I've come to the farmers of farmers.
They were great people.
They invited me into their hands. We've seen cities together and we've had a simple dinner.
They gave me a smoke with her on the floor.
In the morning, even though, there wasn't what to eat.
And then in the lucky arm, I looked at the conference of a kitchen goes and a brothers, in the restaurant, a blind girl wrote a shoot to the lunch.
In this conversation, every child who's got one cat to survive.
I can't tell you how much I was asked when they gave me one of these pieces, and I knew I had to get their arms.
Children need an unfortunate to survive, but also to grow physical and travel.
Every day they don't eat, they lose a little bit of blood.
In these sea of life in an extinction, there's a surprise of one of three children in an inevitable way of life that's water doesn't tell.
When you put it with a healthcare approach, one of the 10 children in the extreme poverty has come up with his personal birthday.
And it's just a quick quick of kids who're finished at high school, because they don't have money to go to the restaurant.
Social and extinction enables human capacity in any possible way.
We see ourselves as a human species think, feelings and moral, but until we take these problems for all of us, we don't have this device, because every person in this world is important.
This child is an important one.
These kids are important.
This girl is an important advantage.
We realized, we see things like this, and they're making us, but they look like so big problems.
We don't know how to take a significant action.
But remember our friend France.
The world's World War has powerful objects.
This is a problem as another problem.
I live and work on the surface and a man. I believe these are very good problems.
So in the next 10 minutes, let's not be nervous from the world.
Let's take our brains.
Let's look at our commercial passion for the solution of problems and between them are falling.
Number one number: Most of the world's eyes are farmers.
Think how extraordinary it was.
If this picture represents the world's eye, then more than a half of businesses in agriculture as a scientific source.
It's very exciting to me.
All of these people, one profession.
Think how powerful it was.
When farmers start to reduce more production, then more than the world's world's world's world's world's world's disease and get more money and transparency.
And more than that.
The product of agriculture is, of course, food.
So when farmers are more productive, they get more food, and they're not just helping themselves, but they're also transparency to healthy communities and economies.
And when farmers are more productive, they're releasing the tree on the environment.
We only took two ways to feed the world: or we're going to get out of our agriculture more productive, or we're going to train and interventions to make more agriculture, which is an environmental illness.
The farmers are actually a key point.
When farmers are more productive, they're smaller, they're educated from the poverty, they're feeding their communities and they're scaring the environmental warrior on the ground.
The farmers are at the center of the world.
And it's not like this, it's this bridge.
Most of the farmers I know are actually women.
Look at the wall and the extension of this woman.
It's physically powerful, a neural conversation, and it's going to do every trick to get better life for her children.
If we're going to put the future of humanity in one person's studies, then I'm very happy that it's.
But there's only one problem: a lot of farmers with small regulations of knowledge and basic tools.
Today, they take a little bit of genes that have been conducted from the last year, take them on the ground and women with the video room.
It's tools and curiosity techniques from the bunda, and that's why there's a lot of farmers have been very poor.
But again, there are good news.
The number of two: humanity actually evolved the problem of poverty in agriculture a hundred years ago.
Let me show you your three basic secrets in agriculture.
First of all, it's creating a discovery that's been involved by the two forests together.
If you're in a natural way that's made a high movement together with a eye that's always in the shape, you've got general properties that make positive features.
At the next point, Dr. Kenney Canada, if you use it in a responsible way, it's a environmental sustainable sustainability.
If you give a toilets, you're just a coffee's coffee of a smoke that's high than I'm, you're going to make a huge prototype.
These things are known as agriculture.
Scientists need to come in a combination with the right agriculture.
When you take the arms and you take a lot of an organic fingerprint, farmers reduce their homes.
These tools and chemicals are more familiar to get the agriculture in every main region in the world, and they're going to have a huge amount of people.
We've just got to spread this knowledge to everyone, especially in Africa that's South Korea.
So at all, these are amazing news.
The humanity actually evolved the problem of poverty in agriculture a hundred years ago, in theory.
We've just got to spread these solutions to everyone.
In this century, the reason why people stay poor is maybe their fingerprinting in a remote places.
They have access to these solutions.
So, the poverty of poverty is just a matter of knowledge and productive products on the surface of other people.
We don't need more genes right now.
The motion of motion is that we're going to reduce the global poverty in our lives.
So these are the three monkeys, and the remote flow of everyone is just the end of the page.
Instead of the corporations, governments and organizations without any profit of the open networks of products and knowledge to the daily life we're spending the poverty.
Okay, so it sounds very nice in theory, but what about reality?
How do you look at the open networks like this?
I'd like to share a minute example that I know very well, my organization, Karan and Iran.
We're using only agriculture, and we've come up with it to provide the tools that are going to succeed.
We're starting with agriculture answers to very rural areas.
Well, the thing might look at the beginning as a hard challenge to do, but it's very possible. Let me show you.
We spend a lot of agriculture from many farmers that we're working, and we'll put them in 20 pounds like this.
So at the next point, from the top of the answers, we're asking hundreds of seconds of 10 tons and send them to the regular agriculture on the surface.
They're then spending their families and they're reducing it from their own experience.
It's like "Amazon for rural farmers.
It's exciting, because it's so that the lesson will work in fact requires water.
Scientists spend a little bit of time and reducing the most of us.
Like yes, we're captured of it.
Our rural surface is providing a platform and revenue to agriculture that's in one week for two weeks.
Instead of where we tell our services, agricultural agencies are going to move out of these tools.
It's Canada, the agriculture that's going to look at our program.
You'll see the wind that's on Kenya.
It's the prosperity that's driven, which I think is the human right of every person's right in the happiness.
Today, I'm proud of happiness that we spend about 4,000 agriculture like Kenya.
Thank you very much.
In every single area, we're conducting a convenient train as our services to 200 agriculture in average, and more than 1,000 of their family.
Today, we've got 2,000 vehicles and a book is going to grow quickly.
It's our brains and we're just one organization.
There's corporations, governments and so many CEOs that have been reduced by the brain just like our own.
I'm going to believe that we're in a moment in a common artist, we can provide agriculture for all agriculture in the wealth.
Let me show you some possible thing.
It's a map of Africa that's created to the restaurant, alone of the United States as a scale.
I've been chosen in Africa that's going to go to the restaurant because it's in a giant area.
This is a serious challenge.
But after we looked at all the size of 6,500 miles on the continent, we found that half of the agriculture comes in these products.
It's a very small surface on it.
If we're against these areas together on the United States, we'll just take the recycling part of the country.
You can invite a piece of everywhere in this region and it's going to go to your face, trillion and TV.
If the United States can deliver the area of this size, then the corporations and the CEO of Africa can provide agriculture for all of its agriculture.
It's possible.
I'm going to be asked by looking at the whole, beyond agriculture.
In any sense of humanity, we've already found effective tools to the skin.
We just need to spread them.
So again, in any sense of humanity, smart people already have invented very powerful tools.
The humanity is very good at simple solutions and powerful to the skin.
We just need to collect a very small area.
Let's use again in the airport of Africa that's created as an example, remember that I'm a privilege in the hospital areas.
I'm a little bit more convenient in these little boundaries.
Again, if we use the United States as a scale, it seems to be what I was called "The France of the French."
In fact, for the first time in human history, we're going to have a lot of lessons.
Cities, governments and CEOs from all over the world are reduced in the brain that are certainly able to reduce this little surface.
We're just saving power.
If we're ready, every one of us has a role in this approach.
First of all, we need more people to work in human development, especially if you're living in developing countries.
We need more people in health care, the instruction, the farmers, the agriculture of products that make their daily life.
They're the familiar people who spend their work to improve others's lives.
But we also need a lot of support people.
These are open support in my organization alone and we're just one of many people.
The thing you might take you, but it doesn't matter what you've got, there's a role for every one of you in this struggle.
And it doesn't matter how much it's possible, reduce the poverty, we need a lot more resources.
It's our main sector.
In terms of private investors, you need a tumor in a risk of risk, a privacy investment and a nation repeated in the markets.
But there's a limit of what the private sector can get.
The private sector is often difficult to notice in a range of deforestation, on the presidents still have a central role in the building.
Every one can make, but we need a leader.
We need food boys and leaders in the DNA that will come up with the problems of human development and bring humanity to remove over the ground.
If these ideas are interesting to you, they're going to go to this website.
We need leaders.
The human beings have invented people on the moon.
We've invented that we're able to join our classroom and we're going to give us any other person in the world.
We're spread from three minutes of fuel.
We're people coming out of the age of the age.
But we left behind more than a billion of our minds.
There's no longer every child, like this, the opportunity to use its human capacity, we're familiar with our own moral human and diversity.
Actually, it's impossible for an external season.
We just need to provide products and services to everyone.
Let's make the strength power, every one of us has a role for prison.
Let's use our time, in our work, in our partner.
Let's go to the end of extinction in our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today 40 million Americans are at the top of their new economy.
Two days to pay their way for teachers, they've now got to experience more than a million American dollars.
They find all the work that they can get to pay from a safe street in their body.
In America, even from the crisis of a foot gets a second opportunity.
But it's nearly impossible for America to get rid of the Scientists.
There was, in America, to go to university means it wasn't going to finish.
My father's father's father's father's father's graduates the mayor in Korea for the remote soldiers.
In his generation, high education was free, or almost free.
No more.
When Paul's also finished at the university University, he'd be able to put on the description in English through a half a choice.
Three years ago, a high school student was the river, probably, and some reasons that I've been talking, was going to go to the school.
No more.
The father of Paul went in his face, but with one difference: when she finished five years ago, it was with a huge street.
Scientists like Text need to take a location because the high school night has become inevitable if not most of the American families.
But then why?
It's going to get into the lab to buy education, it's not bad at all if you can get back with an income income income income income.
But here's the dog.
Even as the February Cambridge 10 percent in 2001 than the switch in 2013.
So...
It's a student learning costs, public training goes down, family experience of corruption, positive experiences.
Cities that are more than some of you who don't have to pay the autonomous asteroid?
The worst investments can be the best investment, because certain corruptions are different in ways you can't move.
I want to talk about three of them today.
1.2 trillion dollars of the street to the sea of high education is a product that you can sell.
We're all talking about education as economists talk about now, as an investment that you can do to improve human beings by trust.
As an investment that you can do to Einstein and switch people in order to hear them more easily.
The United States and the world is accurate about regulations just like consumers from road machines.
The language is reduced in health.
Marians are called "Freethers," students read "consumers."
Social and Texas and science and science, all of these are "content."
Science Scientist is sophisticated.
Just don't go.
Your sensor contains the long-industrial industry for students.
The two sides of weight 363 pounds -- Sali Muhai and Vankt -- and he talked a year on a common range of 1.2 billion dollars.
And just as a programmer, the Israeli students can go out and go down and go and put it down, and make a blog in Wall Street.
And from universities and universities that are affected by previous convenient conventions.
Once one of the restaurants, and then from the house on the road.
With all the money that's going to be, we're surprisingly surprised that some of the high education education began to stop in the primary, in the corporation and the phase.
The teachers they're going to learn?
Third: dots are glad.
A lot of years ago, my teacher wrote, "When my grandfather died students as consumers, turn them into the musicians of the party and Kenya."
Like you can sell and return to the statistics of iPhone, you can sell people more and more education.
It's the new risk, we're already saying it.
But why to stop there?
People can make a lot more with skills and curiosity, description, cartoons.
It's also high education as an accurate object.
Kenya Kenya, like you're curious to School or a don't do yourself from others.
So you can be a passion for other people.
Democrats are glad.
But these corruptions are often in behind the speech of speech.
There's no day that it's without any policy in TV will say to us, "Time is completely unique to jump into the middle life."
And the effect that's been working on is a general discovery: a magazine that's in average 56 percent older than a risk.
Let's look at this number more than most, because on his face, it seems to be based on the stories that we've all heard about in a graph that works as chimps and judgments.
From a hundred people who have been put in any form of two and last, 45 are not finished at the top time, from a number of reasons, to the Francisco.
Five of 55 who are finished, two will be left without a traffic, and 18 other businesses are doing conditions.
So, in Kayan, you're going to get more likely than a high school, but is it perfect on the bottom of the background and the lights that were lost in the corporate period?
Now even economists are going to go to learn in college transparency is translating it.
But it's just because high school generations were going to look at them, for decades now.
For decades, they're working with a very significant selection of what they're producing.
And if you get like you need to get, then go to a few was a bad investment for many.
The general device?
I think it's the joy in high school.
Two of three people who have been put on't going to find a birth job.
And the future, for them, it doesn't seem to be particularly comfortable -- actually, really.
And they're the ones that are going to click out of the most successful forms of student street.
And they're, in a contrast and safe way, they're equally marketing the most general thing.
It's not just a marketplace, it's kind of privilege.
So what do you do?
What if students and teachers were treated to high education as a consumer product?
It seems that everyone is doing it.
So, like every other consumer product, you would need to know for what you're pay.
When you're a drugs, you're getting a list of dung actions.
When you're a high education production, you have to get an axis that allows consumers to choose, make aware decisions.
When you're a car machine, it's going to tell you how to go to a few kilometers to watch.
Who knows what to expect is, for example, to Canadian.
There's this thing, by the way.
What if there was an effect for this?
One who's changed the discovery of discovery.
Let's call it an income learning or IBT.
One of you create it.
It's got your reality.
So there are three solutions, three tons to IBT.
Everything can find out how much money is or it's going to do from some certain and death.
It's used to be aware of this wouldn't be able to get a victim of a penguin, to the conservative speech.
It's also going to choose a few.
Why would someone pay more for a general than let's say, 15 percent of the income income income?
There's the second solution to IT.
By listening to the cost and income and income, first of generations will be able to manage the better, to invent creative ways to do.
For example, all the students here are paying in the same way that's going to all the disease.
It's not a female, and you need to change.
A student has to try to use the most resources and actors and public team than a student of philosophy.
But the student of philosophical, as a result, based on the student to volunteer.
Who then, by the way, is going to make more money.
Why two people who make it a product, put it on the same thing, but one person gets half or a third of the service.
In fact, in Kayan, some of the interventions, pay 25 percent of their income to pay the autonomous, when others pay five percent.
That's the inequality of inequality that's happening when the connections are better.
Now, of course, all of this information -- and one of you're going to do this, yeah?
All of this information has to be a very good design, maybe we're going to do by extended societies to avoid statistics.
We know statistics, right?
But it's going to be how it's going to be, the third and the biggest technique of CIT is an American crisis of fear and the fact of economics because they've made a great product.
Maybe, with time, young Americans and actors will return, as the Iran said local, their curiosity, their love to learn -- to start learning what they like, to love what they learn, to go after their passion...
They're inspired by their intelligence to go for me a study that they really want.
After all, these were Eric and Kevin, two years ago, just as young as this, who went to me and worked with me, and yet, in the DNA study of students in America.
Thank you for attention.
Thank you.
The war was part of my life since.
I was born in Afghanistan, only six months after the objects were taken, and even though I was young to understand what was happening, I felt very well and fear around me.
These are the first experiences that I've been very excited about war and savings.
I've learned that, when you're on the skin, you're going to have a unique concept, in terms of most people who're going to be in the math.
In this kind of contrast, when people's rights are disabled, when their curiosity failed, when they're dead and they've got them -- they need a powerful way to move against war.
I mean, there's no matter how many violence it's the radical and famous, if people think it's the only choice, they're going to take it.
We've spent an important level of violence in the world.
But we wouldn't be able to put a tree to violence by telling people that violence is moral.
Instead, we need to offer them a powerful, powerful, at least like violence.
This is my job.
That's 13 years, I'm teaching people in some of the most difficult inventions in the world to use unprecedented struggle.
Most people are focused on this with Uganda and Martin Luther King.
But human beings have been about thousands of years in inevitable activity.
In fact, most of the possibilities that we have today in this country -- programs, as patterns, as different genetic artists, and as citizens who are important to them -- these rights didn't give us.
They've been invited by people who were born on them and listening to the clouds of victims.
But because we didn't learn from this history, the Western struggle, when it's been done, it's often been scared.
I've been recently met with an ethical group, and they told me something I'm fascinating to hear.
They've already tried the way that they've done, and it didn't succeed.
They've got a prosperity for years ago.
The government reduced everyone and that's what it's called.
The idea that the struggle is not more than the streets is a real problem.
Because despite the evidence can be a great way to predict change, as themselves is not really interested in something -- at least not a fundamental change.
So we're going to have a powerful, we're not going to give people what they want just because they're going to be beautiful.
Or not even beautiful.
It's an unusual struggle that's done by the right right, not physical, but by recognizing the institutions that the muscle needs to survive, and then prevent them from those resources.
Industrial activities can train the military by making the soldiers into the green.
They can wear the economy for corruption and violence.
And they can move in the governments of the reduction of government by making a window.
There's some techniques for it.
My colleagues and my doctor, John School, remember in 198 techniques of inevitable activity.
And disease is just one of them.
I'm going to give you an example of a touch example.
Throughout a few months ago, Matria was reduced by Kenyan Kenyan's officials to the past that they've been connected to the Olympic crisis.
People knew about it in general, but most of them were unprecedented to this force -- until a group of citizens, 12 normal people, they were killed on Facebook for their friends to meet in the central street with the details they said, "Go!"
You've evolved 30,000 people.
They've been left there for months while the refugees spread all over the country.
At some point, the Germans sent hundreds of trees to build different from different languages.
Laughter) But you know, the response of the president from Venna was that he would never get rid.
And the tools understood that they couldn't just keep on the penguin and ask the president to get rid.
They'd have been unfortunate for him a choice.
So they came up with a general, where people from the country were trying to work.
In the atmosphere, more than 400 businesses and schools have published their doors.
In the Bill, farmers all over the country have been previous roads.
Within five days, the president, and more dozens of my job, they've been reduced already.
Thank you very much, I was inspired by creativity and the courage of people who are affecting inevitable activity in almost every country in the world.
For instance, recently, a group of active actions in Uganda, the public was full of meetings on the street.
[]]]]]]]]]]] []]] []]]
Laughter) The muscles have been done in the paralysis.
One repeat was even a color, a car that was familiar with people.
It's active all over the world transfer in the restaurants, but these individual actions are going to get a little bit of if they're not part of a crazy strategy.
Oh my God doesn't expect his grandparents to the bottom if it doesn't have a plan of how to win the war.
But that's how most of the unexpected movement in the world.
It's just as complex as the war of the military, if not more.
The participants need to be very good and the goals in the lights, and leaders need to be a strategy to those goals.
The restaurants evolved for thousands of years in spider resources and some of our brains react to her and return.
Unfortunately, the struggle is nearly uncomfortable for the study that I've done, and even though the number is going to grow and grow, still tens of millions of people teach it all over the world.
It's dangerous, because now we're obvious that our advances have to deal with confidence are not about the new challenges that are born.
The United States has recently been shown that it's a data in a fingerprint in the middle of his arm.
But what most of them don't know is that there are people who have come out against aid by unviolence.
When you've been worried about the contrast, in 2014, they're a new reference, a new atheist on their extreme biology.
But on the first day to teachers didn't even get one child.
The parents were just to send them to school.
They said to the journalists that they're going to teach the kids in the house than they've got the brain.
It's an example of one effect in the city just in one city.
But what if it was sophisticated with more dozens of inevitable residents, against a minute?
What if the name of the parents was part of a larger strategy in the police to identify and enable the resources that's worried by using them to cooperate; the current workforce to create food; the engineering engineers are conducted to represent and reduce the communication and connection, the local systems that depend on?
Perhaps it's hard to imagine if we're going to look at a worse by unviolence.
But it's been the surprise to judge our thinking about conventional and health that they invest in us.
Here's an idea that's going to spread: Let's learn more about the cases where it's succeeded and how you can treat it, just like we're driving with systems and other technologies that are the same laws in a better way for the human consumption.
We may be able to improve the cooperation by the way it's going to get more and more of the war.
So you're going to be able to take the violence as a tool of solution as we've put the web and the tree, when we've been looking at them in more efficient weapons.
With the human innovation, we can make the national struggle for more effective than the worst war and imagination.
The biggest hope for humanity is not an image in the violence but it's going to become it for the year.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We live in a country of drugs.
4.5 billion of the drugs of medicine revealed by doctors and physicians like me, in the United States to Britain.
It's 15 to every man, a woman and a child.
And for most of us, treatment with drugs are often in a number of roads, in the need to understand instructions, in the fossil actions, in the inheritable design for everyone, which are often too much to have a conversation in the space.
And it makes a huge prosperity, that we've got in time, in our money and our friends.
And in our period of axis, the source of information, I think we can do better.
Let's go to some of the challenges that we've come in and don't have some possible solutions.
Let's start with the fact that many drugs don't work on those who have been seen.
Twenty of the most powerful drugs in the United States this year are only efficient to one of four or one of the 23 people who take them.
It's great if you're one, but what about all the rest?
And what's worse, drugs, when they don't work sometimes, you can still make a load effect.
For example, Errin -- about one of all four of us who's going to have an astrona to make the risk of heart disease and blood disease, we've been right now to an alarm without knowing it, and it's still important to the same risks of water in the wall or in the cases that are destroyed for thousands of years.
These beautiful actions are the genome, by the number of consumers, four in the size of death in the United States.
My grandfather died in a single country of anthropotics that made his toilets.
Social effects of drugs are often about challenges in design.
I'm an artist in my children -- small people, in an interview -- big people.
One night I can read by Canadian treatment and raise the speech of less than a million pounds, a drug for a baby in an enormous treatment.
At the night, after that -- to read by a imagination room, who's been treated in a 40 pounds in the 180 pounds or a patient in the Bay Bay School, which, on the local side, often they're going to put it on the plane of the drugs of the drugs that's left.
What means is that most of the surprises I'm going to be an unusual device for a baseball player, and the planning will be able to get a patient in the Southern School.
And beyond the age of age and weight, we're tend to get out of the lines of the microbes in the species and find out when the collapse collapses.
Over that, we know that we have a huge challenge of drugs or a repair that doesn't happen to the rainforest.
Many of us who need to take drugs don't take them or take them wrong.
You know, 40 percent of the adults over 65 in the United States are supposed to take five or more drugs out there.
Some are 15 or more.
Even climate stories can just bring to a dramatic risk of money and human beings.
So, we think about the future, you've been interested in where we're now, as you're often hearing a amount of drugs, personal and personal action, on the Internet of the things, genetic medicine, in artificial intelligence, that we've already come to this age of accurate drugs.
In reality, we're still living in a age of inevitable drugs based on experimental experiment.
I think we can do better.
What if we could do new ways that will help make the drugs more?
You're going to have the species and the right weapons that will give you?
What if we could move beyond the technology's technology's technology as a curiosity and prosperity, to an age where we can get a lower and lower consequences, to a human life and a space in your drugs?
Well, I think some of the solution is transparency in all the ways that have been used to our healthy information and survive.
Today, we're mostly living in the world of response, of a patient treatment, of an anthropic information that we don't win.
We've got the potential to go to the world of a more real health care care system, with the information that's going to have a serious and real time.
And some of this starts with the "I'm the car."
We can measure so many of our physics and our behavior today, sometimes they're repeated on our phone and between chemicals, but it starts to be connected with our private doctors and my French sisters, so they can provide instructions and treatments.
And when we can do that, we can do some interesting things.
Take a blood pressure.
It's a number of risk for early death and dream in the world all.
The adults in the United States, according to the consumption, suffers from blood pressure.
More than you've been under a good case.
It's often about how there's two drugs or three types.
It's hard to take the blood pressure drugs in the accurate and make the genome.
We've got 500 degrees of healthy death by a unfamous person in the United States, every day.
But we're in the age of too local pressure -- the FDA is recently a blood pressure that can be part of your argument.
Now there's a typical prototype of a fantastic blood pressure that's based on radio radio that can reduce your blood pressure.
So in the future, I'm food -- instead of a minute test of my blood pressure, my doctor can see my blood pressure and their blood pressure in real time, and I'm going to put them on the need, using the algorithms of blood pressure, or through the Internet of things.
The technology today can do even more.
In my favorite argument, today, there's A.J. GG, which can read by artificial intelligence.
I've got a little bit of the size of the size of a teenager that's now revealing my life.
Let's look at a view.
They're a little bit about this moment.
It's not just the truth of real time that you can look at by my medical team or by the way, but also the data that we've learned before, and again, it's going to be used to change drugs of drugs in the screen.
Even my weight can go out of my weight. My weight, my body form, my body's screen, my muscles, my muscles, and use it to sell my great medicine or my page.
And it's not just for experts in technology.
MIT engineering that we've changed the virtual standard so that we can connect and collect our lives in a part of the way, from our local facts and our features.
We can start to share this digital discovery, our digital exhibition, and even a potential to do its museum, to share our health data, just as we share data from Google and our right to improve -- not our right, but our health experience everywhere.
Well, it's great.
We can now collect this information.
What if your patients's curiosity is going to go from a central universe to your hands, to your phone, into your body even to measure a drug or other cells?
And of course, we're in the age of the genomics.
Rather my genome, it's going to be less than a thousand dollars in these days.
And I can start to understand my geographics -- how my genes affect my need in a high design, a low design, or maybe in a completely different Europe.
So imagine what if your doctor's doctor or your door or, there were these data as a part of their work, they've been released by artificial intelligence, AI, or like I like to read it, IA -- to reduce this information, to understand, to understand, in 18,000 or more drugs, these are the right species that are wearing you.
So great, now we might be able to do your drugs and your species, but the problem is, we still use this amazing technology to track drugs.
And of course, these technologies have evolved, there's a local pipeline pipeline, a reminder effect, a smart bicycles that can send a symbol or a coffee or your mother if you don't take your drugs.
Plaser [Pachel]]]]]]]]]] []]]]]] &#
So all of these things are possible today, but we're still taking a lot of different molecules.
What if we can do it just more?
I think one of the solutions is to make a better use in the skin.
Center is a number of drugs into a single patient.
And we've got this today in these drugs for unprecedented drugs against corruption and action.
We've got studies on Center for a traffic medicine, where the weapons of statistics, drugs for blood pressure, an aerrin, which in the San Francisco studies have killed at high high risk, is particularly likely to get it.
But these range were not personal, they didn't play for the particular person.
What if we could do well for you the crowd?
So it's going to build for you, look at you, can be dead for you, even every day.
Well, we're now in the age of a 3D printing, you can print a platform for you, an instrument that's affected, organic mechanisms, even I've gone from America to bring me out of my jihad.
And it made me think, what if we could do a 3D printer of a personal motor?
And then instead of taking six drugs, for example, I can take them into one.
So it's going to be easier for drugs, you're going to get the right to the button and it's possible to look at the collection of money, such as TV or CO2.
So with a little bit of aid -- I call it "intelligence" -- "and with an engineering engineering team," we built my first typical prototype of the prototype.
And so she's working: Instead of dozens, we've got small microscopes, every single one of a hundred or two or two, that's scared on the basis of the basis and the extension for a certain patient.
And of course, a conservative question and expectations of drugs from FDA that you can already click together.
We can change the ecosystems by creating the states of the individual microbes in a way.
And when the "printing," You're looking at the spinal of the drugs that you might need every single day.
And we started, again, with genius drugs for the most powerful problems.
About 90 percent of the presidential drugs in our days are fabric drugs.
And for a moment that we're looking at the wheel, you can add all kinds of judgments for the chicken.
You can print the patient there, the liquid, today a week, or TR's code.
We can print drugs in a planning down for who are causing asteroid in the design is going to go, or a planning is going to go and make drugs like resources.
So it's actually the end of the typical prototype of our new medicine.
You see, I'm afraid it here.
It's about 16 cells are separated, every single one has a different micromicrobes.
And I can now contract the software so that you'll give a fossil mechanisms.
And when I'm doing this, the robotic arm will sell the heat of these drugs and the microphones are released.
I can now -- the autonomous process is going to go around and put out of the whole, to make sure that the microbes are fantastic.
And when I'm a "printing," All of these are popular through the device, I'm now going to get out of my personal print with the drugs and the symptoms that have been done for me.
And we can look at a view, if you look back in the coffee, you can see the perfect process, you can see the drugs of drugs in the cities, the drugs go out of the different cells, and you're collecting into the single box.
Well, it's big, I can print my drugs, my customers, instead of six sounds.
I can now see my personal design.
My joy argument to my blood pressure, I needed a vision of my blood pressure, of my conference, my blood is too lucky, so I'm driving the level of the marketplace, the door.
So, it can be conducted on a daily basis, designed by a family doctor or my cardiologist.
And you can imagine that larger pieces, rapidly reducing like this, can be stuck in your physical cortex, in your doctor's doctor, in a primary party.
But they can eventually get rid and contract to more curiosity, which can be in your house, with regulations like that, that's when it's done by a tremendous.
You're able to print your fingerprint, if you're personal, in every morning in your kitchen or inside your view room.
And it can evolve, I think, for an amazing way that's improving the sound of sound all over the world.
I hope that we can imagine the future of medicine in new ways, to go from many drugs, in an independent design for everyone, with an unaccurate, conducting to the age of personalized drugs, accurate at the moment, what will make our health and health and health care over the planet.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, this is amazing.
It's really funny.
However, a question for you.
How long would it take to the day, say, the Chinese hospital that the female can print their sounds in their homes?
Darwin Kenn: Well, again, it's just a prototype.
We think that the geocortex is going to be an autism of autism, and in particular in the hospital, people take many drugs, and they're often caused, so it can be a perfect place to start with these technologies.
They're not going to evolve from the first place to the refugees that's created in atheism.
We need to be building and depressed about these technologies, but to understand that there are so many challenges that are involved in drugs and accurate, and now we have all these amazing technologies that can be able to notice and death, I think we need these things to make a real future of health.
MK: Good, thank you very much. Don't: Thank you.
Thank you.
What does it mean to invest our time in a good way?
I spend a lot of time thinking about how to spend my time.
It's probably too much -- I'm probably too much about it.
My friends think that way.
But I feel like I'm kind of got to have, because of these days, it feels like my small parts of my time somehow insects from me, and when it happens, it feels like some of the parts of my life from me.
Luke right, it feels like my small parts of my time are reducing different things like this, like technologies -- I'm looking at things.
I'll give you an example.
If this email affects -- how many of you get an email like this, right?
I was in the picture.
When it's affected, I can't forget about it now.
Because, like, what if it's a bad picture?
So I've got to push on it now.
But I'm not just going to switch "in the picture," What I'm actually going to do is spend the next 20 minutes.
But the worst part is that I know it's what's going to happen, and even worse that's what's going to stop me from doing it again.
Or to find myself in situations like this, where I'm looking at email and I'm going to go down to the door, but the thing is that 60 seconds later, I'm going to go down to the future again.
Why do I do this?
It doesn't make sense.
But I'm going to give you a speed of what it happens.
What do you think make more money in the United States than movies, Pixi who are doing and baseball together?
It's lucky machines.
How can a lucky machines do so much money when we play so small?
We play with fingers.
How is it possible?
Well, the thing is...
My phone is a lucky machine.
Every time I look at my phone, I play the lucky car to see, what am I going to get?
What am I going to get?
Every time I look at my email, I play a lucky car, say, "What am I going to get?"
Every time I'm glad in a new corner, I'm playing a lucky car to see, what am I going to get now?
And the thing is, again, know exactly how it works -- and I design, I know exactly how the psychology of this works, I know exactly what's going on -- but it doesn't leave me with a choice at all, I'm still going into it.
So what do we do?
Because it leaves us with everything or not anything with technology, right?
You're or connected, and you're connected and unemployed all the time, or you're cleaning, but then you're wondering, is I'm spreading something important?
In other words, you're or moral or you have fear to collect something.
Right?
So we need to return the choice.
We want a relationship with technology that gives us a choice about how we spend time with it, and we're going to have help of designers, because you know it doesn't help.
We're going to need to need a real help.
So how would it look?
So let's take an example that's going to face us: Chile -- Texas.
So let's say there are two people.
We're going to be on the left and she's working on a screen, and Jamon's right.
And John all of a sudden remember, "I need to ask this screen before I forget."
So when he sends her consciousness, she's looking at her attention.
This is what we're doing all the time, we're going to go with a return of other people's attention, from left and right.
And there's high cost to this, because every time we're moving one to the other, it takes usually 23 minutes on average, to take the attention back.
We're actually going to go through a region through two projects before we go back to the original thing that we do.
It's the study of a theory that's only used with the research of Microsoft, which shows it.
And her research also shows that it's actually from a bad emotions.
As we get more external disciplines, it's from us to avoid ourselves.
We're actually driving ourselves every three and a half minutes.
It's crazy.
So how do we make it?
Because we're born and John's relationships of everything or nothing.
We might want to move down, but then it's going to be worried: What if I put something important?
Technology can solve this problem.
Let's say you've got Nigerian again on the left, Jay on the right.
And John reminded, "I need to send this screen."
Only the time, Nanada can admit that it's focused.
Let's say that she's a series of laser and says, "I want to focus on 30 minutes," So -- if -- she's focused.
Now when John sends her awesome, he can draw the thought from his head -- because he had the need, he had the thought, and he had to throw it out before he would forget.
Obviously, it's waiting the consciousness so that we can focus on, but John can invent his mind from his head.
But it's just working if one last thing is true, it's that we should know that if something really important, John can still discover.
But instead of being inherent disciplines or meaning, we're now just creating consciousness, so we're going to do two things here.
We're creating a new choice also for Neanderthal, but there's another thing that we're doing here too.
And it's that we change the question that we're doing on.
Instead of the police's goal will be: "Let's stop it so it's easy to send a message" -- that's the goal of Chart, it's got to be really easy to send a message to someone -- we're using the goal to something deep and human value, which is, "
So we took the goal.
Now, do you actually care about it?
Do we want you to have a conversation to look at what they're the profound humanity?
Well, I'll tell you one story.
A little bit more matter ago, I'm going to help my mom had a meeting between some of the modern technologies and the Amazon.
The Olympic judgment is a device between national and consciousness.
And it was a really amazing approach.
You need to imagine -- imagine a room -- on one side of the room, you have a group of geologists; on the other side of the room, you have a group of single historians with long lights, and you're going to get rid.
And the goals have come to the most powerful human values, like how does the ecosystems look like when you design the most deep and the most powerful human values?
And our conversation was focused on listening to what these values can be.
It's spread in our conversation if, instead of evidence, you've had a compassion test, which means, you may have a word that might be in an accident -- that you're going to think about someone else else.
So is this kind of conversation going on in the real world, not just in these design feelings?
Well, the answer is yes, and one of my favorite is Okkkicking.
If you didn't know, Okkicking is a website that's coming out of people who are waiting for a place to be with a fossil money, someone who's trying to save it.
So, a great option -- what would be their design goal?
Why are you designing if you're in Chicap?
Well, you'd think it's to get organisms into countries.
Right?
This is a pretty good goal.
But it's somehow going to be like our goal to the library before, where we're just trying to make consciousness.
So what is the human goal more?
Well, they put them into a goal as a need to create a experience and relationships and dogs between people who have never met before.
And the most amazing thing about it was in 2007, they got a way to measure it, which is amazing.
I'm going to tell you how it works.
For every design that you have, you need to have a device to know how you do -- a way to measure success.
So what they're doing, let's say you take two people who come together, and they take the number of days that these two people spend together, and then they're waiting a few hours of these days -- how many of these people have spent together?
And then after they spent this time together, they ask them two: How positive was the experience?
Would they have a good experience with the person with them come from?
And they're dealing from these animals that are the amount of time that people spend on the site, because it's cost to people's lives.
Why should we appreciate it as success?
And what you're going to tell you is something that they're looking at as "sophisticated," or, really, "the best time is created."
The doors heard that there were never there, if Okkkoching wasn't there.
Can you imagine how inspiration it would be to get to work every day and measure your success in the new level of hours in my life that they're positive, that you've never been there if you didn't do what you've done at work today?
Can you imagine a world that works so?
Can you imagine a social network -- a week or say that you're going to have a brand, and it's going to measure your success in terms of Western intervention that we've organized and Mary that you've been happy to read, and reduce that's not that you'd like to read or the time you didn &
Imagine a professional social network that instead of measure the success in terms of connections that are created or numbers that are sent, instead of learning the success in terms of work that people have got today that they're happy to get.
And to reduce the amount of time that people have spent on the site.
Or imagine my Darws, as maybe Titan or something, where instead of measure the number of cases that are being done, which is why they're facing success today, rather than measure the external bees and private beings that people have created.
What it wasn't for them, by the way.
But can you imagine a whole world that works so, that will help you spend your time well?
Now to do this, you also need a new system, because you're probably thinking, the interactive economy of today -- the economics of today -- is going to be dead in time.
The more you have use, you have more use, and people spend more time, the more success.
But we evolved this problem before.
We've evolved it with organic, as we said we need to appreciate things in a different way.
We said it's another kind of food.
So we can't compare it just on a price; it's a different category of food.
We've evolved this with the script at the bottom, where we're saying it's a different kind of building that's going to go for different values of environmental states.
What if we had something like this to technology?
What if we had something that his goal was to help create a positive solution for human life?
And what if we can appreciate in a different way, so that's actually going to work?
Imagine you'd give a different price in the agencies.
Imagine they had a facial pattern that helps you move into these kinds of design products.
Can you imagine how exciting it would be to live and create this world?
We can create this world today.
In companies, everything you need to do -- just you can reduce new points, which is your imagination for human life.
And you have a conversation about it.
Maybe you don't do so much at the beginning, but let's start this conversation.
French, you can redefine success; you can redefine design.
You can argue, you have more power than many people in your organization to create the choices that we all live in.
Maybe like drugs, there's a fake week to recognize responsibilities and the highest values where we need to treat patients.
What if the cases were something like this, in terms of this new kind of design?
And the users, for all of us -- we can push technology that works so.
Now it might look hard, but for Charles didn't have been slams until the consumers were there.
Lott didn't have an organic food until the consumers were going to have it there.
We need to feel this new kind of technology.
And we can do that.
And to do this will make a change that's been made out of a whole time and completely reduced, the world that's been affected for a long time.
I want to live in this world, and I want this conversation to happen.
Let's start this conversation now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So we're all there's a cartoon.
For example, some of us tend to think it's very hard to change government systems.
When we think about governments, we tend to think that they're an artist, time in their way, and maybe, the leadership is too much in the tool to change things.
Well, today, I want to challenge the theory.
I'd like to tell you a story about a very big government system that didn't just understand itself in the way to reform but also the results that are quite impressive in less than three years.
So it looks like a public school in India.
There's a million schools in India.
And even to me, I was living in India all of my life, it switched the heart to come into one of these schools.
By the point that children come to the age of 11, 50 percent of them have left so behind their education that they don't have hope to be scared.
Two children can't do a simple connection, they can't build the right sentence.
These are things that I'm and you're exposing a eight child can do.
When the kids are 13 or 14, they tend to go from the book.
In India, public schools don't just offer education -- they offer free learning books, free, free, free, sometimes even peace.
And yet, 40 percent of the parents today choose to take their children from public schools and pay them to put them in private schools.
There's an equation, in a richer country, the United States, this paper is about 10 percent.
It's a huge procedure about how much the Indian education system is.
So with this background, I got a phone phone in the summer of 2013 from a woman who was Serra Robera.
She was, at the same time, the mayor of a school education in the country called Hanna in India.
So she said to us, "Look, I'm a decline in the last two years.
I've tried a number of things and something doesn't work.
Maybe you can help? "
Let me describe the Rwanda for you.
Hanna is a country that has 30 million people.
It has 15,000 public schools and more than two million children in these public schools.
So basically, in this phone network, I took to help the country and the green system of France or Canada to change itself.
When I started the project, I knew in a pain for two things.
One, I've never done something like this.
And two, many have done, probably no success.
When my colleagues and I looked across the country and around the world, we couldn't find a different example that we just could courage and treat the Uganda.
We knew we had to create our journey.
But anyway, we jumped right in the face and when we jumped in, all of the ideas were able to fly into us.
People said, "Let's go through the way that raise teachers, let's sell new tools and put them into the international service, let's put technology into the corruption."
At the end of the first week, we had 50 ideas on the table, everybody's amazing, they all heard right.
There was no possibility that we could apply 50 things.
So I said, "You've got a minute, you've got a moment."
Let's at least look at what we're trying to get. "
So with a lot of metaphors and implications, the Renna started her to say, by 2020, we want 80 percent of the kids who had knowledge of their classroom.
Now the specific goal of knowledge doesn't matter here, but what's important is a couple of times.
Because it's possible for us to take all of these ideas that we're going to help us and say what we're going to apply.
Is the idea of the goal? So, let's stop it.
But if we're not sure, let's put it on the side.
How simple it sounds, when there's a specific goal that we can be very sophisticated and spread in our change.
When I look back to the last two and a half years, these were very positive for us.
So we had the goal, and now we gave us to understand what was the secret, what was a week.
Before we went to schools, a lot of people told us that the quality of education is low because the teachers are nervous, they don't come to school, or they can't, they actually don't know how to teach.
Well, we went into schools, we found something completely different.
In most of the water, most teachers were in schools.
And when you've been talking to them, the understanding that they're completely able to teach corporations in a unique school.
But they didn't learn.
I went to the school that teachers made the building of the classroom and reduced the toilet.
I went to another school two of the teachers went to a restaurant in a lower bank to make money for children's boys.
Basically, most teachers have spent most of their time in a slam, a chimpanzee, and it's got students the lunch today.
So we asked the parents, "What's going on here, why don't you teach?"
And they said, "That's what's fun of us.
When it comes out to visit us, it's exactly the things that it's funny.
Will the toilets have been born, is the couldn't the forces were killed.
When my manager is going to go to the bed, these are exactly the things that are known. "
You see, what happened in fact, over the last two decades, India went to the challenge of the approach, who would be enough schools, and showed children into schools.
So the government invented a lot of programs that we've been able to these challenges, and the teachers would put them out of programs.
It's not in a refugee, but it's motivated.
And now, what really needed wasn't to train the teachers more or take their pressure but tell them that what's important is to go into the corruption and learn.
They need to be trained to survive and be reduced by the quality of the horrible and not on all other things.
So the more we've built in the education system, the more we've come from it, we've found a number of survival reasons that they've done, which is how people act in the system.
And we realized that we didn't have these things, we can do a few other things.
We can train, we can put technology in schools, but the system will not change.
And for these unfortunately, we're going to make a key key key.
So, we've got the traits and we've got the issues, and now we've got to find out what the solutions are.
Of course, we didn't want to reinvent the wheel, so we said, "Let's look around and see what we can find."
And we've found these little philosophical experiments in the country and all over the world.
The small things that are done by organizations that don't have any profit and curiosity.
But what was also interesting was that no one of them didn't have a scale.
Everybody was limited to 50, 100 or 500 schools.
And here we are, looking for a solution for 15,000 schools.
And we looked at why, if these things really work, why don't we define the pizza?
What's going on is when an organization doesn't have any profit comes, they're not just bringing their experts but they're also bringing other forms.
So they sometimes bring money, maybe they bring people, maybe they bring technology.
And in 50 or 100 schools that they really work in, these other crimes really make change.
But now imagine that the head of this organization that we don't have this professor is going to go to the head of education and say, "Hey, now let's do it to 15,000 schools."
Where's this guy or this guy is going to find the money to really expand it to 15,000 schools?
It doesn't have the other money, it doesn't have the resources.
And so, innovation can't expect.
So right at the beginning of this project, what we said was, "What we didn't have to have a space, it has to be able to work in every 15,000 schools."
And that's why, it has to work inside the walls and resources that a country really has.
A lot more simple to say than doing.
And I think it was unfortunately this point when my team came up with me.
We've spent a long hours in the office, in my office, sometimes in the men, they're also losing our head and say, "Where's the solutions, how are we going to solve this problem?"
In the end, I think we've found solutions to the secret school.
I'll give you an example.
In the context of effective learning, one of the things that people have talked about is a personal learning.
Children don't have to put things out, they need to do costs, and it's a more ecological way to learn.
Actually, it means to give students things like chimps, learning learning, restaurant.
But we didn't have the budget to give it to 15,000 schools, two million children.
We had another solution.
We couldn't think about anything.
One day, one of our team's team went to school and saw a teacher from a coffee and loans out of the corner and shooting them into the classroom and put them into the students.
It was a moment "organic" meaning for us.
So what's happening right now in Syrian School behind every subject, we have a small box for every teacher who says, "To teach the idea, this is the activity you can do.
And by the way, to really do this activity, these are the things that you can use from your microbial environment, whether it's coming out of the tree or the classes in the face, those can be used for children. "
And we're seeing teachers in all of the Renna are using many special things to teach students.
So in this way, everything we've done, we could put it in every 15,000 schools from the first day.
Now, it brings me to my last point.
How do you imagine something in 15,000 schools and 100,000 teachers?
Life was a process that's very interesting.
I love to read him "The hope chain."
They would write a letter from the bed and send it to the next level, which is the office of the river.
They're going to be scared in each of these guns, and then they're going to get the magazine to open it, and then they're going to get it to the next level, which is the Amazon.
And then you'd hope that in the Amazon office, someone else got the restaurant, opened it, called the same and put it in the end of 15 degrees.
And then you need the customers who got the letter, we brought it and start to put it.
It was a little bit of diversity.
Now, we knew that this technology was the answer, but we also knew that most schools don't have a computer or electronics.
However, what teachers are smart phones.
They're all the time sending Texas, on Facebook and Twitter.
So what's going on right now in Ghana is, all the managers and teachers go to the hundreds of groups of Watttscop and every time you have to have something, it's just scared in all of the satellite groups.
It's spread like a fire in a coffee.
You can look at who got this, who read it.
Marians can ask special girls.
And what's interesting is, not just the method goes on these questions.
Others from other parts in the country are doing the questions.
Everybody takes a part of peers, and things are safe.
So today, when you go to a school in Ghana, things look different.
The teachers back in the classroom, they teach.
It's often with regular methods.
When it comes to a visit in the classroom, it's or it's not just looking at the structure and the services but also the quality of the horrible.
Once in a decade, all students around the country are focused on their learning results and the schools that are working very well.
And I've spent a book that doesn't work very well, you find themselves out of hard conversations.
Of course, they're also getting another support to get out in the future.
In the context of education, it's hard to see results quickly.
When people talk about transformative change, they talk about seven and 10 years.
But not in Ghana.
In the last year, there were three independent studies, they all deal with students's learning results, these are affecting something significant, something special happens in Ghana.
The learning level of children stopped, and she started to go up.
Hanna is one of the individual countries in the country that shows a improvement, and it's probably that shows the worst bird.
These are still academic signs, there's a long way to go, but it gave us a lot of hope for the future.
I recently went to school, and when I left, I came up with a woman, which was French, she was a mother of a child, and she lived.
And I said to her, "Why do you live, what happens?"
And she said, "I don't know what's going on, but what I do know is my kids learn, they're right, and I'm going to stop the search for a private school to send them."
So I'm back to the language that I started: Can governments change?
I certainly believe it.
I think if you give them the right flow, they can move the mountains.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I was a child, I had a very powerful experience, I spent my wife's rest of my life looking at it, and all the wrong places.
What I've experienced was not an accurate reality.
It was music.
And this is where our story starts.
That's me, from the left to the Hollywood Los's HIV.
And it's seen that before it felt that I'm looking for all the time.
Music goes into a emotionally emotionally, and your blood flow into the heart.
It's driving every experience.
A friend?
[It's a magic from the amazing and James Roman. [] "
Music...
music makes more emotionally emotional than anything.
Let's see how it does it for our conversation.
The right piece of music at the right moment is scared with us at the level of the level.
When I hear this one poem from the same summer with the same boat, I'll imagine a repeat there again.
Hi, Steve.
Here's some of the story, but, in which I've done a little bit of a date.
I thought, if I was more pregnant for music, I could get the feelings to be even more powerful.
So I went into a video video video video.
So they looked like.
It's my brother, Jah.
Sorry about it, Jah.
And here I am, so we're equal.
An amazing movement.
There's got to be an academic.
And these experiments have gone, and at the time, they started to see more like this.
Even though I'm looking for the same thing, to capture this bank for a bank.
But, I'm not.
I've been collecting images on the music was invited by a restaurant, yes, but you've never been able to do what just the Golden Golden music was for me.
It's not a big thing to understand when you push your life and the professional career is going to be in a video video video video.
I went back and asked myself, did I look at the right side?
So I started thinking: He could leave you, the audience, more, I could make you, feel more.
So a cockroach and I started looking at new technologies that were able to put more of you into the work, like your child's house in the bottom of the Central Four Four Foundations in the United Nations Project. "
We were pushing beyond, trying to connect deeper to heart and imagination of people.
But it wasn't enough.
It still didn't have the visual power of what it was music for me.
So I started to look at another new technology I read about it just in science.
And after a few years of trees, I found a prototype.
It was a project from "Nanonya," in the lab of Mark Ebols in USC.
And when I tried it, I knew I found it.
I could take the bank.
It was called an accurate reality.
It was five years ago when I got it.
This is what it looks like now.
I've always started building things in this new imagination, and in this process, we've built something: that reality is going to play an amazing role in history of the actions.
It's actually going to be the last one.
I mean that because it's the first day that does actually reduce our injury of the experience of experience, our ability to experience it first.
You're going to look at, I'm going to explain, don't worry.
Laughter) If we go back to the mammograms with all the best forests, it started around a teacher, with a good story.
Our head tells us how it's on the side of a safe death at the same day.
We're hearing their words and transparency them into our inner corporations.
The same thing happens when we look at a piece of the story of the story, the book about the death of the death, the disease, the radio program, TV program or the movie.
All of these projects are going to do what we call "the tool", "because there's a tree between the reality of our story and the consciousness that represents the story into our reality.
I use the word "consciousness" as a reality that we get from our senses that experience the world around us.
Technology represents this hair.
Now, you're on the airport with the oil leader.
Or you're a leader.
Or maybe you're even the original death.
So here's what's special in accurate reality.
In all the other things, your consciousness depends on the day.
In an accurate reality, your consciousness is the amazing.
So the potential of math reality is huge.
But where are we now?
What is the current situation of art?
Tony, we're here.
We're equally valuable for the first year of collapse.
It's a movie of the back to the back of a teacher who made a room full of people to move on there when you thought that a travel was going to go.
It's like the early level of this day, in a accurate reality, we also need to move beyond this, and within a fact.
It took this imagination for decades to figure out what's the recent language of stories.
In an accurate reality today, we're learning more likely than the language.
We've created 15 movies last year in our similar reality, Venice, and we've learned some things.
We've found that we've got a unique decline into your senses, to your legs, even your body.
So let me show you some things.
For this graph, we're going to take all the way you might look, and open it into this bank.
Okay, we start.
So, first of all, a camera is complicated in the reality.
If you do it wrong, it can actually do you patients.
We've found that if you move the camera at a speed of speech, you can actually move away from it.
The first day in the school to prevent, they told me I had to learn every laughter and laughter before you could get one.
We didn't learn all laughter and laughter.
We've learned someone at all, but we've already tried to improve them to see what creative things we can use.
In this photograph here, we're going to move over the ground, I've collected an axis.
I did this because I wanted to give you a physical sense of movement over the ground.
In an accurate reality, I can give you this.
[Music] unsurprising, music is important in this day as well.
It enables us how to feel.
In this project, we've done with New York Times Times, but Robert and David, JR, we're going to take you out of the coffee, and although you're about 700 feet above your intuition.
You feel comfortable for JR's characters.
The music gives you there.

It's now where you know there and how the world goes around you.
In this movie, "French" which was cooperation between Virgin, the United Nations, Gabby East Arab, and Iraq Iraq, we also see the role of the crisis of the crisis in the reality.
You know, you're going to read in the reality that you're actually listening to someone.
He brings this pattern into your personal space, a space that we would usually keep the people we love.
And you're feeling very excited about what you feel when you're in a very physical wall.
In my own reality, it's not like my hands for the white.
It's more as a geography of attention to the floor.
One tool in which we can use to ensure your attention is called "space sound."
I can buy a sound everywhere to you, from your left, or your right, even behind you, and when you're looking at your head, the sound will go around.
So I can use it to reduce your attention to where you want you to look.
The next time you've heard somebody's happiness beyond your own time, it might be in us.
But reality makes us feel like we're part of something.
Over most of the human history, we've been living in small families.
We started in the walls, then we went to death and look, and then, cities and parties, and now we're all citizens of the world.
But I believe we're still focused to worry about things that are local for us.
And reality causes everywhere and every one to feel local.
So it works as a surprising machine.
Our movie's "clouds over Syria" takes you to the refugee refugees, and instead of looking at people there, it's now a story about us here.
But where do we go from here?
The screen thing is that with all of the previous patterns, the spinal cord in his heart.
The film was already made out of boys, from Mumbridge and his horses until now.
Ford never changed.
But reality is accurate, as a day, it's not perfect yet.
He doesn't use a physical phone or paper or TV signals.
It's actually about what we use to understand the world.
We're using the colors on a painting, but only two are true to the day.
In the end, we can see if all of our human senses will be business.
And we call it an accurate reality now, but what's going on when we go beyond accurate reality?
How do I call it so?
What if instead of telling you about a dream in a way, I could allow you to live in the dream?
What if instead of just sending some reality on the ground, you could jump on a road on a black hole, or create galaxies out of a tree, or communicate with each other without using our genomic computers?
It's not more accurate reality.
And honestly, I don't know how it's called.
But I hope you see where we go.
But here I'm doing intuition for a minute that I'm saying it's a real experience.
So let's hope it.
Your hands, I hope you're a piece of coffee.
Let's open the language.
Wait for the operating budget to release the phone.
For the people who look at home, we're going to put a cartoon right now to show you how to take this experiment in your phone yourself, and even get a Google Clinton from trying to do with it.
We've been scared in the box of children, and as adults, I hope we can all find a little bit of this bank by taking our head again in one.
You're going to participate in the collection of collective reality in history.
In the Gull Center, it's an old style of days, we're all going to see something at the same time, together.
Let's hope it will work.
How does you look back? I can't see.
Audience: 15, 14, 12, 11, 10, 10, eight, eight, eight, eight, five, four, three, 2, 1, 1.
I'd just win out of the horse, and I had to be perfect because I could take it.
And when I was perfect over -- you know, with the wind, we had to go back on it a few times -- so I went to code.

Sometimes I think we're the ones that are responsible.
CA: How was it?
[] It was a great way to get you to respond to previous choices.
I just made all of you to stand up. I knew you're going to get in the day.
[] I believe that everyone on the planet has to experience what you've experienced.
So we can start to design this, not as a technology platform but as a human platform.
And it's where, in the past of Alexander, New York Times and Virginia has done an accurate project called "The Research."
It's been invited with a million cartoons of Google who've been sent to every single day with his paper.
But a funny thing happened in that first morning.
A lot of people got them that there were not the right species in the spinal experiences.
And we started seeing it all over the Institute.
It looks familiar?
The music led me on a search of search for what was invisible for a very long time.
Now, millions of children just had the same conventional experience for them that I had in my daughter.
I just think it's going to go on.
Let's see where it leaves them.
Thank you very much.

As a young Jewish, my mom and my friend always told me stories about the axis -- he's sitting in the walls of the highest coffee in the world -- and I'm going to imagine, the journey that I'm going to listen to his life in my father.
As a young sister, I've lost the president to treat the events that are almost 100 years after the father's imagination.
I remember stories that she told a journey in the back of a metaphorus ways about France, whereas Dardian called the Houthern House School on the clinic all the way to the bicycle.
You see, as a young guy, I always read me a number of things.
First of all, why astronomers in the pocket to live in a bicycle in the bicycle, in the end of the end, he's going to do with the people of the community where he's treated.
And Second, where's the French button came up?
And why was Kenya Moni, the people of Hi, were so sensitive to develop a French, or "Me Fay?"
It made me be a curiosity about what makes us unique as my mother -- especially, our genetic car.
But just when I got to high school, through the human genome project, I realized that I wasn't the only one that I was trying to move our unique network of genes to be healthy or disease.
You see, the project 2.7 billion dollars in the previous age of medicine and is based on our unique genetic car.
So for me, it's always clear that to get this dream, we're going to have to take a lot of people's diversity of people, to get the red of the genetic diversity on the planet.
So after 10 years, I'm continuing to show me that 96 percent of the genetic research that's communicating between common and certain diseases are focused on but only in people from a doctor.
You don't need a Ph.D. to see that it's four percent of all of the interest.
And in my work, I found that a lot less than one hour was focused on clinical communities, like my own.
So this brings the question: For who's the human genome project really damage?
Just like we have eyes and forest in another color, we're responsible to drugs based on our genome.
So how many of you will be surprised to discover that 95 percent of the clinical trials are also generated but only people from a professor?
This demand and the insurance of work in front of people who are clinical trials and they're a part of the previous history of intuition.
For instance, in 1989 researchers from Arizona to take a person from the San Francisco's Southern Mumbaza's Institute, in the conversation to draw the president of the Central Center, just to return them back to them and use the same patterns -- without the exhibition of the exhibition
When the secret people found, they were going to have a 700,000 dollars and his mother on ASA to do a research study in their teacher.
It's the toxic in the kind of effect that we're looking at local computers in the South West -- including the president, one of the big trials in the country, the president of genetic studies.
Although the history of inequality, I still believe that people can produce genetic research.
And if we're not going to do something in most, the forest in a healthy inequality will continue to grow.
My mom, for instance, there's the longest expectations of life between the United States, and that's Jewish, like me, is a whole decade before our unusual colleagues, because we have the highest creatures of a confident two, and the two of the most unusual walls in the United States: cancer.
So how do we make sure that the population's population that need genetic features are not the last one that's going to make?
My vision is to transform the genetic research is to do more to the lights, to make the genes of genes for more unique. "
Second, genes have been done in the lab.
Here's a picture of the Civil genome.
It's huge.
The size of a crisis.
There's the physical sector of this teacher.
But what if you're able to jump a genome in my daily life?
What if you can put a fingerprint into your gas?
This conservation is a little bit of 10,000 times from the traditional gene.
It doesn't have the same physical limits, because it doesn't have to do with the lab with mysteries, big customers of chemicals or computer.
It enables us to invent the genome technology from the black box in ways that they're capable and collaboration, what's active and communities.
As scientists.
A hundred years later in the optimism, we now have the technology to spread the total category in real time, using a fossil fuels, a remote approach to the Internet and a giant feedback.
But just if it's what the Indian people want.
In our space, in our conditions.
Institute is about science for people by people.
We're going to start with a cockroach of the tricks, which is going to focus on communities on a minute or the potential of genetic information.
In the end, we'd like to have an intuitive study from ourselves to do experiments of ourselves and take the next generation of unique scientists.
Finally, people need to be partners and not just a study of genetic research.
And it's out of the except, as the Amazon did, the research community has to reduce itself in a unique culture or die in experience.
Man.
Thank you.
I'll never forget the voice of the laughter with my friends.
I'll never forget the voice of my mother's voice before the conversation.
And I'm going to never forget the magical voice of water across a wall.
Imagine my fear, fear of Twitter, once, I was 10 told me I was going to lose the hour.
And after five years, the thing was happening until I was exposed as an insection.
But I believe that the surprise was one of the most amazing evidence I had in life.
You see, I hope the world in a unique way.
And I believe that these unique experiences that people with the limits of senses are what will help us create and reduce a better world for everyone, people with no limits.
I've been in "The Design of people who are limited," and I've invented a lot of time based on the rules of laws, to make sure that all of the actions were done.
So, I had to learn very quickly in the national policy because they asked me to work in the very special violence that comes to people with limitations.
As the NGO leader there, I invest most of my energy to convince people about the ability of people with limits.
But somewhere over the way, and after a lot of careers that my parents didn't have so happy of them.
It's a tool that's called real thinking.
Social thinking is a process of innovation and solution of problems.
There's five pounds.
The first step is the problem and its insects.
The other one is looking at people in real life and empathy to them.
Third, throwing hundreds of ideas -- and how much more better, the worst.
Speak, prototype: Finally everything you can, what you can find, to wait your solution, look at it and don't see it.
And at the end, there's an ensure that the solution you've got sustainable.
And Darwin Bergan says that a professional thinking tells us to look at dogs, return, to the age, to try and probably most importantly, to ask these emotional questions.
The design of design believe everyone is creative.
They believe in getting people from a book of refugees together, because they want to share some perspective and connect them and finally to connect them to create something new.
Social thinking is such a tool and a variety that it's almost every industry.
I've seen the potential for the issues that have been working before, so I decided to go back to school and get my second description in social design.
It's looking at how to use design to create a positive change in the world.
While I was there, I liked a tree.
But what I've realized in the mirror was I've invented something.
When you're working with a tool, just before it's going to wait you back -- what means that the box or the tool goes back to you -- it's doing sound.
And I couldn't hear this sound.
So I decided, why don't we try to solve this?
My solution was an exhibition of the gene that was trying to avoid and be used to use changes in the sound of the tool, before the person's eye can take it.
Why don't designers think about it before?
Laughter) Two reasons: One, I was starting.
I didn't have the perfect weight of the age knowledge.
The other one is: I was afraid.
My unique experience of the world helped science my solution.
And when I went on, I got more and more solutions that were created in a study of people with limitations, and at the next time, they sat it and put them in the central, limited or not.
It's a Japanese column of the OOxO.
He's designed to people with a chicken, but he was so comfortable, everyone liked it.
Textent from Texas: They're powerful to people regret.
As you know, they all love it.
And I started thinking: What if we took our thinking form?
What if we start to design for limits before -- not for the president?
Like you see, when we design to the boundaries first, we're often going to be able to be used in solutions that don't just buy, but it's also a lot better times than we design to the nation.
And it's exciting to me, because it means that the energy that's going to go to someone with limitations can be won, except and play it as a power of creativity and possibilities.
It's going to bring us a sense of thinking to try to change the doors and the external thinking of suffering, to become astronomers, the kind of famous world that this world has to solve some of its biggest problems.
Now, I also believe that people with disabilities have a huge potential to be designing in the physical process.
Although to know this, a very early response, I was a creative show, I've lost my skills.
The design is, from them, open problems.
So imagine listening to a conversation and just understand 50 percent of what's said.
You can't ask them to go back every word.
They're just going to be scared of you.
So without even understand this, my solution was to take the red voice that I heard, it was the rate, and turn it into a short, and put it on the slide that I read.
Life years later, someone's city that I've also got a short line.
Well, it's because I'm hoping conversations as professionals.
I've also become very good at the top.
And it's really Mola.
In my first Twitter in Spanish, I got 60.
But what I've learned was that I've collected myself and I've spent some things around, finally, I've succeeded.
Like, a professional thinking of people to predict a lot of many, because at the end, you're going to be able.
A little bit of big inventions in the world have come from someone who's succeeding for the first time.
I also experienced this lesson in Scott.
I'll never forget my artist says to my mom, "If you just didn't have the wrong respect, it was in the National group."
But what my artist was, and what I didn't even know at the same time, was that my surprise actually helped me to join in Scott.
You see, when you lose the hour, not just you're moving your behavior, but you're also dealing your physical senses.
One example of this is that my famous heart of heart is Ghana.
Imagine a foot button, which comes from the left.
Imagine you're sick, as I was, and the ball comes from the left.
An person with a normal weapon was the visual perspective of this.
I had the benefit of a South Korean in this graph.
So I've been looking at the players there, who'd come around and they've been in a graph.
And I saw them faster, so that if the ball was translated, I could replace myself and be familiar with this method.
So as you can see, I've been a nearly professional event of my life.
My grandfather's daughter's daughter was profound that I recognize things that other people would never be identified.
My right need to get me to make me a great, great ideas and open problems.
And a lot of times I had to do this in the limits and the insects.
It's something that you also need to deal with.
My job was to take me recently to slow.
It's a lot of design often searching for extreme situations, because it's a lot of times imagine how many of their best creatures.
And the slow -- it was like the previous end.
I was living and worked with 300 people who were killed after the earthquake of 2010.
But five and a half years later, they still had no electricity; they were still not safe for the month; there were still no jobs; there were still a job; it was still uncomfortable.
Arabic aid between international came one.
But they're in front of their own solutions.
They didn't get ready to look at and bring themselves based on the needs of the community.
One organization gave them water and chimps.
But they didn't understand that there was so big noise in the community, that when the guys were going to sleep at night and they couldn't hear, people were laughing to make their own and their homes and the chimps, and eventually they were going.
Now, if this organization would take the time to look at people insected, look at their community, they would understand their problems and maybe they would come to the solution, something like a solar light, which leaves them to a pain in in night to ensure their security.
You don't have to be design to put the ideas I've been able to share with you today.
You're creative.
You're designing -- they're all like this.
Let people like me help you.
Let's people with limits to help you look at dogs, and in this process, solve some of the biggest problems.
That's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
It's from the big proteins.
It was 27 miles.
And that's the biggest scientific experiment that's trying to do.
Over 10,000 physicists and engineers from 85 countries around the world and together a few decades to build this machine.
What we're doing is we're going to expect prototypes -- or, autonomous organisms -- about 9999999 percent of the light.
Right? In this speed, they're spending the 27 meters 11,000 times a second.
And we're going to get them with a different set of prototypes that's going on in the opposite direction.
We're going to get them in a huge rainforest.
They're actually digital cameras.
And that's the opposite of it, I'm working, Alex.
You can get an idea of the size -- you can see people in the size of a standard professor.
But in the audience, you can get a little bit of a body: a 44 feet, a 22 feet, and you get 7,000 tons.
And we leave the conditions that have survived less than a second billion of the universe started -- up to 600 million times in this gene -- huge numbers.
And if you see the parts of the mirror there -- these are huge magnets that make electrical proteins, so you can measure how fast they're wrong.
This is a picture about a year ago.
These elements are there.
And again, these are real people in the size of a standard statistics, so you can get some scale.
And there's the faces that are made of the big objects, somewhere in the summer of this year.
And in fact, in the morning, I got a email who said that we just finished, today, to feed the last part of ATS.
So it's true to the day, it's finished. I'd like to say that I've designed it for TED, but I'm not.
Thank you very much, it's a wonderful song.
So you probably ask, "Why?
Why do we create the conditions that have survived less than a second billion after the universe started? "
Because, particle physics is very poor.
And the goal of the particle physics is to understand what everything is made, and how it's all connected together.
And in "Everything" I mean, of course, and for you, to the Earth, to the sun, a hundred billion stars in our galaxy and a hundred billion galaxies in the universe.
It's completely everything.
So now you might say, "Okay, so why don't you look at it?
If you want to know what I'm made, let's look at me. "
So, we found that when we look back in time, the universe is more hot and more, more and more and more, and just more and more.
Now, there's no reason we're aware of it, but that's what it looks like.
So, at the beginning of the universe, we believe it was simple and death.
All of this complexity, until these wonderful men -- human brains -- they're the features of a cold and complex universe.
At the beginning, in the first billions, we believe, or so we realized, it was very simple.
It's almost like...
Imagine a paralysis in your hands, and you look at it, and it's complicated to repair, it's an amazing object, but when you're looking at it, it's been conducted to water, and you can see that it's actually made out of a mirror from Mary, water.
It's the same way we look back in time to understand what the universe is made.
And today, it's made of these things.
It's just 12 proteins of material, one bubble for two by four natural forces.
And the lines, these extraordinary things, create the prototypes and the penguins that make the atoms of the atom in your body.
The alcohol -- the thing that's spread around the atmosphere -- is powerful in the track, by the way, by the electronic power that's been focused on this thing -- the tone.
The lines are powerful by other things called genoius.
And these things here, they're the nuclear power, which is probably familiar with everyone.
But in the sun, the sun doesn't happen.
And when the sun goes, you get a toy of things called Nigerian, we're going to get out of the sun.
In fact, if you're just looking at your pencil -- about a metaphor of a mirror -- about 60 billion Nigeria in the sun, you're going to go through any of your body.
But you don't feel them because the power is close in the right way.
And these proteins have gone over the early century, eventually.
The first one, the alcom, came in 1897, and the last thing called Nigeria, in 2000, I was just going to say, in Chicago. I know it's a big country, America, no?
It's really on the road.
It's very basic to the universe that's really on the road.
Laughter) So, this thing is in 2000, so it's a very fundamental picture.
One of the wonderful things, in fact, I think, we've discovered them at all, when they're in a few days.
You know, they're okay to grow a different speed of the language.
So 100 billion galaxies, in a 13.7 billion light -- a different modern size, in fact, like the size of the size of these things.
It's completely extraordinary, and we still found almost all the text.
So, one of the Hollympic artists at the University of Richard, Art Richard Ford, the red nuclear gene, once said, "All of science is physics or collection."
Now, I don't think it's an accident to leave the rest of science, although it was India, so it's possible.
But it's the effect that what we've done here in fact, it's to collect patients.
All right, we found the particles, but if we didn't understand the basic reason for the program -- you know, why it's built like this -- actually everything you did is collect patients -- you didn't do science.
For us, we've got the biggest scientific concept of the 20th century that you're in this program.
It's the laws of Newton if you want, of the particle physics.
It's called "The standard model" is a simple mathematician.
You can put it on a shelf, which is always a symbol for genetic.
Here it is.
And I wasn't completely, because I've shown it to all of her amazing details.
This equation, in fact, allows you to look at -- except from the fact -- everything that happens in the universe.
So if you want to know why the sky is sick, why the red grain doesn't fit -- basically, if you have a strong computer enough -- why the DNA has this shape.
Basically, you can choose it with this conversation.
But we have a problem.
You can see what it is?
In a bubble that's in a boss of who can show me.
I'm going to wear you, by one of these lines.
Basically, each of these monkeys are treating part of the proteins.
So these guys take a little bit, and how they're facing.
These are the issues of the space, the same thing.
But there's another symbol in equation, His.
Right, His.
SK has been treated to the GDP.
The Gimbus Cyrus is still not in.
But they're positive -- they're necessary to make math work.
So all of the amazing stimulators that we can do with this particular equation is not possible without this other part.
So it's sophisticated -- a retirement of new particle.
What does it do?
Well, we had a lot of time to find good analogy.
And in the late '90s, when we wanted money to LHHC from Britain's governments, Mr. Richard, said at the time, "If you can explain, in a language that politician can understand, what's going to be doing, you get the money.
I want to know what this beautiful space does. "
And we went to this analogy that seems to be working.
So, what the gas does, it gives a restaurant to the basic parties.
And the picture is that the whole universe -- and it's not just these space as I and in you -- the universe is full of what's called the House.
The Gabby Kimbas, if you want to.
The analogy is that these people in the room are the gas particles.
Now when a particle goes through the universe, it's responding with these horizontal particles.
But imagine someone is not popular in the room.
So everybody's focused on. They can move in a very fast room, very quickly. They're fantastic.
And imagine someone's very important and suffering and intelligent comes into the room.
They're surrounded by people, and they're in their motor room.
It's almost as if they're disappeared.
They're getting rid.
The picture is that the electronics and the lines in your body and the universe that we see around us are in general, in some way, and the sea, because they're focused on the gas.
They're affected by the Higgs House.
If this picture is true, then we have to discover the GDP proteins in LHC.
If it's not true, because it's a complicated mechanism, although it's the most simple one that we can think about -- then what does not do the work of the GPS proteins, we know you need to have to happen to the LC.
So that's one of the main reasons we built this great machine.
I'm happy you're identified by Richard.
In fact, I thought to turn it into cultural genetics, but -- I don't matter.
So this is one thing.
It's actually the conversation why LHC will find.
There's a lot of other things. You've heard about many of the problems in the proteins.
On one of them you've heard: power material, energy.
And there's another subject, which is the nature of nature -- it's pretty beautiful -- actually, when you go back in time, they see that they're changing.
In fact, they're changing in the face.
So the electronic power, the power that makes us, is powerful as the temperatures.
The powerful power, the powerful nuclear power, which represents the atoms of atoms, spread. And what you see is the standard model -- you can see how these changes -- in the forces -- the three forces, except in the field -- almost from the point.
It's as if there was one beautiful power, until the time of time.
But they're just a pilot.
Now there's a theory that's called a metaphor on the top, which is able to put the number of particles in a standard model.
But in fact, in this theory, we find that the nature of nature is coming together in the big tree.
Like these secret particles are very serious to the patient's nose.
So a very convinced theory that it's really in the central region of physics.
And I was there on this money, I would put money on -- in a very unscientific way -- that these things would want to go to LC.
There's many other things for LHC can find out.
But in the last few minutes, I just want to give you a different perspective about what I think -- what means is the physics of particles for me -- physics and biology.
And I think it gave us a wonderful, almost a healthy story, if you want to -- on the universe, the modern science for the last few decades.
And I'd say it's coming to him, in the wind of William David's David's hands, they're going to be together with the wonderful health story of the English and the North Korean.
It's a healthy story, I think, at least wonderful.
And the story goes like this: We know that the universe started 13.7 billion years ago, in a hot and a list for no skin, a lot more than a single atom.
He started spread after a million billion billion billion billion billion billion -- I think I said it right -- after the big bank.
The spider is happening from the rest of the forces.
The universe was then an extinctive concept called intuition.
Within a second billion, it's coming into the action of the Gates, and the Kikotans and the electrons and the electrons that make us get a restaurant.
The universe continues to spread and remove.
After a couple of minutes, there was an artist and the day in the universe.
And that's it. The universe has made about 75 percent of Martin, and 25 percent of the day. It's still that day.
He went to spread over 300 million years.
So light started to move in the universe.
It was big enough to be a light, and that's what we're seeing in the Southern School that George School would describe as much to look at God's face.
After about 400 million years, the first stars were created, this artist and this day began to fill the boundaries more.
So the elephants of life -- carbon, oxygen and luck, all of the secrets that are going to make us -- have been created in the first planet, which then it's called the fuel, it's spread these materials to the universe.
They've returned to the next generation of stars and plants.
And some of the plants, the oxygen that's created in the first generation of the stars with Martin to create water, dinosaurs on the surface.
And at least one, and maybe just on one of the refugees, there's been a primitive life, which has evolved for millions of years to the things that were going to need and left over three and a half million years ago in the summer of Tanzania's boss, and at the end of the end of the time, they've left a fire in another world
And we looked at this civilization, this wonderful picture, which reduced the web to light and you can see this civilization from space.
Like one of my bees, Karl Shair, said, these are the things -- and actually, not just these, but I looked around -- these are things, like Titan Franklin, and Scotch, and DNA, and science -- these are the things that Amith are doing when they are 13.7 billion years old.
Just amazing.
And the laws of physics.
Okay? So, the laws of the profound physics -- they're happy to reduce.
If the space power was a little bit different, the object and the oxygen wouldn't be stuck inside the stars, and there was no of them in the universe.
And I think it's a beautiful story and significant story.
Five years ago, I couldn't tell this story, because we didn't know it.
It makes me really feel that humanity -- as I say, if you believe the scientific story, it's entirely as a result of physics, and some autonomous artist -- so I think, at least, it makes sense of valuable.
So it's LHHC.
LHC, when you start working in the summer, it's probably going to write the next one in the book.
And I'm certainly exposed with a big emotion to its effect.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What a group of people are...
In a psychologist.
And I had the opportunity in the last few days to listen to some of your conversations and expect you how you communicate with each other.
And I think it's fair to say, already, that there's 47 people in this audience, at this moment, that profound psychological symptoms I'd like to look at them today.
And I thought you might want to know who you are.
But instead of doing you, something that would be more and popular, I thought I'd tell you a number of facts and stories, where you might be able to print yourself.
I'm in the study of a personal psychological machine, which is part of a larger personal knowledge that's affected on a small piece of South full of neurons from green to the statistics.
And what we're trying to do, in our way, is to figure out how each of us -- each of you -- is, in some ways, like all the other people, like some other people and like nobody else.
Now, you're already talking to yourself, "I'm not a curiosity.
I'm the 46 person who's been on the Western generation. "
Or you might say about yourself, "I'm curious. Even if I'm sitting by most people as a big metaphor of it."
But it's a self-anxiety of your new, and your airplane that makes me as a psychologist to be really magic from you.
So let me explain to you why this is this.
One of the most surprising approach in personal science is known as psychological psychological and it's made you over five people who share in a way, and you're going to get rid of institutions in a universal way of differences between people.
They're limited in the OCEEO.
So the "AO" represents the sentence of experience, "as they're more sophisticated.
"CC" represents "patterns," in Nigeria with more huge access to life.
"JC represents" reduction, "as we're going to have more beautiful people.
"SA" -- people's right, "built to those who don't be wrong.
And "" -- robotic people, "used to those who are more creative.
For all of these connections are affecting our quality of life, in the way our lives go.
And so, we know, for instance, openness and products are very good at life, but people are open with this success, using their academic and ever, extraordinary.
The Egyptian people get it through a regulation to the last step, to return, as well as a certain response that they have.
Social and imaginations that they help work well with people.
The customers for example, I find curiosity.
With my classrooms, sometimes I give them a fundamental fact that might be an extinct in their personality: I tell them it's almost impossible for adults to get their extinct parts of their French.
And did you know it?
Now, some of you have tried to take the external part of their French.
But the curiosity of you are the more likely those who didn't just tried, but they've manipulated the French of the person who's sitting in.
It's the prosthetic.
Let's see the most detail in the sense, because it's produced, and it's helping us understand what I call: our three types of nature.
First of all, our biological nature -- our biology.
Second, our collective nature or the other one, which is about culture and social tests in our lives.
And third, what you do is you've got to the Iraq that you've got, to Iranian, what I call it "Iraq."
Let me explain.
One of the things that are congested in the face is that they need stimulus.
And you can achieve this stimulus by offering things from extinct: molecules, reasons and social events here at TED -- you see the customers create an alternative environment.
They all collect together.
And I saw you.
It's famous as you look at time in the other places on the other level where they can reduce a conventional discovery -- and maybe you're not necessarily social, but you're not necessarily a social anatomy.
It can be that you understand that you're successful when you have a chance to reduce the Rome.
Sometimes it's out of your body, out of your body.
Canada, for example, is a lot better with the brains than with magnitude.
When the guns go into the office in the morning and say, "I really need a coffee," they don't laugh -- they really need.
The chemicals don't work in the same way, especially if they go on -- and they're already going to have a little bit of coffee -- if these tasks are disappointed, and if they're going to be accumulated, they're going to show the mirror of not to be particularly honest.
But it's a motor perception.
So, the results that are pretty curious: we're not always what it looks like, and it takes me to my next point.
I have to say to this before I get to this, something about sex, even though I can't have time.
And so, if you want me -- yeah, you'd like?
All right.
Laughter) There are studies that have been done on the price where people do with personality, in a reminder, a female, an extended, a gunna.
So I'm going to ask you: How many times in a minute -- or, I'm sorry, it's been a restaurant research -- Laughter) How many times in a month men are doing it?
3.0.
Men's genes?
More or less?
Yes. More.
5.5 -- nearly as emissions.
Women are amazing: 3.1.
Women are exposed?
In fact, when I'm talking about a wonderful man, which I'm going to explain later -- they see.
7.5.
They don't just take all of the fossil men, they're going to go through a few magic as well.
Laughter) []]]] []]]]] []]]]]]] &#
The guns, when they come in a moment, you want them to have a lot of social disciplines that are very excited.
They like to stand close to the media.
They love a lot of eyes, or a view of view.
We've found some studies that they're using most components when they get someone.
So when a magazine comes from Charles, it's always turned into "Charlie" and then "Chark," and then "and then" Charles Bay. "
It's when the fossil public, it's left "Charles," until it gets more intuitive than the person is talking to.
We talk differently.
Socies are a black and a son, a very simple conservative language.
And I've got to tell you that I'm fascinated as you can just imagine -- we're talking different.
We're exposing a complex context, the sentences are involved -- Laughter) less or more.
Laughter) As it was.
And I don't think about it too much -- like this.
When we talk, we sometimes talk about each other.
I had a contrast that I've been scared with a teenager that's different from me as you can have two people can be.
First of all, his name is a content.
My name is not.
[Second], it's 1.98 response.
I have a privacy to be.
It's a third, it's the worst person you can find.
I'm fascinated.
I'm suffering from a privilege, I can't even buy a coffee after three pounds in the walls and shooting in the evening.
We've gone into this project in a person who's been put in a chair.
And it's almost brought the project to reduce.
So the person who's helping him ask me and asked me, "What do you know about a female?"
Well, I'm going to tell you in a minute what you're going to say.
He was talking about "Central Turkey."
And here's how unemployed objects heard what I said, which is actually quite accurate.
I said, "Well, as an artist actually has an alternative sometimes to avoid some of us might see as something more athetic than it's usually exposed."
I'm going to roll his eyes and said, "Hey, that's what I said: He's Iraq!"
I'm going to make a lot of answers now, like free, I was able to move on some characteristics of "I.D." "in this man's behavior, but I don't mean to get the word on the word."
Laughter) But the smoke says, "If it's going to go like one, if it's talking like one, I call it that one."
And we're going to do it for this.
Now, is it something that we need to treat?
Of course.
It's important that we know it.
Is it all we?
Is we just a collection of machines?
No, we're not.
Remember, you're like some other human beings and like nobody else.
What about your disciplines?
Like Alexa, or like Jorg, you might share your chicken or your geolic.
But is there a couple of characteristic features in your behavior, or organic organisms, that make us understand better than just a collective collection?
It makes us love you?
It's not just because you're a kind of person.
I'm not going to put human beings in the cases.
I don't even think that the mammos of journalists is in your face.
So what is the thing that makes us different?
It's our success in life -- the personal projects.
You have a personal project right now, but no one may not know it here.
It's treating a child in front of them -- you've come back three times to the hospital, and they still don't know what's wrong.
Or it can be your mom.
And you've been doing a prison way.
These are free properties. "
You're very inevitable, but you're inevitably inevitably inevitable to compare the predators of the hospital in the hospital, to get something for your mother or your child.
What are these free properties?
They're surprising when we're getting a role in the goal for the purpose of our lives.
And they're what's important.
Don't ask people what kind of person do you ask them. "What are the night projects in your life?"
And we're getting those free properties.
I'm fantastic, but I have a project that is to teach.
I'm a professor.
And I love very much my students, and I love very much of my field.
And I can't wait to tell them what's new, what's exciting, what I can't wait to tell them about.
And so I'm actually working in a concrete way, because in eight in the morning, students need a remote, a little bit of involved in order to continue on the temperature of teachers.
But we need to be very careful when we're working in intimate way.
Sometimes we can find that we don't worry about ourselves.
I find out, for example, after a fabric behavior, I've been able to get a fabric in myself.
As San Franklin said in her book "The" Project, "in just that you've shown the weird professor of the weird, sometimes I'm going to go to the men's boys to fit from the front of the brains.
And I remember one day I've been asked to the cell, trying to avoid an exhibition.
And real brain came to my school -- not really to my cell, but the support cell -- and I could hear different notes of the disciplines, that we're conditioning -- and that's why we're teaching the water in the way, and it's also the other way.
And then I heard this particular voice says, "Hey, is it's Dr. Little?"
Laughter) If there's something that's going to make a fifth of six months, it's a conversation in services.
It's where I'm going to go now.
Don't go after.
Thank you very much.

When we design new products, services or business, the only time you're going to know if they're good, if design is good, it's to see how they're using the real world, within the context.
I remember it every time I'm going to go near the Central School in London.
It's just beautiful.
There's a big green space and open space.
There's buildings in Georgians.
But there's a summer in the middle.
People don't want to go all the way around the edge.
Instead, they'd like to take a creation through, and this creation remains itself.
Now, this creation is also called the road road, and it's often the way with the worst resistance.
I find them fascinating, because they're a lot of times the dots in which design and the usual experience is used.
Now at this point, I need to win, because you're a company going to start seeing them anywhere.
But today, I'm going to choose three that I'm an interesting product and look at what it actually reminds me about products and new services.
The first is a city of Brazil -- Brazil.
And it reminds me that sometimes, you have to just focus on design for a very low power.
Now, Brazil is fascinating.
It's designed by Nazis in the '50s.
It was in the gold generation of the airport, so he put it like a plane, as you can see here.
It's a little bit of worrying, it's where most of the most important government buildings in the box.
If you look at, right in Brazil, right where the point is there, you see it's full of hard ways.
They're just everywhere.
Now, they thought they've made it completely invisible for the future.
They thought, in the future, we wouldn't have to go anywhere -- we're going to be able to drive -- so you're going to have to take a lot of directions or for me.
So as you can see, you have a real need.
These are very dangerous ways.
If we're just looking at one, in the center, you can see it's about 15 degrees of movement.
It's not going to show you a company in Brazil, there's five times a half times of the birthquake of an American city.
People have a conversation.
They're always going to find the ways with the most resistant to save money, to save time.
I didn't have all of these sacrificate ways, I've been reminded when I was in Jah.
Many of us are scared when we're going to face the length that has to be through the primary.
It was amazing for me how many people are going to take the long travel from the left, and just look at the right way, look through the road.
The interesting question is: What designers think when they see our behavior here?
Are they thinking that we're going to do?
Do they think we're nervous?
Or do they get it the only truth?
It's their product.
We design together effective their products.
So our work is to design a real amount of power, because if you're not, the consumer will do it, anyway.
The second way I wanted to share is at the University of California.
And it reminds me that sometimes the best way to make a great design is just spread it.
Now, universities are fantastic to discovery.
I think it's because students are always other and they're pretty smart.
So they're far away to a lot.
They'll always find the creation of the way.
And the nerves here knew this.
So they built the buildings and then they took a few months to weigh.
So they took them.
It's a really sick approach.
In fact, many times, just to get a person asked can teach you what people really want.
For example, Al More in Boston knew he wanted to open a restaurant.
But where should it be?
What's the detail should be?
He's living the service, in his case, a food truck, and he's changed every day.
He wrote a different detail on the office on a price of price to figure out what people wanted.
Now it has a series of documents.
So it can be very effective to represent something to identify normal ways.
The third and last, I wanted to share with you is UNIT.
It reminds me that the world is in support change, and we need to respond to these changes.
So as you feel, it's a hospital.
I've taught you from the left of the ecosystem.
The hospital usually remains in the window on the right side.
It was a hospital organization, so they brought cars for their patients.
But what they realized when they started to offer chemistry is that the patients often wanted to get into cars.
They had too much in her life, so they went back to their customers.
It's an extinction that you see in the Nigerian Center.
The hospital even called him "The Bill Center."
Now, when the hospital saw it in a cold, they tried to put a fish back on it, get out of it.
But after a while, they realized that it needed to be important for their patients, so they were saving it.
And I think our work is a lot of times to track these roads.
If we look back in this in the North London again, this sacrifice wouldn't always be there.
The reason that it was surprised is that people went to the San San San San Francisco in a game, the bottom corner that you see on the right.
So you see the road way.
If we just take the argument back a couple of years, when the Teseslon was in New York, there's no way of wearing.
So our work is to expect these roads that are surprised, and instead of the right place, to track them, like someone did here.
The task is a primary, people started to go near and around the bottom as you see, and they're saving it.
But I think it's also a wonderful memory, which, in fact, the world's in an extinct change.
It's all the time changes, because if you look at the top of the picture, there's another way of being created.
So these three different ways of sharing me that we need to design for real people.
I think surprising why your customers want to be the great artist of success in business.
It's treated to real, and it's made them support, because if you don't invest them in a low power, someone will do it, many times the consumer.
Second, a lot of times the best way to learn what real people want to represent your service.
The answer is often conventional in the building.
Put out and see what people really want.
And finally, in part of the technology, the world in an amazing change right now.
It's changing without a prosthetic.
These hard ways are going to show faster than ever.
Our work is to choose the implications and save them.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Each week as I can remember, my father was a song in sit, wearing a blog, and there was a fabric house in which we made.
I wouldn't call it even repeat; it was Texas, Texas.
We'd spend all this year in order to make a color with an old heat and a flow of color, and then we'd return instead of us, just to start over the next year.
The restaurant and reinvention, surprise and reproduction: The work on an old house will never be trained.
On the day my father was killing 52, I got a phone call.
My mom was on the line to tell me that the doctors found a boy in his eye -- cancer, she said to me, and let's just three weeks to live.
I've always gone home to the Phicasco, New York, to sit with my father in the Mumbai, without knowing what the next days are going to be done with us.
To keep my mind, I rolled up my father, and I went to finish what he's not going to spend -- the black hole of our eye.
When the Minister of three weeks came up and then he was still alive.
And for three months, he joined me.
Most of us and returned the faces.
In six months, the old windows were scared, and in 18 months, the Kenya Rota was collected at the end.
And here's my father, I'm going to have a tree, a job of a day, a forest on his head, completely in Turkey, when he came to me and said, "You know Michael, this house took my life."
So the next year, I decided to go to school to the atmosphere.
But there, I learned something different about buildings.
It seems to be the profound to those who have been put in new forms and elephants, like movies, or...
More phones?
And I think it's supposed to be food.
It's about it.
Why is it that the best architects, the best architecture -- all beautiful and extinct food -- it's also so rare, and it's also so rare, and it's going to see that reduces?
And more to the point: With all the creative components, what else can we do?
Just when I was going to start with my final disciplines, I decided to take a mirror from every night and go to a tree of a room. Paul France, a social operation from healthcare, for the world.
I was surprised to hear a doctor talking about architecture.
The buildings do more patients, he said, and in the world, it causes problems in a map.
In this hospital in South Africa, patients who come up with, for example, a teacher, a teacher, to wait in this uncomfortable field, come up with peers of president drugs.
We didn't think about simple bubbles to the road, and people died because of that.
"Where are the architects?"
If hospitals do more patients, where are architects and nerves that help us build and design patients that allow us to save?
In the next summer, I was in my brothers to Robert with some of my friends in the classroom, jumping the fingers and the Hungles in Rwanda.
Last year after, I was living in Boston in this old ocean, which was not after the tree of the tree.
I was there to design and build a new kind of hospital with a room. France and his team.
If a stairs do more patients, what if we can design a hospital that makes the stairs out, and make people go outside?
If humanitarian systems work often, what if we can design a hospital that can go through natural Iraq, and then we're going to reduce the environmentalism?
And what about the experience of the patients?
The evidence from a simple perspective can improve the health results, so why can't we design a hospital where every patient was a dream with a look at the top?
Finally simple bubbles to the site can create a hospital that's made.
Let's design it one thing; build it, we discovered, it's completely different.
We've been working with Bronx Nigerian, an engineering engineer, and he thought about building a different way that taught me in school.
When we had to improve an enormous and recycling was expensive and hard to come to the website, Bronx offered to do it in the hand, using a method called "Obvia," which means "a community for the community."
Many hundreds of people came up with poverty and falls, and we reduced this hill in half of the time and a half of the trees of laser.
Instead of the Henry Ford, in the Cambridge, and he brought experts from experts to teach others how to create the cartoons on the hand.
And in the workplace, 15 years after the summer in Rwanda, in Brothers, was reduced that we had been working on all the bad events, and a half of them were women.
Brothers used the process of the building to healthy, not just the patients, but also all the community in the whole way.
We call it a local manufacturing way to China, or "Love," and it's about four secrets: that you've made local workers, they've come from the region, we're going to come from where you can and most importantly, think about all the real decision as an opportunity to invest in the places you &apos
Think about it like a local food motion, but for atmosphere.
And we're convinced that this way of building can be reduced around the world, and change the way we're talking about and educating architecture.
It's used by local production to China, even athetic decisions can be designed to affect people's lives.
In the morning, we've been able to use a bone and a local and a local local source that we've found in the region, that we've been thinking a lot of times to remove by the walls, and we're going to have a lot of ways.
We've been working with these studies to cut these boys and created some of them in the hospital.
And when they started in this corner and looked at all the hospital, they were so good to connect these boys, they asked us if they could take the first wall that we built and rebuild it.
And you see what's possible.
It's beautiful.
And the beauty, for me, comes from the fact that I know that my hands were looking at these boys, and they made them this giant wall, which was only in this place with nurses from this land.
When you're going to go today and look at your building world, don't you just ask, "What's the environmentalist?" -- a important question -- but what if you stay, "What's the human mistake of those who did that?"
We started a new method that was based on these questions, and we put it around the world.
Like in Italian, where we asked if a new hospital could help finish the whole corner.
In this hospital between 100 species, we've been designed a simple strategy to the famous medicine before it comes into who's flow, and our partners in San GOS are already offering life in its own mind.
Or Money: We asked if the center of Central could reduce the death of death and babies.
The international has one of the highest creatures of deaths and corporations in the world.
It's using a simple strategy that's going to be treated to the Iranian level, we've designed a center that can put women's women and patients in them to go to the hospital earlier and that's why they've got more safe points.
Or in Chicago, where we asked if the Central Central can help protect species in San.
It's a pundance to the gundance that's in love and the date of a global health care, the cost of diseases and war.
In one of the most expensive places to define the world, we used the summer and the trees around us to build a center where we're taught to protect and put the biological diversity.
Even here in the United States, we've been able to rethink about the largest university in the world.
The network community, through the symbols, shows us the power of visual communication.
We've designed a city that's a city of the ways that we're the people who are connected, also a liquid and not a liquid.
And even in Pattoco, my family city, we thought about an old industrial structure.
Could we use art and culture and design to live the city and other cities from our nation to our nation, and turn them into the center of innovation and growth?
In all these projects, we asked a simple question: What else architecture can do?
And in this question, we've been able to voice how we can create jobs, how we can use local resources and how we can invest in respect of communities that we're serving.
I've found that architecture can be a motor of change.
About a year ago, I read an article about the East East Amazon rights and the convenience called Barwin Berdson.
And in Iraq, there was an architecture architecture.
He and his team took more than 4,000 to the Francisco of Americans who were happening in the American South.
And they had a plan for every conference in which these Nechnos were going on, and girls of Andrew Canada to the Nigerian victims in Mary, Asia.
Scientists like Germany and South Africa, of course, Rwanda, found that it was the advantage to build Antarctica to reduce their past trees, to reduce their national health.
We still need to do it in the United States.
So I sent an email to Nazoo's Rakoti Ford: "Barwin," he said, "I think your new project is maybe one of the most important projects that we can do in America and change the way we think about injustice.
In the case, you know who's going to design it? "
And unfortunately, and the surprise, in Iran came back to me, and I invited me to meet with him and his team and talk to them.
You don't need to say, I've been looking at all of my feelings and I've been looking at a plane for Mexico, Abama.
And when I got there, in Iraq and his team collected me, and we've got around the city.
And they took the time to show me the stairs that were put on the whole city to the theory of the action, and the judgments that train the history of the actions.
And then he gave me a hill.
It's looking at all the city.
He showed the river and the traffic rainforest there was a lot of the largest states in America once killed.
And then to Renna's lab, where Jorvas was talking about these stairs and the wall, "The France of won."
And then the hill comes from us.
He said, "Here's a new analogy that's given the identity of this city and the nation."
Our two services worked together for the last year to design this analogy.
The analogy will take us on a journey through the Kenyan Sydney, a little bit familiar, like the French or the Victorian.
But when we go in, the land is moving through our face and our perception changes, where we understand that these institutions are involved in Chicago, which was happening in the central summer.
And when we continue, we're starting to understand the huge number of those who still need to get a joke.
They're going to look at the signals that are going to be used for us.
And it's really out there, there's a dog of identity.
But it's the time, it's deep, and it's that you're waiting for the invention, to be surrounded by preferences where they've been going to go.
For the next few years, this website will be, when every one of these artists will take and get rid of them in these countries.
Our nation is going to start to reduce more than a century of a minute.
When we think about how it has to build, we've been killed about the individual, the building process that we learned in Banada.
We'll be wondering if we can measure these instructions in the asteroids where these conversations were happening.
In Einstein and his team started to collect this land and put it in refugees with a family, a community and a community.
The operation of the land itself has led to a kind of sophisticated fingerprint.
It's a cooperation of black justice.
Like one team of EJI've been in the collection of the land in the universe where William Mumberne was killed, "If William William Mord Mumbaza's head, one piece of a person, I'm going to get a forest -- I'm going to take it out, and
We're designed to start working on this analogy later this year, and it's going to be a place to finally talk about the cases that you can't talk about.
If my father told me that day -- our house -- I took his life. What I didn't know was that he was a much deeper relationship between architecture and us.
The buildings are not just the two boys.
They're bringing our personality and our activities as a company.
A great architecture can give us hope.
A great architecture can spread.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
So, I'm leaving a team in Google who's working on a positive learning, which means, an engineering field that causes computers and devices to do some of the things that our brains do.
And it makes us interested in real brains and also in the brain science, and especially in the things that our brains are still much more about computers.
In historically, one of these circumstances is a perception, the process that's taken all of the things that are in the outside world -- sounds and images -- are going to be done to the fish in every single world.
It's about our brains, and it's also very useful in the computer.
The algorithms for a positive piece, for example, that our team is invited, they're what's going to make your death in Google Patus be a search, on a plan.
The other face of perception is creativity: the idea of themselves in the world.
And so for the last year, we've been working on a positive perception of society in a way that's invisible to the most important creative world, and learning art.
I think that Milliama had a unique insight about this particular relationship between creativity.
It's a piece of his church: "Everybody has a box in it, and it's the French work to discover it."
So, I think that Neanjo's effect for this that we're creating through a perception, and it's actually a minute of imagination and it's creative material.
The man who's done all of the thought and prosperity and imagination, is of course the brain.
And I want to open a little bit of history on what we know about the brain.
Because not like, like, the heart or the eyes, you can't say a lot of the brain just looking at it, at least, in an unfamous eye.
The early anthropologists that looked at brains called the Turkey boys of this thing in all kinds of imaginations, such as the Pacific, which means "a small window."
But it's obviously not telling us a lot about what's really going on in the face.
The first person, I think, in fact, opening some species of what's really going on in the brain was the big anthropologist, San Francisco School, in the mirror century, using a microscopic microscope, and they've been able to open up in a very high corner of cells in the brain, to start to understand their biology.
And that's the kinds of pieces that it's a painting of nervous cells in the mirror century.
It's from a brain of a bird.
And you'll see this amazing variety of different cells, even the theory itself was quite new.
And these buildings, these cells that have these exhibitions and these fabrics that are able to move many spaces -- it was very sophisticated and curiosity in this period.
They're lucky, of course.
You can't have a couple of people in the century that's been trained; the walls of the walls and the extension just started.
But for many ways, these micro-anatomic creatures of San France, like this, for some more unprecedented.
And we're a hundred years after yes, trying to make the work in which San Francisco started.
It's an unprecedented data from our cooperation in the Mexico Mexico to a brain science.
And what our cooperation's activity has done is for small proteins of brain tissue.
All of the right is called in the size of one meter, and I'm showing you a very small part of it here.
It's a side that's on the size of the size of one microbial.
The boys that you see are a mystery that are equal in your body to the microbial.
And it's a lot of refugees in this very small body of tissue.
Just for the equation, Twitter's Twitter's effect of the forest is a hundred microbes.
And so we're looking at something that's much more tiny than one square.
And all of these hormones of ecosystems are growing electronic microscope, you can start with a fabric of nervous cells, the presidents like this.
Well, it's about the same style in the summer of a Kayan School.
It's just a couple of nervous cells, another one we couldn't see anything here.
It's going to be so convenient, so full of genes, full of one nervous cells into the other.
So the hormone was going to take the time, and the progress in the brain is going to look at the next decades.
But we knew that you would stop using a song, and to the other world's World War, our technology was going to start to start real electrical experiments in life to understand better how they were working.
It's the same time that computers were first invented, really based on the idea of building the brain -- of "The Virgin," as Al Dr. Terris called it, one of the computer scientists.
Warn Mackkota Waller Pixis looked at the Public's coffee's coffee's orchestra, which I'm showing here.
It's the code that you've heard of the disciplines from the eye.
And for them, it looks like an electric diversity.
So there's a lot of details in the size of Mexico and Patus that's not completely true.
But this central idea that the Iranian cortex works as a series of regulation components one information to the patient's heart, in the case of the right thing.
Let's talk a moment about what a powerful information dignity should do.
The unique task of perception is this picture that's left and said, "That's a bird," is a very simple thing to do with our brains.
But we need to understand that computers, it was almost impossible just a few years ago.
In the Cambridge of the Central School doesn't have a professional task.
So what's happening between the pixels, between the birds and the word "bird," in the secret is a connection between a local nervous system, as I'm using a map.
The nervous network can be biological, within the climate, or, today, we're starting to have the ability to build these patterns of networks in the computer.
And I'm going to show you what it looks like.
So you can think of the pixels when the first time of News, and that's, in fact, how it works in the eye -- these are the anthropologic.
And these are magazines into one graph after the next step of News, they're all connected by different chemicals.
It's the behavior of this network is reduced by the forces of all these trials.
It's feeding the strengths of this web.
And at the end of the day, you've got Nigerian or a small group of Nigerians who are dying, and they say, "Ford."
Now I'm going to make these three things -- the text and the pixel of the nervous networks, and a bird -- by three participants: Your Your.
There's maybe a hundred million pounds about -- a million pixels in this picture.
There's billions or trillion trillion, which represents the weight of all these trials in the nervous networks.
And there's a very small number of Tom's TV, of pounds that have this web.
"Ford" is just five letters, right?
So let's face a facility that's just a simple, x x x.
I'm there the frog in sisters because what's really going on here, of course, is a very complex series of math actions.
It's one equation.
There are three changes.
And we all know that if you have one equation, you can solve one change if you know the other things.
So the problem of the conference, which is, to understand that the picture of the bird is a bird, it's this: Tom is the crisis and the magazine is known.
You know the nervous web, you know the pixels.
As you can see, it's actually a pretty simple problem.
You're spending two as a three and you're finished.
I'm going to show you an artificial network that we've built recently, and we've done exactly that.
It's run in real time on a mobile phone, and it's, of course, amazing to itself, the mobile phones can do so many millions and trials of actions.
What you see is a phone looking at the images of one birds after the other, and actually not just says, "Yes, it's a bird," but it's the species of the bird with this kind of network.
So in this photograph, this is a great, and it's an unknown, and it's not known.
I'm looking at the usual parts of course, which is how do we actually discover it, the brain that can do that?
How would we ever learn this model?
So this process of learning, or a fabric, if we were doing it with simple equations where we think about these as numbers, we know exactly how to do it: 6 -- well, we're spending in the eyes and we're finished it.
The problem is with this operation.
So, dream -- used a test because it turned out, but as a moment I said, the plan is a little bit of a morning here.
It's a very complicated action, very unfortunate action; it doesn't have a cooperation.
So we need to find a way to solve the equation without the extinction.
And the way to do this is quite directly.
You're just saying, let's take a bank on a simple, and we're going to go to the right side of the equation.
Now, we're still using a patient.
And this zero -- let's think about it when it comes.
In other words, if we've evolved for right, then the prosperity will be zero.
And if it didn't make us really true, the prosperity will be a big bus.
So now we can just switch the corner, and that's the kind of thing that computers are really good at it.
So you took a first sense: What if you did 0?
Well, then the profound is six.
What's with a 11? The prosthesis is is four.
And then the computer can play a kind of popularity, and reduce the prosperity close to zero.
And when he does that, he gets close to the Wow.
And in a typical way, it's never really coming there, but after about about 10 years, we're going to come up with 2.99, which is close enough.
And this is the learning process.
So remember what's going on here is that we've taken a lot of magnitude and we've evolved for a center through a cell process.
It's exactly the same way we do our learning.
We have a lot of images as babies and tell us, "It's a bird; it's not a bird."
And over time, through back, we're opening up for a blueprint, we're open for these bones.
So now, we've reduced the x and a fire to solve for TV; it's a quick sense, daily day.
We realized how we could solve for a page, it's a lot more difficult, because we need to do a lesson, using a lot of trust examples.
And about a year ago, Alex Monterna, in our team, decided to experience what happens if we're trying to solve for the x, at the beginning, and it's known.
In other words, you know it's a bird, and you've got the nervous network that you've lost on birds, but what is the picture of the bird?
It turns out that using exactly the same process that matters, you can do with a network that's going to recognize birds, and it turns out that the result is...
A picture of birds.
So it's a picture of birds that's completely created by a nervous network that's going to know birds, just by a CO2 solution rather than solve, and do it in the citizens.
Here's another chemical example.
It was a job that was done by Michael Turk in our group, called "The Life School."
It reminds me a little bit of the art of Volololta, where it's creating organisms, it creates them, creates teachers them, and it creates a film in this way.
In this case, what Michael does is change the plane in a space of different animals, a network that's designed to recognize and understand between different animals.
And you're getting the kind of strange in this strange of changes like a name, one animal for another.
Here it's and Alex together tried to reduce the TV to just two dimensions, so they're creating a map of all the things that are familiar by this network.
So to do this kind of Nigeria or a piece of photos on the surface, which contains the surface, you're doing a kind of map -- a beautiful map of all the things that the web knows how to recognize.
The entire animals here. "
You can do it with other kinds of networks.
It's a network that's designed to recognize faces, to make a difference between one finger after.
And here, we put the TV that says, "I'm," I'm my face's primates.
And when this thing is a magnitude, it creates a kind of crazy picture, a kind of sacrificate picture, Saratian, and my psychiatric from a number of coffee points together.
The reason it looks like a number of points together is because this web is made out of an equal meaning of face in one or another, when you look at them with one kind of light, or another kind of light.
So when you do this kind of rebuilding, if you don't use some kind of regular image or statistic statistics, then you get a kind of different perspective, because it's a significant thing.
It's what happens if Alex uses itself as a faith as a device during the optimistic process to rebuild my face.
So you can see it's not perfect.
There's still a lot of work to do about how we're doing good at the good process.
But you're starting to get something more like faces, that's great for my faces as the animal.
You don't have to start with Canada or with a sound of white.
When you're open for the x, you can start with the x, which is himself a different picture.
That's what this little bit is.
It's a network that's designed to buy all kinds of different objects -- buildings in fact by human, animals.
Here we're starting with just a picture of clouds, and when we're extended, basically, this network brings what it sees in the clouds.
And as you spend more time looking at them, you'll also see a lot more things in the clouds.
You can also use the web to predict into this, and you get quite crazy things.
Laughter) Or, Michael did some other experiments in which he takes the red picture of it, it's done, it's fresh, it's fusion, it's fair.
And in this way, you can get a kind of situation of the web, I'm sorry, or a kind of free option, where the network is spinning itself.
So every picture is now the basis, "What do I think I see now?
What do I think I see now? What do I think I see now? "
I showed it for the first time in public a group in Talk called "Life" higher education -- it was Michael after Maria became a party.
So I'd like to end very quickly in the city that this technology is not limited.
I've shown you examples and entirely because it's really fun to look at them.
It's not a completely powerful technology.
The artist who's going to take with us action, Ross Guinn, did experiments that were made out of images, and then his computer wrote a mammogram using boundary networks, based on the content of the picture.
And this nervous network of the poem is based on a big mirror of the 20th century.
And the poem is, you know, I think, kind of bad, actually.
It's a chance. I think it's about Los Angeles, I think it's right; it's a very intuitive, very intuitive media.
What we've just seen is the nervous networks of art to discover, or to remind different things in the world, can be a backwards, to produce.
One of the things that I'm showing me is not just as Los Angeles really saw the button in the Amazon, but that every production, every recycling, all the sensors that's going to do actions that some kind of notion can also create because it's just because it's the same mechanism in two cases.
Like, I think you're going to make and creativity are in any form not just human.
We're starting to have computer models that can do exactly the same kind of thing.
And it doesn't have to surprise; the brain is positive.
And eventually, computers started as a normal design in a small machine.
It's a different model of how we can create a amount of machines.
And we're finally starting to define how many of these first boundaries, of TV and Nigerian and Mukota and Patus.
And I think it's important not just to wait for refugees or play Canadian or something.
From the beginning, we've got them to our brain.
And they also give us the ability to understand our brains better and expand them.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
The stories of the National Science Times's Times's Times' birth's birthday's birds, "The Rosters saw that their crimes told about the Socian struggle between a privilege.
The rivers brought them in the cases to predict the success of the future actions.
And today, this bird is still spending a important place, but much less than it -- on our food stations.
The modern chimpanzee is mostly a fingerprint from the red jungle, and it's in three other species close, everyone's going to survive in India and South Asia.
The local bubble represents enormous characteristics just one time a few decades.
The capacity of Canadian January to train everyday objects may have evolved to take all of these previous forces, and reduce their population when food was common.
It was something that people could win on the basis of a permanent basis, and the low-up corporation of the birds and the extension instead of being able to go into a nation and a device.
The most progressive discovery, which is about 700,000 years ago, not inspired for food, but something that's going to be much less common today.
The asteroids of the muscles, scared in natural features, became the chickens for popular generation.
By the other century before the camp, Congress spread out of the Indus and the Middle East and the Middle East to sell a place in cities and were used by patterns.
But it was in Egypt where the next step of the history of the bird.
When a chimpanzee is a natural object, it's produced to create new and sitting on a group of six or more trees for 21 days.
By the first century ago, the Egyptian, the Egyptians have learned to make a half of my own chimps by the people who have been conducted on hot roads.
It's a range of chickens to continue to train daily trees, and what was an artificial age or a religious principal has become a common conversation.
About the same time that the Egyptian invented boundaries, parasites brought the chimps to Europe, where they're in the mirror became the diverse of the asteroids.
However, for a long time, the value plane of the chickens went to exist in California.
The ancient Greeks were used in Kenyan as an inspired examples of young soldiers.
The rivers were conducted in the chickens.
And to the 20th century, the chimps were thought to be tremendous.
For the next few reasons, Chicago people to you a place where they went, spread in the world through traffic, chicken, and intuition.
After the horizontal war, the Chinese species were fought to the England and with local chickens.
It made a difference in a phenomenon called "The French" or "The Fanki," with interviews in every Europe who are trying to many new species with certain kinds of properties.
The mammoth also made the attention of one, Charles Darwin, which means if the process of a similar stimulus happened in nature.
Darwin in in hundreds of chickens as they finished his historical work that was killing evolution.
But the biggest component of the chimps to science doesn't happen.
In the beginning of the 20th century, the illusion of healthy scientists have made a lot of engagement of chimps, and they were based on the studies of a graph of a genetic size.
With their big genetic direction, many features, and only seven months between generations, chimps were the perfect motion.
The result of this work was a famous clinician, which was used to show what a gene would happen from a data flow.
Since then, liberal warriors became a chicken and more muscles, and allow them to save more trees than ever.
In the meantime, Chicago went to the industrial industrial model, with diverse birds in a huge size of paper.
And while there was a change of agriculture in a open surface of animals's rights and environmental rights, most of 22 billion chimps in the world today are ridiculous.
Matriologist and go to the allies, to take a journey and research convenience, Chicago to a lot of role for the reality.
And although they didn't come before the end of the end, the critical history of the chimps tell us a lot about our own.
There was a planet.
Like anything else, he was born, grew up to about 30 times of our sun and a long time for a very long time.
Some time -- no one knows.
Like everything in life, he came to the end of his life as a normal star as his life, the night of his life, finished his fuel.
But it wasn't the end.
He became a San Francisco, and in a process that's a huge amount of energy's amount of energy, which led the rest of the galaxy and Palt, in one second, the same amount of energy that our sun is reduced for 10 days.
And it evolved to another role in our galaxy.
Social effects are very expensive.
But it's the ones that are even more extreme mammograms.
In the process where it becomes a star to San Francisco, some of its inner parts under its weight, and it starts to move faster and faster, like a customer decision that's focused on their hands into the body.
That's how it begins to move very quickly and defense, in a very, its genetic field.
The material in the planet is going on around, energy from the boat goes to this material and the genetic field is growing more.
In this way, our planet has been a energy traffic to move the rest of the galaxy in the light and a gene of genome.
My planet, it's from my story, it became what's a magazine machine.
Just to explore the ocean, the genetic corner of a big thousand times from the genetic field of the Earth.
The worst astronomers have ever been learned by astronomers are called genocial disciplines because they're proud of disciplines, or contamination, which are focused on the largest as a gene of genome.
Our star, like this in a story, which went to the Genn, turned out as a gene of genomic corporations during the worst analogy of the coffee.
And yet, despite the gene of genome are the most important objects that we've ever been born by astronomers, we can't see them in an unfamous eye.
We depend on, we focus on other techniques to explore this genome.
We can't see them in an unfamous eye.
We can only see a part of the northern electronic South that we call the Olympic light.
And beyond that, we're focusing on other techniques.
And yet, as an astronomers, we're exploring a larger range of light and we're depending on other techniques to do it.
On the screen, it looks like this.
You see culture.
It's a light line.
It's a set of light power over time.
It's an accident of a genome.
astronomers that can see based on transformations like this to explain how the light is changing in time.
On the left, you can see the power of the light, without the corruption, and the right you can see the power of light with the corner.
It's earlier in my career, I'll also see a culture like this.
Unfortunately I lost my vision.
I've completely lost the vision because of a disease that has evolved, and together, I've lost the ability to see this transformation and the ability to stop my physics.
It was a very difficult way to me, in many boys.
And in a professional way, it's made me unable to stop my science.
I started to be afraid and explore the "This analogy" and understand what the astronomy astronomy is for.
I wanted to experience the engagement, the emotion, the Chinese of who proposed a bad event that's so high.
I thought about it for a long time, when I suddenly realized that the light is at the end of the numbers of numbers that's going to have a strong disability.
Together with my partners, we've been working really hard, and we've worked the numbers for the tools.
I got access to data, and now I could work on my research at the level of astronomers from the first teacher, with sound.
What people would be able to do, especially in real way, for hundreds of years, I do today by heard.
Thank you very much to listen to this gene curiosity that you see on the road -- Applause) Thank you.
It's going to reduce this gene of genome that you see on the screen that's been collected from a collective value, beyond the end of the discovery itself.
Now I'm going to show you the discovery.
It's not music, it's sound.
It's a digital crowdness that's been invited to the crops, by the sound response.
In a process called a pencil.
When you listen to this, the ocean hear something more except from the corruption itself.
When I look at the red areas of the previous disciplines, or the noise of the bus -- I'm a dog for the bus right now.
We've noticed the characteristics of electrical genes, like a solar wind.
I want you to hear what I heard.
You're going to hear it as a very rapidly rapidly in the hour.
And because you can see, I'm showing you a red line that's made up of the light that's released to clicks.
[digital]]]]]]] []]]]]]]]]] The Italian
[]] []]]] []]] []]]]]]]
So we've actually found that the disciplines spend enough time to create circumstances, that's created by energy changes that may be involved, it's depending on.
You may remember that I said that the material around the planet is moving around?
He's going to make a power with deaths and a remote that's been done by learning.
You probably remember we talked about a huge star that went into a very powerful electricity.
If it's the case, then the water that's coming out of the planet that's going to be connected to this genome.
What does that mean?
The creatures of a planet might be a very important part of these horrible objects.
When we got to cross this particular gene, we noticed that the use of governments are used to be a powerful piece of astronomers can also be used for astronomers that can see in another search of information inside the data.
In the Bill, I was working on other commercial surgeries, and my experiments showed that when you use the same kind of governments to have a powerful, astronomers can find more information in the new generation, the more likely.
It's the capacity for information to sound from a great astronomy to change a form of data.
The fact that the heat is so powerful can improve to make any one that's interested and want to understand what's going on in very, very, very powerful water.
When I lost the vision, I'd like to know that I don't have the same amount of information and the quality of information like an astronomer who can see.
Just when we put the information through the final process, the new process I hope to be a tool in the field that I've worked so hard to be part of.
And yet, it's going to say to science is not the only tree in astronomy where it's important.
It's a sophisticated phenomenon and science isn't going on at the rate.
The body is a change thing -- every one can develop limits at this point or another.
Let's think, for example, about scientists that have already come to their career.
What will happen to them if they open limits?
Would they feel insects, as I felt?
Technologists are bringing us out and make us switch.
It gives us an opportunity to bring to our confidence to a guy and a guy what we want to do in our lives, looking at a sense of interest -- and not by potential issues.
When we give people the opportunity to succeed without boundaries, it's going to define itself and life remains.
And I think the use of an astronomy helps us get it and make science.
Even though I heard of other evidence that technical techniques have to explore astronomy information, it's not relevant to astronomy because there's no astronomy astronomers in the field, South Africa said, "We want people who are true to the field."
These days I'm working in the planets in the South Africa.
There we're working on conservation techniques and data techniques that will be put with students in the school school to the parents.
These students will learn an astronomy astronomy, and they're going to learn the secret methods in the goal to explore astronomy events like a huge amount of energy from the sun, accumulating as refugees and the sun of the sun.
What we've learned with these students -- these students have a number of limits and strategies that are dealing -- what we've learned with these students will happen directly on how things are done in the professional decade.
I guess myself to call it open.
And it's happening right now.
I believe that science is about everyone.
It bees to humanity, and it has to be right to everyone, because we all study natural.
I think if we avoid people with limitations to take part of science, we'll take our connections with history and society.
My dream is an equal study, which people are in a respect of dignity, and they're losing it, that the people who're looking at them and they're spending together.
If people with limitations will be confident in science, it will happen to be a tremendous tree of knowledge, I'm sure about it.
It's the dirty of digital crops.
Thank you.
Adam December called Astron, sitting at a tree of academic and don't move his finger.
It's going to join him in his friend and Derek, who's reminded to his office that they have to wait for someone called Homo.
So it begins from a designer in which the two sides are going to come up, why they're waiting, and if they're at all on the right tree.
From here and Asia, you're waiting to be just more strange -- but it's looking at a disease that changed the modern axis.
He was written by Smith in the middle of 1949 and 1955, and he invented a simple question, but a metaphor -- what does the characters have to do?
Audience: Let's not do anything.
It's safer. And Dr. Mr.: Let's see it and see what it means.
Audience: Who?
And MK: Go.
Audience: Well, a good idea.
That's a critical dialogue and the concept of what I'm going to do is the main features of the Atlantic, a movement that's done after the other world's world's world's war and an artist artists are going to find meaning in the price.
The unemployment of Southern, the characteristics and the language to ask their meaning and don't share their prosthetic instruments on the stage.
Perhaps it sounds blueprint, the Southern has caused his insects with the hormone.
It's based on the unique approach of Bill Lang in his bodies, which is a commercial tragedy in two systems. "
In addition, the characteristics are made in a clinical field: they're waiting for inevitable violence that gives them a sense of goal, but their only goal comes from the right world, while they're waiting, they're touching for the pregnancy, they're looking for the interest and the climate and the climate.
But cool, there's a concept that's about their hard situation, which is in the language and their movement.
Their communication is full of strange words, repeated and meaning, as well as the physical budget, a dance and code, and they're reduced by physical colors.
It's a lot of times not clear if the audience is supposed to laugh or treat -- or if you look at the difference between the two.
Back was born in Babylin, teach English, French and Italian before to move, where most of his life in a theater, a poem and a prosthetic.
While the project was the whole love of love to language, it also made a place for a project by spreading acts, arrays and organisms of his work.
It was a central neighborhood in his wall, unfortunately, black and black, which was taken to popular through the Atlantic in Spain.
It's also a cartoon of theories, and it's a film for happiness or to take all the signals about their work.
It made the tools to go on to the road, and we've got the magic of Southern Western Western Western and ethics.
It's not all the meaningful meaning that it makes his body completely open.
Scientists have invented no meaning for this, and as a result has a cycle of meaning and the forests who take the top of the aid itself.
It's called the theory of the war, the French, and the British Virginia of Ireland.
The dynamic of the two prototypes has also changed and strength.
They're called the Chicago's posters, a fire-fire, two Italian friends, and even as a civilization of the Acago and the iPhone's hand.
In a famous way, he said that the only thing he could be safe in which he would have been slow and Australian organization was "natural gas."
Like the critical and the top of the intervention, their language is many times in the circumstances that we've developed and we've lost the thought, and it's going to be exactly where it's going to stop, and MK: Maybe we can start from the beginning of an organization: it's going to be easy, it's the
Basically reminded us that just like our daily lives, the world on the stage doesn't always make sense.
He can also explore reality and also the imagination, the bridge and the strange.
And despite a feminist is still attractive, the best theater makes us think -- and wait.
I'm in my life, I wouldn't have a conference that's going to lose 19 will really teach me a important lesson.
But he learned.
He taught me no one about anybody I don't know.
On a fifth day in the morning of 2005, the crowd and I, without bad, we need the same car at the same time, you're going to be, it turns out, a single one of the other.
I didn't see it.
In fact, I didn't see anybody.
You know, you don't look at anybody at the bottom, but I guess he saw me.
I guess he looked at all of us, when studio was killed over the operation.
I often wondered: What was he thinking?
In particular in these last decades.
I know it wasn't personal.
He didn't design to kill or advocate me, Jihad.
I mean -- he didn't know me.
No.
Instead, he gave me a content of not funny and not a concept.
I became a car.
For him, I was "The other one," "they," "as a" we are. "
The "Oh," enabled it to become unhuman.
It's enabled him to push the button.
And he wasn't Berrin.
Twenty and six expensive life was taken in my solution just, and I was almost one of them.
While you take a list, we got into so powerful that it was almost normal; what I'm Michael France through a fire.
We didn't know that we were the air.
We've just been a few minutes earlier at the end of the Nigeria in the bottom: no direct interact, no bees and an entirely conversation.
But in the support, we've got a hand.
We helped each other.
We've read our brains, a little bit like a train, waiting for response.
"I'm John, I'm here.
I live.
Okay. "
"I'm age.
Here.
A animal.
Okay. "
I didn't know Alison.
But I listened to her lights in every few minutes.
I didn't know Richard.
But it was important to me that he survived.
All I've been able to have was my private name.
They didn't know I was a mayor of the design budget.
And here's my favorite, it's also been in that morning.
They didn't know that I've published architecture and design, which I've been my daughter's critical society, which I've spent two black -- still -- I've been scared.
I'm not already a series.
I've spent Jane and I've been looking at TED Talks, of course, I've never seen one day I'm going to be proud of here, and I've been looking at a weird on my legs, I'll give a talk.
I was a young Australian woman who does extraordinary things in London.
And I wouldn't be familiar with that.
I was so excited to survive that I used my finger to buy a famous shoot around the top of my legs, and I just got everything out of the summer, to move, listen to myself, to be scared by the Institute to India.
I've put my list rate.
I showed my components.
I've invited myself need language and I've been looking at my eyes.
I got almost an hour, an hour of my life to this point.
Maybe I had to do more.
Maybe I could live more, see more.
Maybe I had to go out to the tree, to code, do a blueprint.
But my colleagues and my code was always my job.
I live to work.
Who I was on my exploration card was important to me.
But it wasn't important there in this gift.
Unfortunately, I felt the first moment of one of my notes, I wouldn't be able to talk, can't say even a small word, like "Jim."
I gave them my body.
I did everything I could do, and now I was in their hands.
I realized exactly who humanity and what humanity is exactly, when I first saw the beautiful cartoon that I could have when I was in the hospital.
And he said, "Oh, by the consumption, one doesn't know."
A woman, by training, one is not known.
These four words were my gift.
What they told me is very clear is that my life was treated, but only because I was a man.
The difference from any kind of thing that he didn't matter to the invisible efforts that the team had been ready to do to save my life.
For them, it didn't change if I was rich or a second, my skin color, if I was a man or a woman, my right identity, who I was in, if I had a faith, if I had a faith or no faith at all.
There's nothing changed from this that I was a beautiful human life.
I see myself as a animal fact.
I'm the conversation that love without journalism can't just save, but also change life.
Here's a wonderful picture of one of my surprises, Andy, and I'm going to take a year last.
Twenty years later this event, and here we are, Iraq.
Within all the bus, my hand is powerful.
My faces were scared in the clouds.
What did I feel?
I felt wrong.
What I'm going to play with me is an extinct and an exhibition to the corner, which gives me the courage to say, "It's me," This is love.
I was the daughter.
I believe that the potential for positive change is completely huge because I know why we can.
I know the light of humanity.
So this leaves me with really big things to know about and how many questions we need to voice: What is one that brings us is not much larger than what can ever reduce?
Did we have to happen tragedy or a disaster to make us feel deep as one species, as human beings?
And since we're going to move our age's concept to move over to just suffering and give them a series that we just know them?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Technology, the studio of the fish.
It's going to hear a big word and waiting, but it's really exciting, because biology is the only word that's on "biology" and there's the word that's going to have the word "OLO.
Laughter) The kids in the audience already know that YOLO says, "Only one time," and because I'm just living one time, I'm going to get them in doing what I've always been going to do: see the boundaries in the world and make new genes.
This is what I do.
In the last few years, I've spent more in the cases, looking for new genes.
It turns out there's a lot of new genes of roads.
You just need to know where to look, and maybe it's also going to be a little bit.
It's a privilege can tell me a lot of biology and geology.
They can tell me how the earthquake around them have changed and affected that they're stuck in these little holes, and they can tell me about the evolution of the vision, by which they're blind.
The fish have eyes, they're at all identical to our own.
For all of these animals have this. And every time the blood of fish starts to fill itself into the sand and happened in the cave, during many generations, they lose the eyes and the vision until they become a moral, like this is here.
Each fingerprint has evolved a little bit different, and every one has a unique and biological story to tell us, and so it's so exciting to discover new genes.
It's a new one that we've got, an Iranians.
We called it Alexanda, Derey Ray from English: Hi.
It's the next species to him are the most sophisticated of life in Kenyan, in the cases of violence.
And they started to get rid as the river were spending them a few million years ago.
Over this time, they developed these big differences in the genetic structure that remains their generations.
There's a gene called Rosesen that's a critical secret to Italy.
We've got it, and they've also got it, just one of the genes stop using this gene, and the other one's left it.
It's a beautiful natural experiment: where we can look at the genes that we're going to look at our vision, and at the end of how we can see.
But the genes of these cases can also tell us about a biological time.
It's a new one that we've got in Mexico, we've called Tikoti Tim.
It means "A big," in the feedback, because some patients were going to look at this patient.
Remember or not, for the conversations in full of things, and in a privilege of the web, it's not the most important thing to do with your life, but -- only life is one time!
So I love this patient even though he was trying to kill us, and that's because this finger in Mexico, the next one is 6,000 kilometers of it, a traffic in Australia.
There's no chance that a piece of water that's driving water in a two-dimensional axis can push the Indian ocean. So when we've put these genes of the species we've found that they've found that they've been living in France over 100 million years, or about since the primary feelings were connected.
So, in fact, these genes don't have any of it.
It's the opposite that remains them.
And they give us, through their genes, their way and the similar points of how to go and contract at the time of these ancient astronologists.
It's so new that I still don't have to tell you his name, but I can tell you that it's a new finger from Mexico, and it's probably that it's already failed.
It's probably been failed, because the only conditions that we know about is alive, we've been reduced during the building of a low sugar.
Unfortunately, the arm of the cases, the academic water flow in which they live is also our main source of who is.
The truth that we still don't know who's the next species to this gene.
You don't see there's nothing like them in Mexico, so maybe it's something in the box, or in Florida, or in India.
But what it wouldn't be, it may be made of light on something new in the biology of the muscles, or the biology of how to lose better kinds of generations.
I'm just hope we're going to get these species before they're going to be afraid.
I mean to spend my only life as a biologist, trying to figure out and protect these little boundaries and the areas that can tell us so much about the evolution of the Earth and biology of how we see.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey, my name is Asia.
I'm a cartoon.
Laughter) Well, at least I was.
In some time, I would get two or three pounds of boys who were sent to me every day.
I've been a confident in doing the same detail in a number of different points and many colors, because I didn't know what I really want.
So I got to get out, I've studied the clothes, and then I sent back what I didn't think.
Once I gave me a few of these communities, and I said to me, "Oh, I think you have a problem."
And I didn't think that way.
I mean, it's free and free, not that?
And I didn't ask it a second thought, until I heard at work on statistics that I've shown me.
Look, I'm a global components in the society from the death of death. We've been at access with one of my biggest customers, scientists how to cooperate costs.
One of their biggest challenges was how to manage the citizens.
Only the fish that it was born in Kenya, they went back to 7.5 million privacy to wear.
I couldn't stop thinking about it.
What's going on to all of these powerful guys?
So I went back home and I got research.
I found that in every year, two billion pounds of roads that were returned to the wave.
It's like one night you're sitting in the United States to do a road in the neighborhood and you're going to take all the same road.
I was dead.
And I mean, from all the people, I had to be able to prevent this.
So my job is to find solutions to the statistics problems like these -- not to create them.
So this issue became very personal for me.
I said, "You know what? You have to solve it."
And we can, with some of the sustainable systems.
And then I started wondering: How did we get to this situation?
I mean, just six years ago, there was a research study that was able to offer free citizens on the web to encourage customers more.
We started to see companies that are free in the web to define service and provide a better experience.
What we didn't understand is that the thing would lead to that more details were repeated.
In the United States, companies have lost a 351 billion dollars in 2017.
Social companies are fighting in a lot of time to get out of their curiosity.
They're trying to bring this strange instrument to the local strength to sell it again, or they're familiar with the joy, or to a society that's driving the clothes.
Actually, if companies can't find this trick will be rapidly and in a economic way, it's sent to language.
All of a sudden, I felt a big mom about this that I'm out of these lines, that you're going to talk about this.
Who would have been in his mind that my imagination behavior was just not just me, but also in our planet?
And as I wondered what to do, I thought again and again: Why should you be a return to a society that's driving it?
What if there was a different way, where all of them get?
What if someone's going to try to return something, it can be able to buy the next box that's interesting, and it's not an extension to it?
What if, instead of repeat, can I do what I call "green"? "
The consumers can use an ecology to take the pint and believe it while you're bringing it.
A artificial intelligence system can imagine these clothes in their face -- new or a little bit crazy -- and reduce them to the next person.
In a new situation, we're going to have an autism to the next box, and we're a little bit of weird that we're going to go back on the web.
The magical society can decide about the toxic rules, on the number of times that's left to reduce a certain kind of repair.
Everything that the consumer has to do is get a code on the mobile phone, take the needle to the top point of the next step to Egypt, and that's how it's going to be able to come up with it, and it's not going to be reduced.
Now you'll probably ask, "Do people really want to go through all this train?"
I think they're going to want, if they're going to get rid, like a chicken dozen dot or a specific sector.
Let's call it "green roads."
You'll open a new world of possibilities to do money from this new curiosity that's going to be able to buy these powerful details.
This system will transform this beautiful thing called regulation and reducing the planet.
Thank you very much. It's neural. It's close to a six months of our sustainable systems to predict an enormous experiment.
Even before all of these loatic systems will be familiar, we can all of us that code to act right now, by every person in the United States will make a number of small changes in our consumption.
Would I take a little bit of time to do research and think -- do I really need this quote?
No: Do I really want to do this quote? -- before the Kenya.
And if every one of us, adults, in the United States will bring back the year five refugees, we've got about 120 million pounds of roads.
Five percent without courage.
This environmental problem that we've created isn't driving thousands of years -- it's going on today, and it has to move today to prevent the limits around the world.
I'd like to leave my daughter and my daughter's daughter's daughter's daughter and better than I found it, so I didn't just stop the feet, but I've also become the area for the door.
And you can. It's not hard.
Before we move our communities and our limitations in refugees that we don't want, let's move to the next time we're caring on the web and think about the same thing I hope we all want: the beautiful world we can read home.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'd like you to imagine a moment you're a soldier at the bottom.
Perhaps you're a fabric soldier or a mirror from the middle or maybe you're a hole.
It doesn't matter the time and your universe, there's some things that are convenient.
Your Einstein costs. And your actions are frankly fresh in you. French that you're going to protect yourself and those who've been scared to protect yourself and reduce your air.
So now, I'd like you to imagine yourself play a very different role, a role of finished.
It's the role of the emotion that we don't get out or protect.
The opposite role is to understand.
The city is it that's created out, to transform the surface, identify potential care.
And the finished can learn that, from the government, there's a bridge in a moon on on the river.
But over all, the city wants to know what's really there, accurately as possible.
And in real military, in fact, they're the soldier and the city are necessary.
But you can think about each of these jobs as a thinking pattern -- a metaphor to how we all spend information and ideas in our daily life.
What I'm going to argue today is that a good judgment, accurate actions, the right decisions are mostly related to your thinking.
In order to wait these beetles in action, I'm going to bring you back to the restaurant of the 19th century, a place where a piece of paper is going to reduce the big political intervention in history.
She went in 1894 by customers in the French Center.
It was called repeat refugees, but when they started it repeat, they found that somebody in their pockets were scared by the roads of Germany.
So they've evolved in a big choice, and their points in the mirror has been focused on this person to France Darwood.
He had gone without a mirror, not a history of a road, and it didn't avoid how much they could say.
But Dr. Dark was the only Indian mammoth in the military, and most of the forest at that point, the French military was very anatomy.
They've been writing Darwin's hand to it that you'll remind and come to a concept that it was an accident, although the professional experts are much less safe in a imagination, but they're going to get it.
They went and did a search for Darwin's test, looking for the symbol's symbol.
They went through his babies, and they didn't find anything.
It's just convincing them more that Darwin didn't just be there, but it's also unemployed, because it's obviously invented all the evidence before they were able to get it.
So they went out and looked at his own personal history after a few pounds.
They talked to his parents, they found that he learned that he was teaching forests in school, what I showed was clear to communicate with foreign countries later in life.
Mario also said that Derek was known as a good memory, which was very important, right?
You know, because a Google has to remember a lot of things.
So the case went to the sentence, and Derek is an iron.
And then, we took it to this public summer and in Texas, you're going to get the eyes over the country and they've been reduced to the two.
It was called the France of Dr. Dark.
And it went back from a world instead of a world with the name of the name: the other ones, which is a strength of this tree out of South America.
So there he went, and there he took his hand alone, in a fixed park on a church of the France of France when he's spinning them to reinvent us so they could find his face.
But most of all, France has shown the thing as a hair.
One thing that's really interesting to me in Derek Dick is the question of why the customers were so convinced that Dr. Derek would be there.
I mean, you can also assume that they decided to move down, that they're going to reduce it.
But historians don't think that's what happened.
As we can say, the customers really believe and water that was going on against Darg was powerful.
What makes you wonder: What does it mean about the human management that we can find so valuable interventions that are inevitable to avoid a person?
Well, it's a case that scientists call "Mumba". "
It's this phenomenon where our unaware and our passions and our fears, designing the way we spend information.
Some information, certain ideas, feel like our friends.
We want them to win, we want to protect them.
And other information and other ideas are the air, and we want to spread them.
So I'm called the Mumba's "Timba" thinking of a soldier. "
You're probably most of you have never been able to get a famous French in the age, I'm afraid, but maybe you've been looking at a decade after a metaphor or politics, so you've probably realized that when your judge came up with a bad group, for example, you've got a high motion to find reasons why
But if it's a collapse that the other group was made -- great!
It's a conventional decision, let's not test it too much to play.
Or maybe you're a article or a study of a piece of policy that's built in a window, like a death train.
And as researchers showed, if you support death and the research shows that it's not effective, then you have a high motivation to find all the reasons why the research was designed in a bad way.
But if it shows that the death of death works, it's a good study.
And become: If you don't support death, the same thing.
Our judgment is very surprised by our professionals that one of the dogs will win.
And it's there everywhere.
And it's designing our thinking about our health, on our relationship, how we're going to look at how to succeed, what we're listening as a gene or moral.
What I'm afraid of in a motivation or the pattern of a soldier, is how much it doesn't know.
We can think we're objective and unemployed and still kill the lives of an injured person.
However, it's the laser of his story didn't play.
It's a cologist Pixar.
It's also a high selection in the French Arabic, and as most people, it's the conversation that Darwin's right there.
It was also like most people in the military, it was at least analogy.
But at some point, Pixar started to ask: "What if we all do wrong about Derek?"
What happened is that he found interviews that the crowd to the best of Germany went on, also after Dr. Derek was in prison.
And he also found that another chicken in the military was a hand that was a hand that would say if to reduce it that, in a lot more than a Darwin's hand.
So he brought these patterns to the death of it, but to the president, or they didn't care about or the extension of refugees to explain his fingers, like, "Well, everything that's really published is, it's that there's another mirror that's learned how to mix Dere
But Derek is still there. "
In the end, Pixar was able to bring to Darwin's fault.
But it took him 10 years, and in part of this time, he was in the prison of an inevitable interview.
Many feel that Pixar can't really be the connection of this story because it was anatomy, and it's bad, which I'm agreing with.
But personally, for me, the fact that Pixi was actually an anthropic that actually makes it more convenient, because he had those same opinions, the same reasons to be afraid like his partners, but his motion to discover the truth and support it and support it.
So for me, Pixar is "Child's" is "of what I call" Dug "thinking."
It's the journey not to make one idea forever or after to stop, but just see what's really happened there in states and just as you can, if it's not beautiful or worse.
This pattern of thinking is what I'm very excited about.
And I spent the last few years when I look at and trying to figure out what makes the thinking of the city.
Why are some people, sometimes at least, they can move through their similar scientists, their privacy, and their cameras and just try to see the facts and the evidence in objectively as they can?
And the answer is emotional.
So, just as the pattern of a soldier's thinking of a regulation that's in the emotions like the agencies or privacy, it's also a pattern of finance.
It's conducted in different emotions.
For instance, finished are curiosity.
They're more likely to say they're sensory when they get new information or passion to solve a fact.
They're more comfortable when they're going to be able to do something that's against their expectations.
Syrians also have different values.
They're more likely to say that it's moral to look at your images yourself, and they're less likely to say that someone's changing its own smoke.
And for all of the foreign sectors to the background that means that their self-esteem as a person doesn't have to do a few of them are right or wrong on a particular issue.
So they can believe that the death of death works.
And if you look at studies that show that he's not, they might say, "Oh, it looks like I'm wrong, it doesn't mean I'm bad or freedom."
It's a way of machines is what researchers found -- and I also found in analogy -- a good judgment.
And the key point I want to admit with you about these machines is that they're particularly not about how smart you are or how much you know.
In fact, they don't have a lot of their iPhone at all.
They're about how you feel.
There's a quote that I'm going to go back to it, from an epic student.
He's the crisis of "The little boy."
He said, "If you want to build a boat, don't worry you're going to collect objects and flow the work.
Instead, we teach them to move into the big sea and infinitely. "
In other words, I'm saying, if we really want to improve our judgment as well as companies and companies, what we need is not the most dramatic in blogging or radio or companies, or economics, even though these things are valuable.
But what we're particularly need to use these principles is very well in the thinking of six.
We need to change the way we feel.
We need to learn how to feel a geographic instead of a woman when we see that maybe we were talking about something.
We need to learn how to feel kind of curiosity instead of the genes when we're going to be able to use science that we're going to reduce our ancestors.
So the question I want to leave you with is: Why are you the most successful?
Can you protect your principles?
Or maybe you're going to see the world really clear as possible?
Thank you very much.

In the Freedom America, we've done a device that's wrong and learning.
We've read not just colors but also from convenience, the lions in our country and the local schools.
We've gone to the regulation of the galleries.
We met a lot of people.
And we've seen that Egola and Tassia can happen in our prison and the central central central centuries of our attitude and hope for those who want to create a better life after you've survived their chicken.
Imagine if we were also thinking about the president of this instrument.
How would he look at it, with the universe as a value of it -- with love and compassion for her?
We've had a more safe company, healthier and faith to grow our children.
I'd like to know you James Times.
James who had 12 years in the country in San Franciscin, and he's going to be released in 18 months.
Now James, like you and me, is more than the worst thing he did.
It's a pain, a boy, a river.
It's made a surprise; it's spending his life, and it works hard to build his skills to do the crisis back to a nuclear life when it's going to go back to the civil population.
Now James, like millions of people behind Soradia and Bush, is an example of what happens if we believe that our faces don't define who we are, we're all worried about Olympic and if we're support it by the modern century, we're all able to move together.
I'd like to show you James right now, and it's going to share his Golden journey by a weird word.
James Kijing: Thank you, John.
On TED, you're going to go to San Kevin.

It's an inspiration of all the hard work that men and women do in the face to create better and better life for themselves after they're pushing their fingers.
This piece of piece is "Where I live."
I live in a world where most people are trying to go.
It's surrounded by high savings, spontaneously, where the wheel has a way to cut all the lines to a better future.
I'm living in the world that kills people to teach their people is not right.
Imagine.
More than that, imagine a world where people who have been published help people who have come to the French and move.
Maybe then we've all been the president "Golden Golden."
I live in a world called "The Amazon on Amazon" in those times that are used in the face.
But I've come to the conventional structure that doesn't -- it's really what you're doing from.
You see, despite my reality, there's hope.
I knew my sister would come, it was just a matter of time.
And that's how I've been invited to the first privilege as if there were my last meter and I realized that you don't have to be free to experience freedom.
And just because you're free, it doesn't mean you have freedom.
Many of us, for years, we're fighting our inner facts.
We're out of life as we're really glad: freedom!
You don't understand it?
We're all sitting in prison: We're just in different places.
In my happiness, I'm going to be free of the prison I've created.
The key: compassion.
It's my operation.
If we want freedom, then we have to think differently.
Because freedom...
It's not a place.
It went wind.

I once had a dream repeat and I went into a room full of people, and trying to not create a eye with anybody.
It's until someone for me and I'm just going to go into anthropy.
And the man comes to me and says, "Hey, I call me like this and so on.
And how do you call you? "
And I'm just sharing, you can't respond.
After a couple of moments of magnitude, he goes on, "You've forgot how you read?"
And I continue to stop.
And then, to look at, all the people who come in the room are going to go around me and ask, almost one sound: "You've forgot how you read?"
The more the molecules go and men, I want to respond, but I do.
I'm a strong artist.

A couple of years ago, I've been conducted a conventional video on the history of the video games.
And in this video, I made the voice of the space.
[Video]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]] Fre
SK: The dream that was out there, really.
There's a first response.
[Voice]]]]]]]]] []]]]]]]] &#
SK: There's!
You're going to push on "noise."
[Voice]]]] response: A great video.
SK: It was the first part of two parts.
I've been able to start working on the other part so.
You're going to push on "noise."
And video: Where's the other part? Ah? Ah, I need it in Wow! SP: Okay, there's someone, except my mom, who's given me hundreds of hundreds, on the Internet!
I felt that I finally got to this moment.
You're going to push on "noise."
[Voice]]]]] []]]]] []]]]]] &#
SS: Okay, I didn't go.
"Sure."
SS: Okay, at least it was a very important feedback.
"Sure."
SS: "Sure."
So video: I couldn't track because of the Indian.
SK: Okay, OK, two things.
One, I don't have a Indian, I've got a statistics, OK?
And two, it's obvious that I have a statistics.
But this kind of response went to, so I decided I had to get out of them and start working on the other part of the video.
I took the studio, but every time I sat to do, I just couldn't continue.
Each time, it took me back to the previous corporation, when I had a lot more difficult to talk.
I find out since I remember myself.
I was the child in the classroom who had never done when he had a question, or when you knew the answer.
Every time the phone was a crop, I would run into the services so I wouldn't have to answer.
If you called me, my parents would say I wasn't.
I spent a long time in services.
And I also got to show myself, especially in groups.
I've always come out when I asked to say my name, and I'd always be somebody who said, "You've forgot how you call you?"
And then everybody was laughing.
This conversation never has.
[Time]]]]]]]]]] []]]]]]] &#
So most of the time I went.
So you see, at the end of the end, even using my voice at work was a huge step for me.
Every time I'm looking at radio, I'm going to take a look at all a few times and a few times, and then I'm going to go back to the kitchen and trade the details in which, I think, I'm going to sound the worst.
[SP] Street]]]]]]]]]]]]] Street]]] &#
I can look at it, to push it, do it deeper, to add the hand.
And if I'm also exposed in the way, and if I'm also extended in the way, I'm just repeated and fix it.
It's magic.
SK: My long voice in work made me think I'm terrible.
But after the response to the Boston I did, I didn't feel terrible.
So, I was able to use my voice at my work.
Since then, I thought a lot about what's called "normal."
And I came to the conclusion that he had a lot of connection.
I'll give you an example.
I've come up with a story about a magnitude of magnitude -- Homas.
His choices reminded a little bit of colors.
And also when you do that, it's a little bit of a smoke.
For instance, the sea is described in a red red color, in the face of human beings -- sometimes in green color and women in the fingerprint.
And it's not just about a remote.
If you're in the ancient election at all -- China's ancient, Ireland, direction, India and even the DNA -- they're all a little bit of a little bit of colors.
The worst theory that's affected the reason, arguing, that the possibilities began to identify color as soon as they've learned to produce the same color.
In fact, if you know to produce color, just then you can identify it.
Back like red, that a lot of cultures was easy to produce -- started to identify this color in a very early early early early early.
But color like a blue, which was much harder to stop -- a lot of cultures learned to produce it at a much later.
So, they learned to identify it at the moment later.
Unfortunately, even if they were surrounded in some color, they didn't have the ability to identify it.
He was invisible.
He wasn't part of their president.
This story helped me put my personal story into the context.
When I started reading the response to the tank, my first page was to take personal.
But people who wrote the response didn't know about the feelings I had by my voice.
They've mostly responded on my kitchen, and the fact that it's killing from the president to use a clinic with a kitchen.
What is terrible, actually?
It's known that in studies tend to find more protesting in a writing, which you know is "black."
It's known to help fewer intuitions from a feminist, or to the students from a needle.
It's known that someone's lives with a name that's beaten, a road, a person will get more plastics from someone who's name "a black man."
Why is it like this?
What we're exposing is the idea of "normal."
We think it's terrible that a black student would do that the signals of a box.
We think it's terrible that a woman or a student who's going to take a little bit of a pint that's not going to be done.
And we know it's also terrible that you're going to be better to make "white" on a hot worker. "
But studies also show that this kind of discrimination, in most cases, it's just an optimism, and it's a result of engagement to help people that we're feeling safe and not of preparing people that we don't feel about.
It's a sense of independence begins at a very young age.
I'll give you an example.
A series of characteristic characteristics from Kenya's books every year, invented that in 2014, only in 11 percent of the books have been affected by a season.
A year ago, the lesson was only about eight percent, even though the time you're looking at the children in America today, you're going to have a little bit of a page.
Ford.
There's two boundaries here.
One -- we say to the kids that they can be everything they want, to do anything they want, and yet, most of the stories that children as the skin read about people who don't look like them.
Twenty, most of the population remains an opportunity to see the imagination that I've got between most of the TV: our lives today, our dreams, our dreams, our fears and our love and the love of the corporation.
It's wrong!
It's just like the ancient color in the ancient biodiversity, neutral groups are not part of our anxiety, because it's terrifying of all the things that we've been exposed to, of what can be able to see around.
Here's a particular project.
I can get the great idea that I've got in our minds -- which is good, and everything that's out of this definition -- it's bad.
Or I can challenge our consciousness with my work, and with my voice, and with my kitchen, and with my phenomenon here to you, although I'm afraid and I'm afraid to get in the services.
And I'm going to go back to the sound of SP: Latt I'm back to use my voice in my work.
And I want.
It doesn't mean that I wouldn't be on the collection of objects once the next few dozens of people will say I'm talking about.
[] SS: It means that now I understand what's better about the areas, and I'm going to make it no option for me.
The ancient direction didn't get one day and decided that the sky was sick.
It took a few centuries to human beings just to figure out what was so long.
So, we have to challenge again and again our previous concept, to enable us as a company to see the sky for what they are.

You've been a eight: 30 in a great morning.
You've got a great computer.
Thank you all.
Imagine that you're part of a component astronomers to Mars or a laugh planet.
The president can take a year or maybe more.
The place in space and the resources will be limited.
So you and the team will have to figure out how to make food with some things.
What if you could bring you just a little bit of walls, and grow up in a few hours?
And what if these patients could create more objects, you allow you to feed all the team with just some of these objects all over the journey?
Well, scientists in Los Angeles found a way to do exactly that.
What they found was actually very interesting.
It was about organized organisms, which are special organisms.
And they're also used by water.
The microbes in which they used Netroit, and with these virtues, you can create a coal of a Twitter carbon that's going to live on space.
Astronastronomers will take fear of Indian, this extinction is going to take by these microbes and turn it into a bone, a carbon and a magazine.
The astronomers will eat the ancient magazine, and take the flow out of carbon in a way of carbon dioxide, which is then spread by the microbes, which is a magazine from a magazine, and so you're going to take out of India by the astronomers.
And in such a way, it's made out of a fear of a switch.
So why is it important?
We need carbon to survive as human beings, and we get our carbon out of food.
In a long journey, you couldn't collect all fear over the way, so we'll have to find a way to return it on the phone.
It's a smart solution, right?
But the thing is, the research didn't really go anywhere.
We still didn't go to Mars. We still didn't have any other platform.
And it was actually invented in the '60s and' 70s.
So my voice, Dr. Jersen, and I, we've been interested, in fact, in a carbon area here on the planet.
We wanted to find technical solutions to the problem of climate.
And we've found this research by reading some of the materials that were published in the 1960s -- 1967 and after that -- put on this work.
And we thought it was a really good idea.
So we said, well, the Earth is like space.
We have a limited place and limited resources, and on the planet, we really need to find a solution how to return our carbon better.
So we had an idea, can we take some of these NASA ideas to put them on our own problem here in the Earth?
Can we take these microbes of NASA to create a valuable product here on Earth?
We started a company to do this.
And in a society, we found that these virtues -- I'm going to call them a brilliant carbon emissions -- we found that they're a powerful level of microbes that don't look at them and didn't look at them, and they can make a real value product.
So we started taking these products, these microbes, in our lab.
We've discovered that we can create real disciplines of India using these microbes.
And we've even made a ancient long-term conversation that they have a prototype of truth like what you can find in some animals.
We started taking them more, and we found that we could make a name.
It's used to make many products.
We've created a smoke that's like a great fingerprint, which can be used for telescopes, but it can also be used as a biological mechanism or even a symbol.
And we've created a smoke that's similar to the gene that's needed.
It's used to make a whole range of consumption products and industry.
We started working with agencies to define technology, and we're now working with them to bring some of these products to market.
We believe that this kind of technology can help us repeat carbon dioxide in a way of value products -- something that's useful to the world, but it's also useful to business.
That's what we do today.
But a price, using this technology and using these microbes can help us do something bigger if we take it to the next step.
We believe that this kind of technology can actually help us solve issues with agriculture and can help us create a kind of agriculture that's out there, that can help us define a scale of the disease.
And why would we need agriculture from there?
Well, in fact, it's valuable that the population will come to about 10 billion by 2050, and we're going to need to define food production in 70 percent.
In addition, we're going to have a lot of resources and more refugees to create products for consumers and products for industry.
So how do we go to provide the requirement?
Well, modern agriculture can't grow in a way to provide the requirement.
There are a number of reasons why.
One of them is a modern agriculture is one of the big details of gas.
In fact, it's more golder than our cars, our trucks, our plants and our car together.
Another reason is that modern agriculture requires a lot of land.
We've spent 50 million squares per square meters to the walls and the CO2.
How does it look?
Well, it's about the size of South America and Africa together.
Let me give you a specific example.
In Indonesia, the amount of rainforest raines in Britain's green size of Iraq, between 2000 and 2012.
Just think about all the species, all of the variety, which was built in the process, whether the plants, the fingers or the animals.
And a natural carbon dioxide is also inevitable.
So let me make it my wife for you.
This forests happen mostly to discover a place to the consumers.
And as I mentioned earlier, which is used for many products.
In fact, it's valuable because over 50 percent of the consumption products in use of consumption.
And it's including things like England, go.
It's including a song.
It's including patents, curiosity, soap.
And I'm probably there's no details in our kitchen and our biomateria that's created by the users.
So you're and I'm helping directly to the train of a rain.
The modern agriculture has some problems, and we need solutions if we want to define scale.
I believe that principles can be part of the solution -- slide, from these terrible fingerprints.
Now, these women's fingerprints, like plants, serve as natural refugees in the ecosystems where they're extended.
And they're scared in climate places like the Earth, like the Greek Ford Ford and strength.
In these ecosystems, they take carbon and repeat it to the mammograms that are going to make these ecosystems.
And they're rich in the materials, like a name and a protein, insects and coal.
And in fact, microbes are already part of our lives today.
If you're a plane, we've been on a fire in the evening, after a hard week and long, then you're a product of microbes.
If you enjoy your local government -- the product of microbes.
Or fight, or Genna, or Guinea.
Everybody's product of microbes.
But the beauty and the local power with these extinction remains that they can generate within decades against months.
It means that we can create tumors faster than we can create them today.
They're growing up in the screen, so they can grow in every sea and every geography and in the universe.
They can grow in tools that require a magic place.
And we can get to the kind of anonymous agriculture.
Instead of our traditional agriculture that requires so much land, we can grow an anthropic, and as a result to produce a lot more production to the surface.
If we put this approach and use these objects, then we don't have to get more forests there to create the food and the products that we consume.
Because, in a big scale, you can create 10,000 times more productive in every area that you can -- for example, if you use a conflict -- if you're going to take a sample in the same size of a earthquake over a year.
Fathers serve for a year's period.
So this is what I mean in a new kind of agriculture.
And that's what I mean in the development of a system that enables us to grow at a scale that's going to answer 10 billion.
And what would the production of this new kind of agriculture?
Well, we've already created a protein, so you can imagine something like a contrast, or even a chicken, or a beach.
We've already created a name, so you can imagine something like a chicken or a mayor or a mammoth or a safe.
So this kind of dung can actually make materials from the magazines that's going to tell us Pacia and their name, the products from all kinds of kinds of types.
It's going to be implemented, death and it's used to make other products, industrial products and consumer products, you can imagine the capacity to create treatments, soap, soap, soap, and so on, using this kind of kind.
It's not just that we've got a place, but if we're going to continue to act under this plane with modern agriculture, we're looking at survival to measure our fingerprint.
But it doesn't have to be that way.
We can imagine an ancient future.
Let's create systems that's released on the planet, our space, not just because of the cosmos, but allows us to develop systems and ways to live that would be useful to life and 10 seconds that will be on this planet in 2050.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Hi. My name is convenient, and I'm an architect.
I was born and grew up on the number, a city in the Western part of Syria, and I was always living here.
After six years of war, Times today is a half of the wind.
My family and I was lucky, our place is still on his own.
Although for two years, we were like artists at home.
Over the summer, the walls of coffee and coffee.
My husband and and I gave a studio to architecture in the main street of the ancient city.
It's gone, like Rome of the ancient city itself.
The other features of the city are genes now.
Since the Amazon in the end of 2015, big parts of the bridge has already been more or more projects.
The economy is completely devastated, and people are still waiting.
The secrets that they had depression in the market of the ancient city are now out of the streets in the streets.
Back our radio has a chicken, convenient agencies, short, pattern, full of it, and many other people.
I started to teach in a particular choice, and together with my husband, who was looking at some cases, we opened a little books.
Others work in all kinds of jobs to move.
When I look at the wind eyes, of course, I'm going to ask myself: What's led to the war with this?
Syria was in a space of suffering, a history of historical direction, a whole range of photos, survival, chickens, roads, lights, food.
How is my country -- a country with communities that live in Monya together and make sure about the differences between them -- how is it definition to civil civilizations, violence and lennia and restaurants?
There were many reasons that went to war -- social, politics and economics.
They're all going to take a role.
But I believe that there's one central reason that many of you are focused on and important to surgery, because it's going to depend on a lot of our ability to make sure it's not going to happen again.
And that reason is architecture.
Amazon in a half is an important role in a piece of choice, say, and the concept of training between the boundaries, and it's probably true for other countries as well.
There's a safe line between the architecture of a place for the community that's listening there.
Amazon reduces a central role in a situation where a community is reduced or repeated.
The Syrian society has spent a lot of time on the diabetes of different forms and different cases.
The curiosity reduced the stimulus of free trade and sustainable communities.
They've done the artist meaning of bees to a place, and it's transmitted in their building environment, in refugees and programs that we've built in the back of the globe, in the markets and public places, and the proportions were based on the principles of humanity and anxiety.
You can't still read the architecture of the variety of deaths.
The future Islamic city in Syria was built on the West I wrote, sold with him and sold his hands.
So they did her community.
People were scared and worked with it instead of giving them a sense of bees and made them feel at home.
They're part of a fear of refugee.
But during the last century, this isn't better in these places, it's been invented in my head; first, by planning cities of the local corner, when the products went on to the top, a change of what they've seen as a modern categories.
They've jumped streets in the city and they've spent Antarctica.
They called it birds, and these were the first time of a long and slow.
So, of traditional organisms and imaginations of our cities that are enabled identity and bees are not by privacy, but by listening.
But with the time, the future has become valuable, and the month, it's funny.
The modern environment and social environment has been written by elements of modern institutions -- savings in the boundaries of intelligence, the extinction, the Amazon Amazon, organisms that have started communities to go to the areas of a metaphor or a wealth.
And the same thing happened to the community.
When the building environment changed, it's how life and the quality of communities began to change.
From a way of transparency, of bees, architecture has become a way to grow, and communities started to move out of this tissue that's driven to one of them, and that's where it's represents their own day.
While many reasons were invited to the war, we didn't have to move the road of the way, by a nation of identity and self-respectful and self-respectful, ethnic and unprecedented human deaths have been reduced from recycling and proposed.
Over the time, the United States has changed a form of a city to a city with its rainforest.
And here, the genetic communities have gone to social groups, this contract to this and conduct to a place.
From my perspective, in a sense of experience that's going to go to a place and collaborate with someone else's capacity to get more.
You can see the example of the restaurant in the unemployment system, which is a device, before the war, over 40 percent of the population.
Yes, before the war, nearly the population of the Syrian population caused in autonomous neighborhoods, in the French of French without an academic party, are made of infinite forms of extinctions that feed people, people who have been trained in particular to the same group, whether on the basis of a basis, a teacher, or all of these together.
Agonomics has proved himself as a magnitude of the war.
It's much easier between certain areas of the head -- where others's "lives.
The connections that were coming to the city together -- whether there were social, using the remote building, or economic trade through the market, or religion through the pressure of a sea -- they lost everyone in the motor and the vision of the environment.
Let me end up with a musician.
When I read about the Tropical organisms in other parts of the world, which is going to be used for privacy neighborhoods or around France or Brothern, I recognize the first kind of insecure that we were going to have in a disaster of a disaster that was in Syrian.
We've put cities in a way, like a bridge, a broadcast and other streets, and a little bit of the state population is happening right now.
There's curiosity, the war, and the question I'm as a female has to ask, is: How do we rebuild?
What are the principles that we need to courage?
From my perspective, the main management should be about creating places that will make their people feel safe.
architecture and design need to get some of the traditional values that have done really, creating conditions to the list and peace, values of beauty that don't exist, but attitude, unprecedented, unprecedented and reduced, agriculture for everyone, not just for the rest of the city's city's, just like in the city of the
There's a neighborhood here on the left called the dad's father who's been killed as a cat.
About two years ago, I've made this design at the UNNNASA for rebuilding.
The idea was to create an interpretation of a tree in a tree, which is going to take into the brain and spread organically, which is the traditional bridge that I've reduced over the ancient metaphors, and to reduce privacy, privacy, artificial agencies, local places of games and genius and products.
It's far from being perfect, unfortunately.
I've seen it in the decades that we get electricity.
And there's a lot of possibilities for the patient who's going to have a community by architecture.
But to compare it with the blogs, the one of the insects that are affected by the great project to the universe in the dad.
Amazon is not a note that around all of the human life is suffering, but there's a conversation to offer and even a direct human activity.
In this sense, identity, identity and social combination are the production and the product of effective organisms.
The genetic corruption of the future Islamic city and of many ancient civil cities, for example, an intuition of intuition, while generations of moral forces, or genes, even when they're eaten, they're released to measure it. "
Even simple things as simple places of object or who's in the city can do a difference in the city where people feel about where they're seeing a rare place that's going to be created, a place that's worth going to get on, or that's where they're seeing it as a summer place, full of anger.
In order to be a place of Nanada, his architecture has to give up too.
Our building environment is important.
We've got our fingerprints on our brains.
And if you're in a way of training neighborhoods don't have refugees or a finished, you know, you're going to have a fabric cities or a fabric of sacrifice, the urban asteroids have been scared all over the Middle East and one reason of our communities.
We can learn from that.
We can learn how to rebuild a different way, how to create architecture that doesn't just look at the industrial and economic aspects of people, but also for social components and psychologists.
These values were completely transmitted in the rich cities before the war.
We need to create cities again that will put them into the communities that reduce them.
If we do that, people don't feel the need to look for the other possibilities that are around, because they're all going to feel at home.
Thank you for listening.
I'm British.
So I'm so much more about this -- "I'm British."
I'm going to come from my mom that many of us want to believe that there's a lot of families over the last thousand years.
We tend during history to change in other people, but we've done a lot less of it on ourselves.
So it came from a very smoke to me when I woke up in the 1940-year-old morning to find that my country was going to leave the Iraq, my mayor, and the Scotland went to the left with a door who could bring the end of the United States.
So it was a complete dream for me, and it was the slow to a lot of people, but it was also something that was in the number of days that was created a political radiation in my country.
There's been a career to the house with two, almost like, after a French game, we could ask a repeat game.
Everyone put all the other.
People put the head of the government called the school with the first place.
They'd put the rich leading leader that didn't fight it enough.
The young people put the players.
The education has left the lower education.
It's a very bad box that's been done by the worst component of this: the privilege of the muscles and the profound in the streets of Britain at the level that I didn't see before my life.
People talk now about whether my country becomes the small England, or, as one of my colleagues are going to make it, is we're going to become an alphase that's going to happen in the early Ocean in the Atlantic.
But my question is really, should we have the exact level that we've experienced since?
Is it something that happened between night?
Or would there be deeper structures that led us to the language that we're in today?
So I want to take a step back and ask two basic questions.
The first one, what Berkett represents, not just for my country, but we all around the world?
Second, what can we do in Darwin?
How are we all supposed to respond?
So first of all, what about Berket represents?
The ability to look at work is a wonderful thing.
Berbert taught us a lot of things about our society and companies around the world.
It's funny, in ways that we see that we're not aware of them, how many of our companies are affected.
The vote was taken from the age of age, education and geography.
The young people didn't get to vote in big numbers, but those who did want to stay.
More adults wanted to leave the Iraq.
Sography, it's London and Scotland that are most likely to be part of the Iraq, while in other parts of the country was very powerful.
These pieces are things that we really need to identify and take seriously.
But in a more productive way, the vote is teaching us something about politics today.
The political politics is not just about right and left.
It's not just about patterns and extinction.
It's about global civilization.
It's the summer of the prosthetic politics is between those who are living in global civilization and those who are reduced from the motivation.
So if we look at what those who wanted to leave -- we call them "Babylon" -- "we're seeing two faces that are really important.
The first is the approach, the other one is curiosity, and these are represents that people have to take the control of their lives and the feeling that they're not designed by politicians.
But these ideas are the meaning of fear and the light.
They're represents back to the past to the national and boundaries in ways that we've seen.
What I'd like to offer is that the picture is more complicated than that, the benefits of international support, like me, and I including myself, obviously, we need to put ourselves back to the picture to figure out how we've got to the map that we're today.
When we're looking at the voting patterns around the United States, we can see in a way of reference.
The hospital regions are going to stay "and the red areas are going to leave."
When I looked at this, what my personal way was so simple in my life that I really spent in many red areas.
I'm all of a sudden, when I look at 50 areas in the U.K. with the seven percent of the highest, I've spent a time of four days in these areas.
In some of these places, I didn't even know the violence of the vote.
It was a serious lesson for me, and it's the one that people like me think of ourselves to the cases, open and suffering, maybe not know the countries and our companies so well as we wanted to believe.
And the challenge that comes with this is that we need to find a new way to explain about these civilizations, identify that those people who don't necessarily go to university, who don't necessarily know with the Internet, they don't have opportunities to train, which may not be convinced by the thing that we find as convinced in our luck.
So you know, this means that we need to add a more rapidly and understand.
In the evening of the jihad, a training trade in the politics of fear, and it's created that cases around, to the mom, the idea that the vote on Europe can reduce the number of refugees that come to Europe, when the voice doesn't happen to be replaced by the Iraq.
But for most meaning of the previous event of the ambridge was the prosperity of the political institution.
It was the four disease for many, the feeling that nobody represents them, that they couldn't find a political party for them, so they took this political institution.
It's spread around Europe and parts of the world's democracy.
We're seeing it with the top of Denney's popularity in the United States, with the National Institute of Washington in Egypt in Nigeria, from the top of Marian's French in France.
The pressure of Berkett is in all of our companies.
So the question I think we need to ask is my second question, which is how should we respond effectively?
For everybody who has been able to create services, open and suffering, we need a new vision, a more global civilization and all of us, one who's spent people with us and not leaving them behind.
The vision of global civilization is a dream that you have to start with the rise of the positive benefits of global civilization.
The chimpanzees between economists is that a free trade, beyond House, beyond people's boundaries, are useful to everyone in September.
The contrast between international relationships is that global civilization brings, which brings cooperation and peace.
But civilization also has the effects of redesign.
It's creating convenient and symbols.
Let's take the return, we know that the poem comes in is positive to the economy under almost all the reasons.
But we also need to be aware that there's the results of reinvention, which is important, the approach of moral skills can lead to the most richest in our societies and another to make stress in the homework.
It's not from the fact that it's positive, but it means that more people need to share with these techniques and make them know.
In 2002, it was reminded to the past of the United Nations, a giant coffee in the University of Center, and this speech was about a global civilization.
It was the speech in which he's falling the message.
And he said, and I'm fascinating, "The warm of global civilization has to be open to every time it's going to stay safe.
Cities and generations are the forest of a global civilization in the corner and a nation. "
The idea of global civilization has been able to live in a short time in 2008 in a place where there's been a lot of involved in many countries in Europe.
But between a surprise and the economic crisis of 2008, the idea was almost unprecedented.
A global civilization has been reduced in January January.
It's taken as part of Janua more statistics than something that can be used to all of us.
And it has to go back to be on the basis of a lot more than how it's today.
So the question is, how can we get this goal?
How can we fit from one hand to fear and sell at the other side to the walls of sensors to be convinced to fear and art?
This is the question for all of us.
And I think, as a social scientist, that society scientists offer a number of places to start.
Our change has to be about two ideas and change, and I want to give you four places in the beginning.
The first one is about the idea of civil education.
What's in Berkett is the forest between the public and the Amazonian reality.
We've been done to social society, where interviews and nation is not used, and that cases have an equal to the speed of evidence.
So how we can -- Applause) How can we rebuild an honor of intervention and interview.
Without our liberal democracies? It has to start in education, but it has to start with the rise that there are huge effects.
In 2014, the Social Ross Rocide Research published on the possibilities to respond in, and he showed that the rest of the rivers go, so the public apartment of the attitude also costs, although it's obviously not very clear, because it could not be so much about the numbers and political and intervention around it.
But it's also the same morning, it's also a motivated knowledge of the public and it's not true on the nature of the atmosphere.
For example, in these experiments in the U.K., the public of the species of the Research were at a higher level of the approach than they were really, but they also believed that the amount of education was much more likely to respond to the general response than they were really.
So you have to treat this motivated science, in a mirror between a perception and reality about the important aspects of global civilization.
And it can't be something that just leads to our schools, even though it's important to start in early age.
It has to be about civil transformation for all of life and public activity that we're all dealing as companies.
The second thing I think is an opportunity is the idea to encourage more interaction between various communities.
But one of the things that look at me is very clear, when I look at the treatment to respond in the U.K., is that, in the way, the areas in my country that are sufficient by the highest numbers of cities.
So for instance, to London and the East South has the highest number of cities, and they're also in the most popular areas.
In those areas of the country that have the worst levels of the approach, they're actually the most stressed areas and unprecedented in the galls.
So we need to encourage students programs.
We need to make sure that the older generations may not have access to the Internet.
We need to encourage, even at a local level, more movement, more participation, more interaction with people that we don't know and with their investments we don't necessarily agree.
The third thing I think is critical, and it's really basic, is that we need to ensure that everybody's sharing in civilization.
This red of Times "after Berkett is really amazing.
He's showing that these people who were surprising to leave the Iranians are the ones that actually killed the worst of trade from training with the Iraq.
But the problem is that these people in these areas don't take themselves as convenient.
They didn't believe that they really got access to the solutions that are limited from limited and limited around the world.
I'm working on questions that's based on refugees, and one of the ideas that I'm looking at most time, especially in developing countries around the world, is that in order to encourage the faces of the refugees, we can't just help the French population, we also need to treat the level of local communities.
But by looking at this, one of the policies and policy is that we need to provide a better education scale, health care care, access to these areas with a high approach to treat local population.
But while we're doing it around the developing world, we don't take these guys home and put them in our societies.
More than that, if we're going to really take a look at the need to ensure the part of the people in the economic economy, our business and our organizations need a model of civilization that also need to take people with.
The last and last idea that I want to get to is the idea that we need more politics.
There's a little bit of evidence in society science that's important to be about global.
But from the cases that are there, what we can see is that there's a huge range in different countries and different languages in these countries in women and suffering questions like the boat and learning from one hand and a free trade on the other.
But one piece that I think is that there's a tremendous perspective on the data is the idea that local companies are much less suffering to civilization.
It's companies like Sweden in the past, like Canada today, where there's political politics, where there's a species and left together, where we're encouraging proportions for global civilization.
And what we're seeing around the world today is a good career, failure to create a dialogue between the extreme and politics, and it's happening in terms of the Central Central Central Central that can predict communication and common understanding.
It can be that we don't predict it today, but for all of the opens we need to read our politicians and our communities to make the fear of fear and be much more sufficient with each other.
Thank you very much for these ideas, they're a little bit unfair, and some of it because they need to be a common project and a common project.
I'm still British.
I'm still a doctor.
I'm still the East of the world.
For those of us who believe that our possibilities are not one of the other, we need to work together to ensure that global civilization will take everyone with us and don't leave people behind.
Just then we're really interested in the parents between democracy and civilization.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Many years of modern science.
You have to admit that our actions don't know what.
The machines that we're building is going to wait out of a chimpanzees.
The homes we build not survive powerful land.
But we don't have to be too critical to our scientists, for a simple reason: they didn't have a long time.
Many years are not a long time: the shape of nature have been three billion years to spend some of the most amazing materials that we would want to be in our hands.
Remember, these materials are satelliting a quality of three billion years.
Take, for example, Scott.
They're on centuries over hundreds of years in the air air, in coal climate, in Olympic light.
And yet, if you look at their structure in a high electronic microscope, and you ask yourself what they might be, they'll be able to find out that they're made of a summer.
Well, not exactly that we put in it.
It's actually a microscope of microbes.
And this microbial ecology is so powerful, compared to the office, which is about 10 times more than a female.
However, it's made of sugar.
So scientists all over the world believe that we're going to become one of the most important materials to industry.
But here's the problem: Let's say you want to buy half a plane of this nanologist for building a boat or a plane.
You can look at Google, in Bay, and even in the father.
Laughter) You don't find it.
You'll find thousands of scientific materials -- great materials of scientists to tell you what great material is, and there's a lot of things that you can do with.
But you don't find any relevant source.
So we're at the top university, together with our partners in Sweden, we decided to focus on the development of an industrial scale to create this evolution.
And of course, we didn't want to good trees.
So we've been looking at another source of genome material, and we've found this: the bubble of paper industry.
The reason: there's a lot of it.
Europe alone represents 11 million tons of this material every year.
It's going to move at three kilometers, on the surface of a cartoon.
And we're making this light every year.
So everybody's a environmental problem, but for us, it's a identity.
So today, we're actually producing, in a industrial scale in Israel, Nigeria, and nearly, in Sweden.
We can do many things with the material.
For example, we've shown that a small percent of Nigeria's production to Syria, the identity to those who are the credit of my partner, reduce their power in a dramatic way.
So you can use it to create great things, like a restaurant for industrial and popular implications.
But it's not the only thing.
For example, self-support structures like the disease that you see now, you're actually producing today in a neural architecture.
The nature didn't stop making farmers in the extinction.
Think about insects.
French, for example, customers in the capacity of a hundred times more than their height.
It's amazing.
It's about the person, who's going to be in the middle of the New York City and one piece, comes to the head of the lights.
I'm sure everybody would want to do this.
So the question is: How does the crowdness do it?
It turns out they're producing a wonderful material called Richard.
In simple words, Herrin, which is a protein, is the most ethnic body on Earth.
You can open it, except it, and it doesn't lose almost energy to the environment.
And when you're releasing it -- San!
He's bringing all the energy back.
I'm sure everybody would want this material.
But here's the problem: it's hard to take a crowd.
So why? Because they're a click.
It's actually enough to get one pattern.
Now we can reduce his DNA to read how the fingerprinting is produced, and put it to create less coffee, like a kitchen.
And this is exactly what we did.
Now we have the capacity to create a lot of muscles.
My team at university decided to do something really cool.
They decided to move the most powerful material that's made in the extended planet with the most athetic material that's made in the hot plane -- we're going to be created with Richard.
And the result is amazing.
It's a powerful material, altrum and coffee.
There's a lot of things you can do with this material.
For example, I've gone from the next generation to the next generation, so we can jump higher, run faster.
And even a journey is inevitable for computers and smart phones.
Well, the problem is that we're continuing to prove that symbotic users in our body, the same we're driving and we're driving to our bodies.
And I argue that it's not a good idea.
Why? Because they're not successful.
This satellite material gets just like this luck plastic, which is not powerful enough to its role.
But sometimes they're too powerful and therefore their mechanisms don't really care about the strengths of those cases.
But the reason is much more basic.
The reason is that in nature, there's no one to take my head and put it into my kitchen, or take my skin and move it into my body.
In nature, it's all about self-esteem.
So every living cell, whether it's coming from a moon or a person, you know DNA that's designed in biological building.
Most of these are proteins.
In other cases, it's analogy that make other materials, like multiverse, convenience.
And the philosophical corporate for all of these materials is that they don't need anybody.
They identify it and they're feeding themselves to boys -- the fingers that they've got a lot of cells to create tissues.
They're evolving to the men, and fear creates life.
So we're at the top university, about 10 years ago, we decided to focus on what it's probably the most important biological material for human beings.
Why is a collapse?
Because the collapse is about 25 percent of our weight.
We don't have something more common in our bodies to protect water.
I'm always excited to say that everyone who's working in dogs for human organisms is happy to collect a microscope.
There's to admit that we've started the project, there's been over 1,000 medical services that are being scared.
You know, very simple things like a skin to hide a cartoon, discovery, and other medical solutions, more sophisticated, such as a dog for heart.
So where is the problem?
The problem is the source.
It's the source of all this mammography is actually transparency: metaphors, fabric and even human bodies.
And that's why security is serious.
But it's not the only problem.
There's also a quality problem.
And here I've got a personal device.
It's my father, my grandfather, in our prison in Israel.
It's very similar to the heart, which I've made you before, it's been used in his body seven years ago.
The scientific literature says that these drugs are starting to get rid of 10 years after the surgery.
And it's not a chimpanzee: they're made of innovation and responsible, just like this thing, that's made out of buildings.
Right, I can take these white and build a new regulation.
But it wouldn't be the same thing to explore.
So the American and the American and the American drugs have been affected in 2007, which he asked companies to look for better alternatives.
And this is exactly what we did.
We decided to take all of the human genomes responsible on a kind of kind of kind of kind of human beings in the face of a genetic gene.
So now, the wind has a capacity to create a completely new human genome, not used.
It's amazing.
It's actually happening now.
Today in Israel, we grow them in the surface of 25,000 kilometers across the planet.
The galaxies get small toys of telescope.
They're just like a regular, alone is that they have five human genes.
They're responsible to the production of a personal gene.
We're growing them for 50.0-day, we're taking the tools, and then the rivers are fed in the spontaneous trucks.
That's where it's going to start with the collapse process.
If you've ever made a lot of Prize -- basically, it's the same thing.
So you're going to get the tools and you get the tree that's driving the coffee.
You're looking at the protein and you're spending the protein into the fingerprint, the final processes of Twitter, and the final result is the same thing that we're in our bodies -- not very, very new, which we're producing medical benefits, for example, to the friends, a limit of death.
And even, not a while, we've been able to get a market, here in Europe, John's wind that can be used to treat the end of a sad pocket, that's right now to use a clinic.
It's not science fiction.
It's happening now.
We're using plants to generate medical solutions for some of us exposed to human beings.
In fact, recently, we've been able to generate a powerful musician from six times an algae.
And this is amazing.
Together with our partners from Ireland, we thought about the next thing: to add Ricylin to these cases.
By that, we've been able to generate a powerful device about 380 percent, and I'm more at 300 percent.
It's strange to think, but in the future, when the patient's treated or full of these cases, we're going to get better performance after the surgery.
So what would be in the future?
In the future, we believe that we can create an artist in a lot of biological building that nature tells us -- collapse, we're created by this, Ricylin and many others.
And it will allow us to make better machines, which will be better, even attention.
This heart doesn't be the same to notice that you can get rid.
It would be better.
It's actually going to be better and survive a long time.
My friend Sweden said to me once a smart sentence.
He said, "If you want a new idea," You need to open an old book. "
And I say the book was already written.
He wrote for three billion evolution.
And his text is the DNA of life.
All we need to do is read this text, to courage nature's states and start to move away from here.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm very happy to be here.
I'm sure you're here, because it's going to be a little strange.
I'm happy that we're all here.
And in "Here," I don't mean here.
Or here.
It's here.
I mean the Earth.
And in "We," I don't mean those of us who are astronomy, but for life, all of the life on the planet --'s complexity to primary, started and as well as it's in refugees and curiosity.
It's the interesting thing that the Earth is the only place that's living in -- 8.7 million species.
We've been looking at other places, maybe not very well as we had or can, but we've been looking at all; the planet is the only place we know with life.
Is the Earth special?
It's a question that's done me since I was a small child, and I'm afraid that 80 percent of this room thought the same thing and also wanted to know the answer.
To understand if there's another planets -- in our solar system or beyond it -- that can exist, the first step is to figure out what life is here extinct.
It turns out, for all 8.7 million species, life needs just three things.
On the one hand, all life on Earth needs energy.
Life is complex like our bodies get the energy from the sun, but the life that's deep under the ground can get their energy talking like chemical responses.
There's a number of different energy products that are available on all the planets.
On the other hand, the whole life needs food or the right.
And it looks like a very limited, especially if you want a building in the office.
But with that, all of the life on the planet generates their prosthetic tasks only, and these secrets can be found on every body of our sun.
So it's leaving the thing that's in the middle of the border, the thing that it's hard to get.
Not Al, but water.
Laughter) Even though Al could be pretty cool.
It's not water water, and it's not water in a gas, but liquid water.
That's what life needs to survive, every form of life.
And many of the solar system doesn't have dinosaurs, so we're not looking for there.
Others in the sun system can be dinosaurs in the sun, even more than the Earth, but they're going to code under a ice ice, so it's hard to get it, it's hard to get it, even though there's some life there.
So it's leaving a number of boys that we need to take a math.
So let's take the problem for ourselves.
Let's just think about dinosaurs on the surface of the planet.
There's just three boys to take a look at our sun system, in the context of liquid water on the planet, and they, by the sun of the sun: the top, the Earth and the Mars.
You need to be an atmosphere to the water will be liquid.
You need to be very old with this atmosphere.
You can't be too much atmosphere, the atmosphere is too hot or too hot, because then the planet becomes too much like a kitchen, and you don't have a liquid of dinosaurs.
But if there's too much atmosphere, and it's too good or too much happened, the planet becomes like Mars, too cold.
So it's too hot, Mars too cold, and the Earth is just like you need.
You can see the images behind me where life can survive in our sun.
It's a problem like "House and three dogs," it's so simple that a child can understand it.
However, I'd like to remind you two things from the same story, that maybe you don't think about a lot of but I think they're very relevant here.
Number one: If the poem of a sad artist is too expensive when it comes into the room, does it mean it always happened too much?
Or can it be that there's an external temperature in some other time?
It's the same thing that we're getting into the room and you're doing the answer that we're getting in a story.
And it's true about planets.
They're not static things.
They change. They're ridiculous. They're open.
And Technologists are in the same way.
I'll give you an example.
Here's one of my favorite images of Mars.
It's not the most fundamental, not the most recent, but it's a picture that's a photographic mirror of the planet's surface of the planet, the French of the dinosaurs by dinosaurs, the walls that takes them hundreds or thousands of years or thousands of years to go.
And it can't happen on Mars today.
The atmosphere of Mars today is too good and too much happened to be stuck as a liquid.
This one picture tells you that the atmosphere of Mars has changed, and it changed a significant way.
And she changed from a situation that we would define the gallery, because three trials for life were there for a long time.
Where is this atmosphere that enables water to be dinosaurs on the surface?
One poem is that it's going to go out to the sound.
Sotheater proteins got enough energy to remove the road of the planet, take out to space, and never come back.
And it's happening with every body with a theater.
The stars they have the walls that they're a very boundary reminder to the atmosphere process.
But it's also the atmosphere that's taken over time, and it's also for teachers and Earth.
It's just a matter of scale and scale.
So we'd like to figure out how much material is over time so we can explain this change.
How do atmosphere limit their energy for the health?
How do proteins get enough energy to win?
There are two ways, if you look a little bit.
First of all, light is the sun.
The light that's taken from the sun can be scared by the atmosphere proteins and get the proteins.
Yes, I'm Robert, but they're -- Laughter) God's going to be done, not even in my understanding.
And they get enough energy to win and reduce a star of the planet's planet's land just.
Another way they can get energy is solar.
They're particles, a message, a material, that's taken from the surface of the sun, and they're planning through our solar system at a speed of 400 miles per second, sometimes faster in solar suits, and they're spending through space between planets and the planets and the atmosphere, and they're going to provide energy to wind
It's something I'm interested in, because it's communicating to life.
So I mentioned that there's two things about the story of the same and the three dogs that I want to bring to your heart and remind you, and the other one is a little bit more sophisticated.
If Dad's success is too sick, and the success of an artist is too late, is the success of a child who doesn't even happen if we keep the gene?
The thing that you've got with is your entire life, maybe not so simple, when you think about it a little bit more.
And of course, from a planet's star from the sun is causing its temperature.
It's got to have to do with a selection of life.
But maybe there's other things that we need to take a math.
Maybe it's the foreign forests that are also helping the result in the story, what's exactly going on.
So I could talk to you about many features of these three planets that may be affected in a living environment, but by the very profound reasons of my research and the fact that I'm going to be here and you're not -- Laughter) I'd like to talk to you just talk to a minute or two samples.
The Earth has such a fact that's going to move and Mars don't.
The genetic points are created in the great inner line of a planet by an electricity of a liquid material that's created a huge genetic gene that represents the Earth.
If you have an artist, you know what it's because it's the North.
Again and Mars don't have this.
If you've got an exception on a roof or Mars, good luck, you're losing.
[] Is it affecting the environment of life?
Well, how can it affect?
Many scientists think that the genetic field of a planet is used as a gene for the atmosphere, a solar protein in around the planet a little bit like a effect of a power that's connected to the electricity of these proteins.
I'm talking about it to the rock of stars for planets to define because of the mistakes.
Laughter) And yes, my colleagues who've been looking at it later, that's the first time in the history of our community that's been a solar wind to the conversation.
Laughter) So the effect, if, it's the Earth maybe it's been fair for billions of years, because we had a genetic field.
The atmosphere couldn't win.
Mars, on the other hand, it wasn't fair because he didn't have a genetic field, and for billions of years, maybe enough atmosphere becomes a way to make a great car to live in a planet that we see today.
Otherwise scientists think that genetic institutions may be used like a boat's temperature, and we'll allow the planet to be more attractive than the suicide energy than it could be affected and not those points.
The rules can collect energy from the wind.
The genetic field can collect energy from the wind that enables more atmosphere to happen.
It's an idea that you need to look at it, but the impact and how it works in teachers.
It's because we know that energy from the wind wind is affected in the atmosphere here in the planet. This energy is getting over the genetic corporation and down into the small axis.
And in the medicine, it's an expression of the amazing mammogram in the biograph.
If you've ever experienced it, it's amazing.
We know the energy comes in.
We're trying to measure some proteins come out and if the genetic field affects it in some way.
So I got here a problem for you, but I don't still have a solution.
We don't have a solution.
But we're working on it. How do we work on it?
Well, we've sent space for all three planets.
Some of them are already killing around them now, including the MAVA space that's right now around Mars, and I'm involved in this project that's driving here, by the University of Cordo.
It's designed to measure an atmosphere.
We've got similar policies and the Earth.
Once we've got all of our institutions, we're able to take all of them together, and we can understand what the magnitude of the three planets of the planet with their space, with their environment.
And we can decide if genetic institutions are important to life or not.
Once you have this answer, why do you care?
I care deep...
And as well, but deep.
So first of all, the answer to this question will teach us more about these three stars, the Earth and the Mars, not just about their regulation with their environment today, but about how they were billions of years ago, whether they were worried about a long time or not.
It's going to teach us about this atmosphere that enables us and those are the next one to us.
But more than that, what we're going to learn from these planets can be there on the atmosphere everywhere, including planets that we're now watching around other stars.
For instance, the space vehicle, which was built from here in Blue, the exact area in the size of the size of a blog in the sky, two years, and he found thousands of planets -- in the size of a bank in the sky that we don't think it's special than any other part of the sky.
In the 20 years, we've gone to know about planets outside our sun system, to know about so much, that we don't know what they're going to explore before.
Everything is going to help.
Actually, on the basis of expectations that's going to take a little bit of other similar expectations, we now believe that in 200 billion stars in the galaxy that's only the space, on average, every planet has one planet at least.
In addition, we wait that between 40 and 100 billion of these planets are going to be treated in life, just in our galaxy.
We have the expectations of these planets, but we just don't know what they're going to be dead.
It's like to be in the point of a similar point -- and you know that there's other violence out there and want to know more about them, to want to explore them and find out if maybe only one or two of them are a little bit like you.
You can't do it. You can't move there, still not.
So you've got to use tools that's under the screen, the Earth and Mars, and you've got to put them on these other states, and you've got to buy environments out of the data, and you're going to put the best components to the planet, and that's not.
In the end, and I'm at least, it's our red point, right here.
It's the only planet that we know that I'm going to live, even though we're very close and forth to know about more.
But in the time, it's the only great planet for life, and it's our red point.
I'm very happy that we are here.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's a forest in fact by a person.
It can spread on a lot of predators of the wind, or it can fit in a small surface -- a little bit like your university.
Every one of these forests is just two years old.
I have a forest in the back of my house.
It's a huge biological motion.
I'm going to win it every morning, like San Francisco.
So I'm an artist that's enabled these forests in a professional way.
We've gone to actions, to experience, to schools, homes, freedom, public buildings and even genius to get one of these forests.
The forest is not a devastated version of the land where animals live together.
The forest can be an intuitive part of our interview.
The forest, for me, it's such a place in the trees that you can't just go into.
It doesn't matter how big or small they are.
Most of the world where we live today was a forest.
It was before human intervention.
So we built our cities on these forests, like San France, and we're also happy to nature, like 8.4 million other species on the planet.
Our animal environment has stopped being our natural animal environment.
But no longer for some of us.
Some other people and I create these foreign forests -- anywhere.
I'm an industrial engineer.
I'm looking at cars.
I've been working on my previous work, I've learned how to move natural resources into products.
For example, we're going to jump the skin of the body tree, put it into the body of the gas and create a mirror -- the product.
But these products can't become natural choice again.
We've reduced the elements from nature and we've shown them to an invisible situation.
It's an industrial production.
The nature, on the other hand, works in a completely powerful way.
The natural system represents by connecting elements, atom after atoms.
All the natural products become natural resources again.
It's something I've learned when I've created a forest in the back of my house.
And it was the first time I worked with nature, instead of working in India.
Since then, we created 75 forests in the world.
Every time we're working in a new place, we're finding that every student that has to create a forest around us.
Everything we need to do is connect these elements and give nature to a quote.
To create a forest we start with the ground.
We're moving, feel and even arguing it to identify what insects have.
If the land is made of small proteins, it becomes a constant -- so smoke, you can't wait in.
We're a local biomatus that's in the environment, that can help the land become more convenient.
Now water can now wait in.
If alma doesn't have the capacity to keep water, we're going to have another biomatus -- some coal materials like a cat, so the land can keep the water and the rest of it.
To grow, plants need water, light and materials.
What if Alema doesn't have the magic materials that she needs?
We don't just add a direction from a direction to the ground.
It would be the industrial way.
It goes against nature.
Instead, we're collecting organisms to the ground.
They're producing the magazines in a natural level.
They're educated by the line that we've done in the ground, so everything they need to do is eat and culture.
And when you put a rain, the land starts to fit again.
It return to life.
We explore the local trees of the place.
How do we decide what local and not?
Well, what you've got before human intervention is local.
It's usually simple.
We're exploring the National French to discover the last questions of natural forest.
We're exploring the emotions of emotions, or according to academic forestations around women.
And if we don't find something at all, we're going to go to the genes to see objects or a tree of objects that were there for a long time.
We've been exploring old creatures, trees and collections of the place, to identify the kinds of trees that behave there.
Once we know our objects, we're bringing them into a quarter of a variety of different features: the strength, the tree of trees and the language.
We're spending the relationship of the layer, and then we decide the liquid of every species of a tree in a cave.
If we're creating a privilege, we're reducing the liquid of French trees.
It could be a gold forest, a forest that's been spending a lot of birds and bees, or it can be just green to local.
We're collecting the arms and we're looking at the hands of them.
We're worrying that the trees that behave to the same environment that we don't use one other, another they're going to get on the same space because they grow up.
We're sharing a near one to two.
On the surface, we're repeating a return of a globe, so when a hot outside the ground remains.
When it's cold, it's made as a bird just goes on the road, so the land can still be there in a time that's out of the tree.
The land is very consuming -- so consumption, that the sensors can go into it, quickly.
At the beginning, the forest doesn't look like it's growing, but it's growing under the surface.
In the first three months, the sensors come into a meter of a meter.
These sensors create a conference, which is that music is spending the ground.
microbes and tricks live in the web.
So if some materials don't exist in the tree of the tree, these microbes will move the materials into the tree.
When you're out there, you're in a way, you're going to have a five-hicle.
And it means that land under there's a healthy network.
Once the sensors are based on, the forest starts to grow on the surface.
When the forest is growing, we continue to change it -- for the next two years, we're using the forest.
We want to keep all the water and the materials are just going to treat, so we're leaving dogs that grow up on the ground.
When the forest is growing, it remains the sun.
The end of the forest becomes so convenient that the sun can't get to the background.
Women can't grow now, because they also need light.
At this point, every threatening of water that's taken into the forest doesn't go back to the atmosphere.
This graph forest is causing the air to the wind and revealing the doors.
We're focused on the top and eventually producing the forest.
And even without the crowd, the forest budget left to her and sometimes even fair.
Now, when a single tree is treated on the forest, it's immediately starting to train.
This airplane comes out of the virus, which is food in the forest.
When the forest is growing, more trees are treated on the ground -- and it means that more virus is created, and it means more food so the forest can grow more.
And this forest is going to grow an axis.
And once you put them in, these forests will take themselves over and over again -- probably for the future.
In a natural forest like this, unfortunate is the best device.
It's a jungle of jungle.
So this forest is growing as a collective.
If those objects -- the same species -- they would be used in France, they wouldn't grow so fast.
And so we create a 100 years in just 10 years.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
"Oh, who are these people?"
It was a young question about it, when it was about three years old.
We've been around with one of the Greek and the big, of his father's father.
It's going to look at a huge tremendous tree in the middle of the Nigerian.
It was affected by the three leaders of the Arab Institute.
When she scared me, I was proud and I added a question of the Israeli leaders who worked hard to develop their own country and put her sister.
She's a question, "Oh, why do we live, and in the design, where Saraha and the adults, we're never seeing images of strong women on the walls?
It's because women are not important? "
It's probably, the most difficult question I've been going to answer in my daughter as a teacher, and most of 16 years of the professional life.
I grew up in the city of my birthday, the young people between two victims to the wall and the manager's operation of the green, and if you've been a very, very sold and a grandmother.
My dad is going to leave me and my sister to the education even though in our culture at the same time, and they're not the ones that need to be a professional motion.
I've been between one of the single girls in my parents who've spent the house at 18 to learn in "Don't."
My father wasn't a son, so I, how he was, I became us.
Now, after a few decades, I hope I was able to make my dad into a son who could have.
While I've got a first and a cartoon in electricity engineer, I've been working in the research and open in Britain, and in the Middle East, I've always been in the environments that's going to look at "men."
In fact, I've never found a public model that I could really identify with.
My mother's generation wasn't in a business leader.
There were a couple of men who were scared by me in the way, but no one of them didn't know the requirements and the trees that I was faced.
And despite women who love to give us, the conventional values and dignity, objects, they live different animals with different objects.
So women's Western girls had to make a model of themselves.
We had to record more than Western men, and we had to deal with more cultural conversations in the West.
As a result, I'd like to think of our own, the primary women and the agencies, there's actually useful skills to share, teachers that we've learned in the same way.
Here's three of my own.
[]]]]]]]]]] "[" "]" ["]]
So what's just a wonderful, and how do you take it?
I believe that a wonderful concept is just the capacity to make "fuel."
In my previous work, before my current society, I worked with a man called John.
I've send a team to a team with John, and I've worked hard, I'm going to notice how amazing I'm, and I'm going to support me in the past.
In addition to my work in the projects of a summer, I wrote a look at the economic instruments of women.
One day, I've got to show my research in a room full of students to avoid.
JA was in the audience and listening to the first time of my research.
While I came up with my invention, I saw June at the end of the eye.
His woke became a fair and he decided under his chair in in what looks like a woman.
I've finished my invention to buy a lot of answers from the audience and we've put out and we've gone to Twitter.
That's where it's spread.
"What's you've been there was not scared!
You're not active. "
I said to him "June, I don't understand.
I've made a couple of inequations of modern equality, and some curiosity on the Arab world.
Yes, today we're really at the bottom of the instrument, but what did I say, "I realized that I didn't work?"
And that's a June, "All of your research is wrong.
What you're doing is a way to society and read our social tissue of society. "
He's Henry, and he's added, "When women have children, their place is at home."
The time was going to go from a long time, and everything I could think and repeat it in the galaxy that I had in this brain: "You can forget from the participation in society, night.
It will never happen. "
It took me a few days to record this crisis and means her, but when I realized, I got to three curiosity.
One, his question was his problems, his environments.
Maybe there's a lot of like it in our society, but in life I wouldn't have to become my own rights.
Two, I need a new scanner, and quickly.
And I found one, by the way, and it was great.
And three, I'd be able to show you what women with children can do.
I imagine this lesson at the same time in my personal life.
Within my career in my career, I've heard a lot of Iraq, but a lot of times I've also come up with women, men, men, and I've probably been a problem with me and I've been talking about it, we've been reduced for two teenagers.
For instance, a good arm, which tells you directly in my family meeting, or with friends, really, you know that you're not a good mother, at the beginning of how much you're doing in your career, right?
I'm going to say that these words don't stop.
My kids are the most expensive thing to me, and the thought I'm feeding them, in any way it's inevitable.
But just like I did with John, very quickly I mentioned myself a question of their problems, their environments.
So instead of the answer, I've been living my biggest sand, and I saw, in the wall of the globe, the next one in my life.
[Hey]]]]]]]]]]]]] [Hi]]]] &
You can decide to face the negative message that goes on you, give them to make you feel like a failure, which is too hard in life, or that you can choose to see that the third of others is their problem, and make it into your personal part.
I've learned to go always on the other option, and I've found that it's going to give me a blueprint.
And that's true what you say: success is the best action.
Women in the Middle East has enough to be pregnant to someone who is on their career.
CA: I need to say, "Well, enough," because the decision with who's going to come up with you, and you're going to get with somebody who's going to use you if you're a long career.
Yet today, the Arab Research doesn't make any equal at home.
The company just doesn't expect it, and you can see something that doesn't exist.
And for the Arab Arab, the society is still revealing that its personal crisis for happiness has to be happiness and the bridge of her children and her husband.
It's particularly there for her family.
Things change, but it will take time.
Right now, it means that a Western woman needs to keep a perfect house, treat all of her children's values, and manage her business career.
In order to define this, I discovered in the hard way, you need to apply the professional capacity, which is conducted in the West, in the personal life.
You need to work on your life.
And so I do this in my personal life.
One thing you need to know about the Middle East is that a little bit of every family has access to a great help.
The challenge, for that, becomes how to raise activity.
Just as I was doing in the professional life, I spent the choice in my house to help me with my children when I was at work on a powerful basis.
Stin worked in my sister four years, and her job quality was based on.
It's now a unfinished part of our family, it's with us since it was six months old.
It's worried that the house is going to take some of my work, and I'm worried to get it in the best conditions for her and my kids, just as I was doing at work to the most familiar work.
This lesson is going to take every theater on children's treatment, if I'm a village, children, a budget in a style that's playing it with someone else.
A lot of speed, and it's very powerful.
If you look at my blog this year, you'll see that every single day of an hour and a half, from 19: 30 in the Western Arab Arab, there's no longer a family. "
It's a little bit of time.
I did it since she had a baby.
I'm doing all I can keep this time to get home and spend time with my kids, ask them on their day, to look at home, to read them a story before the conversation, and give them a lot of boss and wearing.
If I'm in business business, it doesn't matter what I'm going to return, I'm a company with my children in Scott even if I'm in a lot of kilometers from there.
Our son is five years old, and he's learning a fundamental and a basic math.
Here's another Video: Our daughter is actually more successful than me to teach it.
But it started as a game, but it likes to play as a teacher of a little animal, and I found that these lessons really improve the library of their lights, reduce the responsibility of it, and reduce the context of them, so it's a success in any sense.
The Arab Western women that I know, found their unique approach to work on their lives while they continue to reduce their writing of responsibility in the house.
But the cloud isn't just the ability to survive in the two jobs as a career and a mother.
It's also the ability to be in hope.
When I'm with my kids, I'm trying to leave the work out of our lives.
Instead of worry about a few minutes I can spend with them every day, I'm focusing on these patterns to uncomfortable, emotions that I see my kids, hear them.

It explains, I think, in some way, why the number of women in politics in the Arab world is so low.
But the solution of this is that we've spent a lot of time in social development behind the dogs, in Kenya, in the window, in the phone, social ability that is important to succeed: Nankota.
I would say that the average Arab woman has a big network of friends and villages.
Back of women.
In the West, we're going to think that women's developing themselves, often, for other women, hopefully we've been able to be the most successful woman in the room.
It's led to behavior that's most likely to talk about, creative behavior between professionals.
If there's just a place for one woman in a mirror, then you can't go to other people, and you may not support the success.
Women Western, in general, we wouldn't have this psychological code.
Actually, with a typical company, they found that by one individual help for a second, they're all extended.
In the previous job, I was the worst woman in the Middle East, so you can think that the investment in women who worked with me wouldn't bring a lot of solutions and instead I had to invest my time in developing classes with men and men.
But two of my biggest success happened because of other women's support.
It was the internet of the marketplace that first invented my colleagues as a young leader in the world's global economy.
It's made my interest in communication and my privacy, and when they asked her, she'd access my name.
It was a young, a Saudi woman and a company, who helped me sell my first project in Saudi Arabia, a market I had to go into as a woman.
She made me one clip, and this service led to the first project from many of me in Saudi Arabia.
Today, there's two women in my team in my team, and for their success is important to my success.
Women continue to move around the world, not enough quickly, but we move forward.
It's also the Arab world, despite many communities in the last time.
Only this year, the highest Arab possibilities have five women to make a role in the clinic, which is all about eight.
It's almost 28 percent of the student, and more than a lot of countries can argue to the right.
Today, that's the worst picture about my daughter.
It's the result of an amazing leader, but also a result of powerful Western Western women who don't wait and continue to expand the boundaries.
That's the result of Western women who are looking at every day, like me, to become "Twitter, working on their lives and leave the work out of their lives, and one of the forces instead of conducting.
When I'm watching the future, my hope for my daughter when she's going on this stage in 20 years, 30 years from now it's going to be able to read the stage of a mother, like she's going to be in her father's daughter.
My customers for me is that, for his mother's school or "a kid's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother'll be completely different meaning.
Thank you.
Thank you.
This is my life.
What's going to me.
It's an hour of nine months.
An doctor, Asia won.
When I'm going to go to college, the jobs of the theory will look completely different.
In 2013, researchers at the University of Oxford have studied the future of work.
They've made a little bit of one in two, a high high high high school to go to a mammogram.
The machine learning is the technology that's responsible for this song.
It's a lot of prosperity in the artificial intelligence.
It allows the machines to learn from data and make some of the things that do humans.
My company, "Kig," works in the front side of the machine learning.
We spend hundreds of thousands of experts in the goal to solve problems for industry and academic.
It gives us a unique perspective about what features are able to do, what they don't be able to do and what jobs work will be autonomous or find in risk.
The machine learning started to do the industry in the early '90s.
First of very simple techniques.
Things like the Scientist School, please give up to the mystery, a minute by reading the dance of code says.
In the last few years, we've been reduced by mathematics.
The machine learning can now be a lot of complex techniques.
In 2012, "Kig" started her community for a challenge: build an algorithm that can give the bees of bees in the high school.
The cool algorithms have been able to give the signals to those of human teachers.
Last year, we made a more difficult challenge.
Can you take a eyes and look at a eyes of a eyes called the Social Turkey?
Again, the partnership algorithms were able to move in their homes to those of human interest.
Today, with the right data, the machines are able to go in their eyes on people in these techniques.
A teacher can read 10,000 bees in a 40-year career.
Social professors can look at 50,000 eyes.
A machine can read millions of bees or look at millions of eyes in minutes.
We don't have a chance to contract against machines in doing a high cost of power.
But there are things that we can do and machines -- not.
The machines were very, very little deal with new situations.
They can't treat things that didn't see before.
The secret limits of the machine learning is going to be used for her need to learn big data's data.
Not so human beings.
We're able to connect between fantastic ideas to communicate, to list, to solve problems that we've met.
French France was a physicist who opened out of the "5th century," and he saw that the Nigerian remains his collapse.
He knew to move between his daughter in a electronic clinic and his knowledge in a song to invent -- someone knows?
It's an extraordinary example of creativity.
But it's such a imagination that happens to all of us in small events of thousands of times a day.
The machines don't be able to compare us when it's based on new situations, and it's defining human communities that are going to do autism.
So what does this mean in the future of work?
The future of every choice and training in the answer to one question: How much is it going to be able to go into a high-tech tasks, and how much is it going to deal with new situations?
In a high selection, the machines are getting rid and fun.
Today they're left bees, they're losing certain diseases.
In the next few years, they're going to build our collective curiosity, and we're going to call the cartoons of the rules.
There's still no need to be an instrument, and in Demon.
They're still going to be conducted to a complex, complex and extinction, but the machines are going to reduce their survival.
And they're going to make their work places.
As I mentioned, the machines didn't get very careful in new situations.
It's the necessary of the marketing journey needs to keep the attention of the consumption.
It's about switch.
A business strategy means pollution in the market, a thing that doesn't do.
People are people who are trying to create the wedding journey, and they've also changed our business strategy.
So yesterday, what I don't want to do, we'll live every day to bring a new challenge.
So it's going to be, you'll have a solution on the machines.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Imagine you're a product designer.
And you're a product, a new kind of product, called the human vaccine system.
You're bringing the product to a psychiatric, decision and mobile.
Let's call it a blog.
I think we're all familiar with at least one bubble, right?
How would you see the conversation?
Back, I have a great idea to a completely new kind of human health product.
It's called the human vaccine system.
I can see when you have a problem with it.
Don't worry, I know it's complex.
I don't want to take you through all the detailed details, I just want to tell you about some of the amazing machines of this product.
First of all, it's using some choices by which it has millions of pounds of every component -- refugees, blood cells -- before they're used to actually create a tremendous tree against the unemployment.
And it's used to look at the direction of the direction that it has not only to refugees but also DNA cells, natural diversity cells, genomes.
The features are not really important.
The point is that fear, this direction of different attitudes can deal less or more with everything that evolution would be able to train our lives.
And the design is completely unconscious.
You've got the surface of the human skin, you've got the decline system that's at high speed and then you've got a very, very popular system.
The point is, if one system is used, another can take control, create a almost perfect system.
I think I'm going to lose you, a blog, but I'm the rest of me, because the amazing machine really is.
It's made itself completely.
It's actually able to develop genomes from early to the water that it's not even seen before.
It's actually doing it in an extraordinary speech, identical and responding to every tiny threat, and more than that, remember every day, in the case that you'll ever be easy again.
What I offer you today is actually not a product that is about itself.
The product is motivated in the largest system of the human body, and it works in a perfect corporation with this system, to create an unprecedented level of biological gene.
So in the bar, just tell me in the states, what do you think about my product?
And in the sand may say something like, I really appreciate the effort and the passion that investment in this camera, it's got a list -- but in the states, it's a teacher.
You see that the key to your product is that it's not effective and very complex.
We didn't teach you 805?
And more than that, you say the product is perfect.
He's responding to the response, spending things inside the progress and it's actually designed for someone else's face.
I'm sorry to tell you this, but I don't think that this product is opening.
If we go with the philosophy of a bank, I think we're actually a more effective system.
And activity is always important in the short term.
It's less complex, more efficient, and it's more efficient for the money.
Who can tell it not?
Unfortunately, there's one small problem, and it's that the user of this product, you're or I, we've probably been out in a week starting with the next page, when we're going to be a new finger of an effect.
I first started interested in biology and businesses, and privilege days, when I asked an extraordinary question by CEO's Center's Center.
And the question was: What should we do to make sure that our society will continue to exist 100 years?
It's a lower question, but in fact, it's a little bit more complicated than you're going to think, at the beginning of the average societies of public companies in the United States can get to a life of only 30 years.
It's less than a life expectancy of life that's working in the society that's quite likely to be reduced.
Now, if you were the CEO of such a company, that the investigations offer you, and you're fighting in changes, we've been uncomfortable that you don't worry about what's going to happen in 30 years.
But, here's something you have to leave you in the night: your companies won't be in the environment in five years, on average, is now about 32 percent.
I mean, it's a chance of one to three that control in your society will take or that society's made just five years.
Let's go back to the question of our CEO.
Where's better to find a tree than in nature, that's in the buildings of life and much more years from any other society?
Sologist for the past, I decided I've always been interested in real biologist, my friends of Sylin, a professor of biology and math at the University of Frankton.
Together, we looked at a variety of biological systems, from natural genes to the forests, and the diversity of fish.
And we asked ourselves the question: What does these systems make these brilliant and profit?
And what we've found was that the same web that we saw in the end of this instrument of the human immune system actually judges over and over again.
We've actually seen these principles in biological systems, we've found them also very, very social properties that allow years.
We've also been looking at business, and we've found that really the same features as well as businesses who were peers and had long years, and we've noticed that they've gone from those who didn't kill days.
Let's first look at what happened when the immune system of the corner was read.
This beautiful building is a part of the academic academic that's in Oklaa, Japan.
In fact, it's one of the best actors in Japan.
He was built by a Korean artist, because at the same time, Japan didn't have a lot of women.
And it's this original artist looking for a company to build a brilliant.
Obviously, his company, Chicago, was still in the environment, 1,428 years later.
In fact, it became the most powerful society in the world.
So what's the situation of Congress today?
Not so good, I'm afraid.
She's got money in a way during the morning period of the old economy, to invest in the GDP.
And when the button was shocked, she couldn't get back the loans.
Her company, and the control was taken by a big building company.
In addition, after 40 generations of a very rapidly rapid, by the France of Cano, Canada went into the middle of the environment to put the speed of the speed.
And if you're already talking about a company's failure: we all know the failure of the academic company, the company that's affected by the February in January 2012.
But what's more interesting, is the question: Why is a Piji company -- with the same product, the same technology from digital technology, and at the same time -- why's Jay's been able to survive and make sure?
Piji Philipes used her capacity in chemistry, science, and in optimistics to live in a range of areas, local way through a privacy, and to train medicine and biological consumption.
How many of these experiments have failed.
But in September, the company has been able to fit itself and its platform in a way to survive and prove.
Like the Mr. School, Mr. Muki, the strategy was succeeded because she had "more chemicals," than lucks.
It's an action, of course, they've been able to make more possibilities than the players.
Fajihad saw because she would show up the speed of speed, direction and proud.
Social musician in the page, like this is what we see here, a liquid device, in one evening, the only park that's trying to fly the scans into the roads of the vehicles.
It's the athetics of the athetics to the San.
The vehicles are reduced in the water.
So how is it, if, Tonya was able to fix the train of the car?
Can you imagine how long it took?
Just four days.
In a situation where they didn't have any of them in the water to get a full of five days.
How is it possible?
Tonyota took her network through this collaborative network that she could work very quickly and very part with her books to change her more creature, to change the boundary boundaries of stimulating to the water and to bring back the car back to the air.
Tonota will bring the principles of mortality in its particular chain, the techniques in the system and the functioning system to be able to change more, in a part of the boundaries there.
Now unfortunately, a number of companies have been after small categories.
But we're called a paper every day about companies that are used in the sense of technology.
So, how is it that the consumption of the optimistics of Alexis is able to avoid technology and even ensure?
And yet, technology is not just a big deal in software and electronics.
Alexander has been reduced by an artificial environment for possible technology.
It's most of these technologies at a very early point, before they're focused on or before the players have gone around, and then it's under these technologies itself, even in a range of failure or a crisis of self-esteem.
Alexis remained in her remote level, and Cambia is coming out of the general over 40 years, by using the principles of speed and extended.
Well, if these principles are so powerful, you might think, why don't they talk about business?
Why don't we use these words every day?
Well, change needs first to start in the head.
If we go back to our partner, in the goal to put the principles that make the magic of the human vaccine, we have to first think differently about business.
Unfortunately, when we think about business, we use what I call an anthropologist. "
We're offering goals, we're developing problems, we're building programs and games in them, and more than anything else, we're put an effective effective and safe effect.
And don't get me wrong -- it's a great way, great and it's going to deal with very simple things in the environment that it's relative.
It's the way in the song -- and it's probably many of us, including me -- I've been looking at most of the business problems that we're going to be able to use every day.
In fact, it was a pretty good modern model for businesses -- in general -- until, about the intervention of the mortality of global civilization and the technology and the atmosphere has made a lot of businesses to be much more dynamic and unexpected.
But what about more dynamic and unexpected that we're getting more and more and more today?
I think in another way of thinking, we've got to now control the ecosystems of biological thinking, our principles in our principles.
In other words, we need to think more in actions and discover about how and how we can design, instead of control, complex and unemployment.
It's a little bit like the difference between a planet and a bird.
The ball will be on a bridge, close to the right direction, and the bird means not.
So what do you think?
It sounds a little bit not a little bit of athetic, maybe?
No.
Each small, natural society thinks and work in biological way.
Why?
Because it's missing the resources to its environment through the bad power.
It's missing the scale to stop change, and it's all the time you think about the hard risks that there's a telescope to survive.
The Iranian is, of course, that every big company started as a small company, beautiful.
But over the way, somehow, many of them lost the ability to think and act biological.
They need to reinvent their ability to think biological in the goal to survive and prove in the environment of today.
So let's not just think about the performance in the short term.
Every company I know is a long time in thinking about the main strategy: How good is our creative game?
In addition, let's take a look at the other question, the more biological and profound in its own choice: How long is this game?
Thank you.
Thank you.
You know, one of the things I'd like to say from my head is that I'm here really wrong.
I mean, not at TED, but I'm at this point in my life, really at the end of a collection of cases I've really been looking at them as mistakes.
But what I'd like to talk to you about today is maybe the way we can use technology to make these mistakes often happen.
Because I really believe, when I look back on how I found myself in such a mistake that technology has made a significant role.
So what I'd like to do today is tell you a little bit about myself, because I'd like to put out what I'm going to tell you.
And I think you'll see why the two big answers of my life today are children and education.
And as soon as I put this to communicate, I'm going to tell you a little bit about technology: Why do I believe technology is enabling a powerful tool that can help us go to these challenges.
And then, on the damage that France reminded, that we decided to go to AMD, we call 15 pounds.
And then back to the beginning, and I'm going to tell you a little bit more, and hopefully convinced you, I believe in the world today, it's very important that the industry doesn't just have an idea of what business represent but they're going to have an answer about what's really significant.
So with all of this, first of all, let me tell you, I'm one of six children. I'm the top, the rest of women.
So I grew up in a family of women.
I learned a lot of how to deal with this side of the world.
And as you can imagine, if you were able to draw the next picture: I was born in a small village in Mexico, in a very poor environment for unfortunately, and my parents didn't have the education on a car.
But I'm lucky to like this, and that's how I'm also a cultural event.
It shows you the importance of my parents were trying to education.
My parents were convenient in all the lines of learning, and I'll come back to that later.
But one of the things I've been scared at a early point to learning, and a huge curiosity that was reduced as a child, was the technology that you see here -- the prototype.
My father found it in the rainforest, and he was able to fix it and make it work, and in this way, in an interview of how it was so aware of what's going on in the world -- but by the way I invited me to sit with him when I was just a child, and by organizing a prototype of prototype, and he would tell me how the script would understand all of the
He'd explain me about the Amazon that Amazon, and how he's invented Hollywood that was so famous around the world.
And I've also told me a little bit about history, when you've invented the Atlantic in 1812 of Chicakky on the little prototype, and he told me about Russia and all of the things that were happening in Broada and why this music is, in some ways, a small piece of history.
And even as a child, he was able to get a lot of curiosity.
And you may have this product doesn't look like an academic technology, but if you imagine the period of it all happened -- these were the middle of the '70s -- it was certainly, on his investment, an academic piece of technology.
So one of the things that we've been critical to try to get out of this experience, is that in another time, people ask me and say, "Well, how did you get to your parents when you were a child?"
And I'm always going to say they were terrible with me.
And you don't forget in the sense of people think about it, when your parents do you or support you every time.
They were happy in the sense that when I grew up, my mom and my father always told me, very important to remember two things.
First of all, when you're going to sleep at night, you've got to look back on the day that's scared and feel that today's going to do something, and that's all you can do it in a good way.
And the second thing they always said: And we're going to win you, which doesn't matter where you or where you go, you're always going to do the right thing.
Now, I don't know how many of you have ever done it with your children, but if, please look at me, it's the biggest pressure you can operate on a child, say -- Laughter) -- we're going to take you to do the right thing.
When I went with my friend to the lab, I've always been aware of those words -- but very, very, very, one of the things that happened with technology is that it can help just if it's wrong, of course, but it's also got access, and it's probably likely.
And in the world today, transparency, meeting and price is probably not necessarily a lot of technologies that are created today.
So, one of the answers in our society, and now one of my privacy answers, is to be able to work really hard to make the technology into the imagination, access and environment.
And for me, it's really, really critical.
Today, technology has changed many since the prototype.
You know, today we have, of course, powerful computers in an extraordinary way.
A huge thing that people now call a program about is the Internet.
Although, if we talk about states, we don't believe that the Internet is actually a program.
What we do believe is that the Internet, if we say it in the states, is connection between people and ideas.
The Internet is just the crisis where people and ideas are connected.
And the power of people and ideas can be quite amazing.
And so, we believe that through all of these changes that have happened, we're faced with a huge opportunity.
If we can communicate the people and ideas in a more intuitive way -- and although you've seen a crisis, and you don't know products that go into the market, the exciting thing to me is how many of those products are able to provide people who's products, in a very useful way, convenient way, and it's more likely to call
So, we said we'd like, let's allow it. We'd like to create a blueprint.
And a few years ago in AMD, we put the idea, what if we're trying to create the damage that we call 15 pounds, where we're left, that by 2015, half of the world will be connected to the Internet so that people and ideas can communicate.
We knew we couldn't do it for us, and in no way, we wouldn't mean that we're in AMD would do it alone.
We've always felt because this thing could happen with partners with governments, industry, education institutions, which is an engagement of companies and honesty.
So it's certainly an invention, if you want to think about it in this way, but we felt that we had to take a serious goal in the next few years, it was going to move enough and treat us to treat all of us to think about ways to do things in a different way.
And I'm going to come back in a minute, because I think the results were so awesome, and I can just expect to be normal about what I think is going to happen in the next eight years, when we get to the next 2015.
Where are we today?
It's a year in a year. It's coming from our friends in G.com.
These of you who have never been expected to their website, you should. It's very exciting. And you can see how the Internet diabetes changed over the years.
And when we got this piece, we said well, where we're on the goal that we've built 2015, the thing that we've been based on three parts.
One is the Western world, the definition is basically based on Western Europe and the United States, the advanced progress.
The theories in these parts of the world is really intuitive and continue to evolve.
And if you're going to talk about seriously, we think it's impossible to go to 100 percent, even before the time of 2015, in other parts of developing countries, like India and China, the progress was good -- it was good, but in places that don't expect, places like Africa, South America and other places in the world, the progress was pretty slow, in fact,
I had the opportunity to have a discussion with the president of a bicycle, and one of the things that we've talked is, what's going to prevent the theories to move faster?
And one of the reasons is, in South Africa, the sensor of a space is about 100 dollars.
It's impossible, even in the United States, to pay on this price, to enable the possibility of a series that we can get to.
So, we've been talking about ways where there's going to be possible for collaboration to reduce technology price.
So, when you look at this transformation, you look at the end -- it's a mammography of the horizontal light -- you look at the end: we have a very long way to get to 2015 with the age of 50 percent.
But we're excited in our society; we're a teenager.
We really think it's a fantastic process of things, which is pushing us to do different things, and we expect a day that we can really work with so many partners around the world, to get to the goal.
Now, one of the things I'd like to explain about 15 pounds, which I think is critical, is because it's not a minute.
It's certainly a business project.
Let's take a little plan, from the unhappy world, and we call it the education market.
When we look at children at the age of the Saudi school, we have hundreds of hundreds of millions of children around the world that can produce huge solutions from being connected to the Internet.
So when we see it, we see an opportunity to have a business business that's going to be able to wait for the wall.
And when we started the beauty, just from the beginning, we said it's clear: it's not a minute.
It's really a business project, that's what's called to the most challenging challenge of the market.
Because what we've learned in the last three years is that this marketplace, whether it's education or in a common country, no matter, that it's a very high quality of quality, high price, lower and a lot of challenges, without doing it, and I'm going to be very hard to understand it, and I'm going to explain it in a minu
It's a beauty that's focused on simple human solutions and women.
What we're going to mean is, you know, in the machines, the personal computer was found in 1980 or less, and in 20 years, it didn't change.
It's still, in the places, a fabric or a black box, and it also looks the same thing.
And again in the states -- and I know that sometimes I'm going to spend some of my customers when I say, and I really mean that -- if you'd put the name of the computer, it's going to be very hard to jump it, because they're all very sophisticated but they're all different.
So it wasn't still access that the person in the central is that there was a fabric to this market, so we really believe it's critical to think about it.
It reminds me a lot of conversations that we've heard in the morning, on the same corporation of surgery that was just about Africa.
We're talking about something very similar here.
It's based on a normal approach.
The thing I mean is that in some areas in the world, the government play a key role in technology.
In other areas, it's not.
In other areas in the world, we have a infrastructure that allows the industry to take part of active.
And then we need to be sensitive to how technology can evolve in those areas.
And the last part, it's very important -- and that's the message that we're looking at, that's not a lot of partners, where we're going to think we're going to look at us, it's that we're going to really believe that this biggest success can come by local systems, girls, which
What I mean by this is, and let me use the next example, a South Africa country, because I was not a long time, and that's how I know some of the challenges they have.
This is a country with 45 million people.
It's an economist waiting. It's starting to change an amazing way.
They've got a police's goal of the privilege of the theory.
They've got computer computers in South Africa.
They're developing environments for software in university.
What an Italian place to create a environment that can build the software and her restaurant needs in their schools, and I've learned in South Africa that they've got 18 News, I've always thought they have only two -- English and African -- but it turns out they've got 18 instructions to the poor.
And in order to stand in the walls of the traditional education system, it can only do faces.
I don't think it's a wall of the market can be treated by corruptive companies in the world, which just will be the product and put it into the market.
So we believe that these areas of the world where the population is big, and the infrastructure is able to provide it, local systems start to the end, they're very careful to succeed.
It's a picture of a classroom that we took computers in Mexico, my birthday media.
This particular classroom is from a Chicaan in the state of Chicaan.
These are then that maybe you know Mexico -- Mexico is a very poor country.
Child children are scared in a very coffee, it's great to see the power that has children's hands, in the computer, and I have to tell you that it's so easy to appreciate the effect that there's access to technology and categories on their lives and the support of those kids.
We didn't have a long time for learning in a school in South Africa, at the next school on the name of Nigerian Nigeria, and when you see the faces and the costs of those kids who were able to go to computers, it's just an anxiety school.
And not for a while, they wrote us a letter, and they told us how much they're going to compare from the effect that it created on their lives, on their dreams of education, on their capacity, just anxiety.
We've published now 30 different ecosystems in 18 different countries, and we've been able to connect millions of people in an artist to continue to learn what the specific market needs needs and feel.
And I've got to tell you because although millions don't sound a lot in terms of billions that need to connect them, that's the beginning. And we learn a lot.
And we're learning a huge amount of knowledge about what we believe because a market plan should be effective.
One example of this was to fly every child.
Some of you know the beauty.
It's cooperation between MIT and a group of companies -- Google's engaging, the office and AMD is a key device.
The electronics behind the table to every child is based on an AMD technology, it's the lab.
But in order to give you a mistake about how many people can be creative, one of the goals of a child is to get to 10 hours of solar life.
Because it's been organized because it's about eight hours, and you'd like a child to use a telescope at least one day without a repeat.
Scientists did a huge way of development in this field, and the time it's about 15 hours -- it's just a very special work that people did because they're going to do it.
We're exposing that all of this will be reduced to the end of the current year, and we're very excited about the possibilities that it's going to work in education.
It's a very, very, very machine product in the market of education, not just in developing countries, but even in developing countries as well, because there are parts in the United States where it can also make a huge impact on the ability to make education more and more efficient.
We've also created collaboration with TED at this project, with the Arab for humanity, and with a TED Foundation of Center, we've got a strength that we've published to find the best design to find computers in developing areas.
And we're very excited to happen the possibility to be part of this, and we can't wait to see what's coming out of this key activity.
Let me go back to the beginning, to finish this show.
I'm going to tell you because one of the things I feel that's critical to us in industry, in businesses, to be an answer about these problems.
I don't think you're going to put them on the table, look at books and say, yes, it's a good business.
I really believe you have to be interested in it.
And one of the things I've learned, also, my parents -- and I'll tell you a small story -- especially from my father.
And let me take a while to understand it, but he told me, when I went to college, he said, "You're the first one in the family that's going to go to college.
And it's very important that you're going to understand that civilization can go on, every generation has to be better than its own.
And for that, it's your opportunity to be better than my generation. "
In states, I'm not sure I really realized what he told me at the same time.
I'd like to take out to college, find girls, and learn, and to learn, and learn, but then I've finished the college and I loved.
I finished my school. I decided to get rid.
And on my own day, my father came to me again and said, "You know, I'm going to remind you again, that every generation has to be better than his own.
You've got to be a good girl I've been, because it's how you're going to do the wall. "
Because I think what a great girl was, and now he started to activate on me, as he was doing when I was a little boy later, I was born a child, and again, my father came to the hospital, and we were both on the right side, and he said, "I'm going to know all the kids on the other side, I'm going to be better, I '
And then I've got the big challenge that I've got, because it was a great pain.
But what's important is that he's killed me to the universe every day in the morning and want to be better, really think about a role in life not just being the CEO of FFFFO.
It's one day I can look back, and the universe is really better with small drugs that each of us can do.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Is there life outside the Earth in our solar system?
Wow, what powerful question is.
I'm going to tell you as a scientist -- a Palestinian scientist -- we didn't really get it in a curiosity until not time.
Karl School was going to say, "Absolutions are extraordinary interviews."
And arguments about life outside the Earth are going to be sick, they're sensory and they're alive to be everywhere to be able to believe.
So how do you go on this journey?
The thing we decided to do is, first of all, looking for the primary components for life.
The components of life are: dinosaurs -- you have to be support, not curious, but liquid.
We also need energy source.
Like, we're going to have an organic material -- things that make us, but also things we consume.
We need these secrets around the natural environment to transform time periods to ensure that life is, at the moment, it's made, it's gone and evolved.
Well, I've got to say that at a early stage in my career, when we looked at these three secrets, I didn't believe they're out of the planet over a certain period of time or an interpretation.
Why?
On a high temperature -- there's no water there.
Mars -- swim and strength.
There are no water there.
And beyond Mars, all the water in the sun of the solar system.
But new species have changed our thinking.
And we're looking for our attention to the right places and allow us to look deeper and really start to answer our lives.
So looking at our solar system, what are the possibilities?
We're focusing on four places.
The planet is left and three stars of the external planets: Titan, Europe and Antarcles.
What about Mars?
Let's go on the evidence.
Well, at the beginning, we thought that artists is a gut: full of women, welfare and dead.
And so, 15 years ago, we started a task of task that would go to the goal to find the evidence of water in the past that made the biological change.
We were supposed to recognize it.
And yes, we've been volunteered.
The photos in the lower evolutionary expressions and restaurants and extinctions that were there in the past.
In fact, Korean -- the stimulus that's finished over three years -- proposed to us that she's been built in a coffee park, that the seads were reduced at a speed.
And not for a short period, but, probably, over a few millions of years.
And if everything is there, including the organic material, it might be that life really started.
Koresthetic was also stuck in the red star and discovered another material.
And we were very excited when we saw it.
Because it wasn't the red, it was a bird material, Mars.
We've put it into the roof, and we'll put it on, and let's look at what?
We argued organic materials -- carbon, from an artist, oxygen, refugee, refugee -- each and one of them.
So my colleagues, in his age, with a lot of water, can be for a time of a time, allow life life, enabled this object, enabled the growth.
Will life exist now?
We don't know.
But a few years ago, we started to watch a number of actions.
In the summer of the summer, the lines of the sea were affected by these sensors.
The more we've seen, we've seen more and more you've seen, more and more characteristics.
Today, there's more convenient than that.
A few months ago, the Ghana became a reality.
We've invented the world that we know what these objects are.
These are dinosaurs.
In the summer of the summer, these sensory walls.
The dinosaurs fit in the front of these senses.
So what do we do now -- when we see the water?
Well, it's proposed to us that Mars have all of the components that have to live.
And in the past, it might be that in the two thirds of his fingerprint was the ocean.
Now there's water on it right now.
The dinosaurs on the surface.
It has organic materials.
It has all the right conditions.
So what is our next step?
It's a regulation that's going to be looking for life on Mars.
And now it's more fascinating than ever.
And as we move forward in the sun system, we're going to be able to get the tiny galaxies of England.
It's not in what we're going to go into a direct area, "The region around the sun.
It's a lot more than it's.
It's supposed to look like a nuclear card in the ice.
But what did we find?
The Central Kenney was finished in the region since 2006, and after a few years later, she'd been on a lower to Los Angeles and surprised all of us.
She's discovered a series of water that represents from Antarcelis into the sun system and repeated back to the moon.
What's great environment.
Just a few months ago, I went into Canadian into the water flow, and the Scott Kiky School.
Where's the trial?
It's probably the ocean crisis.
The genes of genes that are created by cells, they're attracted and extended this moon, reduce the ice and create ocean.
The same thing happens to the eye.
The only leader that we found here on Earth, as analogy.
It's modern events.
The modern selection in the ocean caused in 1977.
The oceans were completely surprised.
And now there's thousands of pounds like this in the ocean.
What did we find?
When the oceans were testing the modern, it turns out that they're living, whether the water's invented or alcohol -- no matter.
So modern events are a great place for life here on Earth.
So what about Antarcles?
We believe that there's a place on this planet and they're there for a long time, and we believe that there's a modern, in the end of organic material, it's a place where you can exist.
And not just microbial life -- maybe a more complex life because they had time to open.
Otherwise, very similar, is Europe.
The Gulf Bilo Bayo happened in the planet was right in 1996 and affected the main expectations of Europe.
In Europe, as we know, there's a fixed ocean under the ice.
The task of Galo discovered it, but we've never seen falls.
But we didn't expect.
The telescope, a couple of years ago in Europe, the choosing in the lights of wonderful atoms out of the season of the moon, just like in England.
These farmers, who are not in what we're going to go into a direct area, "There's the sun system, there are dinosaurs.
And if there's organic materials, we'll see life there.
It's an extinction of magnitude, because these farmers are in this environment for millions of years.
Life on the Earth started, to make our work, after 500 million years, and see where we are today.
These farmers are enormous.
Another wind that is Titan.
Titan is an enormous transformation of cells.
It might be much larger than the planet.
It has a great atmosphere.
That's why -- it's mostly a penguin and a little bit of a magazine and an Amazon -- that you have to go from "to get it.
And the surface of the Asian Asian has invented dinosaurs.
We see the water...
In fact, almost the size of our black sea in some of the places.
This region isn't liquid water, but it's fabric.
If there's a place there in the sun system, that life is different from our own, a place where it's going to take water is another tool -- and it can be a mammoth -- it might be Titan.
So, is there life outside the Earth in the sun?
We don't know yet, but we're in a coal.
The data we're getting very exciting and they're making us think about it in new ways and exciting.
I believe we're in the right direction.
In the next 10 years, we've been on this question.
And if we do it, and the answer will be positive, then there's life everywhere in the sun.
Just think about it.
We may not be alone.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We're excited about nature from our kids.
Now, when I say that, I don't mean that we're destroying the nature that they'd like we've been happy, even though the forest is the case.
Why I mean, it's that we started to define nature in the way that it's so difficult and so hard that the definition that we've created ourselves, there's no nature to us when they're older.
But there's a solution to that.
So let me explain.
Now, human beings are using a piece of the world to live, to grow their beach and their tree, to provide an impression to their animals.
If you look at all human beings, we're wearing 10 times more than all of the interviews together.
We take roads through the forest.
We've invented plastic particles for the sounds of the oceans.
We've changed the chemistry of the land with the artificial years.
And of course, we changed the chemistry of the air.
So when you take your next task, you're going to lose 42 percent more fear than you'd go in 1950.
So all of these changes, and many other things, they've been working together to the person who's under "The Antarctica."
And it's an idea that some geologists offer that we need to give the current age, based on some of the human impact on it.
Now, it's still a average age, but I think it's a total way to think about the impact of human beings on the planet.
So where is it there nature?
What's a nature in the world when it's all affected by human beings?
So 25 years ago, the environment in Central Kenyan said that because of the nature was an infant from the human and because climate change that every crowd on the planet has changed by the person, which is the nature.
In fact, he called "The end of nature."
I don't agree with it. I'm just not a concept with it.
I don't agree with the definition of nature, because, basically, we live.
Right? Like, we've evolved on this planet in the context of all the other animals that you share the planet, and with all the other plants and the rest of the microbes.
And so I think the nature is not that it's not about humanity, a man or a woman.
I think nature is everywhere the life is transparency, anywhere there's a couple of pounds together, anywhere there's green and blue and gols with life and grow.
And this definition, things look a little bit different.
Now, I understand that there are certain parts of this nature that are things for us in a special way.
Other places like Atlankton, or the Mumbols, or the Greek's big or the Canada.
Other places that we think as a kind of extension of nature's age before we showed everything.
And in some way, they're less affected by our daily activity.
In these places, there's no road or a little bit of roads, so on, like these.
But at the end, even these tremendous genes are affected by human beings.
Now, let's just take the North America, for example, because it's the region that we get.
So between about 15,000 years ago, when people just came here, they started a process of interaction with nature that led to the reduction of big animals, from the statistics to design the bank land, the whole of these extinct animals that we haven't done with us.
And when these animals were afraid, you know, the ecosystems didn't go from the planet.
There's a giant effect that we've been living in the forests, we've changed the forest from one tree to his daughter.
So even in these NASA, even in those areas that are perfect that we see that we're going to have before people, we're actually looking at an input from human beings.
It's not just historical human beings, it's also historical people, the population of communities to the moment where the first tables have been invented.
And that's the same thing about the other actions.
People are just involved in nature in a very profound way and for a very long time.
Now, just recently, someone told me, "Oh, but there are still rural places."
And I said, "Where? Where? I want to go."
And he said, "In Amazon."
And I said, "Oh, the Amazon, I was just there.
It was great. NASA had sent me to the National Institute of us, which is in the profound Amazon, but it's a huge rainforest, no roads, there's no roads of national park, one of the big biodiversity in the world.
And when I got there with my daughter, what I found, people.
People live there hundreds and thousands of years.
People live there, and they don't just expect over the jungle.
They have a significant relationship with the landscape.
They're laughter. They're growing up.
They look at patients.
They're using the natural resources to build their homes, they're going to do their homes.
They're even getting animals like this that we're living in privacy animals.
These people are there and they're interacting with the environment in a significant way and you can see in the environment.
Now, I was with an anthropologist in this town, and he said to me, when we looked at the river, he said, "There's no demographic in the Amazon."
This piece was really going on with me, because what it means that all the Amazon is like this.
There are people everywhere.
And many other terrorists are the same thing, and not just terrorists.
People invented ecosystems in the past, and they continue to affect them in hope, even in places that are harder to understand.
So, if all of nature's definitions that we want to use connections that it's not affected by human beings or there's no people, if they all give us a result that we don't have nature, then maybe these are the definitions that happen.
Maybe we need to define it by the pressure of a number of species, by the pressure of life remains.
Now, if we do this in this way, what did we get?
Well, it's this surprise.
Finally, there's nature around us.
Finally, we're seeing the privilege of modern feedback from this kitchen, and we understand that it's, and it's this lunch in Canada.
And you'll see this lunch.
I mean, here's, like, probably, pregnancy, mammoth, kinds of plants grow there, documenting all kinds of different insects, and it's completely a space that's not an extinction, completely a spinal space.
It's a kind of funny nature under our face, which we don't even notice.
And there's a little bit of a little bit and interesting.
So this nature, this kind of discovery, the unusual part of our atheists, French, the French of France is under the head, and it's probably more than an ethnic French, because the Olympic Amazons in the 21st century.
I'm going to also read in the South Olympic, which is the National Institute for me, it's a beautiful example of the planet that's coming from the past.
But they're managing it in Canada.
One of the issues that they have now is the death of the white corner.
Erin Blin in Chile is an accident, Church -- I'm saying he's a prototype that's growing in high places -- and it's got all the problems right now with disease.
There's a window that's changed, clinical beetles.
So to deal with this, the French services that you're going to have an organ arm in front of the park, even in the areas that they're using natural machines.
And they're even looking at positive diabetes in a key apartment like I've seen for the last time I went to another.
And things like this kind of more common you would tend to think.
The international parks are used in Central.
The interview of the size of a population and a certain structure.
Turns are in die.
Turns are made in action.
The species that are not local to find out.
More local species.
And in fact, I looked at, and the National National France is doing all the things I've just just mentioned: a spinal cord, creates language, radio colors to flow, return to the surface.
It's a lot of work to make places look that we're not going to go.
And another artist is, these places we've lost very places that we love too much, sometimes.
Many of us are going to go there, and because we're managing them to be creative to the world, often they're leading more cities over time.
What it means is that they're completely bad places to take your kids into a sense, because you can't do anything there.
You can't move on the trees.
You can't kill the fish.
You can't do a teacher in the middle of anywhere.
You can't take a crops home.
There's so many laws and limits that are a child's perspective, it's like, the worst nature ever.
Because kids don't want to take a little bit of a beautiful space for five hours and then look at a beautiful flow.
It may be what we want to do as adults, but what children want to do is go out at one point and just play it, just work with it, just to get it, build a house, build something like this.
In addition, these tremendous magnitude for most of the time people live.
And I'm going to visit them. They're hard to visit.
What it means is that they're just available to emissions, and it's an artist problem.
The natural organization of nature has made a crisis in young children, and they asked them, how long do you spend out there?
And it's only two of five times out of the tree at least once a week.
The rest of three out of five just left in the face.
And when they asked them why, some of them would go out, the response of 61 percent was, "There's no natural areas at my house."
And it's crazy. It's just not true.
I mean, 71 percent of the people in the United States are living in 10 minutes from a urban park.
And I'm sure the numbers are similar in other countries.
And it doesn't even including your backyard, the aerotic objects, the song.
They all live at nature.
Every child is living at nature.
Because what we just forgot about how to see it.
We've spent too long to expect the movies of David David's movies where nature's right there -- Laughter) and we've just forgotten how to see the nature that's just out of our door, the nature of the street objects.
So here's an example: Palessia.
There's a cool disease that you can see from the background, which is given.
Now, it may sound like the first story of the Henin in the National, and it's very similar, but they still didn't open it to February yet, even though they're working on it.
So right now, it's still a secret in the heart of Philipa, and if you know where the wall is in the corner of the corner, you can move on the top and you can find this arm just spread over the city of Philika.
Every one of these plants grow out of a village that helps himself there.
It's a completely autonomous nature.
And it's exactly in the center of the city.
And they sent people up to do a biological concept, and there's over 50 different plants there.
And these are not just plants.
It's a ecosystem system, a functional ecosystem and active system.
It creates land, it's a fear of carbon.
Obama is done.
I mean, it's a really ecosystem system.
So scientists started reading ecosystems like this as "sophisticated ecosystems" because most of them are designed by unlocal species, and because they're really strange.
They don't talk that we saw before.
For a long time, we've been looking at all these new ecosystems when plants.
We're talking about agriculture that's growing up, objects that don't run on a daily basis, a second growth of the forest, all of the recycling, which is responsible that the agriculture is very bad, the forest goes back.
And of course, less or less than all of the artist, which are special ecosystems, where ecological devices are control.
This forest here has a right tree, there's a where you've survived from East East East Asia.
You can create a special ecosystem of your own.
It's quite simple.
You're just trying to use the power of the subject.
Laughter) The anthropologist was an ecologist in Finland, and he does this experiment itself.
He just stopped making his subject, and after a few years, he brought some students, and they did a kind of biologist in his face, and they found 375 species of plants, including two species in the restaurant.
So when you're going to be there on the future's future's future's capacity, you're surrounded by this natural eye, you're surrounded by this diversity, this activity, you can look at the end, and you can see a local games for local school, and that's what it looks like.
These kids have, it's -- you know, under my definition, there's a lot of the Earth that's thought as nature, but it's going to be one of the places that don't think of nature.
There's no thing about human beings, no other plants, no other animals.
And what I really wanted to do was just, like, to win a beach on the side and bring all the kids to go up with me to the back of the magic.
In a way of finished, I feel like these are the choices that come in us.
If we look at this new nature as a uncomfortable or a good or not, we can put them out of a way.
And in the world where everything changes. We need to be very careful about how we define nature.
To not move it from our kids, we need to do two things.
First of all, we can't define nature as something that doesn't happen.
It didn't have any sense as well.
nature wasn't about thousands of years.
And it doesn't including most of the nature that most people can visit and have a relationship with it, including nature that children can't touch.
What brings me to talk about the other thing that we have to do, is that we have to give children a nature, because what we're not going to love.
So we're going to face some environmental changes from challenges and boys in the planet.
climate change is one of them.
There's another: biological diversity is my favorite to go into a pressure in the middle of the night.
But in order to solve them. We need people -- smart people, teachers -- that they care about nature.
And the only way that we grow a generation of people who care about nature is by doing them in nature.
I've got a theory that's made on ecology.
All ecosystems I know, every useful biological biologist I know, every useful death that I know, we've been buying when they were children.
If we have a generation that doesn't know how to build a product, we'll have a generation that doesn't know how it's going to care about nature.
And I don't want to be the one that's going to tell this child, which is a unique plug that takes children into a neighborhood, and I'm going to take them to the Iraq parks, I don't want to be a book that's going to keep a local song that he's going to be like a language
I think I'm going to learn from this child that doesn't matter where this plant came, it's beautiful, and it's where it's going to get it and get it out.
Thank you.
Thank you.
There's a fact that I love that I've been reading once he, that one of the things that you're going to be able to succeeded as a species is the forest of our hair -- because our hair, our nest is in the mirror with the invention of our body, allows us to survive every single temperature.
And now we evolved to this point that we can't survive without clothes.
And it's more than a tool.
All we're choosing to put is the president, a story about the language we were, what we're doing, who we want to be.
I was a single child.
I didn't have easy to find friends to play with them, and eventually I invented a lot of the games of myself.
I invented a lot of my toys.
It started with England.
There was a conference of Brendan in my homework city, and they came back behind the door out of a giant cloud, the size of 18 pounds.
And someone said to me -- I was a boy who said to me that when they finished with these animals, they're pushing them behind, and if you ask them to give you one.
It took me a couple of weeks to return the courage, but I citizens it, and they gave me a few weeks.
They gave me one -- I went back home with a beautiful magazine.
I tried to think about what I can do with the satellite material -- a fingerprint, from it and down.
I started to make it in my head and I realized, "Oh, my head can go into this thing."
And so, I looked back, I put a quote in it and I made myself a space text.
So I needed a place to wear the space text, so I found a mirror from a few streets from the house.
I pushed it home, and in the arm room of my parents, I became the same space.
I started with a frozen control.
I've been looking back on the screen, and I've put an airport underneath the printing it.
I've been on the top of a piece of screen, which I've been on the last wall -- and I thought I'm really smart -- without worthy, I've made the back of the back of the hotel in the black hole, and I've been looking at the planets, which I've been going to see in the roof
A few years later, the movie "from the doors" came out.
I've been too young to see this, but I've been looking at a dozen's life, "Like each other in America at the same time.
There was a statement in my mom who had a station of demand in the window, and my mom probably heard me about it with someone I thought that this tree was tremendous, because a couple of days before the satellite, she was completely excited about it that I was going to give me this web of injury. "
Now, I recognize this as a failure that people at a certain age of children have no idea how good they have, let's show you an artificial example of children's regulations that you can now buy on the web.
And that's my mother's coffee.
It's a facility of a piece of paper and Sylin and Sylin with the poster's pocket on it.
And I looked at it.
A few years later, my dad took me to a movie called "Alexford."
In fact, I've designed it to take me water, and it's not a simple thing, because it's a hard movie, it's about adults.
But it wasn't the red and the eyes and the objects that made me see it again.
They left -- [[]]]]]]]]] []]]] []] &#
The School in "I'm going to be awesome in a summer for me.
These were a crime from a five-hicle in a decline, like a mirror.
And more than that, the Bay in "I'm going to spend their failure everywhere.
All the time -- they put it into a dinner, they took it to bed.
And I was like, "They read my thoughts?
I want to wear a muscle all the time! "
And so I went back to my favorite material that was published for a choice, Kington Kenney, and I proposed myself a musician, a perfect finger with a magazine and a bone.
Now after I mentioned this, here's a picture of the device I've been designed.
But I've been able to do that, it's just the first demand I've come up with "I've gone."
A few years later, I've designed my father to make me a decline.
About a month after, he brought me from a town to Lutin Monday called Paling and yet, one of my favorite materials were going to go away from the materials.
Unfortunately, over the month, we built an accurate decline from Aleximum with complex creatures.
We've taken holes in Canada to be able to get there, and we've finished exactly as satellite and put it into school.
Now, it's one thing in this conversation that I don't have his slide for you, because there's no picture of this failure.
And I asked him to school, there was a photograph of the education that went around the corruption, but he didn't find me, for reasons that are going to get rid.
There were things that I didn't expect about the web of a decade that was made from Monday to school.
In the third hour of math, I was on the top of the classroom, and I'm going to be on the top of the classroom because the failure can't sit.
It's the first thing I didn't expect.
And then my teacher looked at me a little bit about the middle of the classroom and says, "Do you feel okay?"
And I think, "Do I feel okay?
I'm wearing a musician! I'm doing the chair -- "And I'm just going to tell her how good I feel, when the classroom begins to roll down the left and go to a long arm, and then I win the back of the back.
I've been exposed from a heat, from the time I've spent the failure.
And when I woke up, I wouldn't be thrilled because I got in my classroom, I wondered, "Who took me the president?
Where's my failure? "Okay, we're going to go forward many years, some of my friends and I've been able to do a series of Science Science, called" The Freethers. "
And for 14 years, I've learned how to build a biology of experiments and how to tell their stories on TV.
I've also learned early that you're going to make a central role in stories.
I'm using the functions to add the motor, comedy, color and speed of the restaurant to the story that we tell.
And then we're doing a park called "Turk for the capacity of language," and I'm going to learn a little bit more about the great implications of actions for me.
Basically, "The question we've tried to answer is: Are you going to jump into a language that's safe like the movies make us believe?
It was just supposed to be two central parts.
One was when we were going to judge buildings by a man trees into a air luck.
And the other one was the end of the experiment: We're going to have a language in the material and we've gone into it.
I wanted to separate and exhibition between the two elements, and I thought, "Well, in the first part we're artists, so we need to wear autonomous -- or not! Let's look at the cockroach of autonomy.
It's for the artists. "
But for the other part, I wanted something very exciting and fair -- "I know! I'm going to wear like New York Times."
I've been looking at the fabric fossil trees, at the top of the sea.
I've found a long task in Iraq.
I found a summer of sun, I had to wear lucks from a moment to wait.
A day of the experiment came, and I got out of my car at the bottom, and my team looked at me.
And it's starting to stop their customers.
They're like, "
And I feel two significant things at this moment.
I feel so sophisticated that it's so clear to my team that I'm completely translated to wear the bottom.
It's just a piece in my head reminds myself that at a high speed of slow, that the long-term is going to look amazing behind.
It's five years into the GDP's "The Times", "we've been invited to show in San School.
I knew about the Texas for years and I never had time to go.
It was the list of the professionals -- it was the engagement of action.
People tried all over the world to show their amazing jobs on the stage in San India.
And I wanted to participate.
I decided I'm going to make a complicated station that's designed me completely, and I'm going to go to San San's lab in San Antarctica.
The bottom I sat?
Hi.
It's not me at the bottom, it's really my favorite.
But I spent months to adopt the most similar weird coffee that I could, from the fossil to the walls of the walls to the collapse of the camera by the accident.
I found a guy who's doing a mayor's head of my favorite and put them in.
I've even had a lot of reminds that we've made me in the rain.
I asked this in the middle of Mexico and I can't even tell you how hot it was in the bottom.
I've got to remember it.
I'm a privilege, and I'm worried about me in the eyes, but there's nothing that I'm completely happy.
It's not from the process of taking the bottom and go in the middle, but also from the society of the other senses.
It's not called the action in the coffee, it's called "Time."
Now for a teacher, the word's finance is people who are looking at their favorite characters from movies or TV and particularly anonymous, but it's much more than that.
It's not just people who find strength and put them -- they're mixing them.
They're surrounding them for free.
They change them to be the characters they want to be in this plan.
They're very sophisticated and geography.
They're giving their refugees to move and it's beautiful.
Laughter) But more than that, they're doing back with their actions.
In Mexickin or any other coffee, you don't just take pictures of people who go around.
You're going to say, "Hey, I love your coffee, I can take you?"
And then you give them a time to get into this.
They've been working hard on their code to their judgment will look great to your camera.
And it's so beautiful to see.
And I take it to attention.
As a chicken after, I'm going to learn the shame of the jihad's woman's baby as Jersey in the "I'm going to get the song."
I'm talking about how to be the fourth French, "The Times," and I'm actually scaring some kids.
I'm going to learn the "The Rick Rather" -- the head of the head that Chicaa does.
And then I'm afraid like a face from "The Minister". "
If you don't know that's the wonderful journey, and his grandmother, the aki, first of all, you're invited.
It's an extension, and one of my favorite movies at all time.
He's about a young girl called Chile who'd been able to have a privilege in the wind world in Palestinian events.
And she's found the way out with the help of a few friends that she's laughing -- a cartoon called Hoo and a single one called a face.
A single facility and he wants to do friends, and he thinks that the way to do it is by spending them and offer them the identity of radio.
But it doesn't work so well, so it's coming out in a kind of bad journey until Chile has invented it, spread it.
So I've launched a coffee of a face, and I've spent it to the stage of a maximum.
And I've been very careful about the regulations of face.
I decided I wasn't going to talk about this object at all.
When people ask me to take me, I'm the mother and I'm going to go to the age of innovation.
They've created the picture and then I'm going to get out of the roads behind my restaurant from a collapse.
And at the end of the picture, I'm going to make it happen for them.
Oh, ah! -- I loved it.
And people have changed.
"Oh my God! You're gonna! Oh my God, it's so cool!
And I feel and I'm going to go on the road and it's great.
And after about 15 minutes something happens.
Somebody sits my hand, and then there's a metaphor back in it.
And I think maybe they gave me a metaphor back, but not, it's one of the fingers that I've given.
And I don't understand why.
And I continue to go, I'm taking some more images.
And then it happens again.
Look, I can't see anything in this code.
I can see a way -- I can see people's shoes.
I can hear what they say and I can see their legs.
But for the third time that someone's coming back to me from nature, I want to figure out what's going on.
So I'm looking at my head to get a better pain, and I see someone goes from me and do something like this.
And then it gets me: it's lucky to get the identity of face.
In the movie, "The bad journey," a bad luck comes to those who are identified in a face.
It's not a tool; it's a series.
We're, we're all on the restaurant, we're lucky ourselves into a restaurant that says something for us.
And we do it for our own.
We're facing something that's important to us in the face.
And it's how we're making ourselves one to the other.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What would you do if you had to understand the information that's behind 11.5 million documents, let's see it and find the idea?
It was the challenge of journalists last year.
A single person who was called "Monony," was somehow going to get close to 40 years of the office of the National Amazon Amazon, "OK."
The office of Darwin, one of the many around the world, who's built in a style in Times in the HIV, for example, the British Brothers, for other people and a choice that lies secret.
"Alexi" manipulated all the electronics of the same company, all the customers, all the insects "from 1977 to today.
These are all going to get the largest telescope of information in the Mexico Mexico that somebody's ever seen.
But it's also a challenge that's going to be able to predict the regulations.
Think about it: 1,1.5 million documents, which are used by people from over 200 countries.
Where do you start in this huge source?
How do you start to fly a story that's going to lead to all of the world, and it's almost every person who'll be surprised, sometimes, in ways that they don't know.
"Alexi's" explains the data to two journalists from the German newspaper. "
He said his journey to that, and I'm sorry, he's like, "The Darwin's carrying that documentary would be."
But one user can't be found in India in a huge amount of information like this.
And that's why the Soviet Shakota Hong King "to my organization, in Washington," The Iranian Amazon. "
We decided to do the opposite of what we learned to do, as journalists: share.
It's a single fingerprint.
We're protecting our secrets, sometimes, even because of our farmers, because we know that once we tell them what we've got, they'll want the story right.
And honestly, when you have a good story, you like to keep yourself the community.
But we're certainly living in a small world, and at the end, the media has to respond to it.
The issues of them are more and more international.
A giant corporation works in the global decade.
About environmental and health is global.
And that's how it's the money and the financial friends.
And that's why it seems to be so amazing that the journalists have so much to explore stories in a really global way.
And also the content was so slow to recognize the possibilities that technology offer, instead of being reduced.
The reason why journalists are afraid of the technology is this: the biggest institutions of professionals in a hard time because of change in ways that people consume new tools.
The models of the primary business that's going to put the journalist's range, they've been read.
