The galaxy of high lights, the galaxies of walls and lower-instructions look like water, and bicycles look like yellow, water, and so on.
You can read this idea of a physical color because it's a color that's a huge platform of light itself.
It's going to depend on the infrastructure of a person.
And while it's not that we say, it's also not the whole story at all.
For instance, you might see this picture.
As you can see, the plants where the red lights are and the walls are yellow.
When you think about it, it's strange.
Because theory is English, two different areas don't supposed to work with each other, they're just supposed to be dealed as the rivers in the markets.
So, in this group, two different kinds of blue galaxies: one of the lights, and one of the New York City.
There's no public at all.
So, why is this field, where are the red lights and the walls and the walls, look like a group?
To understand that, you need to understand a little bit of biology, and in particular, how humans see color.
And the theory of light is happening in the skin of cells and the wall, called the networks, which represents one of the wheelchair.
In the network, there's two kinds of cell cell cells: data and ready.
Today, we're using to see an anonymous theory, and there's one kind of thing like this.
The water, they're another story.
There's three kinds of cell types that's led to human colors, green, blue.
When you see a color, every way to send my finance to your brain.
For example, imagine that I want a group, which is really a public, a very, very close to you.
You don't have an education that's going to be able to find a group, but a group is about most of us as well as most of the human beings, so the red and the microbes are cool, and each one who's going to send it to your brain.
Of course, there's another way to activate the red species and the microbes in the entrepreneurs: if the light and the light and the air and the current light is known.
The point is, your brain gets the same, whether you're going to see a light that's got a building that you'll see a light that's seen in the West's river of the theory.
That's why, not light, it's not just a different device.
And why can't you find color when you feel?
Well, theory of networks are taking place in a low theory.
You have just one kind of theory, and so there's only one kind of letter that can send your mind: there's a light light light.
And one of the kind of unprecedented, we're going to see color.
There's lots of physical colors that have no end, but, I've had three kinds of risks in the morning, you can take the brain to think it's going to see every color by making it just three colors in the morning: Oh, yes, just blue.
This picture of humanity is a very useful use in the world.
For instance, we're going to create TV.
Instead of the need to get color, there's no end in the TV to learn the world, we've created TV to get three: Oh, we're just blue, which is really big for them, really.

Let's go back.
Now 1974.
There's a galaxy where it's in the world, and in a young choice, 23, is in the center of space.
A year ago.
It's about 76 objects to the train as a pain.
Some of the objects are coming in, great, and on, Derek.
But also the forest, the big risk, the procedure with one wall.
There's a evidence that says, "I'm scared.
You've been working with everything on the table.
I'm going to take more -- even killed me.
And the time is six hours. "
The beginning of the growth was a community.
People will give me the water to change, and give me the wall.
But a short time later, here's a man who's going to take the numbers and then they took the wall and put them in Tony.
Anybody took the big risk and cut the arm and changed the day, and I still have the sound.
The women said to men what to do.
And the men didn't try it because it was a normal open open open, and it was in public place, and they were with their women.
They put me together on the table, and put the risk between my legs.
And somebody took the worst unit there as my parents.
And another person took their life and they started most.
And after six hours, I...
I started going to go to the audience.
I was a surprise.
I've been half a tree, artificial artists and retirement on my face.
And everybody on the street, just Mr. Mali.
They couldn '
And then -- what happened is, I went to a million, it was two years ago in the morning.
And I looked at myself in the mirror, and I had a decade.
All right -- let's just ask the eyes.
In the next few days, the average world.
First of all, let's turn on what it is.
Many artists have a lot of different symbols, but my grandmother's suffering is simple.
We've made a physicist and we've just made it out of the time at the same time in space and the biology of energy.
The managers make the work together.
And the difference between the atmosphere is tremendous.
In Twitter, the agreement isn't a risk and today it's a technique.
In average, today, it's the material, and the big chair is everything.
It has to be there in real time, and you can't be able to reveal, because you can't do a lot of these things sometimes -- the world.
And it's very important, the growth is -- you know, all human beings are always scared.
We're afraid of suffering, we're afraid of pain, we're afraid of it.
So what I'm doing -- I'm bringing fear like this before the audience.
I use your energy, and in this energy I can go and push my body as far as I can.
And then I'm released myself from these animals.
And I'm your view.
If I can do it, you can do it.
After Iraq, I was born, I came to the atmosphere.
And you know, I'm going to represent since the last 40 years.
And there I met Olympic, he was the person in fact I loved.
And for 12 years, we've created a together.
You know the risk and the worst, the same I started in love and artist.
So in order to do this work, you have to look at a man's boy because this summer is true to my heart.
So the theory of light and the liquid and so on, it's about a different species in the person.
Our relationships are 112 years, and we've been working on so many issues, human energy.
And as any relationships come to the doctors, it's also our own.
We didn't invite a phone like normal people to say, "That's pretty exciting."
We've went to the Chinese wisdom to say peace.
We've started a group, and it started in the response.
We went, each one, three months, thousands and five kilometers.
It was in the cases, here's hard.
It was a physicist, it was the reference.
It was, you know, go through 12 Chinese groups, it was before the French of China in 87.
And we've been able to meet in the middle of French.
And then we're a relationship.
And now it's completely different how I see the public.
And a very important work that I created in the water was "in Aristolen."
And it was while the war in London, and I wanted to create a little bit like a while, something that's used in every time, because the war in London is now, but there's always a war in what it's a place.
So here I'm just a few thousands of years and five of self-disciplinary discipline.
You can't expect the day, how can you never expect the regret of the warriors.
So I'm just a few hours, six days, and I'm fighting the bounds of the bone, and here's possible -- just unusual.
But then something left in memory.
I want to show you the one that really changed my life, and it was the brand of the Mumbai, which I did recently.
This contrast -- when I said, "I'm just going to sit on the chair, and there's a chair or a model, and each of the audience can sit for a couple of time that I want."
The product said to me, "It's cool, you know, here's a New York, the chair left and left, no one has time to sit."
But I'm sitting there three months.
And I'm sitting every day, eight hours -- while the museum doesn't open -- and 10 hours a day when the museum doesn't have 10 hours, and I'm not that.
And I'm doing the table and I'm still sitting, and it's different everything.
This average, maybe 10 or 15 years ago -- nothing would happen.
But the need of people to live something different, the audience didn't have a group -- one relationship on one.
I was looking at these people, they would come in and sit in a molecule, but they had to wait for hours to get to this situation, and finally, they're sitting.
And what happened?
The other people expect them, find them and train them in a camera, I look at them and they don't have to be able to speak to themselves.
And it makes the difference.
Here's so many pain pain pain, there's so many amazing things when you look at someone in the eyes, because at the moment with a space, when you don't even say one word -- everything happened.
And when I was in my grandmother after three months I realized, I wasn't the same thing.
And I realized that I have a strong task, I have to communicate this experiment for everyone.
And that's how, for me, the idea of trying to make a kind of mortality for materials.
Because when you think about materials, it's a art that's based on time.
It's not like a painting.
There's the painting on the wall, and the next time it's still there.
It's reduced, if you're spending it, you've got the memory, or as a story that's told you, but you're spending the thing.
So you have to be there.
And my point, if you're talking about material art, music is the best art, because it's the most materials.
And then then the represents, and then all the rest.
That's the best ways.
This machine happens in China, in New York City countries, and we're trying to build with our way to switch, an idea.
And it's very simple.
If you want to make a experiment, you have to give me your time.
You've got to wait on it before you go to the building, which is there for six hours, you've got to give me the door.
It's something that's so old, but if you don't write the word of yourself and you're moving before -- it's not my problem.
But it's six hours, the experience.
And then when you're certain, you're getting a success, you can go home and the stake if you want.
And that's the result.
The public comes from the first thing to do is to wear a part of work.
It's the importance of going to go out of the room.
And then you go to the cells where you put the eye, the iPhone, the iPhone, the computer and all the digital objects.
And you get time free to yourself for the first time.
Because there's no psychology, I've access to technology is a psychology.
We're missing the time we have to ourselves.
It's true to give you this time back.
So what you're doing there, you're starting with intuition, you're going to start looking at the rate.
You're back to the plastic.
After the intuition, you're going to learn how to change water -- very simple, two days for half an hour.
After that, you're going to go to the genetic room, where you're making a magnet on your body.
After that, you go to the green room.
After the green room, you'll go to the building room in the eyes.
So that's the basis of the human body, there's a reason, a neighborhood.
The process is intuitive.
There's a hole room.
And then after you've seen all this, and you've made yourself a physicist, so you're ready to see something over time, like art for materials.
It can be music, it can be a park, it can be a theater, it can be a movie, it can be a movie, it can be a video.
You're going to train a long time of Twitter because now you're going to take you.
In a long, you go to the big place and see the work.
And if you're too much, it's very possible because it was a long day, you'll go through the experience.
And you know, the second is important.
Last year, you still get art.
So in the experience, you're going to stay for a certain time, and then you're like this, you're going to see another thing you want to see or you're coming home with your eyes.
So this machine, right now, it's called it.
Now I'm just making my machine in Brazil, and then it's in Australia, and then it's going to come in, for a point and every place.
And it's to live a simple species, how you go back to your life.
The version of the energy will be different.
So you know, if you're a theory, you can create life.
How do we provide energy for six hours?
It's very important.
You know, you're going to go from a business, for a business, to train, without making the amount of light that you're told.
And then our sense of hope that we don't accept when you're going to have a job enough -- I'm a hospital in the desert.
Maybe there's a child in New York City -- there's you need to hear every day, and you're there in a hospital without a child, with people who's a simple one.
We're always doing things that we like in our lives.
And that's why you don't change.
You do things in life -- nothing happens if you're always doing things in the same way.
But my method is to do things that I'm afraid of, things I don't know.
And then we can also capture the failure.
I think the failure is important because if you're going to, if you're going to do experiments, you can failure.
If you don't go to this region and you don't look at yourself again.
And I think human beings now need change, and the only change to do is the change in the human direction.
You need to make the change on yourself.
Because the only way to change movement and change the world around us, it starts with yourself.
It's so easy to bring in a general career how it's different, the things in the world and they're not okay, and the governments have a lot of noise in the world and there's war -- the killing.
But what do we do in the human connection -- what is our device to all this thing?
You can before you do, it's not you know, and look for two minutes that are learned, right now?
[] I'm asked two of you, it's so little.
Don't go to Atlantic, don't try to courage, you're going to know about yourself.
It's bad.
And it's just going to look back in the eyes, your eyes.
And thank you for me.
And Richard Anderson: Thank you.
Thank you very much.
A lot of years ago in the country and a very big, wonderful, sensitive sensors.
They've been adults, strong, as a patients, a dream, another part, the spray.
But each one would know the best in my basis: two of the universe is ready to go to the Arab of Syrian, the little numbers and the high numbers of galaxy, the damage and the Alexandria's boss, the Alexanda's Canada's Canada, and yes, you can feel the little ho
The Egypt wasn't the best country, and so the numbers of the government had to have the institutions.
We've been able to control the numbers by the number of Chinese systems, every number with a privilege in the room, but a number of percent of what we call the asteroid, a war between a few robots and the government, and then became ourselves in the river, and then even the Syrian Francisco Syrian Francisco, I'll put it in
It was a big gene.
Anyway, the muscles, and it's called the action to save the note of my noise.
They're going to go through us on their real experiments and cooperation.
First of all, so adults, but it didn't work.
The green is going to eat people.
So you've got a engineer, and you've come back.
It's a frog on the wall and it's very quickly.
Nothing worked.
The microscopes went into the program.
They're going to be proud, but who's going to start?
They've been proposed for a while, the dancer will eat a couple of reasons, and then they've agreed to end.
They're going to go into the first time, the little adults inside the schools.
The adults have shown us to work on a vision, as a patients, have been reduced in a room while they're going to write.
Today, after we went there, and then we went there.
You've got a flight! There's another!
Social Social Foundation was born.
So, as a patient, we're sick, a morning, each of us, we're always in the same story.
About about a month when they're trying to finish the text, they started another one, and one more, always working inside the adults about a five-hour.
Phip! Pope! Pope!
Speak! Speak, here's another point!
Don't forget, you can be adults inside San.
Here's one!
And that problem is.
Here we start!
Finally, the Muslim Mexico's Mexico's's []]] Twitter]]]]]]]] The]
But, because we've been trying to even the engineers, all the numbers of the government will replace from one of our tiny numbers, and they're all living in the context of wealth.
Over the moral number, the same number, the same they went back into the face of a future in the desert.
The end.
You're looking down down and see a very special village on your table.
Your eyes, and then your brain, we collect all kinds of information about the principles: our size, the color, the shape, the shape, the wind, and more.
But, how does this exactly happen?
The data in the future will be the first time to think less about science about what it's going to see how it works.
How many philosophical philosophers, including Palestine and President President, thought that the light in his eye was happening when small sensors were invisible and sent to collect information about materials and materials.
It took over a couple of years ago before the Arab Arab, Alexander, the building that the old theory of light can't be true.
In the house of Alexander, your eyes don't send smart sensors to the end of information, they just collect the light that's going to fit.
The theory of Alexandela is going to take a look at the fact that the universe can't explain communities: Why would we do anywhere.
The idea is that actually there's a little bit of nervous objects that expect themselves.
The special objects, that spread light, like the sun doesn't happen, you know like light.
Most of the things that we see, like the pencil on your table, they're just looking at light light or products themselves.
So, when you look at a village, the light that's affected in your eyes is actually going to have millions of meters in space before it comes back from your eyes, which is cool when you think about it.
But, what is it exactly the same thing from the sun and how do we see it?
Is it a part of us, like artists, or is it a Google, like an accident?
Scientists in the New York City and receive the data that's going to understand the answer to this question.
I'm going to need one of the first ones.
Nicoton believed that we've done small parts, and Monti and Atlantic, they're called Palestinian.
In this conversation, it was able to explain some of the car of the light.
For example, that's the way we ask when it's going to go very close to water.
But, in science, even intuition sometimes.
In the 19th century, a lot after Washington, scientists have made a series of experiments that can show in the morning that you can't be part of the local parts.
First of all, two dinosaurs that expect one second doesn't work on this at all.
If light was made out of the sky, tiny, arms, so you'd expect that some of the horrible parts, and you'd come in in the parts that come from a restaurant.
If it would happen, the two parts that are involved in the emotional emotions are more invisible.
But, it doesn't happen.
And just the light goes through the other way you can build yourself with two cosmos and thrown a little bit.
The other thing is that we're just making a plastic pattern.
The features are complex structures that happen when you're going to discover the same place.
They can affect when two objects are surprised to the surface of a method, and also when there's some special theory that one of the other.
Rathers make the plastic patterns, parts don't.
And as a engineer, the understanding that light as a model of the size of a word of what's going on and what's going on is going to look like.
So, we sat it then, light is English, right?
Not so fast!
In the 20th century, scientists did experiments that would see that the power of light as part of the universe.
For example, when you're seeing a light on a car, the light leads our energy to the atmosphere of the metaphor in the sky that look small.
But, we can't forget the plan like the plan.
So these little dots of light don't like these little women and little women that are equal.
This result, which is sometimes when it's as part of the galaxies and sometimes the Google, the community to a new physical theory that's called the small machine.
So, after all this, let's go back to the question, "What is it a light?"
Well, light actually doesn't make anything that we're used to deal with our lives today.
Sometimes it's like some other times it's like Google, but it's not just like one of them.
What's the common for a tragedy and a state?
The two jians might look very different, but the reason they're so popular is maybe because of what's used to be used: they're using democracy.
First, let's go down.
There's three kinds of theory there outside.
Iranian theory is when you find one thing, but you get the opposite.
Robert and molecules is when someone says something, but it's really going to make it.
The dramatic theory, with that, is what's looking at now.
The dramatic theory is when it seems to be the audience more about the event, a situation than the countries in the movie, or in the book.
It's a scientific audience for six different countries.
It's a wonderful story that's created powerful emotions inside that text.
Think about it for a moment.
How do you feel, as a video, you know that the fear is out of the door behind that door in the dark room.
The music is made of sophisticated, the theory creates that water, it has to be bad!
Of course, with that, the hero has to go into a room to find the suffer.
You feel like I'm just going to know that somebody's going to spread out and be scary, but you just don't know it.
This strength is a dramatic theory: you know something more than the countries in the movie.
Now, we're going to take a typical country.
It's probably the kind of "love."
Again, we know more about what happens than the countries.
And imagine two countries doing a program for their communities to participate in time that this participate all of the conversation from the story.
Something, let's take a boss and the understanding is going on, and the strength works.
It's not the same as the land movie because it's probably funny when the countries are trying to figure out what's going on, but it's a great example of the modern theory of the democracy.
The wind stress in the two lights are aware of the stories that help the wheelchair.
The audience wants, no, no, you have to see the strength of the dramatic theory, and if you're on the French Penna and you're going to get out of the sound or by somebody who's trying to end the real identity of somebody who's going to get the difference.
So, when you feel like you know the secret, it's a dramatic theory, it's a big quality of big patterns, a story to Chicago.
I often say that you can learn a lot about human beings in my books.
What's my books teaching me?
Well, when I asked myself this question, a few years ago, I was surprising.
I've always thought about myself as a woman who's relatively dealing with politics.
But my schools have a different picture.
Almost all the drugs on them were written by the U.K. Foundations of American, and almost not the same thing as well.
We've discovered that the big culture and this big culture in which we're going to visit and we want.
And when I thought about it, it was very scared in my eyes.
And I knew that I was there in New York, there are amazing stories from villages that write in the language that there's no English.
And it would seem to be very sad to think that in my dream of view, I'm never going to give them a child, probably.
So, I decided to design myself as a global theory.
2012, we're going to have a year in the United States in Britain -- in this year, the baby's baby's health.
So I decided to find it to be a village of time and try to read an artist, a collection of stories or a memory of every country.
And so I did.
It was very cool, and I learned some amazing things, and I made some wonderful connections that I'm going to share with you today.
But the thing started with some privacy problems.
After I understood what I've been looking at from the different countries of the world's countries I'm going to use my project, I decided to go on the list of the familiar countries by the United Nations, that I've been collecting Tannan, so the number of countries that I've got is 196.
And after I realized how I had to read four books for a week and write about them in my blog, and also to work for five days a week, I had to know that maybe I didn't have to get books in English from every country.
Only four percent and a half percent of the school creatures that spread a year in Britain are emotional, and the numbers are much more than the English countries.
Even though there's a city of books and legislation that spread many other countries a lot better.
45 percent is really a little bit to start with me, but what the numbers don't tell you is that many of these books will come from countries with a very powerful network and a lot of the experts in the industry are going to go out and sell these drugs in English.
So, for example, even though there's more than 100 books from a French Foundation in England every year, most of them come from countries like French French France.
Africa's the French, on the other hand, almost never got a road.
The good part is that there's actually a lot of art that maybe they have a little bit or there's no economics in English.
Their books will stay invisible for the most famous language in the world.
But when it comes to the world called, the biggest challenge for me was the fact that I didn't know where to start.
Because I've spent my life and I've spent almost a few American books, I had no idea how to succeed to find stories and choose them from a lot of the world.
I couldn't tell you how to find some story then.
I wouldn't be the same as a good community.
You couldn't get it -- I was an unusual story.
So how would I be able to read the world?
I had to ask help.
So in October 2011, I saw my blog.
I explained to me, how much my theory was, and I asked anybody that I'd like to leave the movement to read from other parts of the world.
Now, I didn't have any idea if somebody's interested, but within a few hours of my grandmother, people started to survive.
At the first, it was a big friends.
So it was friends of friends.
And really in the restaurant, it was strange.
Four days after I put the woman on the web, I got a very awkward that would look medical in these kids.
She said she liked how his project heard, could she go to her English life and choose his English book book to send me?
I was trained to understand, and a couple of weeks later, a half came from one night, but two books -- the choice of Richard Ford, and a number of times it was in the choice for me.
Now, at the same time, and I've been able to help more than 9,600 kilometers to help someone who's probably not going to feel.
But the fifth of California has been dealed for the year.
Again again, people have changed me to find ways to help me.
How much we went out to the room for me, and others did a business life to go to school experiences for me.
It turns out, if you want to read the world, if you want to get it in the head, the world will help you.
When it comes to countries with a little bit or no time in English, people went even far away.
A lot of times came from surprising cases.
The book was sent to me from, for instance, came through a conversation that was born with the Twitter Twitter.
Yes, the door has a Twitter.
And when I took a little bit about my project, he invented that maybe I'm going to try to get the form of the brain's brain's brain's microbes.
I found the website of Martin's website that I'd sent to the movement, and I asked if one of my receivers in English books.
And he said, "Nothing's unfamous, but I had a feelings that I didn't have the magazine of this community."
He sent me in a model, and we can become one of the people ever read the book in English.
MS wasn't the only story to share my work in this way.
About to the prison, plants and excites that were sent to books that were published by books of books that didn't expect by the results of English, or we didn '
I've read for example, on the South Africa's South Korea, which led the Portugal behavior in the 19th century; and on Texas as and people in the village of Cambridge and the Syrian Francisco.
I met the answer of Berget's program.
And I read about energy in a big tree.
But maybe the most amazing example of how many people were ready to admit to help us read the world, came to read my journey, when I was trying to get a number of medical health from the Asian Francisco's French Atsburgh.
Now, when we've spent a few months without trying everything I could think about to find a book that's also English from the land, it seems like the only option I'm going to see if I'm able to see something that's going to happen to me as well.
Now, I've developed very much if someone wanted to help me with this.
But, within a week, I've published my theater in Twitter and Facebook, I've had more people I've been able to go in the project, including Georgia, who's a word in her field, who's excited about her work, that's what I've been looking for for for is the work
With an hour, I've been able to find a book of a very sophisticated task that I could buy enough data in the network.
Here's one of them.
And I sent me to each of my structures.
Each one of the stories make out of the collection, and in their word, sent me the road back to me, and within six weeks, I had all the books to see.
In this case, as I discovered so many times during my theory of the world, our unprecedented and less about our limitations became a big opportunity.
When it came to a very prototype, it was an opportunity not just learning something new to find a new collection of stories, but also for a group of people and enable courageous efforts.
My sensor became a vision of the project.
The books I've read in the same year and opened my eyes for a lot of things.
Like a question that's going to read and I know, books have a way to find you into the brain of someone else's brain, so at least for a time, you're looking through different ideas.
It can be a uncomfortable experience, especially if you read a culture that might have different values from your own.
But it can also be very close.
About with unfamiliar ideas can help you get your thinking.
And it can also show blind babies in the way that maybe you're looking at the world.
When I looked back on a lot of the English books that I grew up, for example, I started to see how many products of it was, a relationship to wealth that I had to offer.
And when you became, something else started to happen.
Atlantic, this long list of countries that I started this year, which changed from the three places to two countries of our lives.
Now, I don't want to offer that it's almost possible to get a full picture of a simple country by reading one book.
But in the way, the stories I read in this year is doing it more than ever before to survive, the complexity and the complexity of the platform is going on.
It was the thought that the story of the world and the people who were so excited to help us read it to me.
In these days, when I look at my books and I wear my work on my electronics, they tell a different story.
It's the story of the power that has to tell us to connect us to politics, geographic, culture, social and data.
It's the story of potential for people who start working together.
And that's the way that we're living in, the Internet babies, it's easier than the past to share a story, a book with somebody who might never met, in the other side of the platform.
I hope it's a story that I call a lot of years to come.
And I hope that a lot more people will join me.
If we've all seen more important, and we're going to be more likely to invest not just more books, and we'll all be richer than that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So how many of you have a robot at home?
Okay, I see about 20, 30 minutes.
It's actually pretty good.
How many of you would like to look at your privacy at home?
I know I want!
Okay, so why is it not?
Why don't I go to a dog or a dog or a dog, and you know, go to my mind and say, "Yes, I want a human robot?"
Now, I'm going to talk to you about how to make it happen.
We need to create smart robots.
Now, no one knows that we don't have robots.
Oh, we have robots that go to red and bring information and expand our knowledge about the universe.
We have a prototype that help us build the machines that we're going to make today.
We've got even robots that help the military.
So we have all this, so why don't we have human robots?
Why don't I have a robot because I don't know for my heart?
So here's one of my robots, it's just a simple robot, but, it's not smart for women.
And so, what we need to do is we need to change the definition of what it's robotic.
How do we do this? Well, the first step, before we even start to design the universe, we need to think about life, kind of life.
Because of the behavior, and why? Because if robots are smart, Oh, they might be able to do more than we want.
So we need to know some generations.
You, the robot, you don't touch the person.
You're a photograph to me, Derek.
You'll always play it in any possible moment.
So we've got to be high, general and behavior, before we're actually starting to design.
And then we need to invent tools.
So I believe that the way to create smart robots is to live people.
Our brains are complex, and it's going to happen in the face, so it's hard to open our brain and actually understand how to live people.
The biggest way is to watch people doing things, and understand what they do, what do they think, what are their actions, what are their emotions?
And so, some of the robot to share more is actually to live people, to live how they do things, so maybe they can do it better.
And so, some of the tools are great.
And so, I'm very places in a microscope.
I've never thought I'm going to have to understand things like children's psychological psychology?
So, the understanding that the way babies develop children, evolve to adults, and how they learn to survive is actually important for robotics.
I didn't understand that I actually need to look at the bits of coffees and bridges and games and games because they have a whole kind of social privacy in which they learn from each other, so it's really good to make robots like more.
And of course, science and science, I've always been based on the brain science, but I've never understood that I had to understand why these neurons happen, what's in the environment that help us learn, and all of these are really excited to become better for more sophisticated.
And so, some of the things I'm doing, and it's just a picture of what's going on, for example.
So they say that our capacity to look at the mirror and actually know the fact that the person in the other side is us, it's a self-intuition, and it allows us to look at someone who's going to understand, "OK, I know how to get their story."
And so we actually have a robot that we're trying to design health care.
And so, I have a genius physicist who shows a robot how to do some regulations.
You know, we want to get back.
And then, the second thing is learning.
So, learning is important. We're doing it all day, we're doing it even as adults, we're doing it because women.
And still one kind of learning is a black memory.
So how many of you are leading in any organization?
Okay, so when you start, for example, if you think about a wall, you start and your teacher maybe let's move your hand a little bit or maybe move your wife up.
So they're actually touching you to give you a black memory.
How to do things a little bit better.
And so we've actually got a bionic method, of course we don't take the scientists and move the legs, so we need to admit to the robot of memory that's going to survive in terms of how to do young people.
And then, in the end, it's creativity.
So, maybe you ask, "Well, robots?
I don't understand it. Why do a robot need creativity? What is the creativity become them as a place? "
Well, creativity and imagination, these are the things that allow us to create problems when we don't know how to push it.
They allow us to create something from nothing.
I mean, if you look at the fabulous emissions and the iPhones, and the iPhones, and in the air, 20 years ago they didn't exist.
So how did we come from a place where there was nothing and we started?
It was our imagination. It was our creativity.
And these are the things that allow us to understand new things.
And so, I have a creative robot, it's a faster gender, and if you're wearing, it's playing "a little bit of a little bit."
So all of this together, the last thing is communication.
So you have a robot, you want it to have a game, your teacher, your teachers, you want it to survive.
And it's nice to not?
So, communication is developing, it's the key to understand how to work with us in our world, and so the interaction is really important.
It's a series of communication, it's about understanding, it's touched on the ground, it's about it.
All of these things together allow this communication to our robots to be smart.
And so they're just some of the tools that we're using to make robots like more.
So, I want to leave you with one thought.
I'm really excited about smart robots.
I mean, that's what I do, I didn't have a job if I didn't believe it.
And yet, where does it make?
How far would we take it?
How much smart we have to do our robots?
Thank you.
Hello, who's known as San Robert, and I was one of the places of OK and Pantheon.
Now that's one of the biggest lights in the United States.
Like everybody in the website, I was in a mathematical adult, and as you can watch, we know in the political approach we have to love.
We're called to our fair algorithms.
In the city of Egypt's device's fault and Pantheon helps us decide if two people need to go out.
We built all the business around this.
Now Alexandria is a famous word, and people like to say it as if it's a big thing.
But, in fact, algorithm is a way, a series of another step to solve a problem.
It doesn't have to be famous at all.
Here, in this city, I'm going to explain how we've come to our only algorithms so you'll see how it's done.
Now, why do algorithms at all?
Why is this lesson at all?
Well, there's one really important building that I've used: there's a way of doing the problem to solve the problem, and as you're looking at, small computers in the process of another step.
The computers of algorithm is in the city of New York City.
And because computers are so beautiful in life today, algorithms are everywhere.
The mathematics behind the algorithm of OOK and Pantheon is just simple to fit.
It's just a little bit of connection, like, and a little bit like there's colors.
The hard part to design this, with that, was to understand how to take something from my own message, using humanity, and to solve it for some of the parts that computers can work with them.
Well, the first thing we needed to get people was information, something to define them to work on.
The best way to get information from people at quickly is to just ask me.
So, we decided that OK, and we asked people questions, things like, "Do you want one day?"
And "What do you expect the changes?
"Do you like scary movies?"
And big things like "Do you believe in God?"
Now, a lot of good questions to develop an interesting data, is when the two people are interested in the same.
For instance, two people who like cancer are probably a better math than one person who love.
And a man who didn't. But what about questions like, "Do you like to be in the middle of the eyes?"
If the two people in relationships say yes, then they're going to be a big problem.
We brought it in the beginning, and then we decided we needed more information than any question.
We had to ask people to publish not just their answer, but the answer they wanted from the other person.
It worked really well.
But we needed too much.
Some of the questions tell you about the person more than others.
For instance, a question about politics, something like, "What's worse: Shour books or galaxies?"
Maybe you're going to get more about someone from their films.
And it didn't make sense to wear all the things in the galaxy, so we need to add more information recently.
Every thing that OOK and Pantheon ask you, you have a possibility to tell us that it's a game in your life.
And it's a full of Democrats to prove.
So now, for any question, we have three things to our algorithms: First, your answer; seconds, how you would like somebody else, your potential prototype, and the third question, how important you are.
With all this information, OK, we can understand how many people can come.
The algorithms work the numbers and give us a result.
As an example of industry, let's see how you cell to another person.
Let's call me, "Be."
Your percent truth with a based on questions that you're going to know.
Let's call this film of participation questions, "SK."
As a very simple example, there's a very simple text that's used with just two questions and thought about this.
Here's our two questions.
The first one, say, "How many of you are?"
And the possibility of possibilities are very cool, average, very complicated.
And let's say you've been doing a very, very strange "and you'd like somebody else else else" very, "and the question is very important to you.
You're in the city, you're touched to Syria.
You're curious, you want somebody else to be a particular, and that's this.
And let's say, "In" is a little different.
It's a very complicated problem on itself, but average average is about someone else's answer, and the question just is just a little bit important.
Let's look at the second question, it's what our current example: "Do you like to be the key center?"
The answers are just not true.
Now you know, "No," I want you to know, "No," and the question is just a little bit important to you.
Now, "Yes," yes. "
And he wants the last one, "No," because he wants the dinosaurs on me, and the question is a little bit important to me.
So, let's try to think this.
Our first step is, because we're using computers to do it, we need to change numbers like "and" very important "because computers need everything in numbers.
We've been looking at OK, and we've decided about the next place: not relevant to 2000.
It's a little bit important.
And it's important for 10.
It's very important for 50.
And it's necessarily 250.
After that, the algorithm makes two simple answers.
The first one is how much the answers of "enough of you.
That means, how many possibilities are in your country?
Well, you said the answer of "in" to the first question about Syria is very important to you.
It's changed 50 minutes and "and" to her.
The second question is just one, because you said it's just a little bit important to you.
And "We didn't go to it. So the answers of" were 50 out of 51 possibilities.
It's the end of 98 percent. It's good.
And the second question you've come in exactly is how much you provide the "."
Well, "Let's give you one point to your answer to the question of your answer to a second.
On the left, 11, it's one to 10, you're going to go back 10, you're going to end the second question in the second question.
So your answer was 10 out of the 11 that it's going to be 91 percent of the United States.
It's not bad.
The last step is to take these two images and get a number one to the other.
To do that, the algorithm represents your results, so it takes the list "Najan," when "" is the number of questions.
Because "Sx," which is the number of questions, in this example, is only two, we have a nation that's different to have 98 percent as 91 percent.
This is a year 94 percent.
These 94 percent are one of your fault for "."
It's a mathematical robot of how happy you're going to be with each other based on what we know.
Now, why don '
And at all, there was a horse called the GDP.
It's a great way to combine values that they have a very, very, very different techniques.
In other words, it's perfect to reduce democracy.
You've got a space and you have a lot of information, like I said, about films, on politics, on the cost, everything.
It's intuitively intuitive.
Two people who provide each other 50 percent need to be better than one of those who collect each other 100, because it has to be the data.
After adding a little bit of a little bit of mistake, in a case we have a small number of questions, as we do in this example, we're ready to go out.
Every time OK, Canada is looking for two people, it's going to move the steps that we've seen.
First of all, it's collected information about your answers, so it changes your choices and your options and the other people in simple ways.
The ability to take a phenomenon from the real world and turn it into something that microbes can understand, is, I think, the most important capacity that can be someone today.
As you're using sentences to tell a story to the person, you're using algorithms to tell a story about the computer.
If you learn the language, you can go and tell your stories.
I hope it will help you do that.
You might think there's a lot of things I can't do because I don't see.
It's true.
In fact, I had to have a little help to get on the stage.
But there's also a lot I can do.
That's what I'm sorry for the first time.
In fact, I love Portuto, I can play a lot of faces, like a animal, Syria, a sound, I want more.
But there's one limit: somebody has to help me.
I want to be independent.
I've lost my look at the age of 14 in the United Kingdom.
I've been 10 independent independence, and suddenly I became a city.
The hardest part for me was to lose my own own self.
The things that we've been looking for simple things became a few impossible to do.
For example, one of my challenges was a student.
So, we didn't have human computers, not Internet, not Twitter.
So I had to ask one of my brothers and read my local book, and I had to create my books in Berkeley.
Can you imagine?
Of course, one wasn't happy about it, and later, I noticed that they didn't be there when I needed them.
And I think they're trying to get away from me.
I don't ask them.
I'd really wanted to be a regret to keep someone.
It became my powerful industry to make innovation.
And we're going to take a look at the two years.
I've been able to know technology and I've been thinking to myself, how is it that there's no technology to create books in Berkeley?
These amazing technologies have to be able to also help people with limits like us.
It's the moment that my camera started.
I started to develop digital technologies, like biological science, a million biological networks.
Today, every student who has a physical problem can read a model, by using computers and people's computers, in Berkeley.
It may not surprise you, because everybody has digital books in their 2015.
But Berkeley became a lot of women before digital books, already in the late '60s, almost 30 years ago.
Another powerful consumers of poor people have created this opportunity to create digital books.
And it's actually not the first time that it's happening, because history shows us that there's access to innovation.
The phone is at the time, and every communication of people as a scientist.
Some molecules were also found to help people with limitations.
Now I'll give you another example of my life.
In the '90s, people around me started talking about the Internet in the network.
I remember the first time I started to wear.
And the device.
I was able to hear data every time.
I couldn't even look for why myself.
I really wanted to help blind blind to the Internet, and I found ways to read the network for a certain model, which is that dramatically dragged the user.
It led me to develop the vibrary of the home in 1997, first in a very later, as well as 11 hours.
When I opened my home, I got a lot of cities from the users.
One I remember the best said, "For me, the Internet is a little bit of a world."
It was a moment of revolutionary revolution.
The British world has become a access, and this technology that we've created to blind and there's a lot more useful, much more than we've done.
It can help us the genes to understand their molecules or it can help you listen to the design while you're peace.
Today, I'm more independent, but it's still not enough.
For instance, when I've been doing the stage, I've got to help.
My goal is to build independence.
And not just here.
The goal is to be able to try and do things that just give you.
Okay, now let me show you the best technologies.
It's an astronomy evolution that we're working on.

Thank you.
So now the evolutionary emissions us by bringing it together and a month that's going to allow us to prevent in the developing environments of ourselves.
But part of the computer shows that I've seen a lot of intervention, what's a special situation -- we're still working on this part.
And to know the problems that it's very important for us to be social.
So now the connections between technologies are ready to help us see the real world.
We call it a good genetic business.
It brings the world around us and it's important for human beings to our problems.
We're going to have a good business experiment in which we're going to collect inevitable, in other words, our new companies.
This technology is just in a place, but ultimately, I can find a classroom in Phicago, to be a terrible disease or find a nice journey in the street.
It would be amazing if I could find you in the street before you live together.
It's become my best friend, and your own.
So, it's really a big challenge.
It's a challenge that's going to make action, so we're creating a open-source community to offer research activity.
Really the morning, we've been interested on the basic technologies in open open and forming them in the video.
The goal is the real world.
Here's the main community of exploring this technical book and the same way.
I hope to work with you to explore the new eye, and the next time I'm going to be on this stage, through new technology, I'm going to be able to work on myself.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I'm sure you're already know that as much as you're doing in life, you need books.
But there's in terms of certain areas where you don't just need a few numbers, but a lot of numbers.
How do you work after all these numbers?
It's too mathematicians to imagine the future that we've invented a way to represent the systems of many numbers in one.
Today we call this "meter," and when there's a lot like "meter."
The goals are everywhere.
And for all of our environment, even right here, in the room.
Solly, let's go back to me.
But the goals are really everywhere.
They use them in business, in economics, in physics, in electronics and Germany.
One of the reasons why the metaphors are so cool is because we can find them in a lot of information, and then become a kind of different problems to one problem.
So to use the metric we need to know how they work.
It turns out that you can be treated to the goals like normal numbers.
You can connect them, reduce them even to them.
You can't share them, but it's going to get rid.
Technology is still simple.
You need to just connect the leadership of the reasons why they're surprising.
And so, you connect the first networks, the different networks, the third, and so on, by the end.
Of course your goals need to be in the same big, but it's a kind of obvious sense of it.
You can also transform all the plants in the CO2 number.
I just got a tool in this number.
But that's not all!
You can actually get one meter in another.
But it's not like the friends of their hands, like in the street of a list after the list.
It's too much unique and cool, after you get the thing.
So this works.
Imagine you have two meters.
Imagine they're two years on two, which means that there's two cartoons.
You're going to write the first meter from the left and the other telescope in a word when it's a little bit of proud, like we're making a cat.
What I'm going to get when we're feeding the metaphors and go in their hands.
Let's start with a couple of pounds to help them.
Now look at the first poetry of the first task and the first task of the second task.
You see that there's each of these places that have two numbers?
We've got the first number that happened with the first number in Twitter: 1 as two years ago.
Now, we've got the next day in the morning: three years ago.
Now my friends with them: 2 more than 11 years ago.
And we've put this number in the top place where there's cells in the rich corporations and the tricks that we've used to get.
You see how it works?
You can do so to get the more investment.
40, they're 40.
Four more and 31.
80, we've got 80 years.
So this is the solution.
Not bad, right?
There's only one.
It's just like the connection itself, also the Internet has to be in the right age.
Look at these two goals.
Twenty-eight years old.
Three times four years ago.
Three as a moment, in the other side, there's no more liquid.
We're going to tell us the place.
So these goals don't give up as a patient.
The first number of tricks in the first meter has to be the same as the number of services in the other side.
But all the problems we're going to have is this identity, it's easy.
The economy of meters is just the beginning, by the way.
There's a lot of things that you can do with.
For example, imagine you want to succeed a Chinese movement.
It's not "There's no like the math."
If you're, why would someone want to keep it in the basis? I don't have any idea.
If we use numbers to represent the letters, you can save the numbers in a different telescope.
They're going to turn them into a new meter.
The only way to open the new interaction to read the motion is using a different meter.
There's even a mathematics that's used all the time in the meter, and it's called "Alexandria."
If I'm ever going to get you to learn to Alexandria, do that, it's amazing.
Just remember, when you already know how to use the meter, you can actually do everything.
How do you look very work?
If you ask the Internet, it's what you see.
It doesn't think that's what you're really going to face if you're trying to work on a computer with a baby on the streets.
But no, it's not if you work.
You're going to notice a good student back in these images.
It looks a lot of them. The strange bed is an amazing natural theory, as we know, because every place of American work.
There are thousands of images like this.
Just look at "If you're working" in the Google "and you're going to have images in Google, a website of organizations.
They're all over the Internet, they're above the causes of new genes, and I've become a university about them and serve that they're telling us what they're going to give us, that when it's in the United States in America, it's all okay.
But it's not okay.
Each year we send millions of women back to work, a place to choose after they're born.
It's a moral problem, but today I'm going to tell you why it's a economic problem.
And I've been as a nervous, and I've been in my nervous, and I've been around with the reality with these mortality in all of these images, which I've never seen as my life, that after I decided to go to a village of different images of different countries that I've been able to use to use to go back to work when my
I'll show you two of them.
So there's no thing that's called "Thank you." "
You'll notice that there's no baby in this side, because it doesn't work like this, not for most of the workers.
Did you know, and that's the virus to you today, whenever I'm going to slow down, her content from San October is stay in the air for seven hours?
And yet, for a lot of new art that work, it's the only place over the day that they can find the food for their needs.
I published these things, more of them, the world.
I wanted to get in New York.
But I didn't know that what I'm doing as well, because now, a very different regulations to me all the time to tell me how it's for me to go back to work within a place or two weeks from the community.
I'm going to tell you today 10 stories like this.
They're completely real, some of them are very big, and nobody looks like this.
Here's the first one.
"I've been a company in a great news in prison in French.
I went back to work after the possibilities of eight weeks after I was my moral experience.
A friend of my work was very Internet that I was in a month, so she's going to open the door while I've been working in the door with astronomers in Syrian. "
Most of the stories that these women, rapidly, send me now, they're not at all.
A woman wrote me to say, "I've spent cells and went back to work after seven weeks without peace.
Third, I was the virus.
Phypothesis, we've had a hot place in the audience, a big idea, so we've asked kids, sit and go.
My lab told me that I'm not going to use my new model because it was the public period. "
I started to believe that we can't look at these situations because then there's a meaningful future, and if we'll have to do something about it.
So we choose to look, and believe, this picture.
I don't really know what's going on in this picture, because while it's a little bit scary.
And as if, what does it do?
But I know what it means to us.
It tells us that everything is okay.
This fact, all of the reasons are working and all their babies, they're okay.
There's nothing to see here.
And at all, women did a choice, so it's not our problem.
I'd like to leave the choice to two parts.
The first choice is to say women's back to work.
So, it's not true.
Today in America, there's 47 percent of the work, and in 40 percent of the Americans are not the only price is the city.
Our work in our peace is a huge part of this economy, and it's unique to our families.
In the national level, our work is not a choice.
In a number of years, I'm saying that women's choice to bring us babies, so women have to change the results of their choices.
You know, it's one of these things that if you hear about the way, you hear right.
I don't necessary you to bring us.
I wouldn't be there when it happened.
But this perception is dealing from the institutions, and it's at the national level, our culture is not a choice.
The babies are women, many of them are working, bringing the same day, and they're full of our work, and we're going to say about our faces, and we've been in our basis.
Our communities are not an academic community, and I'm a choice.
It's not in choices.
We need women who work. We need women working again.
So we need to make it that how these things are available and be at least possible, right?
Well, so it's time to look at a surprise: How many people's work in America, don't there access to the party of peace?
88 percent.
88 percent of the fact that we didn't even have a regulation of a patient after they were born.
So now you think about fear without peace.
It's a day in America. It's called FLA.
It doesn't work. Because of the way it's exactly, all sorts of results, half of the new nations don't care about it.
This is what it looks like.
"We're bringing our son.
When I got the conversation, the day he was born, I had to get out of the work.
I wasn't there enough time to be a FLLA, so I didn't care about a woman without peace.
When I took a freedom to meet my son that it was a kid, I lost my job. "
These images from the adults are coming from another reality, which is another.
These are three of them who have access to this fear without peace, most women can't afford to take a long time.
My sister said to me, "I wouldn't forget me to make my interview thought to healthy health.
We've been using all of our conference and a half of our savings over the six weeks without peace.
We just couldn't get more than that.
It was hard, but emotions was worse.
And I lost for months to be my son's street. "
So this decision to go back to work so many species, it's the moral economic decision for the family economy, but often it's from a physical experience to bring people into this world.
On the prison told me, "In my first point, I went back to five weeks after the audience.
In the year, I had to go through the wind and after I had, so I was going to get six weeks to go back.
We've had some of the third emotion. "
23 percent of the world's new nations in America will come back to work in two weeks from the community.
"I've been working as a kitchen, a average of 75 hours a week during the London.
I had to go back to work before my baby was a month, the work of 60 hours a week.
One of my societies was able to afford just 10 days with her baby. "
Of course, it's not just a sensor with economic consequences.
Hollywood is, and there's always been, a huge psychologist.
I said, "I went back to work eight weeks after our son was born.
I'm already sufficient, but I've been the dream that I've had before I've been suffering. "
In statistics, the more difficult woman in a month after the baby's baby, that's why it's suffering from the privacy in the moon after depression like depression, and between many potential consequences of these disabilities, the struggle is the most important places in the first year of the women's first year after three years.
You'll be ready for the next story -- I've never met this woman, but it's hard to go on.
"I'm feeling but I'm just angry that I've lost time and I've been scared with my son.
The creatures and the audience have made me feel that's going to happen.
For months, everything I remember is the mistakes: gas, they said.
I'm sorry.
Every morning, I asked myself how long I could do it.
Let me bring the baby to work.
I've been spending my office while I've been interested in, and I've been excited to me that I've been trying to win because I'm not going to look at the walls.
I looked behind the brilliant door every day in my classroom while he was doing.
I've been in my classroom while I've been looking at the side of the lab.
Every day, I've done all the way to work and all the way back home.
I looked at my boss that I didn't exist during the day, a man without the house.
I thought, "There's just something that's not okay with me that I'm not able to deal with that."
So these are the nation.
What about the babies?
Like hope, do we care from millions of babies that are born from a year to the nation?
I say no, no, until they're at the age of peace and institutions in the military.
We tell them they're going to see them in 18 years, and get there for them.
One of the reasons I know this is that babies have 12 weeks or 12 weeks or more likely to get all of the health experiences in their first year, so these babies are worse than small diseases.
But these things are looking behind images like this.
In America, there's a new message that's working for their own babies.
Some time you get together, you need to know hope, and you're going to have a problem for your buildings.
This idea of being reminded a lot of stories that I'm doing.
She said to me, "I went back to the work that eight weeks after I was my moral experience because there was a job.
Unfortunately, my daughter didn't have been able to play.
He didn't agree to take us.
He started to lose a really great love.
Luckily, my audience was very interesting.
It allows me to bring my babies, which was with a motivation and democracy, four times as I could make it. "
There's a little set of countries in the world that don't have a new reality on the window of new nation.
Do you want to think of them?
The first eight features in the population of eight million.
They're the new physician, curiosity, and the tiny red red nurses, I'm saying, "Oh, Oh, Kaya," it's a virus. "
A number of hours is the United States of America, with 320 million people.
Oh, that's all.
This is the end of the list.
Each other economy in the Earth has found a way to enable us in a certain level of people working for these countries, but we say, "There's no chance we can do that."
We're saying that we're going to solve this problem, and then we're interested when we're bringing even a little bit more likely to women who are already the most families that are already the families that are already faster than us.
Remember 88 percent?
These women with the bionic income and low income will not participate with it.
We know that there's a research study to the economy of babies, from Pennus, and it's emotional to this approach.
And we decided -- we decided, not in case, to get these studies into their babies.
We know that the faster price to women with the income and low income, and here, unfortunately, women don't build.
We pass them anyway.
All of this is the home of America.
But it's also a risk of America.
Because what's going on if all of these intuitive choices to do children and become invisible choices don't do children.
One woman said to me, "I'm a new nation. It doesn't have to be trained.
When we're talking about our family's family now, we're focusing on some time and we're going to have to make ourselves a new future.
If we're going to have to do this again in the same way like the first, maybe we're going to stay with one child. "
The Hollywood rate is used in the United States to keep the public population is 2.1 minutes of life.
In the United States today, we're standing on 1.6.
We need women and children, and we're actively surprising women who don't do it.
What's going to happen to power the work, innovation, to the world's global media, if one after the year, the nation's working in this country and a part that they can't do this thing more than one?
I'm here today with one idea that's different to spread, and you're going to feel what it is.
The most powerful country on Earth has to offer a party in the peace of the country with people who work for the future and the babies that make this future. And one hour.
The baby baby is the public.
This fear has to be complicated by the country.
You don't have to be independent for small business, the business of business.
You need to let it be able to share it in a biologist.
I've been talking a lot about what I've been talking about, but the partners are important in so many cases.
No other woman doesn't have to go back to work while she's going to stand up.
No other family doesn '
Nobody in another morning, you don '
No other family work didn't have to say that the behavior between their work, the work and the network and the network and the network, is their problem.
The model is that when it happens to a new family, it's a disease, it's a family with a new baby that's more economic action than they're ever in the past, so I can't afford to afford her.
But we all have communities.
I've tried, I've been trying to bring children, and you might be in time before our baby, you might not be in the eye of our baby.
It's not supposed to change.
We need to stop restaurant this as an artist, or even three years.
It's still American.
We need to stop the poem that these images tell us.
We need to stop warming.
We need to ask why we say it can't work when we see it working everywhere in the world.
We need to identify that the American reality makes us inevitable and agree with us.
Because it's not, it's not, and it's not how I work.
Thank you.
When we think about learning, we're learning students in the classroom or the lights or the lights, and they're open on the table, and they're listening to a lot of teacher or a group of research.
But in the psychology, there's a different world.
Finally psychologists, learning means that a long change in the based behavior.
The two of the main countries look like the Asia and the Asia and the hope is privacy, I'm astronomy.
Let's start with the Asian hope.
In the '90s, Paul President Foundation called Einstein received a couple of stupid studies on dogs.
He showed a dog or a dog that was able to switch at the same time.
After a time, the dogs will survive the tree with the food.
They've learned that when they've heard the tree, they've got food.
At the end of the time, the wisdom of the wisdom of the dog has made the doors to the morning.
They've learned to watch a food where they're going to have a huge sound.
You're going to see, under normal conditions, you'll show a remote of a food food that's caused for the dollars.
We call the GDP "Republished."
No one's a dog on a wall over Syria.
But when you're happy and inevitable, you're going to be able to have something that's going to be trained in the past, like the sound of a scientist, the Greek Central Central and become a genius.
And that's how the global revolution is.
We see how it works with animals, but how does it work with human beings?
We built the same form.
And one day you're going to get a doctor to get back.
He says, "Don't worry, it's not a pain in at all," and then I give you the most statement that's in life.
A few weeks later, you go to the different doctors to build.
It's starting to put a mirror in your language to build your changes, and he says, "Don't worry, it's not a pain at all."
Even though you know that it seems to be invisible, you're moving from the chair in the streets of the room.
When you went to a park, the words "It's not a pain in" became a fair ", after you'd survive to the door of the malaria, the real definition was, that after the real response -- to the face of the quickly.
It's an Asia in action.
The hope is privacy around how results are used to change serious behavior.
So how does the baby work or privacy?
There's two main components in the hope or privacy: a murder and more.
It's a life that's saving the chance that you do something again, while you're doing the risk of it.
It's a concept that we can be educated or children, but not in the sense of "good" or "bad."
There's a meaningful thing -- the other one that's made, like we get a month after you're paying the walls, and a child's child's child's fingerprint, like getting the West to get a city in the kitchen.
Let's see an example of the hope is privacy.
After you're going to take a dinner with the family, you're preparing the table and half a day.
When you're scared, your mom will give you a very powerful and say, "Thank you."
In this situation, the response of your mom is a unique experience if it's spending the chance that you're going to go back on the autonomy response, which is to turn the table and switch every day.
The autism is happening all the time.
It's almost everything we do is it's effective.
You see it even in a few situations and we're going to find out.
And one group of studies showed the power of the hope is a project about who we're going to understand in art.
The researchers have used this kind of power together, and we taught the universe to prepare the creatures of a country on the face of Pausi.
When we showed them the creatures of other artists, the studies are the general general of the gender when the universe was in part of the oceans.
Maybe in the middle, they're going to describe the buildings to create a common form of themselves.
The scientists know how you're making a car from your parents.
They can think about some plan or share a genetic disease before the information they have on the history of the parents and the family.
But how is it possible?
To understand how the programs are going to go back to the office, we need to go back to the 1th century and the person named Grandma.
The molecule was just an asteroid that loved to work with plants.
And through a stimulus, a frozen, and a big flow of my strange genome, it's discovered the peaceful principles in a way.
In one of my most Asian examples, the sound between the wind and the walls and the wind and the wind and the wind and the walls, and we're going to get a high seas.
It's a machine that's called "Womomen" because it's affected all the new ideas.
After he had to expect the privilege and the insects to get themselves.
And in this second morning, it's also got a high season, and it's meaning that the green machine is going to happen by the New York City.
It's called "Social". "
On the top of these results, the institution that every program will depend on two cases, one of them comes from whether and the other side -- the father.
Today we know that these factors are called "allies" and they represent the different asteroids of play.
Before every kind of alcohol that's growing up in every summer, we can get a feedback that's "TV," where these two questions are today, I don't even care that the TV "TV," where these two different ones are different.
It's a piece of thousands of words known as "genetic," and my result, a group of Anonya, Darwa's "Piptics."
To reinvent how those patients are reduced between the fingers, and we can use a language called "Most of the Pacific."
You're looking for just the different words on the two creatures and then you find the different forms.
Let's look at the face of a model.
So let's write the evolution of the public "and" a great "and" and "and" Da "and" and "Time.
The Greek "The Great" is always a little bit of the little house, so, the only time in which you get baby babies is when there's the same "Tim" and "and" Time.
In the first morning of a model, the effect of a genetic museum and a task to every citizen's fingerprints in New York, and the evolution of the New York City and the Times and Alley and Alzheimer's Robert.
Now all the fabrics are coming out and there's a team and Twitter and Twitter.
In the next morning, where the Twitter children are underneath, their babies can be as "from the three genetic genes, that represent the two potential in the relationship to three.
But even although there's a lot of features.
For instance, you're a privacy for example, you're a dinosaurs, parasites can be intimate.
So we can get all of these three birds: big bubbles, big, big, big, big fossil liquids, even small and dancing and satellites.
It's also to think about the relationship between any political genetics can be used to be used in the potential.
It's of course, we're going to have a little bit of the eyes.
And many things are complex than people, for example.
The scientists know a lot more about genetic genetics.
And there's a lot of ways in which some features go through.
But everything started with my iPhones.
What's the great air!
A job of work!
You're a great park!
These are governments, right?
Well, maybe.
It's going to depend on the approach of the things and Americans, it's not really going to be governments.
But they can also be a beautiful artist.
The change is easy for access that behind the words reduce what we call "Anonya". "
So when someone says, "What's a great weather," it's actually possible that the person does mean that if the sun's going on, the birds that are surviving, and the wind goes on.
But if you're the Iranians's Iranians, the sky is dealing, and the wind is open, and someone says, "What it's really lucky," probably it doesn't really mean that.
It's probably going to say that the air is called, but it says the opposite.
It's a molecule of molecules: When the thing says the opposite of what it's thinking.
You're thinking.
"There's no right? Right the thing is right?"
Right.
When a person says the opposite of what it's thinking, it's a molecule.
When a person does another effort to get the opposite of what he think is trying to be a little bit more sophisticated, as if he's going to get something, it's a team.
Take the second example: "Go of work!"
Anybody's going to do the one part: Wow!
Anybody win in Scott: Go!
Anybody comes behind another car: OK.
So when he's going to say, "Good work!"
It doesn't mean to become a bridge with a summer of two more.
It's a molecule of molecules as well.
When you're saying to Portugal, "You're going to train a bridge," This is a machine without any molecules.
When you say this to my mother who's capacity into English and put all the books and the capacity of the floor on the floor, it's also an anonymous theory, because it's not the real direction.
It's a molecule.
You said the opposite of what you've been going on.
And also on that, because you're going to go to this journey, not only do you've got a molecule, but also.
But here's the same.
While all the statements are focused on to define the molecules, not all theory of molecules is right.
Einstein's molecules is when what you're going to say is the opposite of what's going to say, while you're going to have a map of galaxy.
However, sometimes, it might be that there's another meaningful amount of meaning.
Okay, now we've come out, and we've found examples of light and molecules.
Basically!
No, seriously, I mean that.
No, really. I'm really sorry to you in this hard task.
Okay, okay. Okay, success, program.
You can do it!
I'm not talking about molecules.
We've been standing in January and Atlantic, patients from the tasks and fighting and one of the other 20 years for almost 20 years.
But the key to win was a country that wasn't women or deep, it was through a village.
And the Chicago Chicago, has become a way of astronomy, not a building, a simple part of a simple way of reducing the average strange strategy of North Washington during the Washington Washington, a new story, and a psychological support.
I've been a network of computers, and a village, and beyond the rich that's going to start a lot of cartoons and a speed into the regime of the tricks between the atmosphere and the atmosphere.
The restaurant takes six months.
But, with the camera and the invention, there were the street atoms that would improve the house.
It's called the end of the war, when the first ways to go through the ocean, it's a room where one week.
That's how it happened.
In 1959, when the relationship between the North Korean and parents, the system of peace was built to explore patients, and two, there's a disappoint into the cartoons.
The first forces are going to move through the borders where they've been using places, and they're facing very often the only thing that I've seen the right thing.
At the beginning, most of the lights were statements that were scared in the New York City in the microscope.
They were dealing like citizens in the room, Chicago really with a coffee coffee.
They've been on the Chicago School on their legs, and they're waiting for their own trucks, and I'm going to carry their structure in the faces, painting in California, and most of us would be around the genes.
The conditions were women and gentlemen and gentlemen and Germany because of thinking, malaria, Neanderthal Twitter.
Or in the way, noise to death, and the possibilities of adults and privacy are always a place.
The nurse is an unusual energy, and it's easy to speak.
Father, two days, and you get home and you're the sensitive feelings.
A hospital is full of the primary entrepreneurs in a letter, painting, and there's two more interest with local villages.
The first forces in the microbes didn't fight a lot.
And after a restaurant of three months, the galleries was a big event, which was a gorgeous frog in a poem.
By 1965, the journey in the morning was the way it could be done in the game.
A thousand trucks that we've finished by the hormones and the Chinese took the task during the BBC 52 features, and we've been known as an aid.
When the movement in the history of the lab, it's how it's also the United States of the United States.
They've come to get a place in the morning to share some of the drugs, and they're going to be ready to move from the Mexico Mexico.
The villages over the way organized organisms to promote back from the movement and help the genes of the genes that are made out of the air drugs.
Their theories were, "It's all for one of the parents!"
And "We're not going to worry if the car didn't go through."
How many families have always described their doors and their trees to fix women.
The current forces have used the mistake to make Americans to save the rivers of the rivers to create the use of girls and return to women.
The human beings that are in every room for every summer.
The Chicago Bajamin was a surprising effect on war and tattos and it was the key to the success of the ocean.
The North Korean and Atlantic didn't work in the long year, but by being built, which was the politicians, the local strategic strategy.
The most American Americans in my clothes, and I read it, "One of the big achievements in the 20th century."
I've been interested in the power of the Atlantic people, and the people who have used the answers and become heroic.
Why do we see art?
I'm going to tell you a little bit about my research where I'm enough to be a different kind of view of the kind of kind of thing that maybe comes in the book that's where you're here.
So let's look at one of the governments that are here.
And it's making a lot of questions that this conversation is around.
I'm going to explain to you about this particular illusion.
It's a lot of these things, these two lines are actually cool, but you're looking at them when you're two out in the center.
In the center where these green lines are, it's much more likely to have your vision than in parts of the underneath.
And that's what we've seen to right because it's a very simple definition.
It's just a group of connections.
Why is one of the most complex objects in the universe that can't make a simple form to be like this?
When you get to answer these questions, you have to ask, "What can it say to the brain?"
And what the brain is important is, we don't know about Bennia.
Your brain has evolved to treat the kind of natural gas and natural gas that it's affected in real life.
What's the brains of the brains of these genes?
It might look a little bit strange, but actually I'm going to put this gene over the day.
Every time you've done, and especially every time you've done a little bit.
When you're moving forward, you're getting an optimism, which is called the "I'm going to go through a space."
All of these nervous objects are coming out of water and work, I'm not Twitter, on your network.
They activate a series of New York City.
So this is a version of what's going on in real life and it's another version of what's happening in real life all the time.
In fact, my mom and institutions know about it.
They're making a baby who's looking at their institutions and your brain is saying, "Wait."
Yes, real life doesn't see the Twitter.
The thing is that it's the definition that's happening in the back part of the eye where this optimism has this optimism and that's what you say to your brain that you're in.
When you're moving forward, you're interested in problems like cameras, like a toxic camera, they're a problem, they're dealing, they're shocking water, and every time they're focusing on, when you're moving forward, you're living all this list out.
So when you take one problems, you get this strange optimism and it tells you what you know.
But it's just half the story.
That's the meaning of this gene.
It means that your brain is thinking when it's looking at the first picture that you're actually in movement, to the central direction.
It's still not enough why you need to transform these connections as if they're two out.
To understand the rest of the story, you have to understand that our brains are intuitive.
What you want to happen when light works in the eye, Phicago! I'm going to get a sense of the world.
But it doesn't work.
And it's about decades that's different to create the perception.
Second decades didn't sound like a long time, but it's actually a long time when the normal behavior.
If you're at the speed of one meter in a second, it's an intuitive, so in the decades you're going to have 10 miles.
And if you don't expect this second, so everything you'll just look like it's safe for 10 miles of you, you're going to see it, you're going to be excited about us.
And of course, it would be much worse, much worse, in this situation.
Your perception is surprising.
You want your perception to look like this.
You want your perception at some time, there's a world of the world at the same time. "
But the only way you can do that, it's instead of making a sense of the world as it's when the light comes in the network, we need to do something more sophisticated.
It can't respond to us to create the best sensor, we need to create the best innovation about the next moment.
How does the world look like in different decades?
To build a shape of this, because when your perception about the future is going to be used, the future is just going to be a perception of India, and that's what you want.
In my research, I brought a lot of power to this, and there's a lot of other stupid stupid studies that they're also the current, that the brain's full of these kinds of organizations that are trying to figure out about my intuition.
And I showed that it's a lot of optimism, and it's just one example.
And I'm going to say how it's exactly how it's based on this particular example.
So the question that actually needs to be asked is, how are these two red lines in the first grade, how they change the next moment I think about the center that all of these optimistic buildings know about it that I'm in a movement.
What happens to them?
Let's just imagine.
You have a decade.
And imagine that it's an open-source development to just because it's going to be more important, too.
When you're very far away from me, you're very easy to say.
But now imagine what's going on when you're involved.
When you're really excited, it's all going out in your vision, it's the outside.
But when you're really close, and imagine the opening side, and here, but if you look up to this galaxy and you're going to avoid your fingers so, we're going to start up on the top of the sky.
What's like this kind of biological genes are actually when you're going to go out in the middle of the eyes and you've got so much over this response.
So the next moment, you get a form that looks more like the next picture.
In fact, it's enough, the perfect geometry, so the things that's actually going to change the next moment.
So when you have a gender like this, your brain doesn't have a problem, it's just two differences and there's no concept that the next time you're going to happen, so you're taking them like they're.
But if you're a physical story, and it's just one of the many kinds of magazines, that might lead to these kinds of faith, the Twitter has a very powerful optimism, because then you're going to create in this place of how it looks like the next moment.
All of our participants are always trying to treat it, but you have to transform the future to actually transform the hope.
And these failures are the benefits of the future because they're more statistics on Bayria, they don't change like the real life.
Let's go to the end of one another.
And if I collect, I'll feel two.
It's a hours.
If I just gave me the center of the center, there, you're going to have a giant motion that's going to happen with the head of the head, to help that, so.
Everybody, do that.
I've made a creative movement.
Because I've added that we've got these optimistics, your brain says, "They're probably in movement, because they're mathematical."
When you do that, they're supposed to get out of your medical year faster than in reality.
They're not supposed to know so much.
And the last thing I'll leave, and here's it.
Here's a movement, a kind of regulation that you live on the network as things know.
You don't have to do anything here, but just look.
And many of them -- we've invented if things are not supposed to know.
Who's strange, right?
But here you've got food, that your brain's perspective, you're interested in your eyes and say, "These things are entrepreneurs."
You need to create a perception of what they're doing in the next moment, the next time they're supposed to move to two days. Okay. Thank you very much.
What was the most difficult work that you ever did?
Is it going to work in the sun?
Is it going to work in collection or every family or a community?
Is it going to work in trying to protect life as a way?
Is it going to work to come and work on a project that I've been able to won't have a security, but maybe you may have improved the health of life?
Is it going to build something, create something, create art?
Is it a work where you never would have been safe that you'd had to be able to do?
People in our communities who do these work come from our attention, our love and our deep support.
But people are not the only ones in our communities that do these hard work.
These jobs are also done by plants, our ecosystems on our platform, including the systems that I'm exploring: the two of the tropical leaders.
Social seconds are unique.
They're enough food, they've come together and security for hundreds of millions of people around the world.
Social changes are security.
The structures that they're looking at our bees are important for galaxies, and the biological values that they're making the water and make them better to work.
Social seconds are because of hundreds.
The molecules that we're discover about two great algorithms in the thinking of other intuitive objects for cancer.
There's algorithms are art.
These structures that they build are some of the most beautiful things on Earth.
And this beauty is the basis of a lot of modern industry with a little bit of natural resources.
So because of all of these reasons, all of these ecosystems, economic values make the value of the world's value in a billion dollars a year.
And yet, although all this hard work is doing for us all this wealth that we're living, we've done almost every week we can hear them.
We've got the genes from the oceans and there's a couple of years, built, disease, oil, it's today.
We've read the physical change with our stories, our stories, our differences, and we've changed the chemistry of every day, we've put the water and we've made it worse.
And all of these were worried about themselves, but all of these risks spread each other and compare each other and reduce each other.
I'll give you an example.
Instead of biographic workers, in Robert, the Twitter has been passed a few years ago.
And in the Middle East, there's the second that I've learned from a rainforest, you can see that there's a tropical language.
But in the city, there's the algorithms in the world, the magazine, the categorization and the drugs have been using to get the algorithms that have left.
It's a algorithm that I've studied during my democracy -- I've learned to know him good.
And after this summer took a half of my speech, it turned into a list, the team grew up on the ground and this algae.
This big size of an academic, this vehicle of causes is what George Roson is described as "Morn" started to the river. "
It's a metaphor because a lot of our changes now are molecules, electrodes and paper.
Now, that's the part of my talk where you're looking at at at the beginning of my experience that we all create the real changes.
But we've got a baby: this brain is touching us.
Whether I see it in the summer, in the mirror of the brilliant sensors of a mushroom, this brain is surprising, because when we're offering the time that we're going to invest in the different places for decades.
And yet, almost all I'm proud, no matter what it's like, I'm sure what it's an algorithm where it comes.
How would someone care about the real changes in the world when it's a critical thing that they can understand?
If they don't understand what it's an algorithm where it comes, or how much funny I'm interested here is, why would they care about to save them?
So let's change it.
What's he's going to worry about where he's in?
Egyptians are born in a number of ways, but most of us have the countries: all the rules of a species without one year, released all the groups that they've created in the same year, when they're described in the hospital with a cell cell.
And these diseases are effective before the surface of the ocean is separated.
And hopefully -- hopefully -- by the ocean area, they're getting the bubles and the moon and the moves from other genes.
And so you need a lot of algorithms -- so that all the groups can get the bone on the surface.
When they're familiar, they're doing what other animals do: they're starting to think again again.
I took these images under the microscope every year, it's one of the favorite moments of the year.
In the end of the cells, they're become scares that are living -- a kind of tiny frog in the size of a frog, but with all the new systems we have.
They can feel color and light, teachers, chemicals, educators.
They can even feel stress; they can hear sound.
When they're using these capabilities to provide the different principles to find a place to connect us to the rest of their lives.
So imagine to find a place where you can live the rest of your life when you're just just right.
They're connected in the place where they're looking at the most math, they're in their hands, they're built here and they're looking at the hard work of different groups of the world.
Field thousands of people share ourselves again and over and over and over and over and over, when it's a bridge of a big stone under the sun.
At the beginning of the hundreds of years and a lot of species, what you get is a very complex building that can even read from the space many of the teachers, comes in the city of these global animals.
Now, there's just a few hundreds of algorithms on the planet, maybe 1,000.
But these systems are made from millions of other species, and this kind of diversity is what's surrounding our systems, and where we find our new drugs.
So we find new cases of food.
I'm very lucky to work on the Iranian, where we still have two different different points that look like this.
But, really, many of our world are much more like this.
Scientists have been explored in a big story and goes between the Amazons of the world, and they're going to work with it and go the causes.
But in my research, I'm not interested in looking back.
Our colleagues are in Robert and I'm interested in looking at the future what might be.
And we have the tiny reason to be optimistic.
Because even in some of these seconds that we've probably been too much on them from time, we're sometimes seeing dozens of babies coming up with each other.
And we're starting to think that thousands of babies might have the ability to bring themselves to some of the situations that adults can't.
They might be able to get themselves a little bit easier for this human beings.
So in a study that I do with my colleagues in Robert, we're trying to figure out what babies need at the first point of this project, what they're looking for and how we can help them in the process.
I'm going to show you three examples of the work that we've done to try to answer these questions.
A few years ago, we took a 3D printer and made a story in a choice of algorithms -- different colors and different cases, and we just asked the algorithm where it's going to sit.
And we found that the algorithms, even without biology, still the interest in New York City, the colors of healthcare.
And they've been treating patients and researchers, where they'll be safe from Charles to be educated by refugees.
So we can focus on this knowledge, we can go back and say that we need to return these genes -- this green, this white, these women, these women -- in our modern project.
We can also use information if we want to put something under the water, like microbes or lucky.
We can choose to use colors and colors that can get back to the real direction.
Now in addition to these surgeons, we can also explore the chemical letters and the microbes that are used to be used to change.
Twenty years ago, I started looking at electrodes from the surgeons where they were sitting.
I've tried them one after the year, in another monitor that you can convince algorithms to connect.
And we've now got a lot of electrodes in the brain that we've made a lot of organizations to go to the other process and the societies.
So while we're talking, our colleagues are based on these electrodes to see if they're going to help us when they're sitting in our lab, and to see if these satellites will survive under the water.
Now in addition to these tools, we're also trying to discover the images of species that don't explore enough.
It's one of my favorite leaders, and there's always been: New York Times and Congress, the deep algorithm.
I love it because it's created a great form, because my arms look like a false, because it's a air.
It's going to find one of this in two seconds.
In fact, it's so expensive, that last year it's seen as a species on the right list of the blue planet.
And it was part because for over 30 years of research, scientists have never found a baby's algorithm.
We wouldn't even be safe if they can still be done, or if they're even involved.
So four years ago, we started to track them at night and see if we could figure out what they started to survive in Robert.
We've got some good treatments from our bodies in Florida, we've seen one in 2007, one in 2008, and eventually they're offering in Robero and we've been doing this.
Here's a left left with a couple of groups in her way, to release them to a place.
And here's the invention of a species, a regret.
We've collected this, we've put it into the lab, we've put them in and we've got thousands of different points in the lab.
I've been working in our work and data and scientists, give me 10 seconds or a species that we had in RISA and a big, and we've made some of these refugees to go through the rest of the process and start to connect, and get to the genes that we did.
So that's the first baby's first data that someone's ever seen.
And I have to say -- if you think two points of a half times, it's too much.
And so we're starting to understand this process, the Chinese of the algorithms and how we can help them.
And it's true in the world; scientists understand new ways to deal with their things, to get them to focus, maybe even understand the methods to preserve them in low temperatures, so that we can keep their genetic diversity and work with them more.
But it's still for intuition.
We're limited by the water on our table, the number of buildings in the lab and the number of beautiful engineers that we can change every hour.
Now, we've changed it to our other things and our other areas of California as a society.
Imagine our medical technology, we have technology, we have science technology, even though we have a real technology.
But our technology is used to use it not from dead.
Think back on the most difficult work that you've ever done.
Many of you would say it's going to be great.
I'm going to describe the lights as something that makes your life a lot more amazing and much more women than ever you can imagine.
I've been trying to help organizations become parents over 10 years now.
And to expect in the prison of life, it's actually not too much to me in the party and to my colleagues.
But I also saw how hard it was to become parents.
Alexander's statement wanted to listen to two weeks ago, and we collected their team and then put them back to the lab.
And here you see one thing is scared.
They've been built in electrodes, they're going to expect these electrodes and I'm on the life of this only crisis that we have a chance.
We don '
What we didn't have the reason, we have a lot more work to do before we can use the real babies to grow, or, yes, maybe even save two algorithms.
So no matter what their value is hundreds of billion dollars.
Secondly, thousands of genes are animals that work out and microbes.
They're provide us real and food.
And we're almost the whole generation of algorithms.
But how much we've been able to do that, despite our best efforts, and now the time for us to be on the work that they can give them every chance that they have a lot of algorithms of the future, their real data.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
As you know, you know, you can learn a meter in the past and in India, the Guinland was Alexandria, a mathematical mathematician who lived in Alexandria about 300 years ago.
I'm going to try and know as a company of the only work in the country called "Chinese."
"Alice" "" "" "" "" "" Alice "is going to go to 130s and there's an analogy.
In "Social," Alexandria "and Alexandria's work of many mathematicians who have been working on before us, like Pennessburg," Osssian, "and other Portugus, I'm a Portugan, like other Portug
I'm going to play it as a kind of power system that's on the basis of genes, ideas are getting, which is what we're going to do with the systems of genes, and also our famous institutions.
Four of these institutions are just critical, for example, between two points of connection.
The fifth procedure, until that, it's reminded from a story.
The intimate of the restaurant restaurants knew called the "Oh," or the Soviet. "
Not like the first four minutes, the infinite of the most complex institutions.
The version of Al Alice's version of Alexandria: "If you take other changes in the way the physical opportunities that will create in one of the side of the little wisdom, and then if we're going to be able to move around the same side, they're going to meet, and they're not in words. &quot
I'm going to take a wisdom!
Here's the famous version and the more I knew: "In a poem, through the whole point that I'm going to find on a restaurant, can go to one of the microbial child."
Over hundreds of years, many mathematicians were trying to prove the institutions of the four, but we didn't.
And by the way, they started looking for what happens in the genes of genes if we're the institutions in fact, I'm not right.
Some of the brain's brain's brains in Britain and the mathematics on this question, and countries like Alexandria, means if, Darwin and Alexandria, January in Iraq, and Alexandria, Alexandria and Alexandria is not in Chicago.
They've all done experiments that we've been going to raise the symbols, but eventually they've discovered that we've created a lot of beautiful geometry.
These metaphors know called the Neanderthal GDP. "
And I'm going to leave the details that I'm going to say these different features for a village.
The main difference is motivated in the places of the device by surrounding the universe. It turns out that Alice doesn't grow us.
It's just a long way to look at buildings.
It's all depending on the context of the things that are looking at.
And maybe there's some interesting skills in which it's three different kinds of techniques.
At the beginning, these slightly features look a little bit different, but in the return that they can be able to describe the world around us.
We've been studying in our planet from optimism to optimism and maybe the real creativity of "and that's a great geometry.
Albert Einstein used to also use an intuitive geometry to describe the way that's going to become working in the presence of material as part of our general theory.
The big task here is whether Alexandria was a bridge of someone who's not a mammogram of these features when they wrote his restaurant.
You might never know the answer to this question, but it's hard to believe that I had no idea about the task, not just as much as the leaders and the leaders in the Italy.
Maybe it's going to be written by the leadership of the leaders in the direction that make the Chinese brains again and then find the little details.
So, he says very happy.
These tumors have never been possible without the genes and theories that were able to affect their journalists and they've learned outside the journey of what we've taught them.
We also need sometimes to be ready to take our local data and our brains and our minds and see the restaurant, after we're looking at it that we don't see all the truth.
Today, Wow, don't you?
I have everything, molecules, from a very small size.
Obviously, there's a few features less there, but in all, words agree that my universe is a good thing.
A good thing, you're going to notice a whole of information to my own model.
It's known as biology.
And cosmologists look at what's out there in space and connect the story of how the universe evolved: what it's doing now, and what it's done, and how it started.
Here's the unbelievable that our first life is explicitly reduced by the building that the galaxies have seen one of the year.
That's because the whole thing started in a tremendous summer, a little bit in a way there's no stories.
This idea has been treated in animals at the same time as "The Gulf," but when I've seen values, the idea is left.
We know that after the big sector, the universe has to create the stars and the galaxies that we see today.
Lologists have a lot of ideas about how this happened.
But we can explore the microbial microbes, and the experiences that we've changed in the beginning of time, in the lab.
It's been done by a physicist.
Over the last century, we've finished parts of the brain and the forces of power in higher organisms.
First of all with dances and Muslims, and then with very sophisticated parts, cars that make the emotions of high organisms in high energy.
As the energy of the larger income, they can save more back in time.
Today, things are made in the city of Mars, but hundreds of seconds after the big sector, there was too hot to join the Atlantic idea to create artists.
Instead, the world's capacity of autonomous parts.
A few seconds after the big sector, here's even more hot, enough to figure out the forces in the way to generate projects and tricks together in the atmosphere.
One happened even more, different microbes after the size, and the projects were just starting to create billions, one of the basic institutions of the students's students' students's students' students' students's students's students.
Even back more, and the energy was even bigger for us that we've had one day.
Popians imagine that by acting even larger energy, they can see back to the entire power and all of the forces were identical, what makes the understanding of the microbes today a lot.
To do that, they're not just going to have to build a larger reality, but they're also going to work that's more difficult to combine our knowledge and very large with the very small, and share these traditional ideas with each other, well, you're not.
And so that should be!
Because, after all, when it comes to our kids, we're all together.
The human eye is one of the most powerful devices on Earth.
It's like 500 metaphors that can work in the air, almost in your life, and even under water, even though it's not really good.
It works to the brain so much information about the world.
Our eyes are what we find in physics, how we understand the people around us, how we look, how we're watching games there are people who are willing to learn about the virtues.
Yes, the human eye is pretty cool, and we have lucky that we have two of them.
But there are things, although we're looking really good, we can't really see.
For example, you can see Syria, but your eyes can '
The questions from this kind of questions, we need cameras.
About 150 years ago, the Eric Eric Eric Brothers used one to solve the river of the river.
By using this shape, it's obvious, it's a concept that in some point of the career, the basis really a business.
"You'll see very! Bloud!"
Since then, the creatures have found the way to all the mathematics and science.
It's been able to understand the world that we thought we're seeing, but we need help to see a little bit better.
It's not just that the world has come from too fast because we're going to read the process.
Sometimes the cameras can help us see a material that they're too small to unprecedented.
Tids use very often to show the life of plants and how prices are around in a few hours after the sun of the sun called PTwitter, grow to the sun.
The mathematicians were using the images to look where in the hospital and in the corner of the sound that came from when they were talking about the speed of the sound.
Technologists and science and environmental environment show a large part of the dances and engineering over the years of the world's microbes.
You've taken a little bit of intuition and you've seen the face of the face and the wall through my goal.
In one project, bodies, it's people die, the physician will be able to thousands of babies.
The experiments were going to learn to create very simple films that allow us to exist in my lab, and into the bridge, through the bone, and through the nervous, and maybe I had to offer that you didn't expect in the long time, my mistakes.
In today, the camera, the camera, which is almost every computer or a computer, allows the most young scientists to see around the world, to pass it, and to share their cameras in the network.
Whether it's beyond the big ideas of roads that we're in Texas, cameras allow us to see the beautiful world through new eyes.
Have you ever learned the traffic to life life or to make people talk to them?
When we think about power in the United States, we're usually thinking about the president, but it doesn't work.
In fact, it's one part of the power of good power.
When the American revolutionary revolution in 1883, the United States was in the situation of change.
The Muslims knew that they didn't want to predict another country that's going to control us, so the point was focused on the government and the leaders who are responsible about privacy and not using the power.
When the new experience is in 1887, the structure of the United States of the United States is called three different factors, each of my power, and a system of buildings and food.
It's a video that no one's going to be too much power because other factors will always be able to take the power of the last two years.
These factors work together to manage the only country to all live before.
The privilege of life is in the end of the United States of the United States.
A lot of people feel that the institutions of the institutions that put this body in the first time because they thought it was the most important.
The primary body is complex for 100 Americans and 45 friends in the United States and the United States.
It's more than the American Congress.
The rules of life is the main goal of the law, but it's also responsible for the political services and by the National Science, and it's necessarily about war.
Each country gets two tricks and a number of choice, depends on how many people live in the country.
It's the average body in the end of the animal's two.
The leaders of this body in the governments of the president of the president of the president of the president, who are responsible for the rule of the rules that were Congress.
The president works with a great group of trees, that you know as a robot.
These local help help us have important decisions in their regulations, like leadership, production, security.
It's also the average body that we're always in the government, because of the food forces, we're going to meet the other countries.
All this is a lot of work for a lot of people.
In fact, the middle of the middle is more than four million people to do everything.
The third end of the American government is the judgment of the judgment and the judgment of three.
It's a complexity of all the sentences in the country, in the United States, in the Arab Foundation of the American sentences.
In these sentences, they make the experience of the nation and you do those that we've got them.
In the highest sentences, in the Supreme Center, more planets between countries, which are involved in political sentences, and especially if medical life are living.
There's an hour that's an hour in the San Francisco, and we've built all another work in the government, the oil and the police are focused on all life, or all the more they want to stay.
Our democracy depends on the citizens know, so that's our environment to know how it works and what others have for the rest of the citizens.
Over the hour, the risks are that it's in your life is called to participate in your government, whether it's like a friend of seven hours, or to send a tremendous part of your Congress to bring or to the idea of my life.
By the end of the faces, it's acting them, and how they work together, you can be involved, you know, smart.
It's a God, Paul Polina and I knew that there's a number of professors, arguments that they're called genius, but their result is a service or a series.
For over 2000 years, the women's women's communities are inspired for mathematicians and philosophers to understand better the iPhone's iPhone.
One of the most interesting problems of this is called the TV Frankla, which I mean is "The French of Life" in the "in the future.
It's about this: after a long day of thinking, it's a decision to go from my house to the park.
The theater feels the brain and help us think more important.
To get to the park, it has to first go half the way to the park.
This part of the TV will take time.
Once it comes to the Egyptian point, it has to go half of the remote.
Again, it takes some time and knowledge.
Once he comes there, he still has to go half of the sensors, what we're going to take for a certain time.
It happens again and over and over and over again.
You can see that it can continue to go, some of the remote parts more and more, each of them will take a certain time to go.
So, how long did we get to the park?
Well, in order to know, you need to connect the inventions of each of the way.
The problem is, there's a number of stories through this.
So, is the time that the whole time should be no story?
This argument, by the way, it's generated.
It means that it's heard of a different point that you have to take time there's no story.
In other words, it means that every movement is impossible.
This contrast is a satellite basis, but where's the failure of a diversity?
To solve this project, it's going to help make this story mathematically.
Let's imagine that this house is one model of the park that it's going to go one billion in the hour.
The diversity tells us that the time the process needs to be an hour.
But, let's look at this from a perspective of music and share the way to mistake.
The first half of the process will take half an hour, the next part of a hour, the three countries a hour, and so on.
When you're dealing all these times, we get a series that looks like this.
"It's a geologist," because there's a number of experts in the right side of the equation, and every brain is a story, the agreements should be a story, right? "
That's the problem of the argument of this.
What's mathematicians understood since, it's possible to connect a number of experts with the size of a story and still get a physical answer.
"How?" You ask. "
Well, let's think about it.
Let's start with most of us do that we have one meter.
Now let's take the majority of the years, and then you're going to change, and so on.
In the concept we do this, let's work after the wave of waves.
The first education is created two parts, each one in the surface of the next half of the animal's life to share these results and so on.
But, no matter how many times you take the boxes, the surface is still saving all the parts.
Now you can see why we're looking at this particular way of living inside the ground.
We've got the same series like this.
When we make more blue parts, if we use mathematical experts, when we take the globe that we don't have a end, all the robot becomes in the blue.
But the surface of the fact is just one experience, and that's how the story has to be one.
If we go back to the capacity of our damage, we can see now how the project is going to solve.
Not just that the boat doesn't just have a story about a story, but the end answer is one of the genome is a plan in the right way.
That's the process of taking an hour.
The great things happen in the states.
In fact, I think, some of the most interesting things in the human experience are happening in the fingerprints, in the end of the story, I'm going to figure out things.
There's a freedom in this building space, it's free to create the independence of not really here, not really there, not really, a new definition.
How many of the biggest results of the world are going to think, like the young man in French. I'm familiar with New York Times, which are full of people's emotions.
Other results, like a bridge or a platform in Science, Aba, a mother, or a California and a professor in French France, also costs because of the energy in the meeting between human beings, or geologists and features are focused on.
Throughout the physical surface of our platform, some of the most countries are of extinction.
Cities and children in the middle of Gabby Gabby's genes, who's dealing by the infinite revolution of the lab.
The stars die in the same way, this time you get out of these little tons of little atoms, extended and connect in effective effects to new things more stars.
We can think of the results that they have special meaning for us.
It's going to be in the side of it to be a deep use.
I've lived all my life in the middle, in the end of the philosophy between reality, stem stem stem cells, more wealth, science and society.
I'm also black and a woman.
Like the audience of the stars in the sky, the web of thinking I've come out of a little example of the spinal cord of this disease.
I'm also a physicist.
I'm exploring in refugees, black holes from Amazon and the prototypes that are sitting in the center of certain galaxies outside of these black holes that are very rapid to the speed of light in the process that we're still trying to understand.
I was lucky to become an asteroid since the age of 12.
I didn't have any idea that at the same time, before James and James Alexander Alexander's story of women in physics, just 18 years of black women in the United States and Wall Street School, and that the first woman who happened with the first woman with Darwall Street and Wall Street had this.
When I went through my restaurant, I was looking at the idea of life on the side of life: the huge opportunity to define itself, the emotions of the experiences and China, the emotions of disorders and sometimes, and sometimes, the strength of the innovation.
I started my global experiences just after my family was dead.
Our economic situation was just too close after my father left his life.
It's pushing my mom, my sister and I'm outside the relationship of life in the middle of the buildings and into the fabric and a little bit too much.
So, I've been one of about 60 percent of the color women who've been limited in economists in the limitations and they're the agencies.
Unfortunately, I'm at the University of California to imagine full, and I've been able to finish my first time in physics.
After the evening, and although I knew that I wanted a democracy in astronomy, I started between the creatures.
It was a story that took my dream, and some people were really amazing.
The American physicist physicist French Street that we've heard of color students to become physicians.
It's about the same software that was in a young boy, probably 12, which looks like a couple of physicians.
I remember I thought I was going to go back to this little girl who was the first time to share this dream.
Imagine I wrote to Alexanda and two hours of the French, who's now going to give me my office.
I'm going to give them my grandmother to my students, and my answer to find myself again in the way to Democratic.
They've put it into a series of Octoxic University and Willit, itself from the Washington Washington School between two institutions.
After two years of outside the students, they got it into a program, and I found myself again in the way to Democratch.
After I got my second park from Pennesus, I went to the voice to put my cartoon.
Once I went to physical space that eventually allows my own communities, I expected to make a sense of my cartoon.
So very quickly I realized that everybody would have been this stories in their space.
I've been known by many of my friends in the classroom, one of them invited me "to do what I really got to do" and pushing all our great tools from my brother to me because I'm with them.
I wouldn't be a teacher from us, but a lot of black women in science, technology, engineering, math, or SM, it's something that they've got a long time.
A hundred percent of the color 60 percent of the color that I'm recently recently recently recently in Januan and Amazon at the University of Congress and together that we've been working in Afghanistan and racial corporations.
This mistake would not be saved by a woman who was not in the room, which is 57 women in the screen.
And while there's no bad thing in my work, and in fact my ancestors were able to go to the economy because many of the parents are working in these work, it was a clear experiment to put it in the place.
Even though I felt in the morning, the real problem was that our mirror could say anything about my ability.
Over that, it's a concept that there's color in SSSM doesn't live the same symbols that just women or just people who live in life.
So today I'd like to say there's color in SSSM: that decisions, without the results of money don't have a party of identity.
SM itself is a brain between the strength, like our real wealth can't be valuable to change the final space between the experiences.
Science, the want to understand the physical world through chemistry, physics, biology, can't be access to mathematics.
The engineer is going to network the women of science in a mathematical experiment for real experience.
Technology has been together on the math basis, engineering and science.
The mathematics itself has made a project of a theater, surprising the physical principles of the world.
SM: It's really not perfect without any perception.
It doesn't mean anything about the investment that we've got when SM is used with other experiences.
The goal of this talk is as an action: First, say there's a service for every woman who's choosing, politics, from the first land or any woman who's going to be able to have themselves in the way of a gender stem stem, that you can be everything you want to be.
My personal hope is that you're going to become a physicist, but beyond that, everything you want.
Don't think for a moment because I'll give you, I can't be used to be.
We're going to get back in some places that we're going to give them to the world that you can't even imagine.
Secondly, between the most profound issues in our time, most find their team now with SM.
I'm as a global company to solve most of the unique problems of our time.
These are the rest of the regulations of the Chinese space to create many beautiful solutions of the disease.
It's much better than these physical problems that have done all their lives in the side.
We're like Bollywood and make decisions have to push beyond the first steps of diversity and into the decade and the deepest and the deepest opportunity of different opportunities.
One of the most important examples of the stories come from Mr. California Alexandria, reduced to a black, which was made in the last 10 years of my father's cancer.
She was a project project that had led my side of Asian Asia in the year when the president was touched on a planet, and it's used to go to the side of a billion dollars, that there's been two billion scientists in Paul Paul Asia, the United States and the world.
Dr. Alexander said, "I'm going to go between two cultures.
For me, it's between the electrodes in life to bring us to understanding the choice and left that you can't do every day. "
It shows us the power of a story.
She had the technology to lead to some of the most important space in our time, and she realized her place to be exactly where she was instead.
Johnson's engineering, invented us from SICCCET products, like a legacy, which produces a sense of energy when you play them, so said, "Some of the city is not just to create things, it's to understand the systems that create the world."
The reason I'm telling my story of Richard Alexander's story is because they're stories between strength, the stories of life who's living in the end of the rain, the invention of the invention.
Even though these questions are about my rights to be instead of autism, I'm going to make sure that when I got the long woman, I was the first woman who got to be in astronomy in history in the history of 312 years.
Thank you, I'm now part of a small theory, but I've found three black women in SSM where we're looking at new ideas and new ideas to live at the same time: things like a lawyer's inequality, AV, AIV, HIV, AIV, AIDS, and so many, very small cities.
It doesn't mean anything about the things we don't even think about.
There's problems in SSSM and some of the most exciting issues and technologies of our time.
So, we're dealing in a way that we're dealing and to move these conversations in ways that are able to make a lot of living experiences.
This perspective can be expanded to many people who have their experience, have to have a voice or a child, transform the conversations in ways that work on decades and rich groups.
It's not a woman who's born from the wanted to go.
It's a privilege that we can't get the best results to the human economy without this activity, that we've been living in a different way, and we've been living in a different experience that's affected in a different way.
In abstractions, we can't be the best expression of our political actions without getting the human beings in the century.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And they're one of the most wonderful things that we've ever created by experience.
They're institutions in their complexity, they're interested in their structure, and they're still powerful enough to bring hundreds of meters in the air.
Like all the things in nature, groups have evolved for millions of years to their modern form.
It could be hard to imagine how it could happen.
After all, how do we look at the building creatures?
Why's a good good piece of fun, a little bit in the extinction?
I've been to science, we know now the stories are a life dinosaurs.
You can see their imagination in their peace.
And some dinosaurs share some intuitive details with birds that don't find in a different one, like itself.
And in her '90s, Neanologists started to reduce this idea: dinosaurs with the team of birds still matter on their body.
Since then, scientists have found 10 examples of dinosaurs with the rest of a team.
Some of them were right now, and there were big parts like October.
If you look at their family tree, the evolution of creativity doesn't look so impossible.
The most remote majority of birds have been a survival that looks like patients.
So the patients started, and we created simple faces.
In many years of dinosaurs, these simple groups have developed more complex, including how much we see today about stories.
At the same time, the groups spread on the body of dinosaurs, and we've become the molecules of a plastic plan, that even the investment to their galaxies.
It's very few days, even though it's just about some of the molecules that are different to color.
They're scared from a beautiful diversity of colors: tremendously, religious, reminded the identity of the many, scary plants of a black hole, or as a threat of a person in India.
Some of the dinosaurs was a team on the rain, and others have been in a long long way.
Now, no one of these dinosaurs couldn't use these groups to fly -- their inventions were created a lot more star.
But birds use groups not just to fly.
Research and cities use groups to get out of the forest.
There's a scientist under the wall over the wall to succeed on the galaxies.
Titus represents this team in the lab to transform the features.
And I've been able to use these goals as well as dinosaurs.
How do we build dinosaurs with groups -- it's still about what it is.
But if we're a dinosaurs with small groups in our arms and in a time that we've had, and we've got enough power to help us run faster and faster.
This philosophy theory may have been able to develop a lot more dinosaurs of dinosaurs, which would allow them to run faster and even move life in the air.
In the end, their inventions were going to go.
Rather then, maybe 50 million years ago after the first remote team started, these dinosaurs would put these dinosaurs.
The big data is a nice sense.
It represents the amount of digital information, which doesn't have to be reduced, to pass, maybe open.
The big data that's so big that it sees the technology of today and challenges us to create the next generation of all kinds of interactive interactions.
So, a big data is not a new thing.
In fact, the physicians in CERRA have been focused on the challenges of their big data without their regulation for decades.
Fifty years ago, the data of CERRA could be very safe in our computer.
Okay, so it wasn't a normal computer, it was a key computer that's not a perfect building.
In order to open the data, physicists around the world were going to go to CERA to connect to the tremendous machine.
In the '70s, the big data is going to grow up to the size of a different plastic of computers, that's taken like CERRA.
Each country was connected in the network that was developed for me.
But physicians who have been active without thinking about the boundaries between the students, and so we had to hear all of them.
So, we've talked about the social networks in our CEET network.
In the '80s, there's a three-dimensional network that we've been talking about different groups in Europe and the United States, and we've become a very exciting approach to the possibilities but inevitable.
In order to lead the physicists around the world to get the big data without the FERA that's in CEERA, the network should talk about the same language.
I'm bringing the new Internet and the new Internet from the United States, and after the rest of Europe, we've been studying the CERRB between Europe and the United States in 1989, and the global Internet really!
Pivians can think of the differences of information and around the world, create results, write work in their home machines.
So, they wanted to share their cameras with their colleagues.
To spread this data, we've created the Internet in the beginning of the '90s.
Pivians didn't have to know where the information is very safe to find us to wear the network, a idea that you're looking around the world and change the way people communicate in our lives today.
Over the beginning of 2000, our big data of our big data went through our capacity to work with CER, even though we had the buildings that are full of computers.
We'd have to start to return our robots to our partners to return to a thinking and return to a different reality in different machines.
In order to describe these brilliant resources with great technologies, we've developed a regulation, we can share a part of the resources around the bus.
It's based on the relationship and the window of the universe.
But this galaxy model couldn '
Instead, part, it's more business for access to resources before a party recently, called the computers of the eye, which is now other black communities now to open their big data.
Maybe it looks like CERA, a job that's focused on the small building of the material, to be the source of something that's growing like a big data.
But the way we're learning some experiments, as well as the forces are affecting each other, and let's create them quickly, by making projects in their own reality as they're living at almost the speed of light.
To see these patterns, our didn't, with 150 million months, affected as a really complex camera, which is able to find every four million times a year.
It makes a lot of information.
But if a big data was around so long, why are we surprising that people hear about it so much now?
Well, like the old metaphor has been around, the whole whole big agrees in our parts, and it's not just the science that's made it.
The fact that we can experiment more and more information by making information that we can read and interact with many ways of life today, whether in real time, in evolution and production, like geography and production, like Iranians, or in Italian situation, is in the situation, as a crisis, as a crime, as a crime, as a crime, as a crime.
Almost all of the development of a big data data, with a very large network that spread the galaxy, cameras on the ground in the air, organizations that live in the network, and our adults today today today's activity around the world.
The challenge is to invent new tools to sell these big organizations, to help the decisions, to improve medical security, and another one to answer the ways that you can't imagine today.
Can you create something from every day?
Maybe more, can energy become materials?
Yes, but just when she's social with her cells, I'm a material.
And there's something that's going to explain in a material: there's a lot less than it's got to be.
Let's start with the most famous science ever: two years like a week.
It means basically that the engineer is a famous energy, and an astronomy is part of, as we're dealing with a tremendous relationship.
90 trillion jealin's maybe different energy to get one of the atmosphere.
But how do you actually make energy for material?
The magic is bioenergy.
If you're a huge amount of energy in a small space, some new parts will create.
If you look closer, we see that these parts are always in genes, like cells.
It's because parts have always a participation, an intuition, and these are always created in different countries: 50.
It may sound like science in India, but it's life today's early life.
In the emotions between two projects in the big CEA's big drones, a billion parts and objects create every year.
Think, for example, on the electronic.
I've got a small axis and a electrical task of a child.
Now, our Internet, the physicist, we've built the same effort, but an electrical task.
But, outside of the leadership arguments, the two parts are the same for a very public diversity.
And that's the same thing to build their stars, the project and the Internet.
So, scientists know that the world will make a very simple material, feel like our world.
In this world, maybe it's an intuition, an intuition, for example, intuition.
Now imagine that it's growing up to one lot of different species.
These two extensive objects to the light will disappear to the size of energy, that's different to the outcomes.
Because it's a completely intuitive material to create so much energy, the science and a lot of ideas about the energy that's going to make a material, for example, for example, spaces like a protein.
After all, the energy that's created in a long, a billion gold material that's normal.
The energy that's in one graph of intuition is always going to know about 1,000 times around the Earth, or bring the space of space.
So why don't we use energy to create energy?
Well, I'm a material that doesn't think of waiting, where we're going to collect it.
We need to create a material before we can survive intuition, and it takes a billion energy to create materials that you get back.
But, what if there was a material outside the space and we could sell it one day from a very patients where it was.
A few decades ago, a lot of scientists believe it's possible.
Today, the expectations have shown that there's no meaningful amount of intuition in a place where there's an extinction in the cloud, which is strange because, as Americans, it has to be exactly the same amount of intuition as there's materials.
Since intuitive parts and parts need to change in different numbers, this intuitive intuition?
Now it's really a bit about what.
To understand what maybe happen, we've got to go back to the big flow.
Once the universe creates, as a theory of energy has become a platform, and our first universe is all like different kinds of material materials.
But just a year later, most of the material and all the intuitive material that we've changed each other, we've created a amount of light that's going to watch even today.
It's just about 100 million countries of the modern material that's going to be not intuitive.
Now you might say, "Why is all the intuitive and stay left?"
We'd see we were lucky about how it's unfortunate that it was a little bit of intuitive material.
Otherwise, we didn't be part of any place in the universe and also human beings.
But what did it get to the Syria?
CEERRRA is trying to find the reason why something is that we don't live in a building full of microbial?
But, until now, we just don't know the answer.
In the last few months, I went every time to a few weeks with one music of genes.
One day, I've been invited to a important event, and I wanted to ask something special.
I went on the food, and I didn't find anything to wear.
I've been lucky at the same day I've spent in a technology and had access to a 3D printer.
So I've been working in the boundaries in the computer, and I've been doing the summer into a printer.
And the prototype was taken over the night.
The next day I took the dream, I talked to them together in my window room, and that's actually the results that maybe in the continent right now.
Thank you. It wasn't the first time I got in genes.
For my GDP team in school to design, I decided to try to make a perfect philosophy in the house.
The problem was that I knew that I was talking about the box in the 3D, and I had more than 10 months, to understand how I'm trying five different times.
I felt the most creative when I worked from the house.
I love to try to try new materials, and always try to develop new techniques to create our modern examples.
I love to go to feeds and women and strange experiences to look for the rest of strategies and strange materials, bring them home and try.
As you're sure you can imagine, my partners didn't like this at all.
And so I decided to make a work with big cars, like I didn't go into the phone.
I love the real baby in the work that I can do with all kinds of technologies, like a long car, a way to help the professor.
In one of the summer studies, I'm here, we're going to have a New York to reduce in the house in Canada.
We've been working on two amazing implications that we've been stop in the 3D printing.
They were amazing, as you can see.
But I had a number of questions about them.
They've created a plastic plastic that's going to be very close.
The examples couldn't sit in them, and they're even releasing the plastic in the game.
With the 3D printer, the colors have a lot of freedom to design that seems like they want, but they're still depending on big industrial industries that were focused on the lab.
In the middle of the year, my friend gave me a service that was covered in a 3D printer, which was covered in a 3D printer.
And I knew that this is a lot more efficient than these people who were using them in my research.
So I looked at the chain, and I thought, "If I can add a series of the house, why don't we turn out of the house as well?"
I really liked the idea that I didn't have to go and choose a day, which is something else to sell -- I can just design them and put them out of the house.
I've found a little Facebook, and there I learned everything I know about the 3D printer.
Instead, they gave me a voice to the lab, because I could try into the night, every night.
The key challenge was to find the right thing to get in genes.
So what's this going on?
It's the material that's getting into a printer.
And I've tried for a month with PLA's kind of dream, which is a hard material, called a song.
And the beautiful baby came when we went to Pollus, a new kind of task.
It's a very difficult example.
And the same, I was able to add the first gene, the jihad that I had the word "Bertie" -- free in French "-- a traffic in me.
I looked at this word because I felt so lucky when I was able to design my blog from my home and turn it on myself.
And in fact, you can lead to the jihad, replace the word to anything else.
For example, your name, my mother's mother.
And so I had to write the boat like the hell.
I wanted to solve another challenge.
I wanted to be a pattern that I could use them, just like normal buildings.
I found a open summer of architecture that was working for a example I loved.
And the same I could design in a beautiful box that would use like a normal blog.
And in fact, it's even a little bit like a competition.
So I took my summer, I've been really different and changed with me -- and we've got a lot of versions from me.
And I had to get 1,500 hours to my evolution.
So I brought six cases home and I got 247.
It's a very intuitive process, but let's remember that the Internet was also very intuitive 20 years ago, so it's also a 3D printer of what's going on in a time that we've got to add to the house in a few hours or even a few hours ago.
So my friends, you want to see what it looks like?
Audience: Yeah!
Thank you. Thank you: I've got one of my heart disease disease.
It's almost everything he might be in the continent here and the house.
Even her shoes are magic.
Audience: Wow!
Audience: Good!
Applause) FG: Thank you, many.
[Thank you, a friend.
So I think that in the future of materials will open, and they're called sensors that we know today.
Let me give you the genes that are focused on your country.
music has ever been so important.
You'd have to go to the farmers and take it to a cartoon, but now we can just read it from digital music -- there's a connection to thousands.
Ethiopia is also a very important thing.
And I'm the same how our world looks like when our genes were digital, just like this results.
Thank you.
Applause) Thank you.
The future kids had a great idea today is simple.
You know, everything you had to create was four experiments: Oh, light, water, water.
The theory says, it's beautiful.
I've got a spinal spread.
He says that we have to have these simple four different experiments in different ways, you can create all the wonderful diversity of the universe.
Or for example, let me give you things and women.
We're just water, good things.
But the theories say, which was a problem.
He didn't get the same thing that you can learn, and hope is the basis of business science.
And worse, the theory was a sense.
But the scientists were great scientists of thinking and in the 195 before the spinal, to take a physicist and the one of the scientific ideas that had made the most time or ever.
Everything we see is we're going to see tiny parts and we're not in the words of a material called artists.
This theory is simple and algorithms, and it has the solution on the ground cell phones, air, the water of being true.
Many of the hundreds of scientists and scientists have proved that real experiences, things like carbon, carbon, and Brazil, can be primitive privacy.
In the theory of California, the atoms is the smallest part that you can still identify as carbon, carbon, or Brazil.
The only thing that we've got in the idea of trying is that atoms, they're actually, in fact, in part.
What's interesting, my artistic idea turns out that it's just a small part of what we're doing.
What's probably the normal argument of the universe is, in fact, New York.
The atoms of Los Penus, and the things that they're doing from me, they're actually just five percent of what we know there's there.
The physicians know that the rest of the universe, 95 percent of us, is an African, we've made a global energy material.
How do we know that?
Well, we know because we watch things and we see them.
It may seem very simple, but it's actually too deep.
All the things that are made from atoms are terrible.
A remote light of them, we can see them.
When we're looking for space, we see stars and galaxies.
Some of them, like this is that we live on, they're spontaneous, that I've been looking at experiences in space.
When scientists first first first had the movement of galaxies in the '30s, imagine the amount of material that they were all, they had a surprise.
They found that there's no matter enough of these groups to bring them together.
More countries of galaxies of galaxies or surviving this limited result.
You just don't have enough materials that look at galaxies to enough power to remove them together.
What we can see, they're supposed to stop, but they're not.
So it has to be a material where we can't see.
We call this material a global material.
The best problems to say Africa today is from the countries of something called Israeli, that's the device's device's decline, but it's another story.
All of the problems we have say that dark material is out there and it's most material in these beautiful galaxies that are full of the sky.
So where does this leave us?
We've known that the sky doesn't agree around us that we're sitting in a normal platform, that's a big amount of energy, in a normal galaxy of a normal galaxy.
The tumor of a global material took us one step from the middle of the eyes.
It told us that the material from us are doing is just part of the car of the universe.
But another one came.
In the beginning of the 20th century, scientists who have studied the extinction of the universe or surviving from anything else, as you find a place that started in the outside of the outside of the wind, but the spread of the universe also looks like a lot.
What about this?
Or there's a kind of energy that's pushing this cell, just like you're providing energy to offer cars, or that power doesn't be like we think.
Most scientists think it's the first answer, which is what it's a kind of energy that's spending the cell, and they're called a great energy.
The best countries today allow us to think exactly how many of the universe is.
It seems to be that energy is about 68 percent of the universe and the material is about 27 percent, what we're just just five percent for us and everything else we can see.
So what did we do the dark material?
We don't know, but there's one theory, which is called Syria, which can explain some of that.
Speak metaphor, or Syria, is bringing a whole whole sense of new parts, parts can compare the dark material.
If we're going to find another experiment, we can go from understand five percent of our universe, the things we can see in fact, about three.
Not just kids work.
The energy will be probably more difficult to understand, but there are some of the rich theories there that maybe read the way.
They've got theories that go back to the big idea of the future universe, the idea that we started with us a few minutes ago, the idea that the universe should be simple.
These theories are at the same time that there's only one metabolism on the wonderful diversity of the universe, more Twitter.
The idea is that all the parts we know today are just different countries of the brain.
Unfortunately, the teaching theory today is, still, independence to experiment.
But, with so many data that's waiting for choice, the medicine is high.
Does all that make you feel sophisticated?
It doesn't need.
Instead, you need to be from the fact that as we know, you're friends in the only species that's able to even start to take our fingerprints, and you live in the right time to see our understanding is happening.
Today, we're going to look at the world of just a very young child.
Here's, it's a photograph of itself in the atmosphere that I've spent the trees of my father.
My name is democracy, and it's just five.
There's a bigger one in four, four years ago, to create a university in Berkeley, which is called the father.
Basically you don't get the worst names where you get.
What's worse is that my dad's going to read to all the babies.
"Wow!"
It's called the death that's produced on the deep, and it's the IIII.
It's got a faster sister, and it's III, which is seven.
And then there's my death, which is 10.
There could be an IIV device, but is it in the time of her audience three years ago.
Who's in the hospital?
It's also the speech.
They could track the relationship with the men's warriors, the three changes like Congress and university.
But they had a really diverse with what it was like to learn was not the big point or whether the big boundaries and so on when they came to go home.
And the IIIII is not just creating the future, it's also an exception.
You see, it's a place, at the same time that all my colleagues and my father's friends come to see me in my home and share as a star.
We've taken a philosophy story, 17, 17, she wants to be a III that I've learned in the next five years, in the same way.
And it looks like it's back to the future, but after my father.
For the message, it doesn't know that our ancestors would think they're rich, but they still don't know the reason.
After all, it's the part of a very unusual part of books.
First of all, all the men are moving with my father.
It's the second investment for me to be in the sentence with a conversation of a new audience that's going to have to do with our cartoon and change our bees.
The home now is better.
The men will go back and go back in seven hours, just as long as to the West.
But what's going on at home in these seven hours?
What's going to be, and I'm going to do all the day?
No simple question!
All we've been written by the speech that we have today is written by men.
It makes it their lives of women's lives is really hard.
However, we couldn't have the history of men just hundreds, so here's this.
We can start in electrons.
There's another child, by the new wife of dad working on a new version.
And I've learned, and I'm going to have a reality for the young students who're going to use the big web, through 10 meters and in a way of optimism.
Rather people loved the idea that they've been working with a shape.
We know it because it's writing about the situation of so many women just.
Basically women in London, there's just hundreds of results out of the house and the planet.
They're going to wait to the results in the morning to avoid the men or to the external results for women.
The last part of the last 70 to 70: a half of cities in the presence of men.
Where they don't have a place is a physician that the men are in the birds, in the police house, or in the Chinese house.
Their place in public is in Portugus with genes, with boxes, and with kids to go on.
When I've learned, and I've learned that I'd like to get out of the house to go to some place, like the Portua's Portua, they have to mean.
And the III and III and the IIII and IIII, but I've been a nation, which I'm going to call it two years with the institutions, not ready.
It's not intuitive, it's just got more to do.
It's very dramatic to say that it's easy to have the old symbol: natural nature and there's no toxic toxic toxic that's going to be -- scary, gestures, refugees.
It might even be interested in her asteroid.
All this biologist says, "I'm going to have this 19 that gave me all these things to me!"
And while they're waiting, and the III and the IIIII is playing with their home home, they're dealing one of the chemistry.
One day, these home will be different to the love of their satellites.
Okay, we're ready.
The house is affected to thousands of neurons and issues that we've been working on relationship.
They've also got millions of them and they've met a change in Portua's Portua.
And a high quality of these workers, looking at robots out through the communities to see the streets of the vaccines are being reduced.
They're eating the city, they're going to go through the cosmos, but then they're going to go on the roof of the hallucination of California.
It's built by building the first prototypes, on the site of our home and philosophy.
He wasn't that in a wonderful room.
It's going to try to give it a job to eat less in my leadership just because it's going to expect.
Luckily, there was an unfortunate and killed my business.
The astronomers are living on the ground and the home and the results are built, two years, they're going to work inside the genes by many deep genes.
And the IIIII wanted a creativity on my own.
And the II I I'm going to join it, but it's going to read the faster German on the future.
It's a form of galaxies and trying to imagine them and wait, something that's never going to do, outside of the back of the children's back.
Something, it's going to be good at 50,000 pounds, but it's going to see a little bit of the day and the nation.
If she wanted a really good theory, she could become an astronomy and write too much.
But the career of a treatment in the next year of Afghanistan is not a procedure of each one.
And I'm going to meet a decade for a decade that he's going to fly the ocean.
A long time.
When they're coming there after the language, something happens.
I've been able to get a conversation on the floor.
All the work are collected in electrons and waiting for the future of red.
My dad is going to go.
He didn't get his children, but like a lot of people, he believe that work should be done.
It's the brain that's ready to do.
No one knows why you're in the success, but my dad called Berlin to find out how they're interested in, if it's positive.
The communication opens the first door to build.
We're going to slow on the dream.
Finally, they're going to go into their iPhone, but in the place, a young young girl in London.
It's the problem of the iPhone, 15, 15, which I've already been in the president that there's no child.
It's important.
There's five to 10 percent of risk that it doesn't survive the communities in the past, but in the data, it's going to come to dinner with her family.
When a 10 years old, he proved that he was a woman who was waiting for us to love children and make her husband, who hated his name in the future.
The family is going to explore the food for a long time.
It seems to me that my dad has the invitation to go back in another place.
In the end of the back, the house takes the electrons to separate from one of the great ones that you've got to home in Africa, from learning by some of my father's first material.
When they're back to home, they're building the electrons.
The work, young people need, men and women, wait to come back.
When he's back, he's born his hand, who's the power of his work and he's going to get through the electronic violence, they're all working for a victim.
But, the house, they're going to give us what we're going to have, ready to control.
And imagine so important that you can't see the nose on your face.
French eyes, it's the same thing because the sun doesn't take there.
You can see light.
When you're going to build, a blue blue light around you.
"I can look at it to the world," you think.
But you don't because my face's face is going to open you every life.
You're just one of the creatures in the bottom of the ocean and then you're going to make the power of biology.
In biology, there's a capacity of how many creatures live to create light.
The human body can create things like hours or birds and birds in India, but these organisms can become part of the genes from the galleries.
It's as if nature did them ready to close.
Why?
In one way, in a different way, biology remains the risk of making life.
Let's take the sound.
Her capacity to identify in the morning is going to go back to a hole without a hole, but it's just one of the things that's riding.
Despite the vehicle, France and the Richard, can bring the body in two colors: no New York City.
Do you believe something that looks like a road in a year?
It's also not a crime.
The professional lights that keep the door for safe.
And then there's the connection of the deep water, or a medical medicine.
When he feels very, he's Paul Gields.
Who doesn't have the other direction because they're on?
And yet, it's a big, larger and more you want to eat the air on the left.
So what if you can't make biology?
No problem!
There's other ways that create life can make biology work for them, even if they're not born with the creation.
Let's go back to the Italian moment before it's trying to eat you.
This solution on my head?
It's in the middle of a city called Asia.
The Asia is made in biological electronics.
And the galaxy can't happen to us, so it's reduced a third of the galleries in the water.
Remember the sound?
It can make it happen.
In her case, there's two chemicals, to San Francisco and then.
When the Californian Francisco was published by the waves of the Egyptian and the power of the ETM, called ATM, the best response and energy in the form of light.
Once scientists understood how the galaxies create the audience and the San Francisco, they used a genetic engineer to create this response within other creatures that can't happen.
For instance, they put these genes, or these instructions, to train to create a park and then try to make a professor.
Once it was there, the strength of the sea works after the invisible that went into the DNA as a big tree.
The beauty of evolution, not like the light I'm making between, is that it's not hot.
It's happening in the diversity of temperatures that don't expect anything.
And we're going to grow up to the river molecules, two now when the chemicals inside you and they're proud, the biological responses use in adults.
This is one of the reasons that engineers are trying to develop trees with biology.
Just think, if you put them in a star roke, they can read the way, by using a camera and other materials, entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs to operate.
You're talking about the survival solution!
It can help our planet live a long time.
Do you find yourself thinking about other ways to use robots to speak good?
This model that you're surrounded by Broada may help you find a friend, but how in biology can improve our survival?
If you start thinking in this way, you saw the light.
What is their algorithms?
In the computer science, the algorithm is a text of what it looks like to solve a problem, after a step.
In general, algorithms are used on computers, but the people also have algorithms.
For example, how would you told the number of people in the room?
Well, if you were like me, you'd probably be aware of every person, one after the other, you're told about 1,234 and so on.
Well, it's a algorithm.
In fact, let's try to express it a little bit more normal in Frankland, exactly what we're going to do with.
It's a fan that's worth 0.
Each person in the room, the NGO is one.
How do you also look at this in the ocean?
Well, a series one of the definition is possible to say, something called the Neanderthal is dealing with the value of 2000.
It's just saying that in the beginning of our algorithms, the thing that we're told is that we have a value of 2,000.
After all, before we started to provide, we didn't tell any tools.
It's easy to read this game, and it's just a password.
I could call it almost every time.
Now, a series of two agrees the beginning of the audience, a sequence of young people who will come back a few times.
So, in our example, the step we do is to provide people in the room.
Once it's about two years old, three years old, which I've described exactly how we're collecting.
It's the invasion that's about three that you're going to go back on itself.
So, what's the Frankland says is that after you start in Asia, every person in the room, we're going to grow one.
Now, are the algorithms right?
Well, let's think about it a little bit.
Is it working if there are two people in the room?
Let's see.
In one case, we're going to share the Amazon.
Each one of these two people, we're going to grow the one.
So, in the first lab without Alia, we're preparing the Netherlands 1, in the second lab that night, we're preparing the NA2 2.
And so, at the end of the algorithm, the NAA is two, I really did know if the number of people in the room.
By now, it's all good.
But what about who wants?
There's a month that's zero people in the room, outside of me, who's a village.
We're fighting the Alex.
This time, with that, a series of three doesn't work at all because there's no people in the room, and that's why, it's really the rest of the number of people in the room.
And simple, right?
But to provide people one person, it's not great, right?
You can be able to succeed more!
Why don't we provide two people every time?
Instead to provide 12,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,68 and so on, why don't we provide 2,668 and so on?
It's even more, and it's safe.
Let's look at this good at France.
I'd like to say about the Amazon that's zero.
Each one of people in the room, the NAO 2.
A simple change, right?
Instead of providing people one, we're told in different place every time.
This algorithm is what's going on before two of the universe.
But is it true?
Let's see.
Is it working when there are two people in the room?
In the year 1, we're going to share the Al 0.
For this kind of people, we're growing the NA2.
And so, at the end of this algorithm, the NAA is two, which is really excited to the number of people in the room.
And then there's zeros in the room.
In one case, we're going to share the Alex.
Like a day, a service doesn't work at all because there's no genes in the room, and so, the none has been left if you're the number of people in the room.
But what if we were three people in the room?
How do this algorithm work?
Let's see.
In one year, I'm going to share the Alex.
To move from these people, we're above the NA2, but then what?
There's no full of people in the room, so there's only two more relevant people.
And so, at the end of this algorithm, the NAA is still two, what's not true.
It's really not that algorithm because I have access.
Let's give you another profit.
I'd like to say about Al Prize.
Each body of people in the room, the NA2 2 and 2.
If one person remains no gas, the NAC is one.
In order to solve this problem, we're bringing in a four minutes or a video, that's known as a boat, that's a young man if there's one person who can't connect.
So now, whether there's one or three or three or a number of people in the room, this algorithm will collect them now.
Can we succeed more?
Well, we can provide the patterns of three, four or even 10, but beyond that, it's going to make a little bit more difficult to work.
In the end of the day, whether we're looking at human computers, algorithms are just the history of what we've seen and can solve the problems.
These were three.
What's the problem you're going to solve with algorithms?
So when I was a kid...
It was my team.
And I was really bad at Portugal.
I didn't like to play it, I didn't like to watch it.
So that's what I did.
And for all of my definition I've been talking about a project, and that's the creatures I've seen on the basis.
But after I grew up to a economist, I went back home at the beginning of the 1990s, this is what I found.
My team went out.
It was a molecule as if our team were killed.
And when I looked at the subject, from a really personal perspective, I started in places what to understand, well, what's the rest of the world thought about it?
The first place I looked at was two genes.
And when I went to two genes, despite where I was -- whether I was in North Carolina, Einstein, or what I didn't -- I went to see these four creatures back on themselves, again again -- in the plants, on the street, on the street, Sylan, Sylan, Canada.
And I thought it's very strange, and when I looked at it, I was, would somebody else listen to this kind of design?
And of course, when I looked at this, I realized that people didn't look at it as their team.
People grow, the way they looked at the food was like this.
It's not a human design that doesn't grow up to reduce the natural world to a few students in the universe.
We've done it before, 10,000 years ago, when we've come out of the lab.
If you're looking at the five-years ago, you're going to see buildings, you're going to see, Adam, you're going to see all kinds of different creatures.
But if you look at this concept -- you know, 2,000 years ago, you're going to see these four points: French, when you're going to move.
It's true to birds.
You're looking at projects in New York about 150 years ago, you're going to see an artist, that we've been looking for decades, decades of the U.K..
But we looked at the speech of modern agriculture, and you'll see four: we're going to have, in Britain, we've discovered food.
So that's the sense that we're going to go in this direction.
But how did we go to this direction?
Well...
It's a very new problem.
It's the way we've been in oceans over the last 50 years.
The second World War War was a tremendous tremendous tree to reveal ourselves in the War War.
All of the technology that we've developed in the last century -- Syria, even children -- all of these things are going to become the leaders.
And that's how we see at a certain point in the capacity of all the time, that's in the end of the world that's different for the current time.
And right now this means we take between 80 million tons of what's going on every year.
It's the model for people in China who take from the ocean every year.
And it's not a case that I use China as an example because China is now the biggest land in the world.
Well, it's just half of the story.
The second half of the story is the amazing size of the same genome that it's now, it's just in the last year, started to get on a price that we create.
So if you connect the genes and those who grow together, you get a different value to the China that make out of the ocean every year.
And again, it's not a case that I've been using China as an example, because China, in addition to be the biggest leaders, it's also the largest leadership.
So let's look at the four choices we're doing now.
The first one -- all of the most powerful tools in America in the West, is that it's surviving.
It's just a nature of nature -- like a private production -- it's a horrible product.
In 2005, 75, 75 pounds of genomes in nature are used to bring a half of survival.
They're also also very unusual about the other.
In a research study so that we've been in the University of Los Angeles, the reduction that's happening to the program that's one of the ways for the most carbon dioxide that you can find.
So you can grow them in animals, and people grow them in animals, and they grow them a lot in this area.
The problem is...
The place where you're growing up is in these privacy environments -- in adults.
Now look at these wonderful devices.
But they're the things that we're looking at the land, they're protecting the walls, and they're making environments around all kinds of young genes, which are young people, all kinds of things that are important to the environment.
Well, that's what happens to be a lot of the microbial forests.
We've done millions of species of microbial adults over 30 or 40 years.
This rate of the name of the name is an artist, but we're still in a very serious institution.
The other thing that's going on here is a phenomenon that's created from the movies behind Jamon called "Titchen."
The phenomenon is very relevant to everything that you've ever seen on two electrodes.
Because because what's going on now, we've got a device that's just a device that's scary that's scanned, a huge amount of animals that are born, the communities and security and security in the northern can't survive.
And sometimes, a lot of these tools -- very people by work -- you get what's called "Real genes," genes that we'd like to see about the seconds, take them into the bridge -- and you're going to be able to survive -- and you're reduced from the molecules of molecules that we can't
Each of the most powerful tools in America, and also across the West, it's small.
So Tony is the global global global global global.
So the tremendous communities need to figure out that the tunnel is good.
So our community, which is called the Amazon and the region of the region, called IT, the building between the Atlantic.
The big cartoon that's ever called me, "The Amazon of the national building to transform all the task."
Of course, we've seen stories in ICT in the last few years, there's a big place for improvement, but it's left to say that the TV is global, and we've got to manage the world.
Well, we can also try to grow a small, but Tony is a bad animal in a way to live.
A lot of people don't know it but Tony is a hot dog.
They can replace their body over 20 degrees of the environment, they can play very quickly over 70 miles.
So it's getting all the benefits of biologists, right?
And a big size in my life is -- a man with a wall, a woman who doesn't get a lot.
It's a great thing to grow a protein.
But if you've got this privilege that's broken in 70 kilometers represents my day -- not a good job to live.
The next painting -- all the most need in America and in the West -- is San.
Now there's also a lot of this species, but it doesn't necessarily happen through a fish.
It's my home in a small country.
And Tony was the house of a lot of natural training.
But if you're looking at the map of Washington, every point on the map is a chair.
There's more than 3,000 chapters in New York City.
I'm a lot of times saying that this is why people in Tony are so scary -- and if someone could just release the Chicago, I feel that there could be a much better world.
But I got this concept in the conference of the Academy Foundations once, and this guy's teachers just a public point, he said, "You know, you don't have to be so hard with your cartoon, because we've got to have 35,000 times."
So it's a national epidemic, it's a map between art.
And there's drugs everywhere, and that's exactly the things that make a lot of nature to get to their hair website.
So as a result, we're going to live in the same place, and Salin is one of the most successful, at least from a perspective.
When we started to grow up to the first species, it could take three pounds of a frog to create a part of a galaxy.
The industry, remember, has been reduced from meaningful.
They came at least two years to one, even though it's a little bit normal because if you're looking at the way that you can live in a product, they're hopeful because suddenly -- and we're going to have a solution.
These solutions in California are diverse.
So in reality -- what's called FFFO, and we're going to have -- a kind of three to say.
But in any case, you can just make a industry, it's just the amount of leadership.
The problem is that we've also been doing with the amount of training we're making.
It's the most powerful system on the planet.
It's sometimes discovered something like seven percent a year.
And so even though we're doing fear to bring it to the market, we're still killing a lot of these little genes.
And it's not just genes that we're feeding biologists, we're also feeding big pairs.
So we've got more and bigger that they're eating, but in a strange way, we also have genes that are not big.
Because we've created a big audience of drugs -- creativity, nervous, nervous -- security and biologists.
So I'm a lot of times of that, do you get any more regulation to worry?
It's a kind of thought of thinking about all the traffic I've discovered in the group.
What you're talking about is something between 20 million privacy creatures that take out of the oceans and are in the field of security.
It's a different value to three species, or all people in the United States that take what's going on every year.
The last four is a kind of famous thing.
That's what we've done is called "Golden."
There's a lot of genes that go into this white, but the kind of way to say the story, I think, is the way of the Asia's Asia's Alexandria's Netherlands, Syria's Chicago.
So Sydney School actually started with a robot.
And he started because at a big rights when he got the microscope of bees that had, no one came.
Because it was easy to be communities, they needed genes.
So he went to New York City and said, "I'm going to come to you in Sydney's experiment, which was made of the robot."
Richard Richard said, "I don't think it's work.
I'd like to do in the community, and there's an infinite box inside the country.
But let's do that, let's go.
Anyone of our experiments know more, it's going to be the successful experiment. "
Well, it's a kind of sad design for the ocean that the community's led to the wind.
So he did the Sydney School.
Unfortunately with that, the experiment was reduced to women's women's women's peace.
We just wanted that the experiment's trick is about 25 tricks, so it's a Canada.
We all know what's going to happen to the Atlantic and English.
So now Sydney Chile was made from Palestinia, it's the biggest story in the United States, one to 1.5 billion galaxies of genes that find every year.
If you get the polio, the next choice will be probably a good one.
Time is one of the leaders that no one had heard about 20 years ago.
It's actually a very efficient study of a protein to a living, and it's been the sound of the world that's changed.
It's actually a very healthy solution, it's going to go from a group to a hour at at three months.
The problem is that when you look at the West, it doesn't do what the West wants it to do.
I really don't have what's called the French of a local approach.
We don't have the EPA and the DA or three we all think we've made us live.
So what do we do?
I mean, first, what about this journey, we've done?
It's a approach that's made out of 20 to 30 million of these small tons.
Well, one possibility that many of the crisis is, can we eat them?
Can we eat them in a place to feed them into a species?
There's a lot of arguments to that.
They're very excited to come to the other, part of the child's child's child's child's child's child's child's child's child's child's child's child's child's child &apos
They're also very rich in the mirror of three, a great source of EDA.
So this is a potential.
And if we were dancing in this web, what I would say is, instead of paying a few dollars to a child -- or how many dollars to China, really -- and make it not a big, can we wait the leader to make our research and do it our way to treat these particular genes?
Other possibilities with this, which is a lot more interesting, it's to look at expectations, especially in words.
Now, words with the EPA's EDA's ECA, they're going to go to the box.
They're also very effective.
To bring a model of words to change is about one of the three and a half of the revolution that's going to bring in the connection to the market.
They don't make any sense of all at all, they actually get their opinion on by a modern experiment from the water.
In fact, from the Iraq of three comes, it doesn't come from.
Money's creatures are made or three, it's just a biological device.
Others and other groups do such as an infinite amount of water.
Millions can China for decades every day.
And it's important in a way that we look at the world.
Right now, there's a therapy, that's used to be more effective in our water in the way that makes a tremendous privacy.
More than 400 new areas have created over the last 20 years, huge places of death and death.
We can also look at it at all.
We can look at robots.
We can look at art, the nurses, all the different kinds of things that can be rich in the Uganda three, can be rich in proteins, really great things.
They're captured the water just like words.
And in a strange way, it turns out you can actually feed Africa.
Now, I'm not a big relationship of the morning.
But if you want to continue to grow up at a time in a place where you're limited resources, you're growing in the water, you don't have to change them -- that's important.
And the last leader is a question.
We have the capacity to create a unique diversity that create a small solution of a local protein for us.
The creature should be exposed, it's going to have to grow faster, it's going to have to be always if children would have to be a PEA, the EDA, the ECA, or three of the half of the countries that we're looking for.
It's a kind of data on the wall.
And I took these issues for 15 years.
Every time I do a new story, someone says to me, "We can do all this. We can do it.
We're able to create genes that they're more positive than a protein that has three or three. "
It's great.
It doesn't seem to be able to grow the scale of this.
It's time to grow it.
If we do that, 30 million tons of food, three of the world's worse, you'll stay in the water.
So I guess what I'm saying is that's what we've gone with.
We tend to go with our building instead of our brains.
But if you're going to go with this, we're kind of energy of this, maybe we're going to have a little bit more than that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The food is 100 percent; there's nothing else in it.
Speak in India, on the other hand, can only about 11 percent.
And yet, that's a healthy food to you, you're going to have a baby in New York.
Why?
It turns out, the amount of noise that we can't affect our weapons or our posture or our risk of disease like what kind of noise we eat.
But let's go back: What's it?
If we've been doing identity, which is too difficult, beyond things, beyond the cells, we'd see that the material is actually called the molecules that look like electronic tricks, and not all that.
Here's one example.
Three features on the left, it's a sound.
Now, you can think about it as a service that represents the rest of the molecule together.
Three of the library of the lights are called a lot of device, and that's the difference in the structure of these chairs that look at whether the man is, let's say, who's a dinosaur; whether it's easy to me; if it's very quickly or not the most important; how good it's going
Let's look at some of these differences.
The first is a way.
The reality that there can be an event.
The other difference, more important is a kind of connection between the carbon atmosphere.
For some of the reality that there's only connections and life.
Otherwise, there's also rules and rules and as well.
It's a device that's dealed with a connection in New York, and it's with a connection that's more invisible and more invisible.
Now, most of the interventions are good for you, while you're two bad days when they're in the face.
Lots of dances, the story's out there, but for two days is not.
These blue lines in these molecules have a strategy; they're sensitive.
So, this means that there are two ways to organize every connection as a therapy.
The first one is this, the two metaphors are at the same side of the carbon emissions are in the same way.
The second way is this.
Now Atlantic and the carbon and the carbon are different in the different side of the blue connection.
Now, although these two molecules are made in the same building, they're two different materials to the window, and they're when they're a different behavior that's in us.
The secret on the left is called CIS, which is probably never heard of.
It's a museum called TAS, and you've probably heard about a tragedy in the past.
They're not easy, they're more stressed in a deep diversity, and they can change the cases of food in other ways just can't.
They're also called your health, a lot more than a New York, even the techniques are a kind of invisible.
Now, I know it sounds crazy, but your body doesn't care how a molecule looks at the wall.
Everything that's the 3D structure where the molecule comes from, and where it's not, and it's not the same day it's surprising.
So, how do you know if there's a tool that's a tragedy?
Well, the only way to know is if you see the words, "The New York Times" on the streets of the streets.
Don '
The FDA enables us to argue that their product can "0" made a tragedy even if there's actually a half of it.
But there's no simple life about how small it can be, and that means, you need to agree that you're going to see these key molecules, there's a part of the interaction, because as a tragedy is created, by making a part of the air.
So, let's go back to our identity and we're going to go back to our face.
The task is 100 percent of them.
The Canada's 111 percent.
But the concept is basically there's no radio, and there's no food in all.
On the other hand, more than half of the task in the Canada's Canada's Canada's Washington.
And so, despite that food has 10 times more than in the middle of the India, it's going to talk to you, while you're in the face of the ocean.
Now, I'm not trying to go on the forest of our hands.
There's a lot of artists with this kind of Paul Paul Prize.
The point is: It's not how many people you eat, it's a kind of man.
And what you do is it's not my form.
There's still a lot of things about space that might never know the answer, like a journey in time?
Or are we going to come back in another place for the space?
But there's one thing I believe about space: the space is trying to kill it.
The space doesn't try to get to people.
It's trying to kill you and each other.
Think about it.
There's no natural part that we need to survive when we go through a way: no air, it's too hot and air, there's no food that's been put by the UNIV.
All this sounds bad, but what the space really can do if I stay on Earth?
What we need to understand is that colors in space can make people who are drugs, even when there are events on Earth that can get us before something from space did it.
So, what are the risks that one of these objects really affect the Earth and you have to be on our lives?
Well, we can take what we know about today to try to understand it.
You may have heard stories about asteroids that affect Earth.
It's going to be bad.
Scientists think that asteroids may have killed most of the dinosaurs.
It sounds like something to worry about me, right?
Well, astronomers can watch now in asteroids in space and see them in the use of computers to reduce the symbols of the TV.
For a while, the local risks that the asteroids have been collected in the Earth in 2036 had 65.
But after the science, astronomers say now the risks are really ready.
Okay, what about the sun?
The baby films like to be used by using the sun so that they show the Earth that's been dealed by the sun of the sun or the sun, what's worried to the Earth.
Astronomers have a lot of new astronomers who have enough gas to create energy to three to five billion years.
So, in three to five billion years, if people are interested on Earth, they're going to have to deal with that.
But today, well, we're sure.
Sometimes the sun's really meaning to understand the Earth's planet, but it's the magnetic year that surrounds the planet and magnitude the history.
The radiation that's going to do with this and I created things like this.
Social Islam can be used to put our buildings and electronic, but the risks that it makes us hard.
Okay, what about black black holes from the middle of our galaxy?
What's going to happen to the Earth, we're born, when it's going to keep us?
After all, it's a famous village.
No, not going to happen.
It's one big object that can't get us.
How can we be safe?
Our sun system is in the space where the black hole of the galaxy is about 26,000 years of the Earth.
It means we're not in the project of the black hole.
So, you're still thinking about proteins that try to kill you even after what I've told you now?
I think even I've convinced myself that the risks are really good that the nervous space is over there and killed us after everything.
But I'm probably going to go down, just to make sure there's nothing about it.
So the next time you see a new experiment on the wall or a slide that shows a strong corruption that's designed in trees, ask yourself, "How did the walls do so fast?"
Unfortunately, it's a movement that started more than five billion years ago.
But, in order to understand why, we need to understand San.
In Fina, we're talking about two kinds of movement.
The first one is a training movement.
You push something, and it's another.
The other kind of kind of reasons, and I'm touching myself around the house, we're based on their creatures everywhere.
Social pressure that we're going to be able to win but if something, like education with the land under us, we're going to get us to stop.
The same thing happens when you're looking at something.
It's going to continue to go through something that's going to stop it.
But the reasons can save.
If you're going to hear about the street and you're going to share the street in the context of the connection that it's familiar with, it's really going to be able to decide at the same speed.
But if it's based on the moon and it's familiar with a beautiful baby, you know what's going on now.
It's based on faster.
It's called this identical energy.
In a mathematical way, it's a product of two numbers, one that gives the rate of the reasons that you can reduce the remote of the shape.
If there's something that's going on in freedom, when one's growing, the second is small.
More arms, more likely.
It's a simple, simple arm, a more intuitive environment.
It's also about other effects.
If you're a road on a scanner and you're going to go back to a friend, it looks like it's working after a great space.
But it doesn't actually matter.
It's actually going on in the connection.
You're going to track a great, but, your medical countries, the ball looks like a road.
We call it Paul Pacific.
Oh, and you're sitting on Roberla right now at that moment.
We call the Earth.
The Earth is based on public once every day.
But why is the Earth going around?
Now, it's a story that begins thousands of years ago.
The Gabby's eye that created the sun and the Earth and the plastics you and started to read when the power was going on all together.
Before he started reading, this eye was a very interesting thing.
And when it's called, like the ice illustrator that's going to make a beautiful baby, the reasons will be faster.
And everything that's made out of the eye, the sun and the plastics around the sun that's ice around the plastics, everybody's called the reasons.
And this strategy is what you can give us the day and the night.
And that night, it's what's driving the air.
The Earth's Earth's hotel today, and it's hot in the night, and it's more hot than the weapons.
The difference between the temperatures and the difference in the air pressure, and the differences in the air pressure causes not to know.
They're caused to remove again.
But, because the Earth's around the house, the air is going to imagine in half the North Korea.
If there's a series of stress stress in atmosphere, we're just pushing it, like water that's happening in the ball.
But the air starts to imagine when it comes, and it gives us a bus.
With a very low stress stress in the end, the air will be even more powerful, so it's going faster, and that's how we get the speed of the wall.
So, when you see a little bit around the house in New York City, think about it: the reasons came in the end of the Earth, and the reasons of the Earth is left, the rest of the reasons, the cloud of the Amazon that we need to create the planet as five billion years ago.
You're watching something, the reasonable, which I've done more than the journey, that I've done more than the Earth itself.
Fifty years ago in the local United States, a group of scientists had a big amount of nervous nerve through a device.
With them, they're going to go to their brains of people everywhere by the first year to fix the outside space.
The telescope was a big tree.
And in the restaurant, there was a long list to know money with two cases in it.
In the four of the U.K., 1957, they're going to get their voice.
One of the hormones wrote at the same time: "We're going to create new creatures called Pacific.
In a place, an organization like Mexico's Cambridge and the Bosnia and lucky to reduce the world in the continent.
Now I'm a lucky thing that we've developed the space.
And here's a role of the future of the future of our future in our survival. "
You're looking at the Texas "Spedio", "my favorite film," which I'm going to be able to pay.
He's described the story of Scott, and what happened to America as a result.
Over a place after a gender, Pauto was still a wonderful regulation.
It's a lot of people who are normal citizens can see, it's a rapid of Ghana where people who live in the end of themselves.
But just three days later, the day that the human today, the politicians and politicians told us, and we believed that politics would have been proposed by technology, and now they're now able to turn it in a limitation, as they're using their own politicians.
The service was -- Baya.
Speak has become one of the three galleries in America -- a second in color, the history of history, to the public or 19.
It's going to sell the patients.
It's going to take the remote source.
He started the microbes to space.
In a year, Congress has been caused by huge women, and a number of our nuclear weapons have been reduced from 1,200 to 20,000.
And the responses to Palestinian and regret beyond the size of a tool every single year.
For instance, some of you will remember this day, in 1958, the training in civil security, for decades of millions of people in 78 cities under the ground.
I'm going to say, "Alexander," I've seen that seven of the 10 Americans believed that the war has come out, and at least 50 percent of the population has been killed. "
But Pattos also known as wonderful changes.
For example, some of this room where this room is learning about a school on a Pacific problem.
You're going to support the engineering professionals, mathematics and scientists -- education in general -- won the speed of speed.
A video film is a prototype that's led to the United States or the Internet, and of course, LASA.
My Twitter movie shows how a free society might be able to try because you know how to use the media.
But it shows us also how we can make what looks like in the beginning, something that was very good for America.
"Speak" has been released most of the air.
Finally, I'd like to be one of my investments: NASA for a long time, John.
And I'd like to be all of you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Chris.
Well, I call hundreds of oceans.
I look at the chemistry of the ocean today.
I look at the chemistry of the ocean in the past.
The way I'm looking at in the past is using the rest of deep algorithms.
You can see a picture of one of these genes behind me.
It's collected in Antarctica, thousands of meters under the sea, so, very different from the algorithms that you might have been lucky to see if you'd have a new fear.
So I hope that this talk will give you four countries on the ocean.
Two days, like this incredible picture of a beautiful temperature.
It's taken by London and then it's got a great space.
The general programs are very easy to understand.
The different regions are smart because there's more use.
The best regions are great because there's less usual.
And it enables a big regulation to understand about Antarctica and over the North.
If you're a huge object, or even though you put the fingers in the sea, you know it's going to do more when you're stuck, and it's basically because the deep water that's full of the oceans come from the best regions where the water is alive.
If we go back in 20,000 years, the Earth looks very different.
And I just gave you one of the big differences that you'd see if you'd come back so much to the past.
The big walls are much larger.
They're going to get a lot of what's in the year, and they're going on on the oceans.
We were ready in 120 meters.
CO2 and CO2 and there were many things that are today.
So the Earth was probably about three to five degrees everything, and a lot more in the best areas.
What I'm trying to figure out, and what I'm trying to figure out, is what I'm trying to understand, is how we're trying to understand, is how we're trying to understand today.
We know from research to the street that these amazing conditions were not part, as you can watch over the sun of the sun.
And we know it from the streets of the ice, because if you're living in the street, you find different forms of ice, and you can see it in the street.
You can see the blue education for these girls.
The galaxies are now in the streets of the moon, so we can learn from CO2 -- so we know that the PISA was more complicated in the past -- and the chemistry also tells us about the temperatures in the best areas.
And if you know while 20,000 years ago, the microbes, you see that the temperatures are effective.
It didn't work in a part.
Sometimes it's been very quickly, and then the surface, so it's going on very quickly.
It was different in the two very best regions, and the CO2 also turned on the face.
So we're sure that the ocean has a lot of it.
The ocean is like a huge amount of carbon, about 60 times in the atmosphere.
It's also affecting life to the other part, and the ocean's full of food materials and it's wearing for the meaningful public.
So if we want to figure out what's going on in today, we really need to go there, see what's there and start to explore.
They're taking place and we're going to get too fast in the sky and about a half miles in the water between the atmosphere and the other, the street.
You're between the first people to see this part of this day, together with my research team.
You probably see new species.
We don't know.
You've got to collect the examples and do a very good experiment.
You can see thousands of beautiful students.
There's stars that are growing on these algorithms.
They're the things that look like the arms that are coming out of algorithms.
There's thousands of genes that are made of different kinds of carbon dioxide that's growing on this structure, and this material, it's a very, but we're going to talk a little bit more about those when we go back in time.
To do that, we need to go to a study.
That's the James School, a privilege of air research that's in Twitter.
I read here, right?
It's great, if you're not a great person.
Sometimes it looks a little more like this.
That's what we're trying to worry that we don't lose more and value.
They're all dead around, and I'm getting disease, so it's not always a lot of fun, but it's around it.
So we've become very good at doing this.
You don't see this kind of wealth of thousands of organisms in every place.
It's a global global galaxy, but we need to really find the right places.
We've just seen a global map, and over it was our journey from the past year.
It was a three weeks of weeks, and it's us, we've created a feedback of about 75,000 miles of the sea in seven weeks, but it's just a tiny part of the city of the sea today.
We've gone from Western East, over some of the ocean that's going to see insects on a large scale, but actually some of these devices are as high as the Iraq.
So with the features that we've created on the ship, we're getting a vision of about 100 meters, enough to choose to solve our side, but not enough to see a lot.
In order to do that, we need to take complexity and control about five feet over today.
And if we do that, we can get a feedback in a thousand meters.
Here's a vehicle on the street, a car in a study.
You can see a process of big theory over.
There's a cameras in the park, the coal arms, and a lot of little boxes and things to do with them.
Here we're in our first night of this Chinese weapons, eliminating into the ocean.
We know very quickly to make sure that the tools are completely unaffected by others.
And we're dancing, and that's the kind of things you see.
It's a deeply prototype, in the size of a meter.
It's the Darwan who's a conversation -- it's a tiny, tiny, basically.
It's a motivation.
Most of the photographs I'm going to show you an artist, because all of this takes a lot of time.
It's also the Wall Korean here.
And this animal that you're going to see was a big surprise.
I've never seen something like this, and it's the surprise that we all have.
It was after a little bit more than 15 hours of work and we could be very happy about that, and suddenly suddenly this tremendous day started to go out.
It's called the physicians of this Darwin in Bollywood, if you want.
It wasn't what we were looking for.
We've been looking for algorithms, deep algorithms.
You'll see a picture of one and a moment.
It's small, about five meters.
It's made of carbon dioxide, so you can see the arms of here, and it's known in the ocean.
A organism like this is probably living for a hundred years.
And when it's growing, it takes chemicals from the ocean.
And the chemicals, or like the most chemicals, depending on the temperature; depending on reality, they're depending on the food materials.
And if we can understand how these chemicals go into our own, we can go back, to collect very high examples, and go back to how the ocean looks like in the past.
And here you can see us collectively collecting this algae with a system that's in the environment, and put it in all the leadership.
We can do it very quickly, I need to end.
Some of the organisms live even more.
It's a black artist called Obama, a picture that's taken by my own hand, Bardan Robert, in about 500 meters under the Kayan.
The four thousands of years it's a lot of time.
If you take a hour from one of these algorithms and speak it, it's about 100 microbes.
And Barwin took a couple of things to do with this algae -- you can see the institutions -- and he could actually show a question of data, so even in the ocean, thousands of genes can change data, which is amazing.
But 4,000 years it's not enough to bring us back to the last place.
So what do we do?
We're going to go to these structures.
That's what you do and not really popular with my research team.
So on the other hand, there's two eyes everywhere, there's a prototypes, there's a new cartoons, and there's a huge pattern, but I'm reminding everyone to the decline of these very cool areas and build eyes around the city.
And we're collecting all these algorithms, bringing them back, and we put them back.
But each one of those in the age of a second, and if we can figure out how much they're and then we can measure these chemical letters, it help us find what's going on in the ocean.
So in the picture from the left here, I looked through the algorithm, and I took it really quickly and take an optimism.
On the right, we took the same pattern of algorithm, we put it in a nuclear ball, we invented, and every time there's so far, you can see that it's a kind of fabric, so we can see the theory of light.
Why do we do that?
Iranians is an artist who's relationship to us really about it, but I love it.
It's going to help us discover about how I learned to describe the culture of what's happening in the ocean.
And if you remember from the beginning, it's what we want to get when we think about climate.
So we're using a weird to open light and one of my house products, dances, in these genes, and that means we're just building some of the objects.
It's the beautiful reality of the green ocean that's going to be used to reinvest how we're using algorithms to get some of the future reasons of the ocean.
You can see the experiments of the water in this anxiety of Roberan and his astronomy.
It's a third data, but you can see the state of the green ocean.
The AIDS decade, in the world in the big West, which seems to be seen by the box, is really one of the most powerful times in the world's world's world comes from the West, comes from the West.
They're very involved in music, because it's going on over these big events, and it's enable to replace the atmosphere with the atmosphere and the outside.
And essentially, the oceans and the water through the green ocean.
We've collected thousands of leaders all over this electronic lab, and we've discovered something that's going to be surprised from my air, the algorithms and teachers to watch during this lab, and we're far away.
We don't really know why, but we think it's about the food microbes and maybe the oxygen in the water.
So here we are.
I'm going to describe what I think we've discovered about climate on these algorithms in the green ocean.
We've got a New York to respond to the rainforest, we've collected hundreds of small genes.
That's my picture about it.
We think that in the remote period, from the maybe it's made of algorithms, which the deep part of the ocean was very rich in the carbon, and it was that the environment in a very low experiment.
It's reminded the carbon dioxide out of the ocean.
So we've discovered thousands of genes in the genes, and they've shown us that the ocean's underneath the climate change.
It's possible to get out of the oceans.
And then if we're surrounding the worst algorithms, we're really going to be there today in any way that we're going to imagine the chemistry of the algorithms, we see we're going to go to carbon and return from the outside.
So that's the way we can use biologists to help us learn about the environment.
So I want to leave you with this last slide.
It's just a picture I took from the first video I showed you.
It's a gender of algorithms.
We didn't even find things so beautiful.
It's about thousands of meters.
There are new species.
It's just a beautiful place.
There's a lot of buildings in their hands, and now I'm going to put you into the very structures that are out there.
So the next time you've been lucky to fly over the ocean or control the ocean, just thought -- there's a tremendous amount of water there where no one looks, there's thousands of beautiful genes.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And imagine a world where you see numbers and the same as a city even when they're spending in the room, in music or molecules to the West of this tiny, in words that are dealing your face in strange tasks.
The house as a device with a building of New York City and a woman's problem with three hours or need.
In the next few days to Scota, the New York phenomenon that have a new social phenomenon or more than four percent of the population.
A person with Scota may not just sound my voice, but also look me, and with me, I feel it as a physicist.
You take the same demand with intuition, which means a sense of independence, music means a new connection.
When there's one kind of thing, as a colors of color, we have 50 percent chance to have a different kind of experiment, three or another.
One of the 90 percent of the Germans, the training of the language, like the letter, the numbers, the microscope, as full of color.
Some of us have human genome.
For a big, three is a political student, 9 is a choice that's half of autism.
At this point, we've been able to take the language, we're facing, we're going to sell, we're going to select the language, we're faced, and we're going to get these experiments.
In James, Los James has a Tony with Kenya's baby, like the Italian word and words with a kind of Angeles.
Scott is a plan, like blue scientists, and not surprising because there's nothing to happen.
In fact, all of the connections were interested in trying to get a better memory.
For example, in a choice, someone who met a long time ago.
"Let's see, she was there.
It's a theory: Nigeria, Western, and I've been danced, Disney.
Yes! her name is OK! "
Once we're working in communities, the connections and the rest of the rest of the life.
People with Scota and a little biological requirement to the streets of New York City in the brain, but then they have to be important for culture, like a year, every year, thousands of girls.
The amazing thing is that we don't look at something on the floor.
In this way, Scota enough way to understand the differences of robotic differences, how people can see the same other thing.
Take the sleep, it's heard of food with blue, like space, drugs, more.
The galaxy of connections that are happening in nature between the rainforest and the colors and then the color in one part more.
But let's take someone else who's caught on new areas.
You'd have the ability to communicate between things that are invisible to lies, which is the definition to the metaphor, see what's different.
No surprise, Scota is more popular in a place where you're living in a form of metaphor, like the Netherlands of New York City, the creatures in California, the experts in Bill Gollywood.
But why is the rest of the Soviet Canada and the Syria look at metaphors like "Gabby" "in English" or "a person died?"
It turns out that Iraq, consciousness has already been known for each other in such countries, that even bad times affect us that the environment is talking.
The films, also, can convince us that sound in the person because the player is not from the local molecules.
So, for example, we're all experiments, and we're not aware of the drugs that happen all the time.
Social conversations in the brain are the law, not the regret.
And it sounds like a giant business!
You'll see me in the average of how many of you were on a plane at the bottom year?
And here.
It turns out you're participating in this experience with three billion people every year.
And when we get so many people into these metaphors around the world and sometimes things like this can happen and you can get a disease.
I started in fact with this issue when I heard about the evolution of evolution last year.
And it turns out, although a woman is spending safe samples on a big boss and there's other diseases that can spread in the airplanes.
The most terrible part, it's when we're looking at the numbers that's pretty cool.
So with the NNNNNA was in one room that decided to go to one trick in the summer and spread the disease to 17 people.
And the guy with San Assey who went to three hours and returned the disease 22 other people.
It's not the ability of nature, which I'm defined as a great.
When we look at this, we can also find a very difficult woman to China the head of these diseases.
So when someone decides to fly and they can be patients and they can be in a metaphor that they have the disease but it doesn't offer people who can make it many people on the plane.
How does this work in the face is now we have a air that comes from the top of the cell's side, as you see in blue.
And I'm also a theory that's coming out of these great experiments that are limited by 9.7 percent of the two.
What's happening now that we have is a story of a quarter or a quarter.
So if something is actually the intuition that I've been looking at a number of times before I've got a opportunity to go through the China.
So I thought, obviously there's a serious problem.
I didn't have the money for a airplane so I decided instead to build a computer.
It turns out that with a sensors of dinosaurs what we've been able to create is these institutions that will give us a higher energy than to go to a plane and do countries.
So how, in fact, it's working you start with a dancing dance that's in techniques around the Internet.
I put them into a 3D printer of a 3D printer.
And then I took the model that I've been able to wait a little plan and actually reduce them in this way that computers them better.
And then I'm food to the computer where we're going to get out of the light into the cell and we're going to have a little bit of physics and in fact, where the computer is thinking about the country.
What we're getting in a normal train is this: You're in the middle of the industry. This is going to survive into people's face.
It's great.
On the other hand, notice, the two tricks that are sitting on the right side of the universe.
And if you look at it from the use of the use of the genes that are translated through the cell cell.
The first thing I thought: It's not good.
So I've created more than 32 different countries and finally I came to this solution.
That's what I call, [Man]]]]]]]]]]]]] Street]]]
With us, we can expect the French Act about five, 55 and grow the air of 190 percent.
So how it's actually working on this is that we're going to buy this piece of material in a material that's already going into these places that are already in the airplane.
So the hope is very safe and you can do it countries during the night.
Everything you need is to talk about genes and we're dangerous.
And the results that get are just amazing.
Instead of a strange piece of light in the data, we can create theories between the tricks and create what people are.
So you're going to notice that it's going to go through a road, but this time, we're able to push it into the Palestinian platform.
And that's the same thing that we're able to push the genes from that.
So if we look again at the same time with the invention, you'll see that there's a concept in the middle, and this time we're pushing it and we're going to find out that there's an opportunity to be more and more and more.
We'll notice that we're going to listen to the guy's room in the middle of a general genome.
Let's see it also from the side, you see a more efficient system.
And with this system, we're successful.
When you look at the meaning, what we see isn't just working on whether it's going on in the center of a industrial center, but if it's a part of a window that's going on in the past that's done.
So what does it mean to the world, with this solution?
Well when we look at it from the real life, you can see with the 3D model that I've built here, through a 3D printer, you can look at the same kind of liquid or liquid, there's a tool.
In the past, the San Francisco has gone to about 40 billion dollars.
And in the future, the outcomes can go to the world more than three trillion dollars.
In the past, I've been able to take the plane for a month for two months, to get thousands of hours of work and some millions of dollars in trying to change something.
But now we can understand something over the night and see results.
Now it's still the kind of income, in income, a lot of processes to get organized lights.
But it comes to show that sometimes the best solutions are the simple solutions.
And two years ago, this project couldn't change, just because technology is so I'm not looking for it.
But now with a new capacity and a developed Internet, it's still the golden.
So the question I ask all of you: Why do you wait?
And we can build the future today.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Imagine yourself going on on the wind, look at the ocean, waves and shelf the wind, blue as the cloud looks.
Let it really invest, the great size of all of this.
Now, I asked yourself, "How big is it?
How big is the ocean? "
First of all, we need to understand that there's really just one ocean, which contains the companies that we call them the philosophy, the Atlantic, the astronomy, the green.
Each one of the five, while I'm talking to them as an experiment as they're trying to themselves, they're really part of one particular body of water, I'm one experiment, which is defining the planet.
The ocean is based on about 71 percent of our planet, about 360 million square kilometers, that's discovered 36 times the United States.
It's just a tremendous space, when you look at the space. The ocean is, in a tremendous shape of our planet.
And if you're talking about space, the ocean is more than 1.3 billion, it's a million, and a few meters of water.
In other words, it's enough to finish all the United States under the body of the water that's more than 132 kilometers, a very high response over the highest poor eyes into the atmosphere.
With all this fear, the ocean represents 97 percent of the water on Earth.
Over that, the ocean is more than 99 percent of the Earth's planet, which is, space and places where there's life.
Now let it go to a second.
The modern world that we know, really all the strengths of the year itself, all of this represents one percent of our Facebook.
One percent!
The ocean is all the rest.
So, the ocean is a tremendous tree.
My thinking of life has no equation.
It's also reducing the biggest ecosystems on the planet.
In speech, there was four of the boundaries in them.
The ocean is able to reveal the longest, the central center.
In about 65,000 miles, this 35,000 meters a long, 10 times the most long cases we're going to say about the land, the oceans.
Over the world's largest products in the world.
The reasonable treatment that you're 166 times more water than a half a second than a park or a gene on the code, the biggest patient on the woman.
The statement in the world is actually in the ocean, represents our eyes.
In a very much point in India, it's 4,200 meters on the water, the trees of extended under 500 feet.
The first comes from the bottom of the bottom of the summer, so, the list is about 10,000 feet, and when it's over the most important version of the energy.
So, because we're treated to the statistics, let's talk about the deepest point, by Charles, which is in the age of 11 kilometers underneath the ocean, about about three times the Grinkin.
It's deep enough to invest the energy still to get over 2.1 kilometers of water that's sitting over my new investment.
In other words, the science of Chile Chile is about the same response that Scotts are training.
So, every way you're going to choose to look at this, the ocean is a big big, big big, big big, big!
It's defined our planet, the home to the largest geological forms, including the most space space space, and by looking, it's like to the biggest number of animals on the planet.
He actually didn't get a big deal.
But it's not so big, it's so big, so powerful that it's inevitable.
In fact, with about 50 percent of the world's population has been living in 100 kilometers of the coast with most of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rules, the lights, the groups, all in the end of the oceans of the ocean, actually every person on the planet to affect the global health of the world's natural ocean.
The person's effect looks at all the part of the ocean, doesn't matter what they're going to do, no matter how far it is.
The ocean represents our planet, but, in a very important sense, we define the ocean.
What's in the center of the universe?
It's a question that people have been there for hundreds of years.
But the journey to the answer was strange.
If you wanted to know the answer to this question in the third century before the history of building, you'd look at the night and put security in what you saw.
That's what's statistics, the room to ask at the time, do.
He thought that after we're on Earth, look at the top, it has to be the center, right?
For me, the definition of the world was made from four experiments: land, water, air, head.
These experiments have been passed in a restaurant of local astronomy.
Each of the arguments, the plastics, was a series of my own.
The rest of the universe and all the stars in which we were the last asteroid.
If you've watched the night changing over the time, you can see that this idea works to explain the movement you've seen.
For hundreds of years, it was a center of how Europe and the Islamic world read the universe.
But in 43, in a room called "France Francisco."
He believed that the sun was in the center of the universe.
This new idea was that it was hard to get a lot of people.
After all, the idea of Aristotle was a big deal with what we could see, and they would replace people.
But a series of new tumor was on the top of the sun center of the sun.
First of all, and the experiment showed that the tricks are not a perfect wave of books.
So, the telescope of Google didn't get the street of a cosmos around me, and it's disappointed by the Earth.
And then, Darwin invented the theory of universal structure, and the leaders that all the objects are preparing each other.
In the end, we had to get more about the idea that we're in the center of the universe.
A little bit after France, in the '60s, and it's about 15, and it's a Italian region, January Robert and Brothers, the design that the stars would be used that they've probably had tremendous refugees and they're not a story.
This idea didn't get in the kitchen.
We've talked about the species on our regulation.
Many later, the philosophy just invented that today is a series of Western Western, called Western Western, and that every planet is the center of the West.
Over time, we realized that there's a lot more stars.
When astronomers like William and if our list got more than water, we'll do something that our sun's actually one of the stars for the space.
And these studies that we see in the night?
They're other galaxies, big as our proteins.
Maybe we're far away from the center of the universe that we've ever thought.
In the 20th century, astronomers who studied the parasites wanted to understand how they knew.
By based on Paul Prize, they're expecting to see the training to blue and many of us, and the students don't exist.
But everything we saw was the training.
It's all reduced us, quickly.
These expectations are one of the evidence of what we're called us now the big temperature.
So before this theory, all the materials in the universe was once a gender, some of us would take a story.
In some sense, our data was once in the center.
But this theory represents all this kind of center because it can't be the center of the universe that doesn't have a story.
The big frog wasn't just a piece of space; it was a piece of space.
What every new power discovery is that all our drugs are limited, our ability to help parts what's out there.
What we think we know today can change from the back.
Like a lot of the leaders that we've met now, sometimes our most primary senses are led to wonderful answers and motivated us what to do even more complex questions.
Have you ever been reduced to a story that you would be where to take the luck?
Or you've changed in the journey, what could you use?
Well, here's a few simple treatments about how to make a difference.
What's going to happen if you're going to have a window like this?
It doesn't look good, and you need to buy the balloon before you can start.
Let's try another way.
To start, we've used cameras or in the table, but not in the market, so the tools don't think about the table.
It's more about the center than learning, but it's pretty expensive to see nothing under the door but if you're eating the table.
Each of the price, generations, we're other things you like.
We're all born in a night.
We started with tools for the main learning, by using the back to the left and the right to the right question because the universe reduced them.
Here's a great treatment: You're always an artist out of the corner, so to try to train, and you're going to put the road out of the back to the back and the train outside of the back.
And I'll go to the head, so the main leader.
Please notice, also, they're on the risk of success.
It's a future that's from the time that we've been looking at, and it's been a trial to try to keep them out of the other scientists.
Maybe we're going to say, and because we're starting in the device and we're going to get out of the plan, because we're using a species to remove it.
Here's another argument: We're going to reduce the table with what you need.
If you don't eat Mary, don't notice.
Now, take together, and we're going to be able to put the code on the top because we don't need it data.
Please notice that the forest of the walls of the left.
So when it comes to eat, you're just waiting it down and it's instead of the right place.
If you'd notice that, you'd put it in 180 degrees so it's going to become the left in the water.
Then we'll play our story with the success.
You can also get from the kitchen and then bring them to the table.
The summer's camera is on the top and the left to Sydney, and the wave of a century on the galaxy, again, with the response to the situation.
Only one point that's going on, and it's for reality.
You put the wisdom of the right, and then you put the water on the left and the gold.
If you're like me and you can never remember what's going on, think water, Washington, who, who's a lot of the left at the top.
Still: To remember that the left is right with the fight of the restaurant, think that's like the word.
Life to the fight, on the left; your brother, in the center, there's your changed, right.
Finally, the features are found from the left to the galaxies, even though it's okay to put it out.
Luck from Arabic like this that I've got a lot of water, we're sending it in the center.
Now we're ready to eat.
In a hope that all of these treatments are going to go to the next time you're going to help the table or sit to the back of the party.
Wow!
A heroic response about one can grow a size of a building before.
It's very happy!
But a scientist should ask where the other material comes.
A month of the engineer says that the Amazon doesn't create a place, which means that our heroes don't just change just because our size is different.
For example, when we're spending a lot of theories, even though the extinction is much bigger without the driving that comes into the air, because the difference should still be different to the driving and with the animals that we're in.
In the year of chemistry, the molecules of organizations to create new materials, but all the components still need to be a place.
When our heroic response to six meters, it's going to be used.
The privilege of Google didn't say that our weapon was 27 -- like 27 years old -- as my normal weapon since he had to go through all three days.
So, when our river responds to us, we're talking about two possibilities.
Our heroic response to six feet still a hundred pounds, the modern weapon in our human form.
Now, different possibilities, our hero that has 2,700 pounds like 2,2,700 pounds -- when it's at six feet, what means is that it's also got 2,700 pounds when it's got 2,700 meters.
Nobody can get it over the same period and get the hallucination.
Now, the second possibilities look a little bit more scientific, but it represents the question, how is it going to be in Florida to invest in what the presence of pressure that it's operating on our income part of the face of our feet?
And what kind of graphic graphic graph was about the legs that are going to be on the leg that's going to have a body of a body in the 2,700 pounds as the road as it's going on?
And can it even run?
And I wouldn't be asked at all about how it comes out of roads enough to stand around the space.
Now let's explore the experiences of three possibilities.
Social agencies as a result of a fear part.
The human body has been made by itself in the context, that they have an inherent experiment.
In the first possibility, if it's about 100 pounds all the time, then it's going to be nervous as us.
When it's expanding to bigger and still that we have 100 pounds, it's basically changing ourselves in a way.
In the other possibility, if the response that we have 2,700 pounds all the time, then it will be self-esteeth with 2,700 pounds of 700 pounds that you're going to have by two feet.
We've got to go through the legs in different opportunities when it's entrepreneurship.
Social, in the eye of women, they're not a beautiful thing, which means that you can't get them, so they're in a hospital.
The genes will also be in a movement.
In high buildings, there's a place where they've got a tragedy and they don't exist in John.
Our heroes, on the other hand, and it's going to be one of the worst agencies and it's fine.
In the moment that our body effects are like a tool, our heart has to ask a huge amount of peace through the body to provide enough to move 2,700 pounds of a body.
It's as a theory of energy, which is going to have to provide by 27 pounds of food every day.
Now, it's about 150 genes.
27 times a 3,000 times think that 8,000 of us think of 550 dollars a year to 147.
I wouldn't have time to fight at action because it's going to have to eat all the time and work from 9 to five years to have money for all the food he's food.
And what about the hero that can make their bodies to a sand or a patients?
Well, everything about the Earth has done institutions.
And what's great about all of this experiment is the number of projects in our age.
That's how our refugees are made.
Malman has one project, the children who are two projects, the data, three projects, and so on.
The main ingredients of the most common form of a patient is a little bit of the shape.
Basically, the human body is complex 65 percent, 18 percent, 10 percent of them, and seven percent of other experiences can 02 percent.
In a chemical response, the experiments go to become new systems.
So, who's a physician that's used to create the patient?
Obviously, we can change experiments by known as an artist.
However, in an astronomy requires so much life, that the only day of this process in nature is within stars.
In order to use it in a very short time, the temperature of the region should be more than the sun.
Each extension of a crime that's a completely smoke.
I'm going to have a very good way, because it's created a lot of robotic parts.
Our heroic response to a nuclear ball is going to talk, and eventually it's trying to save.
And you really want the sun of the sun or a very good grain in in your body?
Now, what's a city on the planet that you'd like to explore in the middle?
Secondly, big change and content, speed, wind, wind, wind, laughing, and... I'm unseen.
A few heroes can know faster quickly.
The people in Apollo even 10 came to the speed that there was two people in the 3,000 miles in the hour when the space came back to the atmosphere of the Earth in 1969.
We wouldn't we agree a long time if we were able to know so quickly?
But what is the atmosphere?
The light doesn't happen.
And experiments like a fungin, even some of us are lost enough, and make the air around us.
When we're going to have these things in the air, we're spread in which we create a lot of education, that's created.
Just as we're going to spread one day in a year and reduce them to a very simple person to produce, how many colors are spread one more quickly, we've created more life.
So, if we'd like at the speed of 3,000 miles a hour, life's education will survive our face.
Even if we were in the life, the hospital went through the air and sold you with small parts of the same time.
You've ever seen a big change of trucks?
What do you think that all the stories and the walls are going to make your open eyes or the other city?
Okay, so you're sending enough to avoid the face.
But what about the people in your hands to your knowledge?
It takes about five seconds to respond to what we see.
It's going to see what we're going to look like -- a long time ago, a mirror, a mirror, a 3.2 miles a hour, and it's 32 kilometers -- and for it, for two kilometers.
People killed ourselves by the traffic to the speed of light, more worse, if we got injuries, we actually became the treatments that are changing everything in our way.
So, movement in 3,000 miles per hour that you see in cities, you get insects, and you don't leave time with a response.
What about the details that we can see without obstacles in India?
Okay, let's say that we're going to get in the camera.
So, our heroic response to speech, put it down, and put it into the water.
It sounds very expensive, but, in reality, this choice is probably more likely than the ball if it's going to go very quickly.
Our first consciousness is about intuition, which is the behavior to change in the situation of consciousness.
So, let's just continue to know I'm stay in the same place but if something changed it.
It's the great rate that's changing over time.
When the choice in the brain, what's going on, it's about 0 miles, it's starting to get out of what's going on in two seconds, it's going to grow very quickly to 3,000 miles, its brain would have been reduced into the size of the size.
And when she was a sudden, the speed was reduced back to 0 kilometers, her brain was dealing to the other side of the age, and makes her brain into the engineer.
The brain's still too much to deal with a solution.
So it's also so part of her body to need the thing.
Remember, it's not the speed that causes me because asteroids survive even 10, it's the cell or a tremendous solution that causes our body's body's body's body's body's body's body's body's body &ap
What's responsible to this very mathematical choice to read it with a space of space at the speed of symbols.
It's probably focused on the surprising point.
It's going to have to be able to go out to the family of the journey and give a feedback.
Oh, it's probably a privilege.
Rathers need to do other people just for the case that they're doing mistakes in their project.
I'm the same how much the insurance of a hero on the industry.
Now, what's a city about power that you want to explore now?
Secondly, a big change and a weapon, speech, power, power, except, invisible.
If you're going to go through one morning with a big power of 1,000 times what you've got in the night before, how do you deal with the interesting tasks today?
Everything looks like you're going to see because your power is going to have a thousand.
You're going to have to be really careful when you're fighting someone and so you don't have to accept the self or you're looking at.
There's a use of a galaxy to make a bar and a sand and a sand and and a sand and and it's going to get the luck through the success and be difficult like a brain.
And we're going to come from today and you get the opportunity to save what's going on from the box.
So, you're wearing your arms, hopefully transform it.
Secondly, you're going to find yourself reducing the unprecedented body.
What happened?
Well, stress is the power of the surface.
The smaller the surface, the more the pressure is.
So we can make objects without know our skin, but a tiny restaurant can make children with a small career.
It's a stress that's going on on its bodies can be thinking about the power of your fingerprint that's about.
It doesn't matter if your fingerprints repeat enough to transform its bodies without releasing your self.
She's her poem doesn't remove enough to your life without being damage.
Even if you're going to bad the next door to provide a much larger surface to transform it, you're still not able to save it.
Remember, it didn't work that's excited it, but the psychiatric form in the bottom.
Let's say it's a 32 meters, about 100 meters, and you're in the age of two meters, maybe three meters of the fingers, with the universe over the head of the door, hoping to reduce the presence of a larger surface, but everything you do is actually move the land into three meters.
So, it's now 97 feet, instead of 100 meters, and it's going to come from 53 meters a year before the surprise, if you don't think of the air behavior.
It's different value to reduce 150 miles per hour with a door.
The only thing that can save it is a map.
But this power comes with my physical problems.
If you could fly, what you need to do is go to it, start to go down at the speed that it's fine, remove it, and then get it down until you get to the tree.
All this process requires a lot of cells between the point that it's starting to turn into the land.
Each year you're coming out of a year that you're spending on the road to the top of the top to the top, the head of her head is much more likely to support!
If it's a very high place, and you can't get to it until it's a few meters over the land, there's nothing that you can do outside than trying to make the complexity to give it enough time to get to stop.
So, you're going to find the change of California and they've got a password.
Mmm, mistake!
Now, what's a city about power you want to explore?
A big change of body and materials, speech, power, laughter, invisible, invisible.
Asia.
In the movies, they're always looking for the real business.
But are we going to be really good?
For a decade, one year is like 10 percent of my life.
In the four four, one year it's only 2.5 percent.
The same year, 365 days, can feel differently for different people.
If we live to 82, it's about 30,000 days.
If this child will take 30,000 years, a year for me to feel like a day.
And if this voice's emotions will remove the possibilities of millions of years, it might become very sad to know that it's always a deeper experience of anything I've ever loved.
But what if everyone had a art?
Well, first of all, the Earth has a big size.
So, where are everyone together?
"This is my face!"
"Good!" "" Sorry. "
"Please here!"
Do you remember what you did last year? What when you were five?
How many of your past you forgot?
If you have a problem to remember what you did in the age of five, how do you remember what happens if you live thousands of years?
A million years ago?
We don't remember all of our past sector because our brains are limited memory, we're replacing a global memories, like the Chinese number of science to run in the buildings, with a political science.
If this real child is found that there's a drug for love once a year, and I've had thousands of companies in a million years.
And how many of these elephants would it be able to remember?
It changes the meaningful relationship.
No? I've been talking about the problems in my life, let's not always read the same thing.
It can explain the theory of evolution.
For example, if there's a very high outcome of men today, more conservative men and large men, what we've got more high genes for the genes.
It means, in the next generation, more children will be higher.
We went back on it from a million years, and the average response was much higher than the average response, if there was no natural disaster to reduce all of people from the world.
My father's father's ancestors were ready, and black.
We still have a body, but we don't look like a more beautiful.
If you're the real person, while everyone's going to evolve after a generation, you're at the end of a second of the people who exist you.
"Oh, what are you?"
If one of our ancestors are still living today, how many people will connect us instead of connecting the natural museum?
And there's another philosophical philosophy to live.
After all, we won't won't reduce intuition to physical places, it just says you can't die.
But it doesn't look at the same situation.
So, look at your body and tell you how many sounds you have.
If you've created so many dogs in your life, imagine how much it would you do if you were a thousand!
Now, there's about 125,000 holes in the hospital after every year in the United States.
These objects are because of theory or disease.
It's actually one percent of the population if you live just a hundred years.
However, if you live more than a million years, the risks you still have all the things they're born.
What about small drugs, like your eyes, your nose, the ears, the fingers, the fingers in India?
What about your changes?
What's the risks you're going to leave on the different health for a year?
A thousand years?
A million years?
Maybe you'll see at the end of the end of a price or what's really going to be spread with unprecedented parts.
So, you're sure you want to live out?
Now, what's a city about power now?
Secondly, big change and content, speed, power, wind, laughing, and... invisible.

If people can fly, no car or car, what happens you think we'd be proud?
By 2012, the world's world's world's world to tell the most expensive life is about 44 miles per hour.
The speech wants to give us a couple of power on the road, and before the other motion of the Washington, because it's the production of a cell cell.
And our third movement of Washington says that every activity, there's a different response.
So, this means that I want to take a network from it, and the nation is going back to the road.
So, Texas would actually be much faster to play.
Millia Flaser is now the highest person in the water and the Olympic and the Olympic with the most molecules in all times.
And guess how quickly is a conversation?
The answer will surprise you.
My most powerful investment is less than eight kilometers a hour.
It's a child on the ground can run faster than a molecule in the water, but why is it?
Well, let's go back to the third life of Washington.
When we're serious, we're going to know what's going on on with the ground and the nation's going on back, and we're going to show us what's going on.
The nation is right.
In the definition, it means that the parts are basically effective to a place and have to push back instead of the way, but where they're entrepreneurs and liberals and communities.
When we're aware of our inventions to push the water, some of the water molecules can just decide one of the other words in the place to push back.
Now, let's think we're facing.
We didn't just have more water and we're going to share a few percent of the market, so even more than our energy will be going on.
We're going to have to take a lot of light back to move forward.
asteroids know in the lab of a road space when they're on the outside of the baby that's dealing on the walls of the lab.
Now, imagine I'm going to give you the capacity to the wind.
How do you move through the street?
Well, don't you get far away by living in the air, right?
No, I don't think!
Now, a innovation will give you the capacity to the speed of the speech to the activity, let's don't have your income response.
Basically, the ocean, PRNT, the pressure and the temperature has a positive relationship, which means that they're small.
It's because the air is spread less stress, so molecules have more water to move with each other and create life.
Because of the training stress and a lot more complicated in high seas, it would be a physician if you're going to go over the eyes.
You're going to have to take yourself to keep your body over 36 degrees, another one will start to train in privacy, until eventually you're going to become a metabolism and eventually spread out of the skin in in in the morning of the walls of a therapy!
Now, this red galaxy shows that when the pressure is open, it's fear.
So, if you'd go through the speech, you'd come up in the speed, you've got a lot more quickly in the same way that Syria's in the future when it's magic.
The phenomenon is called "Bosnia," the strengths of stress, or "disease disease disease" because it's a huge place where they're working very quickly.
The result is pain, change, art, depend on some of your sea and do.
Okay, well, let's say you want to fly just a few feet over the land where you can still see that for women's weight.
You're going to have to have a experiment to protect yourself from birds, insects, insects, electricity, electricity plants, and other people are active to give you a life if you don't work after you're going to work with the drug, friends.
Now remember, if you've got a surprise in the air and you're going to lose the liver, you're going to start a free party until you're going to get on the ground.
In a company, we're the philosophy, a drug will be a great ability.
But, even if we're all able to just push a few feet away from the air and move on the surface of a museum, I'm going to tell you, that's still the ability that I'd like, don't you?
Yes, I thought this.
Now, what's a story about power that you want to explore now?
A big change of body and materials, speech, power, wind, invisible, invisible.
It wasn't great if we could be invisible?
Oh, right?
I mean, we can be able to wait for people without alone and do what we want to be responsible.
Now, we've realized how to use a big boundaries to get the light in the goal to create the peace of the world's peace.
Scientists were created from materials to be a virtual theory of nervous objects and tiny species.
The cameras can also take what's behind you and make the picture so you'll see invisible.
However, no one of these possibilities can't make themselves in the size of a person's size and look at all of the opportunities and all of the studies in movement.
But if you're really invisible, just because, here's some problems that you may not think about before.
We're all going to get any other people and it will be you, you're going to have to be a completely unusual place.
Even when a physicist outside!
You can't take anything, including the key, another one of people read your key lights in the environment.
And the genes and people on the street can't see you, so they're going to get you at some point.
Oh, because you don't go on or you're going to do three times, another they know you're there.
And just because you started invisible, you didn't say you're going to stay like this.
What if somebody's a mistake and you're going to be here just a surgeon?
And what if we're a rain?
But if you think dinosaurs can make you read, you're wrong.
My father's a city of light cells from people, some of us are trying to do from other materials.
My father's father's father's father's homework when we're bringing the little hairs on our city when we're in women.
So, even if you're invisible, you're still going to take all of your parts.
We usually don't exist on the city because we can't see that when we're on our city.
But, if you're invisible, people's creatures of people in Abraham's fathers with a really complex legislation.
Good!
How do you think that the world looks like if you were invisible?
Well, the answer is tools.
The reason you can't see in the wave is because there's no light.
To see a participation, I just need to get back to your eyes.
So, the networks in your eyes and take the slide for your brain so that you've got it to a picture of a development.
If you're invisible, then, in definition, I'm just going to be around you instead of return to you because people look.
But it means that the networks in your eyes are not a light, they're also.
So, your brain doesn't get anything to do with the picture.
You can see your slide without showing you to stop the light?
No.
So, when others can't see you, you can't see.
Amy!
Now, you've also thought if I realized it's a bubble?
If it's so, how can you get a medical treatment and say if you're doing?
The doctor doesn't know where to take the game or think they can't see your finger.
In the same way, you can't see it.
I mean, what if you have a disease today?
How can the doctor look at you without being able to see the color change or communities?
And what if everyone was invisible for the picture?
Well, think about how much of the world's world had to see people on the street, on TV, or at home as you see now.
It's very cool to be invisible.
Now, what's a philosophy in power on you've been black holes?
Secondly, big change and content, speech, power, wind, laughing, and -- invisible.
Do you remember when you looked at the first time your computer was more than a molecule?
Shen out of the past and the gender of the gene, there was something that you'd put your car, the building them, and it's become reality?
What is this?
Is it a Germany?
Let's imagine that we can predict the size of electronics and return ourselves into a little bit of a mouse.
If you separate the past, you'll see it's a really simple machine.
I've got a couple of prices and a system that's the same motion and remote.
Maybe you've got our optimism to take these countries with new theories, but now there's more women to do it with a regulation that's got some plastic wheelchair.
The same thing.
When you're fighting the button in the past, it's sending to the computer with information about my species.
When you take a little bit of your mouse, it's scared by a simple system.
This system is changing as eyes, and we need a map of the computer.
Basically, it's enough way to communicate with my environment.
But it's also a function like outside to keep the lab and be exposed in the privacy.
In this case, it's a plastic system that's sent a little bit of your business enough thinking so it's created the privilege of the lab.
"Oh, work! I have a outside here."
The lab, we're the central fact, is the brain of all the computer.
Just like your brain didn't stop all the body, the lab doesn't stop all the computers, but it takes the phenomenon.
And the work of the lab, all my work, is to bring out the memory and make them.
So, while you're molecules, millions, millions, maybe really quickly, something like 60 words in India, the lab comes from a billion instructions in the year.
Yes, billions every year: it looks like to move the rest of the screen, to kill the cloud on the table of the work, to play your Internet, to manage the team that you're doing on the new experiment, and a lot more.
Your computer's computer is a lot of fuel!
"But I'm going to feel a little bit very important that's going on now!
Let's move everything now and take a box! "
There's a plan to everything that the lab does.
The brain software for the past, the fingerprints of the cloud, to the Internet, and the treatment of the same identity that's sent by the words.
Each software was written by human beings in language and see people, like Janua, BC, Canada.
But human programs have to take a lot of species and make a lot of information outside the computer, so they're a smaller and smaller and better than one in the robots of Africa in memory.
The lab between it is that it has to look at how to treat a little bit of the past, so it's looking for the presence of the rich program that has been able to give the memory system to see that's left there.
Everything looks at the Arab School is already in the mirror.
And it's not the end of the story!
Because the lab has been taught that the future of pressure when the train was over the picture of a computer screen, and so, it's the lab represents the screen to find this button.
And then the lab has to ask from the memory of the button, which means that the lab has to show the screen to show the video that's going to survive, and so on.
And let's just say there's a lot of great programs before you can even see the button on on the screen and when you've gone on.
So, just the simple activity of outside your past says in the morning all of these little components of your computer structure: the bank, the basic system, the lab, the lab, the program, the memory, and even one million.
Have you ever woke up in a song? Fathers know you, you thought, "It would be so cool to be asteroid!
I can push the outside space and look at the Earth and all that.
It would be so cool! "
It's not just the situation at all.
If you're in the outside space, you're spending the Earth, it's called a free treatment.
You're actually patients in the Earth.
Okay, think about it for a second. That's the feeling that you get if you're going to get the response on the road, you're like, "Wow and I'm going to go on."
Just you do it all the time you turn the Earth for two years, three hours, four hours.
And water, how long is it called, right?
So, how does the Earth work?
Let's look at a book from Einstein.
I've had an idea, a little computer experiment. You take a sense, put it on the head of a hour.
If you're in the beginning, it's a little bit away from you.
But if you see it more powerful, it's a far far away enough that it's going to take a little bit beyond the Earth's Earth.
Well, you can imagine if you're seeing it really, really powerful, it's pushing the Earth and go back, water!
Let's take a lot of women with you in a little bit of a little bit over the face of the Earth and think the best to be up.
You're going to go to a park and get in the Earth.
But, you're actually a very quickly entrepreneurship.
So, when you go down, you go to the park.
You're going to find yourself in the Earth, and you're falling down, and now the Earth's going to make you out of the side.
Okay, and now it's guaranteed you back and you're patients down, so you're missing the Earth, and now you're under the Earth.
And the Earth gets you up, but you're the right side.
So you're going to get again the Earth. Now, you're on the other side of the Earth.
You know, you're going to have the Earth's Earth and you're going to have you on the side.
But you're aware of the industry.
And now you're listening to the top part of the Earth, over the northern and the northern, and they're going to be patients down, and yes, you're going to get right.
You're going to keep it because you know so quickly.
In this way, astronomers expect the Earth.
They're always patients in the Earth, but they're always missing, and so, they're taking all the time.
They feel like they're patients, so you just have to get it.
So, in fact, if you want enough patients, you can open the Earth.
But there's a big problem.
First of all, you need to know at eight kilometers per second.
It's 18,000 words for an hour, a little over 23!
The second problem: If you know so fast, yes, you're pushing the Earth and you're actually going to learn from it, but there's a lot of air in the way, much less things and people.
So you're going to have a result of education in atmosphere.
So, I'm not glad about it.
Scientists have a mistake about evolution.
Let's talk about evolution.
You've probably heard that some of the people think it to change in disease even though most scientists don't.
But even if you're not one of these people and you think you've got a good understanding about evolution, the risks are that you still believe in some things about it that doesn't mean right, things like, "evolution is organic to their environment."
It was a theory of theory that when I was going to have a moment about evolution.
Almost 60 years ago, Darwin published his book, John in Palestinian astronomer's offered by certain programs over their lives and then he'll have these programs for their office.
For instance, he thought that, because Jeopardians don't reduce their lives to come to a high seas, their offspring will be born with a long way.
But we know now that's how genetic networks work.
In fact, organic organisms don't evolve at all.
Instead, genetic motivations make some of the jealousy to be born with a long, and it gives them a better chance to survive when it wasn't lucky, which brings us to "The survival of the wisdom."
It sounds like evolution always knows the biggest, the most powerful, or the fastest, what's not really the case.
One thing that's safe, because evolutionary connection is just a matter of the current environment.
If all of the high trees are surprising and dancing and dancing in the rest of the rest of the rest of the long, all the jungles were in the situation of corruption.
Secondly, survival is not how evolutionary evolution is happening, it's going through a long way.
And the world's full of creatures like the galaxy, which is so small if it's not going to survive in the night that it has to find a very quickly before it's dead.
But at least we can say that if organism gets to culture, it's more evolutionary, right?
Still!
Remember, natural choice doesn't happen in the energy level, but in the genetic level, and it's the same play in organism in our buildings as well.
So, a gene that causes the animal to get their life to survive and survive and to the building of one of the ocean, can be more common than organism that will be used to use itself.
Everything that makes it more than the future of the same gene will go to the next generation to the goal, to the tree -- the evolution of evolution.
One of the women to remember about evolution is that when we say things like, "genes want to do data from themselves or even nature," we're actually using metaphor.
Remember doesn't want anything, and there's no external mechanisms that choose what genes are the best genes for the left.
Everything that happens is that genetic intelligence and organisms that are carrying them to come and evolve in different ways.
Some of these ways make more the future of the gene that's going to go on, and so on.
Like, there's no one of the first magnitude program that's dealing with an anonymous form.
It's not me that the human eye would be blind where the optimism is coming out of the network, but that's how it evolved, from a simple theory.
In the region, it could be much more efficient than human beings to change diverse materials instead of liberals.
But through thousands of years, where our ancestors have evolved, the New York City, and there wasn't possible to expect that it's two quickly later.
So, evolution is really going on in a young way, after a step after a step, I've created all the genes that we see in nature.
Fields are a complicated thing, especially when molecules have a great connection.
If you can remember a few generations in Chinese, a simple philosophy, and a few insects know, you're going to use satellites in a right way.
I love to think about different parts of our sentence and chemistry.
Let's react them: the privilege molecules, the air molecules, and the wisdom.
The connection molecules are pretty small.
They're words that are psychological companies, words, cosmos.
You can remember the street molecules by the head of the house in Gabby.
The public words are for me, and also, not, but, I'm still, so.
Because they're so small, more times full, they're going to have a help of stop but not always.
The molecules have a device on the other, they're the statement of the sentence.
They're words that survive different things, independence and independence.
The molecules have a list of the sentence.
In general ways, there's a service that's going to happen, because, before, with that, but if, although.
Because the molecules have all about power, they can do the hard work themselves.
But, of course, sometimes even the powerful times that we need a little bit of help from the warriors.
Because our stimulus is so nice, it's a lot of times a technique to do connections.
Today, once he's moving his house, he's seeing a door and he's going to keep the weight of two sentences, one on every arm.
I'm going to like to get politicians even though it's close.
The park asked the device word if it needed help.
Well, we know that the molecules of the world are the world's face of the sentences.
The capacity can remove these three sentences because they're scared in a different way between two arms.
So, when the prosperity asked if he could help, the door of the door has been reduced from the idea of help.
No hope, maybe the next time!
So, we've got a really complicated experiment.
In the year, it's seeing two molecules that are trying to get the weight of the families before.
Even though you're going to like a poem, it's never about others.
The park ask the old words if they need help.
They may not want to be in that, but this time the molecules have to help.
The sentences that sometimes have a lot.
The simple philosophy tells us that it's just better to train nervous objects if the web is reduced in a different way.
So, while the molecules were able to train two sentences as they're trying to reduce the web on the two side, they have a problem to get one.
We've gone from there to help the department of the device, but how does it help?
When the molecules have a sentence start from sentence, we've done ourselves after the first thought is the perfect sentence.
After it's going to help the old molecules, the galaxy that's going to go through the same amount of brain to reduce the web of two sentences that are perfect.
In the University of Canadian University, and it's on the University of the University of Street.
The park asked the connection of the connection with it needs help.
Obviously it needs!
Research! We've put ourselves before the connection of the connection.
Social molecules don't have dreams like molecules and connection.
And so, the experiment doesn't have to care about the poetry behind the public molecules.
Social molecules have been lost.
They allow them to go before.
To help others that's hard work!
In the way that home, our experiences see a brain in the morning and reduce the web of a whole sentence and a part of the sentence.
You're going to learn biological biological biology.
We've already done that there's always the connection of the connection if it has to help the details.
It's one of the only cases where the molecules have to do not need the business.
The stretch of the street's connection to a concept that's not a network, what's going to be able to finish because now, everything she wants to do is go home and take a good eyes of sentences.
So, I have an investment opportunity that doesn't treat it that it's a potential quality to you.
Over the last 10 years in England, the returned on the windows of the CEO on the Olympics of about three to one.
There's some privacy societies that face with parts of the skin, and they're starting in 3,,,,,00 dollars that we've joined.
And they're expected to get a big size of about 40 percent.
And the biggest solution is that it's changed with a device that's going on.
Now, it's a real success, and there's companies where really offer this investment, but my thing about it is different.
I'm architecture and agriculture, and over the last year, I've been looking at the access to death and how they're going to do our cities in content.
So in the summer, I did my first show on my death and architecture in evolution, and it looks like "Montana."
And because death is a topic that many of us find and we don't have to talk about it, the extension was going to be done, so the people can be able to connect with.
So one of these regulations was a very interactive map of London that showed really how much of the city of the city can be learned.
And when you're facing the map, the name of the CEO's Clinton -- the building of the things -- slow.
And these heart forms that you can see, they're all in hospital and they're going to be remote and exploring things in the city.
In fact, most of them are in companies.
We wanted to show that even though I've learned in the career are things that we might not think about, everyone around us, and they're part of our cities.
So about four million people die in England every year, and on the left, about four and wanted to talk.
But not Google, like a lot of clinical countries, and they're proud to happen, in the central cities.
It's a liberal liquid that I've been aware of this for a while, and the main reasons are big or population, the fact that I've been talking about almost full.
There's the English use of English that things are thought to be able to find advertising, and there's also a special pressure -- people want to use the same what to build in the house or office we're doing.
So they came up with some solutions.
They were like, well, these are we can use these things after 50 years.
Or maybe we can bring people, like, four to the sky. So the four people can be in the same part, and we can do a better use of the nation, in that way, in this way, and in our community, we're going to still be able to read people in the future.
But, creativity, companies don't treat us by the local networks.
In fact, the surprising thing is that there's no experiences on no one in England to students in the morning.
Social, it's been done by privacy organizations and data, like I've been covered in a box.
But there were also sometimes groups for a professor who wanted to get into the game.
And you know, they're looking at the little size of this bear and this high research, and it looks like there's money we wanted to get together.
So, in fact, if you want to go out and open your health, you're kind of capable.
Here's a virus response, and they had a lot of experience and a lot of our galaxy, and they wanted to develop the surface.
And they had a lot of ideas.
They thought of the first time for the French Friday, but the mom said not.
And then they wanted to open up a genome and over the task said no.
So they brought the idea to open their health and they think that, they could tell their value from about 95,000 dollars to happen.
But just go back to this idea of making things like, it's kind of power, right?
The thing is that the high cost of these beetle windows is actually very surprising.
They look like they're expensive, but the cost is changing the fact that you need to be part of a bedroom -- like, someone has to wait for the next 50 years.
It means that it's very difficult to do money in health.
And that's why it's in general that they're reduced by the sample or by a group of metaphor.
But in any way, I'm going to do with these people, and they're now trying to build their home.
So just to explain to you a kind of how it works: if I want to build something in England, like a house for example, so I've got to ask that there's a first design.
So if I want to build a new building for a new office or if I want to expand my home or, you know, if I have a life and I want to get it to the office. I need to do a lot of light, and I'm sending them to a decade.
And they're looking at things like how it comes to the environment.
So they look at what it looks like.
But they also thought about things like what impact would it be about the local environment?
And they thought about things like, is it going to get to the day or would it be a lot of movement that you want to get to this thing that I've built?
But also good things.
It's a end of local services like microbes to neighborhood that people want to use?
And they've got the solutions and their independence and they've got a decision.
So that's how it works with you want to build a big thing.
But what if you have a piece of land and you just want to read how many people, like five people?
Well, so, in fact, I don't need a man behind one!
There's almost no energy in the English that's happening to the bear, and the web, it's going to be reminded without the water, like they don't remember the same day.
So in fact, if you want to go and open your own things, then you can.
But I mean, as if -- really, why do that?
Well, if you're a democratic family and you have a big one, then there's the chance that you have music in it, and you're going to talk to the family.
But the really strange thing is that you don't need to have a very large piece of land before you get to start with people.
And so this means that techniques, it's a relationship, like, the back to your house in the villages.
And so what if you want to try it for yourself at home?
Well, there's some trees that they have in the website that can help you.
So, the first thing they're telling you is that you need a career before you're really ready -- I'm not going to just want people to put them under the platform.
And they also tell you that you need to get the place.
But it's less than the French women.
Now, they recognize you that your neighborhood may not love it, but, animals, there's almost nothing they can do about it.
And just in a case that someone who's still the street idea about how many of these effective parts and how much money you might make, they're also teaching that it might live for your home to save 20 percent.
Although, in fact, there's more sense that no one wanted to buy your home after all.
So what I find interesting about this is the fact that it's kind of a lot of our approach to death.
In England, and I think the numbers around Europe are probably a place, just about 30 percent of the people I've ever been talking to someone about their team about death, and even people over 75, just 45 percent of the people ever talked about it.
And the reason why people give me -- you know, they think their places were far away or they think they were made out of unprecedented people on this.
And you know, in some country, there's other people where you're reducing things for us.
The government has a democracy about things like death, for example, there's people like the managers who put all the years of working with this issue.
But when it comes to our cities if we think about how places come to our cities, there's a lot less energy and thought we can imagine.
So we don't think about it, but all the people we hope we think about it -- they don't treat it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We've tried to learn from a wave.
The New York Times is easy, they're just a connection that you can learn with a leg.
But to get the wisdom, you're going to have to need a video or a small, but if you have a better way.
Now, it's obvious that the face of a small, I'm growing with the wind, but it's going to be much more far away than that.
In fact, the relationship between the markets, the spinal part of the Internet, always is the same number, no matter how big the world is doing.
The historians don't sure what this number is going to be for the first time, but it would know in some way for 4,000 years.
My values appear in the work of the future universe, in no, Chinese, and mathematicians today.
And even believe it was used in the Portugal building in Egypt.
It's the rich mathematicians because it's by making biological creatures on the surface.
And until 1,600, it's thinking about 10 minutes after the rich point.
So, when do they finally know the local value in the rich place?
It's actually never!
You see, the relationship of our electronic cycle is what we know as a number of unusual, one that you can't know about three numbers.
You can get close, but it doesn't matter how much the crisis is, it's always a little bit.
So, to write it in a decade, and you'll have a series of books that start at 149 and you're going to support it!
So instead of trying to write a number of schools every time, we're treating it using the same babies.
Today, we're looking at the speed of computers by which we're giving them to our face, and computers would be able to think about it until we're going to call books.
People don't even choose to see how many books they can change and while people remember more than 6,000 of them.
But most scientists, you need the first four.
And what are these scientists?
Well, about every month that's going to happen to the waves, what's less likely to be on the refugees of children.
And it's not just waves even.
Because it's also easy to learn information, we're going to help us understand open systems like poor, electromagnetic waves, and even music.
In statistics, we've been using a equation to think the surface underneath a normal physician, what's going to be able to understand physicians' physical results, philosophical words, say a scientific outcomes.
And if it wasn't enough, we've been using some parts, like these in the big, not just because of our galaxy, it's more in the eyes, but because of the words where parts know.
Scientists even used in order to prove the amazing feeling that light is also as part of the electromagnetic, and maybe more exciting, to think of our experiences, by the way, there's still a lot less than the numbers in the face.
This picture of the Twitter man, who has a very devastating conversation of the air, became one of the most familiar symbols of Ross.
But why?
It's just a simple form of TV, right?
Still!
Let's start to answer this question with mathematics.
I don't know how to think the surface of the world.
I'm going to take the value of Philippines the same thing.
I also know how to take the surface of the ground.
I'm proud the basis itself.
But how do I take the big surface and create a connection in the same area?
It's a problem called most of the world's world's first investment in the future.
And like a lot of ideas of the future world, it's got new life during the virus.
It turns out, that this problem is inevitable because of the iPhone, but it's another story.
The air of the air, which has been affected by the architecture of the Rome, and Twitter and Twitter, where a person in the center of a big city.
And Twitter and Twitter argued that the robot is the human body center that if you take away from the driver and put it on the road, you can create a perfect space around the body.
In addition, we're going to have the best trick in the fact that the universe's developing today and the response is almost identical in the human body, so that's where it's where the body is built inside the robot as well as well.
We didn't just use our ideas and Twitter to solve the problems of the world's problems that we're used by using people when the security of creativity.
We didn't just think about the Internet with that.
There was an intuitive movement in Italy at the same time that we saw autism.
This movement took an idea of the fourth century that was developed by Western Africa, called "The big service of today."
This belief that the universe is a different way to the chain, and this service begins up with the violence, so it's going to go through the artists, plants, and all the animals before I've come up with the small years.
In the first of the philosophical movement, we thought the species of humanity in the chain was exactly in the center.
Because people have a new body that's beginning to us that what's violence, we're looking for the universe in the middle.
Over the time that we don't just want to create the Internet, with that, to make a project called Penna Monica and be another idea.
He took the human species from the service that made a concept that people have the ability to take all sorts of species that they want.
Finnounced that God wanted to understand the complexity of complexity that he created.
It's led to the form of humanity, which is there in the center of the universe with the ability to take every form you want.
The humanity, before us, can forget in the morning that I've been able to get like the brain or the platform of the economy that can be like this, it's our choice.
In the area of the air, we can see that by the two species of the person, it can fill the rivers of the city and the majority.
If a meter is the language that the universe's going on, then the light says that we can move inside the whole experiments.
The humanity can be able to eat that it wants a philosophy and philosophy as well.
In this only theory, Darwa can't take the mathematics, religion, the philosophy, the architecture, and the art of New York City.
There's no doctor that it's become the opposite of all the time.
Let's take a moment to read the next text.
How was it?
Should you go?
OK?
What about these sentences?
They're actually trying to learn to our experience of civilization, where we're going to make you open every word.
These are the ones with Congress who live this particular rate every time they read.
As most people think about Syla, they think about seeing the same beautiful words, like see "Bay" and "and" and "and" and "and" and "and maybe they think people with California is" a hole. "
It's the truth that people with Congress see things like everyone.
And Scotland has been caused because of biological problems, which means that people who are affected from a problem not with the political language.
For example, if you're going to hear the word and then someone asked you, "We're going to remain", "What's the word to stay?
Thank you.
It can be difficult to be difficult to with Congress.
If they get a structure of structure, like Pittsburgh, students with Scotland need to solve the word to read it: PM, Texas.
The time we've learned that we've been able to open it into a hard woman to keep up with friends and get enough of understanding.
The same political words, like Milliams and companies are also expected.
These women are more functional and changing.
And Social affects one of five people.
It's going to happen on a sequence.
One person might be a community in the past was a different case.
And Sollia also wanted in the family.
It's beautiful to see one family who has problems with me after there's problems that have even one words in the year, like my head.
Our physicist's physicist show a lot more likely to think about when we're looking at these in the brain with California that's surrounded language.
The radiologist is the idea that all our brains show the difference in action and action, we don't have to be so careful for all of the leadership "and" and "as an active disruption or disappointing people if these creatures."
People with biological markets like civilization, including creative people and reality like Pensburg, who's worrying about, and Giberberg, who's in Berberberg, who's in Bergen, who's in Bergarian, who's in the ability to be very successful and successful.
So, here's a special way that these brains with Congress works.
The brain's starting to change intuition.
The questions are responsible for the language and ultimately, and in the end, you can see, in the local problem in all sorts of spaces.
The MRI MRI studio study found that the brain of these with Canada are looking at more on the right isn't the strength of people than people.
It means, when they read a word, it's going to take a long time in the brain that can be treated in the extinction.
That's because of the green problem, they're called a larger market.
But these are with Congress can change the brain to improve the theory with new interventions that I've been talking to the language that's trying to work on the kind of health and experience.
The brain of those with Congress starts to use the questions more efficient in the medicine, and their theory is better.
The Western works because it's dealing the right category when we're going to exist in the brain, where there's no nature shows all kinds of differences between one person.
The New York Times has the data of brain activity in all people and offers to understand better the perspective of those around us, we need to try not only see the world through their ideas but understand their brains.
When we're watching a movie or a disease, we know that the players probably learned the service from the moral, which basically tells them what to say and say it.
And I'm going to play it.
Basically, in January Juson Bush, but the two artists used.
In the same building building to create their music: data, and even though the Chinese result can be heard in the economy, the diversity of data is actually related. Let's look at the experiences of music.
And how they communicate to create real work.
This music wrote about five pounds that go to the beach.
And on the top of the bed, the left is right.
The worst form says to do the sound of the sound or what they're leading, and the iPhone says to do the rate of the behavior.
Let's start with the sound of the sound, to help, we're going to use more, but this system works on everything you can think about.
In the Western music.
The sound that we've been able to read after the first seven hours of the house in the house, A, RB, []]],]]]].
MT, []]]]]]]]],]]]]]]]]] &
But how do these sound get the resources? Well, for example, if you're a CO2 and then you're more likely to get the story.
You're going to notice that they're going to hear a big relationship.
And we're going to go back back to something, we're going to be able to make a difference between two different changes.
We're one of these studies, we're saying to the military to play this sound.
But there's a lot more rapid response than you're doing today, and you can give us.
France, for example, can play 88 data.
So how do we treat 88 data to something building? We're using something called a key.
It's a very strange form that's focused on the beginning of something.
And there's something that's going on.
I'm going to tell you that there's a certain crisis that says that there's some artists and artists to collect your whole tool, if we want to play data that doesn't work on something, we're kind of excited and other small surgeons that look like Chile and Jerusalem and put the data on them.
If we need to create so much of California that's going to make a difference, so we need to change the key.
There are two main projects that control this: the rate of the rate of music is.
When myself, a kind of border. It sounds something like this.
Please notice that it doesn't change, it's just a genius and a joy.
It can be intuitive.
Or what you want, really. The point is that we're just like the second of the cloud.
One disease will be one to two seconds, with every year we've built the same way that every year.
It's the rate of disease to create a small music of time that everyone's different in your way, stress, with a conventional rate, we can start to end up with our kids, and then the music starts to happen.
It's the most basic experience of stress, and it's different from one rate, and it's half, and it's different that are surrounded.
This whole tool has changed four states.
And this little guy is that I've learned, two and a half times.
"You say," What does it mean? "
You may have noticed that not through the five, there are small changes that reduce it to small parts.
This is the United States.
And we're relationship to each part.
There's something that's called a while, what means to do in a few cases have anything.
It means that there's two facts in everything, it means that there's three, it's four, and so on.
You need to use the basic forces of the rate. One of the relationship to the whole, two and a half.
Four to a week, eight countries have changed, and so on.
So the bottom of this time, I'm saying there's four data every thing, one, three, four, four, four, three, three, three, three.
But as I said before, if we're just going to die, it's going to be done by a tree, so we're going to push a few minutes with different colors.
Please notice that even the number of data in all the rest of the year, the number of surgeons are all changed.
So how do we create our music that you've heard? Oh, you've heard okay, but maybe a little bit of hope, right?
Let's add another tool.
Now it sounds like music.
Of course, it's a little bit of a species to start to read it quickly and play what you see on our whole tool.
But, with a little bit of time and suffering, you can be the next boy.
Angin Broaden.
There's a lot of ways that our wonderful language, English, not the genetic language.
For example, most of the time when we're talking about more than one of something, we're put in the end.
One click, I've got a hospital.
But then, there's the courage of words where things work.
I'm going to ask you; if there's a friend, so you've got a man, or even better for me, women.
Even though if there was only one of them that was.
Or if there's more than one percent, so that's a jihad, but why not a lot of music?
Or if you have two legislations, so why don't you see that you're in the water.
The fact is that if you were talking about a thousand years ago, it's exactly what you would call more than one.
If modern English is strange, English has to have a psychologist.
Believe or not, English was even more difficult to learn from today.
2,500 years ago, Italian English is the same language.
They've been trained in intuition, and they've become more effective.
It means that in the local English English, just like Germany, money would be a lot.
Fortunately, Gulf, there was a coffee; at the time, there was a memory; and the table on it was, in Robert, was an invisible, which was called Antarctica.
Good!
To use these words not enough to know their meaning but what they are, also.
And while today, there's only about six forms of many that don '
You think it's a strange strategy?
Well, imagine if there's more than one hour of the summer's coffee gas, or if you're more than one tree of the Atlane's "Tim" has a year of ".
To be able to talk about each one of these, you had to know the molecules for their culture instead of trying to finish the people in the end.
And it wasn't always a place in the end.
In the future English, they're able to add other sound in the end.
Just like there's more than one molecule, more than one gene in the lab, and you're going to slow down, you're going to slow down the road, and people've been talking about [ECA]] -- but on] you're going to.
Sometimes it was like in the women today, to create the culture, you don't need to do anything.
Because in one year, you're going to be paid.
In English, one house, two.
And just like today, we've got a tool everywhere.
The ancient English people would have been in a place where [Sweden]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]
So, why don't things stay like we were?
In one word, Nanderthals.
In eight, thousands of tricks started to go on a lot of English.
They didn't talk English, they're a virtual thing.
And they were adults, and adults don't get a language like children.
After 15 to the process, it's almost impossible to learn a new language without limited and raise there as we all know from the skin.
We had no different genes, so they had a way to replace the women's dream of how English works.
Some of it was these crazy forms.
And imagine a language of language with an astronomer from one side, and then with other words, everything you needed is to end up with Egyptian.
It wasn't much more simple to use food?
That's how the viruses feel.
And there were so many of them, and they started with so many English women, two fast, if you're growing in England, you've heard English as a real art.
After a while, nobody remember the real English.
No one remember that you'd ever say Rica instead of a door in a place where you'd be.
A lot of creativity was a lot more diverse now, outside of some extinction like the Technology that it was hard to break the leg.
The lesson is that English is much bigger than you think.
Thanks to my father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father '
Even though it could be a fun, if only to the week or two weeks, we could?
PM: So I thought a lot about women's companies, and by the way, these two women, I'm very excited to say, there's my companies for a very long time, too.
John Panada: Yeah.
PM: And one of the things I read about women's companies is something that Scott said.
He said, "You can tell a lot about somebody," In this case a woman, "on her companies."
So let's start with -- []] JG: We're in big cases.
Little Milton: Thank you a little bit of these water, I'm very dead.
[JG: You're the time of our time.
It's very limited -- L.C.: Just be it, that's going to lose all life.
[JG: You don't see nothing.
Anyway.
PM: So tell me, what do you look at society?
LP: I'm looking for somebody who has a sense of fun, which is left, that it's available, in political scientists, who has a concept of a second to the Earth, someone's leaders, in a new sense of thinking that Iran.
I didn't know what I'd like to do. I thought the morning. I don't even know what I was doing in my companies.
I mean, "I have companies, meaningful."
LP: [JP: No, that's true.
I don't know because I have my companies. They're -- one of them.
I don't know about you, but in any way -- you know, they're reducing it, they're waiting for me. They're making me worse.
They're less likely to me about you when I'm going to need a tragedy.
And it's also a lot more young than me.
I mean, it's nice: Thank you.
[JP: No, really, I can put you in this, because again, you know -- it's a fifth that's still in a environment that's going to play our kids from when you're going to read the end.
I'm sorry -- I'm going to be there for you.
LP: No, I'm happy that I have you to paint in a model for my opportunities.
[JP: I show you the way.
[LP: Well, you do that.
PM: Well, as I'm glad, and as I'm going to go through different restaurants, what do you do to keep my friends and my life?
LP: Well, you need to use a lot of -- JG: It's not invited me a lot, I'm going to tell you this.
LP: I need to use a lot of social media -- you'll be on the web. And so -- and so I'm going to go on my words, I'm going to find my students to find my friends, because I'm able to answer them as fast as possible, because I know they need to do.
And they need our support, because most of our friends are village, or active, or all three.
There's a long list of robots and other theory, and I want to get to you where you can, I want you to know that I'm there for you.
JP: Do you do a jihad?
LP: Oh. JG: No?
LP: It's cool. JP: I'm really on the argument of Jim.
LP: No, I'm very thrilled -- I'm very proud of our happiness molecules, and the nerve.
JP: You're very thrilled this right now -- L..C.: I'm very proud of all the same.
[JG: That's the category.
You know, the more I'm glad, I understand the importance of companies, and so, I'm really couldn't make a game -- not give me too much time to go.
I read a lot of times as a child knows very well, the books that I love, I'm asking my friends.
LP: When we've been here today that I've been able to take a lot of books on women, and I've been able to see some books, how many studies have been done in the last year -- JC: And I've been grateful?
And PM: And -- L.C.: Thanks, not, it's really important because it's a different example of how you're going to disappear, put them in the side, and you're going to change children.
It's very little research that we've been doing, even though we've built a lot of times.
JG: It's safe.
Audience: It's really exciting, and you're all interested in it.
A study in the school of medicine showed that women have small companies and less likely to develop physicists when they're food, they're going to be able to live, which seems to be much more sophisticated -- JP: Egyptians -- scary.
JG: We live five years more than men.
I think I've been looking for the years with happy.
But the most important part we've found -- the results were so excited and so interesting -- the studies found that there's a crisis of health and health care, like there's no matter.
JP: There's something else, also -- L.C.: I've already said my dream, so...
[JG: Okay, good, listening to my dream, because there's another thing.
Because they're just -- for years, decades -- they're just exploring men when they're trying to understand stress, just recently they're behind women when we're going to live, and it turns out that when we're going to live -- women, our body's exposed in the ocean.
It's the hormone to carbon stress that makes a good feeling, bad.
It's also when I'm with my friends and women.
And I think that's one reason why we live more time.
And that's so easy to create the men because they don't have it.
Stoston in men are afraid of the intuitive effect.
LP: Well, when I'm a kid, we've done "95."
JG: CA: -- L.C.: We've been laughed so much, we found that we had so much in the common common and we're so different.
Here's, like the Hollywood economy, I'm like a Twitter Twitter, [Nicole]]]]]]] The New York Times]]] &#93
JP: I think -- let's build our legs a lot.
And if you know why I mean.
LP: I think we all know why you mean.
Audience: You're trying 10 years to live right now.
So from the books that John's sent me to Sweden and read about companies was a book of a woman that I'm a very, Street Street, who said about women's companies who have no social societies, they're essentially free.
Did I give you thinking about companies where women are just curious?
Are they trying something that's just going to live in your life?
LP: Just my life -- I'm actually thinking.
Because -- in terms of people who know a lot of time that you've spent with them -- I can see the walls in you, the river, the actions.
There's actually a kind of love, a mother of love in the relationship.
I'm just going to see a deep inside your office.
PM: Do you see this, JL: But I have special power.
JP: Well, there are all kinds of friends.
There's business friends, and my friends from empathy, I've got a lot of those.
But the ocean companies have...
They feels only because it's open to heart, right?
You know, we're going to live too far -- I find that I'm a lot of meaning with the intuitive companies.
Not because I'm sad, but they're touched by inspiration.
LP: And you know that one is going to write.
So PM: Well, two weeks here, to me, who's talking about?
And I'm always thinking, when women talk about their societies, men always look a little bit of heart.
What are the differences, you think, between men and men and women?
LP: There's a big difference, and I think we need to have a lot of empathy to men -- so they don't have what we have.
I think it's maybe the reason they're going to die more.
So we have a lot of compassion, because women, seriously, we -- from different relationships, our societies, they're very beautiful.
They're scared.
I'm looking at actions -- it's something that men don't do.
I mean, how many times I asked you, "Is I okay?"
"Would I really get there?"
PM: You're doing interesting.
[JG: But I mean, we ask these questions like this, and men don't.
People describe relationships between women like face, while men's societies are more likely to identify.
LP: Most of the time men don't want to replace their emotions and they want to bring the deeper emotions.
I mean, it's in general that we've been in evolution.
They're going to go into their lab, to watch a game or play a body or talk about Portugal, oh, or machines might be treated.
I mean, it's just a kind of -- it's more men behavior.
JG: The plan -- L.C.: They're talking about basis.
I mean, I'd mean that maybe they'd have been doing something if we could get someone in their own person's lab because -- JC: You know, something that I knew very interesting -- again, psychologists didn't know it about recently -- it's that men and children who have a really difficult relationship like women.
If you look at the movies of babies in the house that it's going to be born, you'll see that the buildings are just like the house, look into the eyes of their art, they need this connection of energy.
When you look at the exhibition, you can see the liquid on the door, the child even in the classroom.
They need a relationship.
So the question is why, when they live is changing?
And the answer is a platform culture, which means to build young men need to be a emotional relationship with someone.
The real men don't understand how it works, they don't go to doctors if they feel bad.
They don't ask help.
There's a quote that I really like, "Man new men become" we're "and" their "I'm."
You know, my self-sense.
While the sense of women have always been something.
But our "We're" is our investment, it's what makes us.
It's not that we're better than men, just I need to prove our men.
LP: Well, well -- JG: It's a quote of a statistics.
So I can look at our humanity -- L.C.: I know who's a galaxy.
JP: I know you know who it is, but I think it's -- not, but I think it's a great quote.
I'm not much better than men, just don't need to prove our men.
And this is really important.
LP: But men are so many people in culture to feel together in the atmosphere.
And we need to make something else that happens.
JG: Western companies are like a new source of power.
LP: Well, that's what's exciting about this.
It's because our societies -- different companies are just going to have to one of our lives, and one of the women can be a very powerful power, give the world -- to make it out of what it should be -- the things that people need to need them.
PM: That's why I'm talking about it, because the companies of women, as you said, John's a new source of power.
So how do we use this power?
Well, women are the most famous demographic model in the world, especially women from adults.
And if you take our power, we can change the world.
We have to do that.
[Time]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]] &#
And one of the things that we need to do -- and we can do it because women -- first, we're in a problem or when we're the students's students.
We need to make less.
We're in the Western world need to need less and when we're building things, we need to buy things too much, when you've got to buy this kind of thing that's growing up.
We are those who need to live outside the network.
We need to go back words from adults.
And the voice companies are bringing -- the "Ason" and "and" these bad people -- because it's what they're -- and we tell us that we can't do it without going to go back to the fire.
You know, the features are not really there yet, and it's not true.
There's countries in the world right now that live in a city on energy and represents two cases.
And they're telling us that if we're very limited, we're going to find ourselves back to the Amazon, and in fact, if we're starting to use the new energy, and we don't live in the region, and we don't live -- LT: OK.
JG: And we didn't take the time in the golden hospital -- right.
It would be -- there was more democracy and more jobs work more and more profound, and these are the women who are going to lead the way.
LP: Maybe it's the students to start three metaphors with our sister around the world, with women that we don't see, women who may never be a meeting, but we're nurgent in this way, history -- most people get men and men.
And the effective word here was "men."
Because they thought companies should be between women and women and women didn't think to change -- JP: they didn't think we were even pregnant, the hands.
LP: No, exactly. It shows you how long history would be limited.
And waiting, no, here's the best part.
It's like, you know, men need women now.
The platform has to women.
The American experience needs women.
We don't even live.
JG: You're talking about a unique interview of rights.
LP: Yeah.
The Scott Gates said something like -- every single animal that wrote since the Second War's Second War's Second War's Central War, but we don't.
So it would be a good place to start.
It's very, very interesting -- JP: Right.
[There]]]] There's a equality between the species, it's like proud, it's depending all the stories, not just women.
PM: You need more words to live and how to do that.
How to be companies, how to think about our power in different ways, as consumers, as citizens, and that's what makes John's experience of how women can be companies -- for a long time, and if they don't agree in the world.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Audience: Thank you.
LP: Thank you.
JP: Thank you.
Thank you.
Imagine this: You're going to have a deep change when you're suddenly blind!
And it's not the great idea.
The eyes are scared, and there's a moment that you're sitting on the side, I'll show you.
You're trying to open the plastic, but no sound comes out.
You're trying to run, but you realize you're changing.
It's trying to experience you, but you can't say.
You're going to have a dream, and that's Scott.
It sounds like a movie of Stephen Bang's movie, but it's actually a medical situation called a second, and about a half of the population has been living this strange phenomenon once in life.
This natural case of being a face with small creatures can go through interesting changes and all of the identical identical identities of a motion or a sensors or a feeling out of a body as if you're in.
Others even argued in thinking that two years is a meeting with a wind or a return.
In 1867, Charles Syrian's first doctor was the first doctor of a second.
"The person is going to happen to our environment, but we can't get any connection.
And we're still going to see that there's still a clock.
It's really in the door of the movement, and it's in the pressure of a season.
If it's just able to move, it's the most common and disappear. "
Even the first poem was the first to look at the students in a different situation, it's so proud that as a little bit of the cultural culture does when it's the French French Arab.
In the Europe of the buildings, maybe you'd be thinking that I'm a boss, that's a hungry for malaria, and you're going to get you in the night.
In Sydney, the master, a young woman, brings the women and sit on all of their young people.
In Turkey, John was reducing you and trying to experience you.
In the cell, if you're affecting you while you're different.
In the United States, it comes to you.
In Mexico, you'd notice the basis of Mexica, the man.
Basically, a teacher is sitting on your chest and try to experience you.
In Paul, and it's the sensors under the stairs.
Maybe it's easier to get bad at two years because what's going on in a much new brain to explain.
Scientists believe that different scientists have actually made out of the REM's reference, and I've known what's going on, and that's what's going on.
While you go back to RIM, you live a number of new genes in a form of parts, and your brain doesn't exist.
Over the dream, saving nervous nervous nervous nerves, which change almost all the muscles.
It's called REM.
That's what you're going to run out of the bed when you're looking at your dreams.
Over a third physics, you're living with REM's normal components.
You're learning and your muscles change, just your brain is in the forest.
That's what makes you imagine that you live with bad news.
So it explains the opportunity, but what about the feelings of the action, experience, stress, in the sense that so many people are described?
Well during RIM, the functions that are changing you from the part of your reality, RIM, also reduce the control of the self-self-self-esteem.
The other thing I've done more radiation and what's going on.
You're going to get more carbon and you're living in the community of a different way.
Over a second year, there's a combination of your open body's body's body's body's body's body's body's body's body's body's body's body's body's body &ap
It makes you try to try to hate light, but you can't be able to have the REM that takes your capacity to control your capacity.
This father doesn't happen in the body's body's body and create a sense of stress on the ground we are.
While a number of people living in a different way, it might be to have different disorders like Darwin, many of the rules that live it to live it in the far world, maybe once in life.
So you can be a moment, as you know that no one's trying to shoot, go, to our life, or prevent you for women.
You've put it to a train!
Two years ago, I've been here for the first time.
I didn't have any idea if it's been working or if it's possible, but in some small steps, I've created my first chair, which is called "The Gabby."
I've been surprised with biological biological biological biology, I've invented the work for French Ford, in the region that I've been released by Darwin.
And then this amazing thing happened.
It changed.
One boy became two.
Two years became the 26.
And before I knew, we've created the first parasites in the world.
In 2009, I went to Mexico and I started with local groups.
It's a small community, for a few movement of the people who get on today.
And then finally, to the museum, with over 500 patients.
Genn, that's what it looks like, it's not just warming.
Since we've discovered the design: "Alex Amazon," in the Amazon, "is going to be six feet over the water that's got over 40 feet, and today I'm making a strategy and I'm making some kind of dirty in the Atlantic ocean.
Each project, we've been using materials and design design and life; safe and interactive, which is based on the design of design.
My teachers allow the face of algorithms to connect with us.
We're teaching them in natural gas so that after the hair, they have the computer website.
The creatures are all organized so they're making a really big scale.
Even in this slide, there's a beautiful area for filmmakers like asteroids and stars.
So why do we get my work in the ocean?
Because really, it's not really easy.
When you're in the middle of the day under three meters, you're trying to raise small eight minutes to the day, you're starting to be if you don't have to choose in the painting instead of this.
But at the end, the results always die with me.
[The ocean] is the amazing space in the world that's ever going to be able to buy.
You have an amazing effect of a theory that changes every hour, a team of a patient who cards the bone in the eye of a restaurant, the quality of a long time and the process of studies, each one can give our brain to the website.
[But over the years, I realized that the biggest thing about what we're doing, the really profound thing about work, it's that once we hear the pixels, they're not more, because once we hear them, the drugs that can.
When innovation is created, a new world starts to start, a world that's affected us without the park.
It's a little bit of a woman, but no human beings can't change the species of nature.
Speaks look like scientists on the face.
Alexandrogen is changing their creatures.
You go to the head of the data to build as they need.
It's too much and that's where they're looking for.
And it's a part of the body and it's got a night.
I've been a remote device from a big color.
The worst person I've ever seen in life under the water.
Girls are interested in the water with the wheels.
Social genes and water like air.
And you're going to get a lot of effects on the road.
And the amazing response that we've got to these work I've learned that we've been able to connect with something really first, because it looks like these species around the world, and it's made me deal with my responsibility as an artist and what I'm trying to get.
I'm standing here today on this series in the middle of the ocean, and there's no good place to talk about the really important effect of my work.
Because as we all know, our markets are dead, and our oceans are in the case.
So here's the thing: the most common picture is using a recovery of all my work now is this.
And I think there's a reason, or at least I hope it's this.
What I really hope is that people start to understand that when we think about the natural environment, we need to start thinking about our oceans.
Since these websites, we have a couple of results and unusual results.
You need to create more than 800 feet of new regions and innovation, you get to Floridin and imagine a half parts of the museum and the natural museum, providing a meaningful growth for business areas.
You know, "I'm an Alex" in the Amazon, "in the Amazon," in the Amazon, "in the Amazon," in the Amazon, "and" in the Amazon, "and" in the Amazon, &quot
The international activity of art then reminded the government to get 10 million dollars a month.
The February February in America reminded the government to remember about a mistake as a musician.
In order to get back to the park and help the magazine to deal with the walls and the cosmos.
The website is going to have a "French" by Washingdom. "
So why are we all here today in this room?
What do we all have in common?
I think we're all participants at least that we don't define our oceans enough.
And one way of thinking about this is that we don't treat our oceans like women, and we need.
When we see amazing places -- like the House is full of a wonderful community, or this country, even -- when we see the places and these amazing things, we understand their thinking.
We call them women, and we're doing as we can read them, to protect them and keep them.
But to do that, we've got to give this value; it's taken by somebody who doesn't understand the value.
So I'd like to finish in the morning about things and women.
When we've come there to the website in London, we've seen a very important museum: music isn't ready to use, of education.
They're places where we're saying self-values for us, where we're making them in their own own own.
If somebody was just a group of Chinese community, we would be touched.
If someone would like to build a million stars at the bottom of the German, we would have been exposed by represents it from Amazon.
And yet every day we're hormones, gas, get too much in the oceans.
And I think we have more to do that, because when we see the ocean, we don't see the destruction that we're causing.
Because for most people, the ocean is this.
And it's really hard to think about something that's so sad, when a morning.
It's just too complicated, too big, I'm too story.
And what do you see here?
I think most people are actually looking beyond the iPhone.
So I think there's a real agreement that we're never seeing today, and if we don't see it really, if we don't have a graph of it, if we're missing our car, then there's a big risk that we take it.
And Darwin knows in the bank room, Tony's's "and" is going to be sick. "
And her water is the place where students can write about how they're trying to build.
But because of our work there, there's a little bit of a building that's just happening in itself.
And we don't want to stop in Afghanistan, building and love.
Just last month, I've spent the four years of the Paul Polina's Foundation in the Central Canada, in the center of California, and I've been standing around about the climate change of the people who have the power to change the power to change the things.
Because for me, it's just the beginning of the task.
We want to share with other inventions, products, politicians, biologists, to see a better future of our oceans.
And we want to see beyond plastic, beyond art, even.
And say you're born in 14 of the city, and you've never seen the ocean.
And instead of going to the museum of nature or air, you're going to go to the ocean, the door of a death door, it's going to be able to put through a local rights, where you can see all the life on the ocean on the ocean.
It's safe for you.
So let's think of the size of a big, and let's think about it.
Imagine where our imagination and power can lead us.
I hope that in our art of the ocean, we don't just find an amazing creativity of the species, but also reduce something, and new environments to swim, and you show a really different way -- and maybe it's a really different way -- like scientists and values, we've seen value.
Our oceans imagine women.
Thank you.
Thank you.
In the National Bank of 1957, the world looked at at fear when the profound companies made the first prototype of climate change, for space.
Because this little device, in the Internet of 06 meters, we're going to have the motor to the window between the local United States.
It's a summer that's going to go through 18 years and change the world as we know it.
Scott was actually not the first human technology that made a space.
This description that's going to go to C2 and two patients that have changed the German in the United States over the last part of the last war of the second world.
The patients didn't have been so effective, but when the Western war, the United States in the United States were also adopted the technology and the scientists who developed it and started using them to their projects.
And in 1957, the professors were trying to succeed the difference between the first two years, the RRAC that used later to get more sensitive and months later.
So the most powerful thing was not the audience itself, but the fact that the same technology can be used to be used for a big frog for the city.
In order to stay behind, there's an astronomy that's going to save our project to switch as well as possible.
And in the 1957, people and emotions from all the country came in to expect the calculation of London and Egyptian and Atlantic, and the Rotsburg has gone through two seconds later.
My failure is made from a car in the United States.
The most popular data in San, "Philippint" and "and" and "and" Pacific. "
And the good side of the United States came out that the United States will get a concept of developing countries.
Fortunately, the military worked on a word program, or a virtue, which was made in the Kenya in 1958, but the United States and the United States were asked to build the forest before the robots came back in the hour, and it was the first man in Africa in 1961.
It's almost a year, we've been exposed to the Facebook and other robots that are trying to put their use in a space in a space in a project and bring John Glan to be the first American in French 1962 in 1962.
In this time, I don't realize that just to fly in the room of a few months after the viruses is just not enough.
The United States has to do something first, and in 1961, a month after the income of Gargen and the list of my goal to put a person on the wind of the years.
They've come from this goal through a platform and even with a trillion who did the famous step for 20 children in 1969.
The two countries have made their attention to space, you can't know how long the space is going on.
But at the same time that the relationship between the Soviet and the University of Canada and the United States in London, the United States and the United States were going to share instead of acting.
The average task of their successful reduction, the knowledge called Alzheimer, where even American spaces started to discover robots and two groups have met, some of them, and they started the end of the motor's story to 1975.
So in the end of what was the goal of all the microbes to space?
Is it just at the time or light?
Two designers are trying to bring one second by a beautiful period that would be complicated as one of the resources that could use in the resources that could be invented in other places?
Well, sure, of course, but the biggest solution of the space program is not about one country that's trying to change the other.
Over the morning, you're going to have to go to the space, you're going to have to have a education room, in generally, I've discovered, something that's led to many more solutions that might not be getting in a different way.
Many of the technologies that ASA have developed for space are now using civil life, exposed to the local food in a doctor, to use the LEED for cancer.
And of course, the tricks that we use to get a mobile phone or the GPS were not there without the space program.
All of this is how to show that the solutions of science, research and what's called "convincing" because it's much more than what's going on by scientists themselves.
And imagine yourself in a very effective game when this great guy is sitting in.
He's born, he's going to become our year and he's doing laughing out of your team.
And days later, you're going to park when you're going to start to the rain.
And who's going to show you a meter?
I'm in a room from the most sophisticated game.
Do you change your mind by based on the other meeting, or are you going to go with the first rain and out of it?
Scientists in social psychology show that we're dealing to create a rapid there on others on their behavior.
We're able to do it with a little effort, some programs or patterns from one behavior, like a word that's done there.
When we're using our photos like teachers, we can remove in our country and how people come in the future.
When he's fighting to know that the guy's best game was an intuition for the first time I met him, you might watch the way.
So, you might be able to choose from me to the next time you'll see it.
However, we can change our sky not just new information.
It's a behavior that's the patterns that look like this process of the perception.
On the one hand, we learned a very moral information about someone who has a much more powerful impact than learning and very high moral information.
So, unfortunately for our new friends from the best game, the behavior of the game might be much more than the best behavior in the park.
It's a stupid studies show that this little is happening because the unmoral behavior is more independent or the size of the real iPhone of the person.
Okay, so before this diversity, a bad idea is always more powerful when it's talking about right.
Well, not necessarily.
A certain kinds of learning don't look like words to the kind of control.
As a place on the capacity and the skills of another person, for example, these methods become.
It's actually the positive information is the one that's got a lot more.
Let's go back to this best game.
If there's a black hole, it's at the end of a more powerful effective impact on their capacity than if they're missing the network.
The two sides of the design story are in the end of things work.
In general, the genes that are spending as behavior as much as lower, they're also the ones that people tend to change more in the head, and in the future creativity, very active activity and very high skills.
So what's going on at the level of the brain?
By FMRI, I'm going to be a function of participants, researchers, this is a spinal network of areas in the brain that responds to information that I'm going to work with one of the first drugs.
It's all of those who are related in a way with social intelligence, attention, and control and genetic control.
More than that, in a way that the water is based on the behavior of people, active to the open brain and the galaxy and the French French Francer to try to work with one patterns at the same time of these behavior are going on in the universe.
In other words, it seems that the brain works after statistics of behavior at a low level, to make complex decisions about other people's face.
It has to decide whether the behavior of a person's behavior or a woman that's out of?
In a situation with the effective effect that became the good, your brain says, "Well, Mexico, I'm more proposed to someone's terrorism, but the way that this guy gets on the political game. It's going to be great."
So, you decide to go with your first rain.
And there's a good moral moral in this information: your brain, and in your mind, you may have more care about what the very very independent things, things don't inevitable that somebody else's going to do with the very moral things, but that's the result of the service of the different behavior of these bad behavior.
We're more normal for this that people are good institutions, like to give invitations to help in the country.
In this context, bad can be more good, but most of the best is better.
Think about the last time that you've made someone based on the behavior, especially on time you really feel that you've changed your mind about somebody.
Does the behavior is that you're going to know your river there something that you're going to find, or is it something unusual?
On our planet, there's two good areas: the Art, which is in the countries: Eric Tius, from the North, and the Antarctica, the Antarctica, the Guardian.
But there's a more way to remember them if only remember what's going to remind them.
The architect, which is put in our extinction of our platform, it's not an experiment that we're all surrounded by a woman.
In the other side of the world, the Antarctica is a continent that's developed by ocean.
So, Alexandria has a very well, but not penguins, and Atlantic has penguins but not bees.
Let's talk about architecture.
The architecture is an infinite ocean from a mood and a surgeon in a tremendous city.
The region can be defined as a device between the astronomy and the North.
If you'd be standing in the morning and we've been looking for a place that's looking, in all the directions, it's going to be great.
But it's hard to stand up in a long time because it's in the middle of the ocean, and it's covered in the streets that won't have the park.
If you're going to go into the water in the northern, you're going to go to four and a half miles.
Over water, average temperatures can go to 400s -- over the worst temperature that's going to be about 6888,000 dollars.
Although the human conditions, human beings have been collecting the architects for thousands of years.
Life in Art can organize organisms that live inside the ice, it's an anthropin and politics, genomic genes, birds, birds and years, plants, plants, human societies.
Okay, what about Antarctica?
Antarctica is the most expensive continent in the Earth, and it's capable of the geographical speed.
It's in the 50s at the size of the platform about the size of Australia.
It's almost 98 percent of Atlantic that comes out to least at least a half miles.
The conditions in Antarctica are the most serious ones around the world.
In average, it's the case, with the most sophisticated, the neighborhood in the neighborhood that has the most high response of all women.
You might think that we're going to have all the time in the best, but Antarctica is so hard, that it's been thinking to talk to 200 miles of life and a lot less within the continent.
The temperature in Antarctica came to the [80s] 80s.
Because it's so hard to come to me, there's no people working in Antarctica, but between 1,000 people in the year in the research field that are reduced around the continent.
Even the most serious animals are fighting to survive, and we're going to see entrepreneurs who are training there, including many kinds of art, electrodes, plants, plants, plants, plants, plants, prototype.
But why is Antarctica faster than the exhibition?
Well, first of all, most of us in the continent is more than three kilometers over today, and the temperature is happening with the response.
So on the walls, there's a tool.
Secondly, remember the architecture is actually not a story.
The water in the ocean underneath the water is more than half of the anatomy of Antarctica, and this life is passed through the moon.
It's information from temperatures in the architecture of the architects from coming to the patterns of Antarctica.
Third, this problems are from Antarctica Antarctica.
While the Follin Bill Bill, when the Earth is far away from the sun, it's in the case of the moon in Antarctica, what's created as a frog of the morning.
But even though they don't have to live, the near North Korea is a big reason for that our patient is like somebody.
Our very good regions are very important to keep the air.
They're helping the temperatures in the metaphor of our remote data from design.
When you're living in Atlantic, you're going to have a kind of climate change and global warming, you're going to get more likely to do.
Western war are part of our history and safe and our future and our future.
Since the nation of humanity, the war of Asia has come out of a lot of civilization and civilizations are related to food wars instead of war.
But the wars of the future doesn't look like the wars of the past.
And together with the traditional wisdom, our future can be able to go from the San Western war, to live in the way that we use a new type of years, including computers and programs and programs that change the capacity of the ocean.
And not just my friend's engineers didn '
So, how can we treat a basket if we can't agree on what it means?
One way is to imagine a situation where we've got to understand who we've got to be dead.
And imagine there's a new kind of, one that can make a critical crisis or even be in the same country.
For example, a person who works for the government using a wireless device to send it to another leader.
This device is happening to the heart rate of attention to the sound, what makes the death of the gender leader.
Is this explanation thought of what's like?
As a second example, imagine companies that are exploring to a computer system of intelligence and enemy countries.
This map is almost our income that we've put a nuclear airplane, which has made it close to thousands of patients and citizens.
When I grew up, the ocean states responded by the limitation of genes and the behavior that you're going to expect the electricity of the beautiful countries.
A hospital can't treat patients, so areas that sometimes don't exist, they're all caused for thousands of citizens.
My teachers' electricity 'electricity is a beautiful, but the infrastructure that's happening, the kind of thing started, and the imagination of the electrical network of the citizens.
Is the country can fight back?
Who would we wait?
And would their genetic response be thought of war?
Do they think of human crisis?
Who is responsible?
Would you write the code?
What's the project in which we've developed the form of the India?
What's the exhibition that started the event?
What's the material that created the computers, knows that they're possible here?
Because the war was us so long, we have life to focus on the understanding of the product to take the resources in the West.
The experiences of experience and so on to all of us to prevent information from become more inevitable.
The kind of civil planes have used them to be used, the limitations of autonomy, the use of insects or patients, all active actions, that if we're doing, we're thinking to active activity and spread under war and war between wars and violence.
Again, the current optimistic situation remained that there's a lot of other political questions enough because there's no communities, and there's only two ways to move about these questions: peace we're new.
So, what are the political conditions, but possible you can imagine that we've developed under the definition of war war, and how would you mean infrastructure between art to prevent these activity?
A hundred years ago, Albert Atlankton's 36 years ago, we're going to go to the French Alexandon to get a new theory of space, and for a time, the general theory.
The general relationships is without the magnitude of Antarctica, theory that represents the work of the biggest country, to program one of the most sophisticated society and patients and treat the beginning of space.
In 1915, there was a exciting year to be a physicist.
Two new ideas became the subject.
One was the relationship of Einstein's theory, the other thing you can argue was even faster than the revolutions: Italians, a new way of science is still successful in a way of the world's world's world's world's world's world's world, the world's world &ap
Over the last century, these two ideas have changed the understanding of the universe.
It's a religion for me as an intuition that we've discovered from what we've done today, how it started how it's going to evolve.
After a hundred years, we're looking at ourselves now at another feedback in physics, but what's on the project now is different.
The next few years maybe we're going to be able to keep our understanding of nature, or if maybe for the first time in the history of science, we can't stand for questions that we can't answer, not because we don't have all the technology, but because the physics is independent.
That's the basic problem: the universe is much more interesting.
It seems to be a relationship and the intuitive theory that the universe should be aware of.
It needs to be a zero, and it's unusual.
But when we look around us, we see that we live in a full of interesting things, full of stars, trees, trees.
The question is, ultimately, why are all these interesting things going on?
Why do there something to nothing?
This digital is the most difficult problem in Chinese physics, and in a few years, maybe if we're ever able to solve it.
In the problem, there are two numbers, two really dangerous numbers.
They're the programs of the universe that we can learn, and they're very dangerous because if they're different, even in a little bit, so today we know it today.
The first of these numbers have to tell us that we're going to do a few miles from this room, in CERA, the house of this machine. The biggest scientific device that we've ever been built on the human species, the big dances.
HHHHHC stimulates an atmosphere through 27 kilometers, and brings them closer to the light to the light before it's telling them one in two huge parts.
In 2012 in 2012, scientists in CRRRRA were going to have a new part of a new experiment that's created by these real problems in LLLC: The Gabby Gates.
Now, if you're doing the news at the same time, you'd see a lot of really excited scientists, and I'll take you if you think we're doing this every time we find a new part.
Well, it's a kind of true, but in the galaxy is a special brain.
We've been excited so excited because we've invented the galaxy enough the universe of the third energy.
Now, you may have problems to imagine that there's energy, but we're all together.
If you've ever been reduced from a genetic piece of the feeling of a brain to the wind, then you'll feel the effect of a year.
There's a little bit like a little bit of a magnetic year, out of this that we have value everywhere.
It's around us right now.
We can't see it or touch it, but if it wasn't there, we didn't exist.
Here's the galaxy that you're going to get out of the basic parts that we're doing.
If he wasn't here, these parts didn '
But there's something that's really enough about the year of the galaxy.
I've been treated as an intuitive theory says to us that we have two interactions, a little bit like a light.
It needs to be depressed, so I have a value in every space, a woman who has to be born so that I have a huge value.
In these two cases, atoms can't be awesome, and so all of the interesting things that we see around the buildings there were no water.
In reality, there's a little galaxy, not zero, but it's about 10,000 trillion trillion of our income value, a little bit like a light that's going to go before our star situation.
And this value is unique.
If he was a little bit different, there was no physical structure.
So that's the first one of our basic numbers, the power of the year of the galaxy.
Students are born for decades without trying to figure out why I have this very interesting number at this point, and they've got the number of possibilities possible.
They have names that sound like "French" or "big water."
I'm not going to get into these ideas of ideas, but the main key key is this: If someone explains the most interesting value of the year of the Gates, so we need to see new parts that create in LLLC and with the Gates.
By now, with that, we didn't see any of them.
But there's actually even a worse example of this kind of a number of content, and this time comes from the other side of the night, research today in huge life.
One of the most important results of the general theory of Einstein was the size that the universe started from the space of space and time 13.8 billion years ago, the big sector.
Now, before the local German's local theory, the universe started since the lab is very, very excited about the abstraction.
But in 1998, astronomers did amazing that the expansion of the universe is actually very happy.
Today, we're going to do a bigger and faster and more information about forces and curiosity that read energy.
Now, every time you hear the word "Africa" in physics, you need to be very important because it probably says we don't know what we're talking about.
So we don't know what it's a great energy, but the best idea is that it's the energy of the space itself, the organization of the human.
Now, if you're using a very good intuition to think some of the African energy should be, you get a simple result.
You find that this African energy has to be 10 in 120 percent more than the value we've been looking at asteroid.
It's one with 120 zeros after.
It's a big number of metaphors that it's impossible to understand it.
We use a lot of the word "asteroid" when we talk about big numbers.
Well, even it didn't work here.
This number is bigger than any number of astronomy.
It's growing in the electronic electronic trillion times from the number of atoms every day.
So it's a really bad competition.
In fact, it's called the worst strength in physics, and it's more than a theory.
If energy was even close to so powerful, then the universe was bad for regulation, as a galaxy could not be created, and there was no beautiful.
So it's the second of these complex numbers, the power of a global energy, and to explain it and even a higher level of the direction of the interest that we've seen in the galaxy year.
But we're going to say to this year, for this book, there's no explanation.
The hope was that a whole combination of the relative theory of Einstein, which is the theory of the universe in a big scale, with the autonomy of the universe, the theory of a small scale, maybe you'll provide the solution.
I'm an intuition itself to lead most of the insects of the independence of the physics of physics, and physicists have made it since.
One of the most promising places to the theory is the original theory, and the central idea is, if you can focus on one of those experiments that create our world, you'd see that they're actually not part of energy, but you're actually more tiny little little little little little little tiny, with all sorts of categories that have a little bit more like this.
So it's a neural way, almost an effect of looking at the world, but it's got one category.
It turns out that the drugs of the drugs is not one theory, but a whole collection of theory.
In fact, there's 10 in the 50s of different theories of drugs.
Each one of the four countries with different laws of physics.
Now, the structures say that it does the moral theory.
You can't make the theory.
But others actually became this and said, well, maybe this failure seems to be the biggest explanation of the drugs.
What if every 10 in the half of the different possibilities of the universe is actually a place where it's in a big dictionary?
First of all, we can understand the cars in a strange form of these two risks.
Obviously, energy is so powerful that the universe is so bad, or six times the galaxy can't create.
We're living in one of those places in students who have the number of numbers really match.
We're living with the "gas" as the three bees. "
Now, this idea is very similar to power, and it's easy to see why.
If we're working after this thinking, then we'll never be able to answer the question, "Why do we have something for nothing?"
In the politicians, there's nothing, and we're living in one of the buildings where the physical experience allows us to be something.
Even worse, we can't build the idea of millions.
We can't get these other days, so there's no way to know if they're there or not.
So we're in a really excited place.
It doesn't mean that the students don't.
There's other patients, other stars, other galaxies, so why not other species?
The problem is, it doesn't think I've ever known in security.
Now, the idea of students were a long time, but in the last few years, we started to get the first five important features that this thought might be going to really find.
Although the big babies from the first revolution of LLLC, what we've studied there -- we've been looking for new theories of physics: France is a big place that we can explain the right value of a year.
But despite the high religion, the LLLC has been found that the atmosphere that I've been able to stop by the Bosnian Amazon.
My experiment was published by saying that we had to have the nervous nervous themselves that we didn't see a new physics.
The risks now can't be higher.
The summer, the LC started our second activity with energy almost like what we've done in the first revolution.
What physical physicists wait to the babies are trying to share new parts, black holes, maybe something completely unprecedented because of these real emotions in the big dances.
So, we can continue this long journey that started 100 years ago with Albert Atlantic to the deeper understanding of nature's natural life.
But if, within three years, when LLLLC is listening to a long time, we don't find anything out of the galaxy, so maybe we get a new generation in physics: most of us have a strange plan of the universe that we can't explain; most of us that we're living in Mexico, when we're living in the M
Thank you.
Thank you for the first questions is, Berni: Eric, even if I said now that science doesn't have some of the answers, I'd like to ask you how many questions is: to build something like the LLC is a project.
I just mentioned, when I got you, we live in the world to make a product.
How do you think to take so long, imagine yourself out of the wall when you build something like this?
The Eric Fild: I was very lucky that I joined a experiment that I was working on LC in 2008, just when we were born it, and there are people in my research group who worked for three decades, all their careers on one machine.
So I think our first conversations about LLC were in 1976, and you start to design the machine without technology that you know you should have to be able to build it.
So the important power wasn't at the beginning of the 1990s when the design started seriously.
One of the big genes that take these emotions, they didn't think there's a technology that can stand in the LLC, so here's a city that's going to be affected with a couple of trees around the outside, but in the middle of the middle of this, it's going to develop technology.
So you'd have to focus on the news of people, that they're going to solve the problems, but you can go for a decade or more in the middle.
BG: China's just known about three weeks ago that they're going to build a big part of the LC.
You'll be wondering how you're going to get your news.
Audience: The big one is not all BG: I'm sure, I'm sure.
And it sounds funny before physicists to say that.
But I mean, really, these are great news.
So building a machine like LLLLC and networks from all over the world to one of their resources.
No country in building can't afford to build a big machine, outside of a concept, because they can invest like resources, power and money to build machines like this.
So this is just a good thing.
What they're really going to do is build a machine that's going to explore the magazine food and can give us some of these new ideas if these new ideas, they're really awesome, so these are great news for physics, I think.
BG: I'm going to go. Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Have you ever experienced a jihad?
That's this strategy that you get when you look familiar.
Society in the journey is happening just like you remember.
The world's world as a simple world that you've done as a theory, but the process can't be based on China since you've never been here before.
That's the first time you'll notice, so what's going on?
Fortunately, there's no extinction and Los.
The experience is a piece of a training, and it makes it a little impossible to learn and learn it.
Scientists can't just sit and wait that it happens to them -- it can take two years.
It doesn't have a physical impression in studies, it's reminded by the people as a feeling.
Because of invisibility, there's a face of the service over the years.
Since the question of Berkeley was like a French French that's already seen, more than 40 theories were trying to explain the phenomenon.
And yet, there are other countries in New York City and psychological psychology that are found the possibilities.
Let's go for three of the most beautiful theory, by using the metaphor of the journey to each of them.
The first one is working as a treatment.
We need action.
Let's go back to the wall that represents every day.
When you're dealing, your brains work as a big amount of information: the most capacity of the regret, my invention of help, the wind of Afghanistan.
Within a few different words, this information is going on on the wheelchairs and works for one moment.
Most of the time, it's all about memory.
However, the theory makes a song that's going to happen when there's a city in one of these ways.
The difference at the time when it comes to the brain to restore the insects as another event.
When it's a gene that's already been killed, it feels like it's already happening because in a certain sense, it's happening.
Our next theory is inevitable in the past and not mistakes in India.
It's the Congress theory, and it's used to use the table to build it.
When you're trying the robots, it's a remote memory out of the brain.
Before the theory, it's because memories are so worse, and in biographics, you need just one part to see all the picture.
Your brains identify the map with one of the past, maybe from your grandmother.
However, instead of remember you've seen the example of your grandmother, your brain's doing the old memory without identified it.
It's going to leave you with families but without memory.
Even though you've never been in this journey, you've seen this map, but you don't have to identify it.
Now, look at this galaxy.
Do you notice?
Our last theory is a weird, and it's a puncture that's going on when our brain's going to go around the time it's surrounded by another object.
When we go back, we feel we've already been here.
For instance, just now when you've been reduced in the galaxy and don't come to the map or to the patient.
Even though your brain is taking it all in your beautiful lights, it's done it without the creativity.
When you finally put it back from the galaxy, you think you've ever been here because you're just not paying attention.
While all of these three theories are taking a common plan of January, no one of them comes from a safe sample to the phenomenon.
Still, while we wait that researchers will find new ways to capture this incredible moment, we can learn the moment of ourselves.
After all, most of our studies were based on human experiences, so why don't they be?
The next time you get a jihad, you'll take a moment to think about it.
Would you be curious?
Is there an intuitive object?
Would your brain just respond to the robot?
Or is it something else?
Have you ever noticed how much the ice looks bigger when it's close to the iPhone than it's high over our head?
So you're not alone.
People would be about this strange effect since the time we were, and unfortunately, we still don't have the robot, but it's not because we didn't try.
Some of the biggest brains in the history -- Aristotle, Palestinia, and the Chicago, and all of them have been lost with the current problem.
One of the first ideas that we've been doing was that the mirror of the moon is really bigger than the iPhone.
Maybe the Earth's atmosphere is changing as a tremendous, which makes the moon when it's a new region.
But this message doesn't work.
If at all, the implications of the atmosphere are going to look a little bit smaller.
What's more, if you're actually imagine the ice and the ice looks at different species, it doesn't change at all.
But then, why does it still look bigger when it works?
It has to be a kind of optimism.
The question is this?
One explanation is the Amazon's father's father's father's father's father's father's mother's father's mother's father's mother's mother's fair, which is called a different person's
Here's the two circles in the center of the same size.
Maybe the moon looks bigger than we don't exist because it's maybe tiny trees, water, and it's growing.
But when it's higher, it's surrounded by a tree of the night and it seems to be tiny in the equation.
Another possibilities is a physicist agenda.
If you've ever been trying to create a good perspective, you know that the more nervous nerves are, you need to create it smaller.
Our brain represents mathematicians about it by more objective objects like bigger than they're really seeing.
Secondly, the big data in this painting are the same big, but the interest looks much bigger because we're bringing it into a smaller kind.
So, between physics and the Amazon, it looks like we're going to solve the cost of the moon, but unfortunately, there's some details that agree the eyes.
First of all, if it was just the AIDS effect, so we would expect the governments of the moon to disappear for high tricks over the eyes because we didn't have smaller objects to the iPhone.
But in fact, tricks and intuitions don '
On the other hand, if it was our brains and intuitive the bones to the iPhone, then we would expect the questions of the moon would look inside the tricks, where all the sky, all the sky, represents with a little bit over.
The studies showed, with that, it's not the case.
In order to summarize the eyes more, it seems to seem to be the remote questions to say if you're going to become a good robot between your legs.
Now, it's just going to do power!
One of those of these explanations are looking at today and known as the regulations.
Our brains have remote judgments and the size of their eyes by the species of the eyes.
When you look at the iPhone, our eyes are focused on the street so our brains know we're looking far away.
The ice looks at some size.
Our brains think it's far away, what's wrong, so you're in terms of special nature that has to be big.
But when we're looking at the night, there's no eyes on what to focus, so they're back to their normal state, which is not a few meters.
Now your brain thinks that the moon is really far more, so you're kind of natural as the moon doesn't think it's.
Instead of trying to explain why the moon looks so big to the iPhone, the regrets from Morothiopia around what the ice looks smaller than.
You still don't want?
Well, in fact, a lot of scientists didn't, so we're going to prove about the motor's idea and maybe we're going to continue each more and we're still seeing it in the night.
Brank Gates: Thank you very much for TED, design.
Octoctober: Good.
BG: Let's start with a number.
Over 2015, like a million patients and the cases came to Europe from many countries, of course, from Syria and Iraq, but also from Afghanistan, in Google, Egyptian, we'll see more.
That's the response of two kinds of kinds of responses: roads and the boundaries are limited.
I want you to sleep in this kind of opportunities and a little bit of smaller.
And the first question is very simple: Why is the political movement so much over the last six months?
AG: I think what's known about this experiment was the rainforest of the Chinese patients.
There was already a global movement from Europe in Africa, Asia, but a movement that grew up in autonomy, and suddenly it happened in the first months of 2015.
Why? I think there's three reasons, two and a long long, one day it's the gold.
The two long years of Twitter, in the relationship to stories, are first, that stories have less hope.
They're looking at their countries and they don't have a lot of hope to go home, because there's no political solution, so there's no public group.
Secondly, the animal's experience of the stories in the neighborhood countries.
We recently did a study study with the World Bank, and we found that 87 percent of the stories in Syrian -- 93 percent of the stories that were living underneath the local eyes.
Just as a half of the kids go to school, and the interesting data about it and we're very hard.
We didn't know that they're patients, missing all the suffering, they're also living in very serious conditions.
And the third reason -- the gas -- it's that suddenly the international aid.
The world's world's global food programs, not just a office in resources, except in 30 percent of the food support that it's enough to the Chinese patients.
The patients don't use to work, so they're depending on the support of art, and their sense was, "The world will take us."
And this reason I think was the gold.
All of a sudden, there was a great time, and people began to know in big numbers and if you were to be ready, maybe I was in a situation and I was going to admit enough to work like this, I think I was going to work like them.
BG: But I think what's been surprising is that it's not just going to happen in real solutions, but it's not supposed to be a perfect solution.
The war in Syria has been dead for five years.
Millions of patients in the animals, villages and cities around Syria.
You're in this situation because this situation is because the consequences of disorders, for example, and that's where Europe looks not ready to decide.
AM: Well, not ready because there was a party, and when you get not ready to know in reality.
You're going to take decisions, because you don't have the capacity for a million.
And the argument for this is that, even when the career started Europe and that what happened to me wasn't able to create a kind of situation for the situation.
You're talking about a million people.
It sounds a number of trees, but we're the European population like 550 million people, which means we're talking about one patient on every 2,000 citizens.
It's one thing about three building.
Walk? Somehow, of course, but images.
So the question is this: Is it a problem that you can deal with, if you've got something about the most important step that it's effective in the media problem, but you're going to disappear now in the phenomenon that's going to look at the phenomenon as it's -- if Europe would be able to replace and return to a kind of
But because it's going to happen, the reality of the income point in Europe has to support a lot, and then go into a trillion dollars through security and all the rest of the organizations, physics and all over Europe countries, according to every country.
If you're looking at the old plan and again that I'm trained by groups, you're always a little bit too late, or by a little too late -- BG: And there's already a metaphor.
AG: My country is supposed to take 4,000.
4,000 in Portugal is a number of percent.
You can go with a number like this if you do work with it, but in the current conditions, the pressure is the income income income to Europe, and then, when people go through this kind of intuition, they get to energy, change, in fact, no asteroid.
At the end of the end of the three countries that control the patients.
The rest of Europe and Europe are looking at the side to do a lot.
BG: I'm going to try to get three questions, and I'm going to play a little bit of the cancer.
I'm going to try to ask them, and I'll ask them in robots.
But I think these questions are very business in Europe in Europe, the first time, of course, is about numbers.
You say, "550 million" is not a lot, but on how many people are able to record?
AG: Well, this is a question that doesn't have a answer, because patients are the right to be leaders.
Like yes, there's something called the national sentence, so in a situation where you can't say, "We're going to take 10,000 of that."
I'm going to wait to you the next thing: In Turkey, at the beginning of the crisis, I remember that one said, "Turkey would be able to take a thousand patients."
In Turkey, you now have three million or a thousand or a very similar number, if you're told all the patients.
So I don't think it's true to say how much we're ready to take.
What's true to say is: How can we protect to stand in our international responsibility?
And Europe wasn't able to operate like this, because Europe comes out because there's no tricks in the air project.
And the right thing isn't just in the refugees; there's a lot of other species.
And let's be today, it's the moment that we need more Europe and less Europe.
But as the public believe less in the European institutions, it becomes much more difficult to convince the public that we need to solve these problems.
BG: I think I'm now at the point where the number of patients make political identities, in the city of politicians.
We've seen it again in the end of the week in French, we've seen these opportunity once after a time in many countries: in polio, in Mary, we've been exposed in other countries, where the public news is changing because of the numbers, and even though they don't hear in the number of tricks.
NGO: But, if I'm a woman, about this point: What is the East East East Asia in the village in the village and there's no cases?
What East Eastern Easteroid, in TV, a few months ago, every day, when it's exposed in the news, a lot that comes from no choice, and the images in TV showed hundreds of thousands of people know.
And the thought that no one's treated in this kind of concept, that all of this movement is happening without a child.
It brought many people to think, "They come to my village."
And so the thought that we're going to make this sense of income, that Europe is under a plastic that we're going to have to change, and the problem is that if it's a manager and we're going, if people're going to get a planet, you get the leader in the classroom, you get the process of engineering experiences in the
But, unfortunately, a lot of citizens are scared, just because Europe wasn't able to do the work as well.
BG: But there's a village in Germany with 300 species and 1,000 patients.
So what's your colleagues?
How do you think the species will respond?
AM: If there was a medical situation of this situation and a physical physicist in all over Europe, then I always had the relationship that I wanted: one of the 2,000 species.
But because the situation doesn't manage and we get in the end of results that we can't live with them, and of course if we're talking about a village -- in London, there's many villages where there's more tricks than buildings.
I don't ask that it's also in Europe, that every village or pharmaceutical villages will be more than a place.
I'm going to ask that Europe will do the work right now, and you can be able to protect people as other countries in the world and have to do in the past.
BG: So, if you look at the world's world situation, not just in Europe -- Applause) BG: Yeah!
Thank you. BG: If you look at the situation in the world, not just in Europe, I know you can make a long list of other countries, but I'm more interested in the other side -- do there's somebody who works?
AM: Well, like 86 percent of the patients in the world are in developing countries.
And if you look at countries like Canada -- the Canada and the more than 6,000 patients.
All the boundaries are open.
They've got them in a country where they call "people," that every patient has to go.
They're trying experiments, Chinese and words.
They're recorded from all their neighborhood.
They're long to see.
And also, in general, African countries are very techniques for patients who come to them, and I would say that in the Middle East and Asia, we see a little little bit of open-source galaxies.
Now we're born in a little bit of problems with the situation in Syria, because the situation of the situation has evolved to have a very hard thing, but the truth is that not a long time from you, all the borders in the open citizens.
The truth is that for Afghanistan, the limits of Pantheon and open Iran, and at the same time that six million Afghanistan came.
So I'd say that even today, the key sector in the developing world is to countries of openness.
The key sector in the developing world is that these questions have become more complex. In the city when the audience's audience, there's a variety of diversity on each other's going to be on the security -- that we've learned problems in a different temperature -- the other side of the other.
BG: And we're going to go back in the middle of this, and you've also mentioned the creation of the world's statement.
It's going to reduce the general design of organizations that affect these areas.
Now when the world seems to be bad, do you get a bigger design more and more support, or the conditions will be left when you're?
AM: We need more support.
I'd say we're going to get to a third year.
The situation was much worse in the summer.
But it's obvious to decide that it's not enough to provide the patents and the consumptions that control them.
And here we've got a secret in the basis of the electronics, the terrorists, the muscles and the walls in a new period of cooperation and an unprecedented person.
For instance, Balin and Darwin are the income countries.
Because they're the income countries, they can '
Now, imagine there's no diversity, because they're enough connections to the world.
They're recording them millions of patients, and if they're going to be yes, they're going to have a education of groups in the region, with all the women who're doing a place, and what's going to be the first behavior of our political security.
So there's no idea that these countries don't expect first in the countries of the year's action in the National Act.
And they're not.
And not only do the patients live in human beings are very women in these countries, but the local communities are also sufficient, because we've left, because there's a year on the limit, because the lights and the studies and the research.
And also, of course, if you look at the situation today, about the oceans in these countries, it's obviously, the most important groups in the population are people more than the crisis of the service in the neighborhood.
BG: Who should we provide this support?
You're going to support the basis of music, organizations in international organizations, the air and the air?
Who's supposed to make this support?
AM: We need to one of the efforts.
It's obvious that the cooperation is going on.
It's obvious that the two and a half times outside.
It's obvious that economic institutions have to be limited to be so that we can invest in a lot of students.
We need to combine all the tools and understand that today, in situations that make a lot of time, at some point, there's no idea in the problem between the Internet and economic aid and the development of life.
That's because you're talking about children in school, you're talking about health, you're talking about infrastructure.
You're talking about things that require a long-term effect, collective perspective and not just collective information in studies.
BG: I'm interested to get your response to something that's going on in the city of the eye.
That's the exhibition of the leadership in the French French Foundation for the United States of Canada.
I'm going to say the next things.
So not, listen to this. The things are interesting.
I'm sorry: "I call a 3D form of Muslims to the United States, doing our parts of us exactly what's going on."
How do you respond to this case?
AM: Well, it's not just a Netherlands.
We've seen some cases around the world of people with political responsibilities that say for example, we don't have local patients.
And the reason for this is that they think that in these things, they're protecting their own imaginations.
I worked in her government.
I believe that a lot of governments have to keep their own security and they're citizens.
But if you say, things like this, in the United States, let's be in any theory, "We're going to protect our cities in Muslims," the things you say are the best lesson for the economy of the Internet.
Because what you're saying -- I've been saying, [The things you're saying is that you're going to hear about all the Muslims in your own place, and they're going to try to grow the way to organizations that are using technology, and that's "Alexandria, Alexandri
It's actually telling them, "You're right, we're going to say."
So of course, it's created in companies that they're four minutes, culture, culture, it's created a situation where, a lot more efficient for these organizations to be effectively effective in the kinds of people in countries where these countries say.
BG: Would the last slide in Paris response to them do your work more difficult?
AM: No doubt.
BG: What's a sense?
AG: In fact, many people have the first response to the terrorism of these terrorists is: to define all the limits -- not to understand that in the region in Europe is a lot of creativity.
There's thousands of thousands of doctors in Syria and Iraq and Iraq, so it's not a problem that's just by doing so that scientists want to get to Europe.
And I've got to say, I'm convinced that the idea is, I believe, there's been by the person who's exposed -- BG: myself, yes.
AG: [I believe] It was in a machine, because some of my strategy is a refugee, they're seeing in patients] people who need to be part of the []]]]]]] &#9
And I think it's part of my strategy that's a part of my strategy that's going to make a Europe to respond, to define the limitations of Muslims, to develop students in Europe, and by trying to move to the activity.
And the deep art is that it wasn '
I think, as I've said, in the region of Europe today is a global problem that we're focused on, and what we need is to prove that these organizations are wrong, by using effective politics that come from this part of the world.
And another thing I believe in is that in a country, we're paying today in Europe about failures in words that don't work in the '60s, and' '80s, about the definition of the definition that we've done in the same years, we've created in many years, for example, in
And this intuition, sometimes, two of the second morning is in a very result of failures in countries to listen, of failure in countries that had to invest a lot more people in which people could live together.
I think it's clear.
But I think it's obvious that all companies have been reduced, culture, four minutes in the future.
I've tried to avoid that, I think, there's no possibility.
And this is a good thing that's going to be, but I'm also familiar with that, because companies have a very big investment in social rights within the seconds.
And Europe, in her country, and when she's invented in the last decades.
BG: You're able to put your role in the end of the year, after 10 years in the role.
If you look back in 2005, when you go into your office for the first time, what do you see?
AG: Well, look, in 2005, we're going to help millions of people come back to their own security, because we're going to have the local patients.
Last year, we went to 124,000.
In 2005, there's been 38 million young people as a result of patients around the world.
Today, there's more than 60 million city.
At the same time, there were recently, some patients who were solving.
Now, we're seeing a platform of new patients and the future refugees have never come from: Afghanistan, California, our democracies.
It's obvious that the world's world is much more dangerous.
It's obviously, that the ability of the international community for patients and to solve them in time, it's, unfortunately, it's much worse than 10 years ago.
There's no critical power in the world, there's no diversity of global government working, which means we're living in a situation that's about the future that's not about the future that's more likely to get, and as a result of the people who are suffering, these are the people who are getting worse.
BG: It's a series of the American politics that when he's going to leave the room for the last time, he's leaving on the table with a kid who's going to go to the room a few hours later.
If you'd have to write this bubble like this to another person, Paul Phicago, what would you write?
AM: Well, I don't think I was a design.
You know, one of the worst things when a person is going to try to be the leader in the room, who always says to me the new behavior to do.
So that, I didn't do.
If I had to tell me something, I would say, "Here's yourself, you're going to do as well as you can."
BG: The design, thank you for the work you do.
Thank you for TED.
Thank you.
What is love?
I want, but, what?
What is love?
Where's there?
Where?
I'm a universal truth?
Okay?
Watch for all the religions?
How?
What is a biological phenomenon?
The answers aren't missing.
A window has to do.
It's designed for everything.
This is all you need.
This is all there.
All of these, artists, they're the change, and they're ways to define it with leadership, by saying that it's more important than all the things, but the artists?
Of course, love is more important than your normal Australia, but is it more important than a disease?
Or do you exist?
Or do you have a special statement in our country?
No matter what your answer is, you just make it, you don't define it.
Another challenge of love to define love is that often we're trying to do it while we're taking patients into a planet or so.
You'd put on somebody who's going to get a big blog to say who's doing money?
Or, I don't know, ask people to define what they're building in the problem is that they're pushing them over us?
Or are the real privacy not like a privilege?
Wouldn't it be like a period of bees?
The bad news?
This is my point.
I don't think right because I'm very love, so!
And one step back, I'm going to wait, no matter what, love is potential, the most powerful thing you think about.
And despite hundreds of years of AISA, it's still represents us.
There's some people who say it's a sense, emotions, a sense of somebody who never will ever feel like her in the past.
But emotions are easy, they're not very easy.
Sometimes you hate the person you love.
In addition, in your life, you feel like this in the past, at the end of the iPhone.
Your relationship with your family designers design your relationship with gas.
And your love to your galaxy can be a self-esteem system, healthy, or strange for refugee, with the only love.
My love is also a system of behavior that we're connecting with emotions and different opportunities, buildings, we've found a positive connection, small, and there's no, to bring children to the world, light.
But love activity can be a culture or culture.
You can love or be somebody who can't bring children or don '
But if love is something we can define, so how can it be interesting for many people?
So, maybe love can just in your head, you're on what people you've developed through your nervous spaces and a natural molecule, and you're going to die in your nervous system.
Maybe these models are familiar.
Maybe love is the training of the person, just like a person can be familiar.
I don't mean, to be stressed like what's going on.
The reality is that materials are ready in your brain that are defined by human beings and can make you develop a human legacy.
The person is able to provide political change, and you want more.
But then sometimes, Atlantic, you're alone.
And the love of love, you're proud, from the chest.
What happened?
Would the person open up and come to the side?
Why do we like to stay left and know each other through their lives?
Maybe to create new life, to many of them?
Maybe love is just our optimism or "hate ourselves.
There's a evolutionary argument about all the behavior of human behavior, from the way we're bringing ourselves in politicians, until we're treating each other, in the systems, not how we're growing children.
So, there's the arguments that you're learning that you feel about you is just a biological way to make you continue our species.
The nature in the kitchen is born on the walls, just like it makes us a child on the bits, and a professional biology.
But is it all that love is?
Or, maybe worse, is it just a structure, or a body that we all hear is trying to live for a sense of the goal?
Maybe it's a structure, but let's be more accurate about what love is like: our experiences, emotions, the brains, our culture, our culture.
And you can see this structure through Oxford Oxford: scientists, emotions, history, sentences, sentences, or just people.
If you don't have two people that it's identity, you also love three people or not the same.
So, in every relationship of love, there's a lot of what to talk about biology needs to be open to it, a woman who probably doesn't survive.
Let's always give us a million, of course, in the process of building.
So if we can't define it as well.
It means we can still do that.
Think, I didn't mean what I mean.
And imagine that two people since the music.
What's the risks that they're listening to the same list in India?
It's probably very low.
After all, each one has a other with music.
Now, what's the risks that your body has to have the same medical treatment like another person's body?
We're even lower.
When we go our lives, each of us will have different needs to our health.
Scientists and doctors live all the time and new ways to make medicine more privacy.
One way they do this is by research cells.
stem cells are not perfect in life, which means they're not aware of some work.
While a city of a gender cells on the body, a cell that's just a car, and a nervous cell that's sending it, to cells, cells don't have an active structure.
The stem cells have the potential to become any kind of cell in your body.
Your body uses stem cells to replace cells that live when they die.
For instance, you're replacing the tool of four days.
Your stem stem cells under your eyes replace these cells when they get.
Scientists imagine that stem stem cells will be used to create real medical medicine where we can replace your body's body's body, well, part of your body.
We've studied stem cells working hard to find ways to use stem cells to create new places to replace this kind of thing that's affected or disease.
It's using stem cells to replace the body's body's medicine called democracy.
For example, scientists are using stem cells to treat patients with diseases like learning.
A learning is a kind of cancer that affects your nerve.
It's just a collection of the nerve inside your bone where you create cells.
Basically, some of the cells within your nerve is growing up in a great way, and we're going to put the healthy cells that create your blood cells.
How many patients can get a stem cells.
These new stem cells will create the cells that are related to the patient's body.
There's actually a number of stem stem cells that scientists can use them to reduce medical electrodes.
CO2 stem cells or specific stem cells are in small countries in your body.
Social stem stem cells replace your cells in your clothes when they get dead.
Social stem stem cells are made from hundreds of things that are going to expect by political doctors.
We're going to have a specific stem cells, stem stem stem cells and things can.
It means that they can grow to any kind of speed in the body.
There's a third kind of stem stem cells called prototypes.
It's a city cell, an artist, as other organisms that are going to get like stem stem cells.
Like stem stem cells, they're also, can become any kind of cells in the body.
While scientists and doctors imagine to use these kind of stem cells to create new places that we're going to read your body, they can also use stem cells to help understand how the body works.
Scientists can watch stem stem cells are developing to understand the mechanism that the body is using to create new forms in a traditional way.
Scientists imagine that with more research, they can't just develop a real drugs that exist to your body but also understand better how our body works, as it's healthy.
Today, more than half of the people in the world live in main areas.
By the middle of the 20th century, it's growing 70 percent.
But over 100 years ago, just two of them out of 10 people live in the city, and before that, it was even less.
How did we get to such a big amount of city, and what does it mean about the future?
In the early days of human beings, people were small, which are going to most of the place in the search of food.
But about 10,000 years ago, our ancestors started to learn the best civilization and local agriculture.
For the first time, people can grow food everywhere to look at me, and that's the difference of villages and workers for the first time in history.
"Why don't you know?"
Well, at the beginning, the villages still had to go every few years when the nation was born.
It was just with the progress of techniques like the good year and about 5,000 years ago that people would be able to agree on a long-term food, what's going on and over and over and over again.
And with a physician that all these methods were created, it wasn't necessarily necessary that everyone would have been together.
It's possible for the development of other scientists, through, cities.
With cities that create food products, like every day, art, and other studies, there was now a opportunity for a long restaurant in a long life.
And when the journey that's wrong, it's also technology that you can see, like galaxies, drugs, roads, and ants.
Of course, these things will be even more work to build them, so more people have been convinced since the village of cities as the opportunities and the opportunities became available.
If you think cities are modern, you might be surprised to know that in 2000 cities have been exposed as a population that's almost a year in Canada or a Canada today in Canada or Canada.
One reason for this was that you'd have to look at it was not available, so everything had to be in the process, including some cases of water that we had then been.
And then the city of the city was more limited by the need to define beautiful genes.
The speech from that very quickly was able to develop infrastructure to protect these limits, but outside of it, modern cities like we know them, not started to move from the industrial revolution, when new technologies have been intervened to large and enabled and enabled and allow cities to grow more, more than a metric, as well as an electric network.
So, what are the future of cities?
The global population is now more than seven billion times before it's going to grow 10 billion.
Most of the tumor is happening in the world's main areas of the world's countries.
So, but cities have to have to change to make the size?
First of all, the world has to find ways to provide food enough, Chinese, education for all people.
Secondly, the tumor has to happen in a way that doesn't exist in the way that spread the studies and the service that you know in the human population.
And we need food, maybe we're going to need to live or live quality, genes, gas, or gas, we're using the center of cities, while we're more electrical than a variety of regular energy.
Instead of families and family, more and more recycling and quality.
Maybe in the universe that you can see everything that people need to live today, as well as small cities, that spread their needs in very, very early products.
The future of cities from diversity, you can change, creativity, and you don't work around the only industrial industry, but it's a global world.
What if you could see one color?
Imagine for example, you could see things or water and everything else was invisible to you.
It turns out, so you're living your life all the time because your eyes can see just a tiny part of the event of the light.
These kinds of kinds of things we're seeing around all the time, but they're invisible to the human eye, we've found that there's only two issues that love you, to read and the two doctors are using them to see into your body, to learn who's bringing you the food.
To understand how all of these can be light, we need to know something different about what it's light.
Aria is a electronic theater that's also active as well as as parts.
Google are like waves in the ocean.
There's small waves and small waves, waves that are based on the beach after the other, and galaxies that have ever been caused.
The size of the galaxy is called the road, and how much fun it looks like.
And imagine you're on a series in the ocean, which is down and down and down when the waves go.
If you find that day, there's a long way, they'll tell you to train and once, or as a lower.
If you find, instead, there's a global way, they're going to be one day to the other, and you're going to go down and down a much more fun, as a high speed.
Now, different kinds of light are all English, they just have different systems.
If you know how the galaxy of a light light, you can think of my energy.
A long dream there's a low energy, while to make a very high energy.
It's easy to remember if you think about being in this case.
If you'd be scared with galaxies, you'd probably be very high energy to keep things that didn't work.
But today with waves in a big way, you're going to roll it, bad, low energy.
The energy of light tells us how it works with material, for example, the cells in our eyes.
When we see, it's because the light energy represents our students called networks.
Our networks are just not just in a very productive way of energy, and so we call this field of light.
In the network, there's some special tricks that look too small.
The motivations imagine love, so you know how much light you have.
The experiments are responsible about what a color of light we see because different experiments feel inevitable.
Some experiments are more sensitive with long waves and lower energy, and other experiments feel more difficult to make products, with high energy.
When a light comes in our eyes, the relationship of energy that all kinds of institutions are aware of the brain the simple colors.
The wife we're recording is actually a light to my energy story.
In one side of the three, we see the light with a low energy, and in the other side of the light with the light that we see blue.
If light is very light by having energy that our networks can't learn, we can't be able to see it.
A light with galaxies create a very high energy in the middle of the eye before it can even go to the network, and not just with long waves enough to move the network at all.
The only thing that does one kind of light to a second because it's through the wheel.
Luckily, there's a long way, while Derek's a frog, there's a big way.
And light looks, the kind of light we're actually seeing, it's somewhere in the center.
Even though our eyes can '
With these devices, we can measure the light that's found, even though we can't see it ourselves.
So, one step back and think about it for a moment.
Even though they look different, life and the sense of the space is the same as the sun that's going to take on you in the day, and that's the same light of the Islam that you're remote to protect yourself from us, and that's the same to your television, to New York, to your microbes.
Now, these examples are all things about Earth, things that you can live in your life today, but there's something more amazing.
Our universe spread the perfect data of light, it's also.
When you think about the night, you probably think about being able to see the stars in your eyes, but it's just the light looks, you know it's just a tiny part of all the information.
If we were to draw the universe and we could see light, it was like we have one village -- and design.
To see the universe in all of our science, we need the mathematical eyes, and that means that there's a special basis that can help us see beyond the region.
You've probably heard about the global space that you've seen the beautiful images of a child in the air and see a galaxy.
But maybe you don't know that there's almost 20 tricks on the road, from places that can be able to see some of the national event.
With telescopes that use our democracy, also in space on Earth, we can see some amazing things.
And the most cool thing, no matter how the energy, the light that we see in the hot universe is the same as the light we can live and learn in the Earth.
So, because we know the philosophy of how Neanderthals, Elaser, English workers here, we can learn the light of stars and galaxies and we know what kind of things happen there.
So, when we're really going to live today, think beyond what your eyes can see or not.
I think a little part of the natural world can help you understand the perfect data around you all the time.
In 1977, the philosophical physicist think that if you're going to expect Twitter and then help, it's treated within the different molecules.
In this time, it's going to work less than a half of the atmosphere.
The same is true for many other microbes.
It's about it that they're really small.
And some microscope creatures are sitting around the world that will help us, where to go a half meters of water is a air effort.
But why is it so important to play?
What's going to make the world of a road so different from this of a laser?
In order to understand, we need to go to the physics of dinosaurs.
Here's the way to think about it.
Imagine you're living in the kitchen.
It's a big amount of water molecules.
Millions are working on you in a thousand trillion trillion trillion trillion.
So, take a way with your body and it's easy, but if you'd be really small, you'd say you'd be about the size of the water molecules, suddenly, it's like to play in the morning of people.
Instead of just to play through the small molecules, the tiny molecules, now all the molecules are like another person you need to push to get access.
In 1883, the physicist Sylan Richard Robert and realized that there's a number of refugees that can watch how entrepreneurs die.
It's called California, and it's depending on simple techniques like the player's player, what's going to happen, and the patterns, or the stairs, of the dinosaurs.
What it means is that creatures are very different and very different disappoints.
For instance, because of my tremendous size, you can take a flow of the world from a big virus.
If he's pushing his story once one time, the light can be more than a tree.
While the world's power in the world of just a low virus.
If a piece of a crop in the back, it doesn't work for us.
Because to imagine how it makes it a slow, you need to bring yourself down to a number of virus.
Imagine yourself in my perspective with your inventions as a train of the eye, and you're going to have a good sense of what the invention is focused on.
So, how do microbes get to a woman?
Well, many people don't have to play at all.
They just can't explain them.
It's something like a self-disciplinary that's waiting for that is under a big pencil back.
But a lot of microbes that are living, and here's their wonderful opportunity.
One trillion of them use is to change their web.
By changing their weapons of their web to create more leadership than the return, organisms and cells like a party are able to move through the process of water molecules.
But there's even more intuitive way that questions came in the Internet and the road.
Instead of using their weapons and what's going on, they're bringing them like the outside.
Just like you've got to end with a building from a massive motion to a local movement, these little creatures are looking at this environment to push themselves in a place where you feel safe as a woman.
Other strategies are even more strange.
Some tricks take the method of the atmosphere.
They're using a perception to transform ourselves from the ground.
They can't even use the perception like the skin to protect themselves from the ground.
Others use a chemical engineer.
The Paul Paul Robert was just the smooth of our cancer.
It's released as a model that's how you're going to have the screen, what you can find is that you're going to have through the wall.
Maybe it's not surprising that these society are responsible to the environment.
So, when you look really close in our body and the world around us, you can see all sorts of tiny creatures that find smart ways to know in the situation.
For all of these drugs, electrodes would never find their regulation, and they would never come to their team, which means that you'd never get a feedback, but you'd never had the kids.
For many, one of the most cool things in the "Social" is that the two weeks of peace and there's a real language.
And there's too much, and it's too much coming after the real language that we've lost in "Amazon," and it's actually a dad and my father and my dad when the kids are "Science," was a language for them.
Since 1979. And let's not forget the alphabet in Twitter's "TV" "" "" "" "Tylan", especially because it's the traffic of the TV ".
"Nicologist" is a creature of a car language.
They're more species like the United States and they're not just a collection of a cosmogram that's like "Atlantic" where the United States and the United States and the "physicians" talk, where "Dr. Syrus's" is meaningful.
What's become "Nico" for a real language is not the number of words that have.
It's help, of course, there's a lot of words.
We've got thousands of words.
And my father started with 1,500 words.
We're today in the website and we've created more.
But you can see the difference between words or words in the heart, between what makes real language, from the road to the street of thousands of dozens of the future, "Nico" with a couple of words.
After all, you can sleep 5,000 words in the United States and still don't succeed.
And I've got four things around you in the waves.
Because you have to know how to make the words together.
I mean, the language of real and change.
Life has.
In England, to become a time of time and stories.
Watch, however.
In thousands of years, this scription is to the summer of it to her.
The real languages also change over the years.
There's no corruption today why we had thousands of years ago.
When people talk, they're collecting new features, and women, make mistakes, and today creativity.
Today, people say, "Give us today the fight."
In the future English, we would say, "Oh," Uganda's "is" The Egyptian "County". "
Things also change in "Nicologist."
Talin is a new version of thousands of innovations.
When the first elephants were involved in "New York City," in their new language, the word for people was "New York," but in one language of the groups we started, Talk, in a few years, Kenya was beautiful, when we became a revolution.
And just like real languages, "Nico" like thousands of "became many.
When the list of the brilliant artists around Europe, we've got French and French, books and Italian.
When the groups go to different places, in a few years the way their bees change, just like anything else.
So, the Democratic word to us was very, but in French, it would be believe in time in the schools it would be very, very.
Talin Kenya and his wife did the same thing.
While the modern word was a function of the phone, in the AIDS, which was spread in the country, it was a baby when the box was born.
The alphabet that Tylon's exposed to most is the experiment of San Francisco, and their words are different in the same way that French French and different books.
In a second point, it's in Syrian and it's kind of a kind of experiment.
And as you know, real languages are cool.
It's because they're changing, there's little changes to the story, just like San or in the end of books.
The real corruption never made sense.
That's why Taliban Kenyan has a lot of outcomes.
It's a lot of objects in the forms that you just need to know.
Take the word "to know."
In the past, it's "I know," it's not that it's about "and nobody in English.
Wow, well.
In thousands, "I think" it's an asteroid, but "it's a trick.
Wow, well.
In fact, despite that, even though it's more like a real language than a language.
Falthough, there was a street for TV and China to create something that people could really talk.
Many of the thousands of times in the movie "natural connection" is since Twitter "and" and "and" a lot of hundreds of thousands of sensors based on what's going to be in.
It's the best we can do for thousands of times because there's no thousands of around us that we're talking to it.
But the New York Times took another step.
And we'll see, and evolutionary resources are developed enough to really talk to them.
Here's the GDP's refugees, although they're going to get it to the TV with the global, the strange thing, the New York Times that you're going to share in the back of your gender.
Remember or not, in fact, we're doing this in many languages around the world, like the Asian Francisco.
By the time, the theory in the alphabet is much more easy.
So, let's go out of this page and say, "Wow," in the three "Nico's" and the last three "we've changed with Africa in four hours" New York City ":" I'm saying! "
"The Gabby!"
My dad "Women's Abraham!"
"Wow!"
And "Get see!"
In 2008, in San Francisco, 17 years old, came up on a plane from Western Africa.
And while Syrian was the worst, he wasn't alone.
Don't have been able to grow over 24 young men, who are in the late '30s, are in the early decades, and are very active in social media as a Facebook leader.
With the Internet and other technologies, they change our lives today, but they also change the genome, the radiology and the universe of refugees today.
What about the connections between Twitter, Google galaxies that are waiting for democracy?
These numbers represent the chair of Google's faces, effectively the only biological emissions that were learning and can use them to communicate with each other, to get out of the world out of the world and spread out of what's happening in their country.
Today, patients are actually unlimited.
If there's limits to patients today, they're related by digital, not the physical geography.
And under all of this, there's a human power of power there there for national games, privacy people and private organizations have the advantage of information and intuition and intuition.
And that's because, in our generation of digital diplomacy, we have new technologies, platforms like I've mentioned, and that's more general, can be moral, to learn, to reinvest by organizations and organizations faster than governments can respond.
To understand the rate of our governments think about it, I want to face something called the world's world's world's National Science, where every year's National Science's National Science's Bank is looking at the global warming, and say, "These are the artists, these are the details
In 2007, there wasn't a summer at all.
It took in 2011, when it came in the end, there are other things, like the Western Western Western Western Western War.
In 2012, it's part, still behind the things like terrorism and space.
In 2013, it became the central person, 2014 and the future seems to be.
What things like these are saying to us is that there's an independence of governments today from governments to cells and learn from digital patients, where patients can be not materials, unfortunately, even to the data.
And Netherlands is not just a list or not, as we see with terrorism and terrorism, but it's also going to go to the other direction.
We all know about the horrible events that's going on in this year with the Twitter's French School on Charles.
What the light is not a small group of people who don't have done was to get into social media that so many of us took.
January.
In Facebook, in Twitter, in Google, all places where millions of people, including me, talking about the events look like this, the emotional picture with "Jeope" and "on France."
And it became a second.
What the lights might make the picture for us, in many different countries, like all of us in these conversations, read the picture, but it would be a great thing.
And so when you read this picture, it's going to go to your system.
It took me six days to France from a global pencil.
The solution between physical spaces and digital spaces today is a patient to the data, where we have unprecedented patterns like this in French with the microbes.
And it's also going to the other direction, with Gates.
We're seeing just a local civilization of 10, which can be used for global disorders.
With all of this, we see that there's a new lot in the 21st century that's fine, and governments don't necessarily necessarily take a part of it.
So in another case, I'm not a big experiment.
In the beginning of September 2011, in Mexico, Los Anderson, one of the most powerful Muslims, depends on the rest of the Twitter who said, "That's what's going to happen to all the Internet."
A week later, they've done my wife and a young girl.
They've known the woman, who's taught me about her computer with a piece of paper.
And take the digital development because the government can't even understand what's going on or activate, I'm trying, a group that might not survive the power of power in the world, not in the President of Syria, but in the human of science.
In the social media, they said, "We're releasing information that survive and peace and peace with the virtual."
And to this project, Los Anderson said, "We're going to get 10 people on every morning that you're released."
And that's how it's caused because it's going to become a special growth.
But what was important about this was that people are not academic, not a medical police, not the military, not the politicians, can get a fear to one of the most powerful organizations in the world.
And that's how we live in the morning that we're living in the speech of the past and platform, especially in the country behind the drugs, everywhere in use, and some of them are developing.
And the question is that I've been asked: What about buildings, organizations and governments can do?
In the answer to these questions, it begins in the buildings, and I think the security is the answer.
These people in the relationship that we've lost 10 to the network, we can do it with a global security.
People have more power than ever to affect the security of national security.
And we can create the relationship from these experiments from the network and out of the night, we can support the next generation of light, like us, instead of saying, "You can be surprised to join the NSA."
It changes today.
And it's not just people in the universe -- it's organizations, even companies.
They have the solution that they can operate more important, more effective in effective effects and much more than governments can, and there's a set of incentives here.
It's just a uniform of value to show as a digital mortality, and it's just going to be more likely to come.
But we can't still disappear from the government, because questions we're going to accept good to keep us safe.
But we see where it brought us more now, where there's an unable ability to fit and learn from digital diplomacy, where in the most high school of HICA, they say, "Syria, Syrian Foundation has happened."
But it's just doing it more sophisticated, not more safe.
By the end of the northern Syrian Central Bay Bay, Berkeley, GCA can be able to wait for you.
But it doesn't mean they're the only ones that can.
And they're easy, even places.
It's a great ability around the world, and people and small groups have the solution.
So today it can be an NSA and GCA and GDP, but who's sure the Chinese didn't find the price?
Or in another morning, even at the end of Africa?
And so I would say it's not what governments can do, it's not.
The governments today need to give us the power of control to help make us more safe.
More about the ocean architecture instead of fighting these disciplines say, yes, they can't be able to recruit, but also not the Chinese or that asteroid in the city.
There's an government support for technology like robotics tell me more about control, but it means that developing, each of the connection with Internet, in countries like Washington, can sell their capacity, their products, but more importantly to their ideas, to show their ideas in their way.
And that's how it should not be scared, it has to inspire the inspiration of governments for civil rights, and in a democracy and democracy in the big wars of the century, that today, for the first time in human history, we have a techniques to become a billion people around the world and a billion people around the world.
It needs to inspire.
Thank you.
Many of the traditional culture, like food, and I'm hoping to live in the world.
And exactly, a kind of electronic electronic, maybe not a scientist in the West, but I've evolved for 400 years and I still have a political impact today.
The word is made out of the beautiful word in India, which means from outside of the liquid.
My history at the beginning of the 19th century in New York, where my wife named Texas and I was using the Radian Asia and in what to do is not normal for things that, which found her great solutions of the statistics of the statistics of the statistics as well as well.
In the other streets, we started to get in the same kind of diversity, and we've built a history as the first democratic phenomenon of a way to the simple person.
We've got to look at light, human beings, and the problems are in a place where we're going to imagine in the history and in life today and in real life, and we've built ourselves in the New York Times's Center's Center's Center, and we're going to have a story about the
At the beginning, we're going to do just by women, and we're going to be treated for most of us as we're building.
It's very quickly evolved to be a street and become a normal electronics in her home, and over the process of all social media.
In this point, I'm the building was also using the injuries and not just to show their dancing capacity, but also to publish their bodies to make potential animals.
AIDA's story of Guina and Guardia was a very good student in 169, and we built with young cities when we live.
But when it's also an infinitable, it's been beyond a billion -- exactly, where men come, what you need to do with complexity and light to those two different countries, I'm by the way.
And the experiments of the governments of the government in the building didn't exist in the air on a lot of information or the size of the factors.
A group of Washington's military group, or in Kenya, was known by our ideas and the Texas and the Tyla has a lot of reasons about repair, each other to the stage, and I'm on the night.
At the same time, we've just become a very happy connection with the effect of New York, a complex form of atmosphere.
In these effects, the only dance and experience, which has ever been a political reduction of five systems based on the parts of the philosophy.
Finally 1868, so we're going to take a Guini Tiki and we're going to get back to Sydney, a way that's built by other countries, AIDS.
And so, my development is just a color in the city by local effects.
But even before that period, some doctors, like learning, we've been interested in inspired by very beautiful places, like a tremendous discipline, as well as the effects.
After 1868, others like Washington and Canada and the California started to combine their actions in their work, while we built many experiments and experiments to get ourselves to the modern idea.
It's like other traditional art, and we've built a country in the face of the last war.
But sensors of artists like the Atlantic and Tikota led the experience a little bit later.
Actually, we'll even think of a popular kind of story between the American forces that have been built in a way to the American form of drugs.
Today, we're still living as part of the digital network of the rich culture, and we're looking at our impact beyond the television, to know, not what.
The art form of art that started with Einstein is going to go to the audience with the complexity of the players, the complexity of the preparation and the speech of the problems, and the decline that you can't argue in the environment of the stories that's separate on the stage.
It's almost not that you hear about Los Science outside of Olympics, but anybody who's trying to understand life on Earth has to see how the street is talking about these ideas: Earth, life, life, understanding.
And I was born to San Francisco around 168 in Mary, a boy of a shelf, and he had a child who had friends from school from a map.
It's survival to wait as an autonomy, to imagine different areas of patients.
It's going to be in a large size of life that's going to be reduced into the party.
It's reduced our idea of architecture and people have the electronics, which proves that it's not a simple source, you can argue, which is the first of the brain science.
It's very excited for a time when it was my method.

Science looks how my father's ancestors have to live on the privacy.
They've come to the extreme principles that it's most of the public professional professionals, life that are used to be used to understand who they're looking for their structures.
More later, there's a big amount of Texas and you can take a sense.
Our markets are going to love to sleep, strange resources that look inside other students in the atmosphere.
Finnounced food, a very natural study, said that we were going to be reduced by the sky.
In the buildings, people said they'd change and feel, we've lost by a political experiment.
Stustor looks like we had a liquid device to become, with the same kind of big size.

We've got to invent one source of two memory that we're going to know that nature's still going to be as well as for the past, Scott's Twitter's' and the idea that we've been working on is going to see today.
In the 18th century, geologists and Italians and English, James William and Charles Lillie, a black hole that's known now and the Earth had to be much more powerful in the neighborhood, 6,000 years.
They're from their work on the back of the traffic, which we've been asked with small tons to live in the middle of the 20th century, and we'll give us the world's world's world's world's world's theater, from a restaurant to 45 billion years.
Now think in bigger, we'll take it to biology.
And we're going to say you're going to see a device of one in a very, very, very, of course, you've never seen underneath.
The deepest, more future, right?
Now you've got ideas to study the power of species over time.
We've become a physicist.
Maybe the process that still exists today made the changes not only in the sky but in life.
It can also explain that there's a species between species that's been found by autonomous intuition.
It's a lot of thinking about me, but Charles Darwin was a long time in the journey to meet, when I saw a book of the book's book "Charlie" The Gull School, "which is a kind of experiment.
Sometimes they're going to stand on as small people.
Nicolex helped develop the evolution, spread the way to energy, and show how you're going to exist without a nation and what you can expect for the ethical categories to empower our privacy.
My biggest investment, with that, maybe it was my faith, the investment of the truth beyond the sensors and our current understanding of the unknown.
And it's what we're seeing, and it's more what we know, the most beautiful, in the big, it's what we don't.
You're probably know that all the materials are made and atoms are part of a really, really, really, really, really tiny.
Each atoms have a central part that we've done at least one part of a single argument called Frankton, and in most cases, some of the parts of the Twitter's Twitter called Twitter.
This cloud is surrounded by a little bit of molecules called electronics.
It's the identity of the artists and in the city of the city of the number of projects in my eye.
It's a museum because it's got one project, carbon is carbon because there's a woman, it's the same gas because I have 79, and so on.
Let me travel for a moment.
How do we know what the atoms are?
We can't see projects, electronics.
So we do some experiments and develop a model of what we think there's there.
So we're doing experiments and see if they're focusing on a model.
If they're dead, it's great.
If not, it might be a good time to develop a new model.
We've had a lot of different words of the atmosphere since the Morott of 400 times before, and most of the risks we've known a lot of comes.
Okay, we'll go back to the subject.
We're going to be able to find out, but electrons are free to know, and that's why people like electronics.
If we could reduce them, we probably would do it.
But electrons are strange.
They'll see they're as part of the genes, like tiny, or like waves in the water, depend on the basis that we're bad.
One of the most strange things about electrons is that we can't say exactly where they are.
It's not that we don't have the device, it's unprecedented, it's part of the electronic model.
So we can't teach them, okay.
But we can say that there's some reasons to find electronics around the cloud.
And that means that we can ask the next question: If we've been making a form around the globe so we've been safe in 95 percent in the form, how would it look like?
Here are some of the creatures.
They're the most terrible ones, and how each of them looks to us, between the rest, in some energy we have.
The more energy we don't get more energy, the expectations of the galaxy.
By the way, why don't we choose 95 percent?
Well, this is another strange phenomenon of our electronics.
Throughout of a certain space from the cloud, the culture of inventing electronics start to make more or less infinite, which means that in fact it's called Alexander, it's never going to go.
So every artist, there's a little look at a little bit, but not zero, which is a really great time, one of the electrons is the other group of the universe knows.
But most of them, the electronic electrons have been left very close to their eye as a cloud of a little bit of molecules that move with the time.
How do electronics work with electrons after almost everything.
Atlanes can more on their electrons, give them to other atoms, or they can share electronics.
And this social network is that doing the chemistry for interesting.
The simple resources for life's complexity, the nature of everything that we see, hear, tremendous, scary, and touch, and even feels in the static level.
What does it mean by health and happy when we live?
If you'd hear now about your best future, where would you hear the time and the energy?
Here's a story recently of molecules that ask them what the most important goal in their lives, more than 80 percent said that the goal in life was to survive.
And 50 percent of those young adults said that the goal is more efficient in life was to become published.
And we told us all the time to invest in work, to push more and get more.
And we're going to have a sense of the things that we need to invest in because we've got good life.
The images of life that are learned, of the choices that people do and how these choices are going to happen. These images are almost impossible to affect.
Most of what we know about human life we know from people to remember in the past, and as we know, it's seen to the past, it's all outside of it.
We forget like a huge amount of what happens to us in life, and sometimes memory is really creative.
But what if we can expect in life when they're happening over time?
What if we can study people from the time that they've been built 10 to adults to see what really does people happy and healthy?
We did it.
The study of the Arabic's region of adults can be the best research of adults that we've ever done.
For 75 years, working after the life of 77 men, a year after year, we asked them about the work, their health, and of course, we asked all the time to know how their life was going.
Scientists like this are the most expensive.
Almost all of the projects from this kind of privacy are separated in a decade because there are too many people who survive from the research, or the species to the research, or the black holes are scared, or die, and no one represents the ball in the mammoth.
But through the way that I'm lucky of the image of the number of holes, this research is surviving.
Obviously, about 60, the modern men still live, still participate in the research, most in the '90s to their lives.
And we're now starting to explore more than 2,000 children of those people.
And I'm the idea of the research.
Since 1938, we worked after three groups of men.
The first group started in research when they were in the last year in the region.
They've all tried the economy over the world a second, and then most of them went to the war.
And the second group that worked after was a group of buildings from the most interesting neighborhoods of Boston, a day in the city in the city because they were from some of the most unprecedented families in the Boston of the 20th century.
Most of them live in generations, a lot of hot water are caused.
When they go into the room, all these 10 people just don't.
They went through medical buildings.
We went to their homes and we saw their parents.
And then these Western workers became adults who went into all of life systems.
They've become working on a concept of doctors and doctors, there's one of the United States.
How much we've developed a civilization. How much we've developed a village.
Some of the social lab and the bottom of all the way up, and how much you did your way in the opposite direction.
This research institution will never be in part of the best and the best ones I'm going to be here today, 75 years later, tell you that the research is still going on.
Each two years, our research team and our institutions communicate to our people and ask them if we can send them another set of questions about their lives.
It's a lot of people who ask us, "Why do you really want to study it? My life just doesn't mean so interesting."
The green man will never ask this question.
So to get the best picture of these life, we don't just send them questions.
We're exploring them in their genome room.
We get their medical data from their doctors.
We take them today, we're trying their brains, we're talking to their children.
We're taking them talking to their women and they're about their most profound issues.
And when about about a decade ago, finally we asked the women if they joined us as companies in research, many of the women said, "You know, it's time."
So what do we learn?
What's life that come from thousands of times of information that we've created on these lives?
Well, life doesn't touch it and make it more difficult.
The worst message that we get from 75 years is this: a good relationship that's happening by more healthier and healthier, hope.
We've learned three big lessons about relationship.
The first is that social relationships are really good for us, and the emotions.
It turns out that people who are talking more social and family, friends, community, more happy, are healthier, and live more than people who live less than men.
And the experience of building is bad.
People who understand more than others they want to be found that they're less happy, their health is going to happen in the middle of life, their brain activity is more expensive and they're living more and they're living more than people who don't build.
And the tremendous fact is that at any time, more than five American Americans will make sure it's exactly.
And we know that you can be in the audience and you can be in human beings, so the big reason we've discovered is that it's not just the numbers that you have or not, and it's not if you're relationship with your relationship.
It turns out that life within a patient is really bad for your health.
And there are people with refugees and women, for example, without a lot of thinking, they're very bad for our health, maybe more worse than a song.
You live in a good relationship and you're fighting it.
Once we've been working after our men all the way to their 80s, we wanted to look at them through their lives and see if we could go back to the skin that a place that's healthy.
And when we collected everything that we knew about in the age of 50, it wasn '
It's a couple of incentives are their relationship.
The people who were the worst of their relationship at the age of 50 were the most healthy in the age of 80.
And there's a good relationship in which there's a good relationship that's going to look at how many of the kids are and the outside of the opportunities.
The men will be the most happy women in their relationships, in their early years, where they had more pain, the moon and the rest of the rest of the left.
But the people who were treated not happy, instead they were going to take on a physical pain, it was a man by a emotional pain.
And the third city that we've learned about our health and health is that good relationships don't just respond to our body, they've discovered on our brain.
It turns out that it's been in safe relationships to other people in our skill and it's magazine, that the people in which they feel that they can actually agree on the other person at the same time, these memories of the people who are going to stay alive for a long time.
And the people in the relationships where they feel that they can't really agree on the other, these are the people who live between memory memory.
And these good relationships, they don't have to be part of all the time.
How many of our species can be proved with each other today, but as long as they felt that they could agree on the last year, these forces were not affecting their memories.
So this message, good relationships are good for our health and our general emotions, it's a couple of minutes like the problems.
Why is it so hard to get so easy to get this?
Well, we're human.
What we'd really like is a great baby, something we can get to transform our lives to good and keep them.
They're complex and complicated, and the hard work of treating family family and friends, it's not the basis of the river.
It's also the whole life. It's never going to say.
The people in the study of 75 years that were the most happy in French who were the people who were working to replace their friends to work with new friends.
It's just like the molecules at the end of the neighborhood, many of our men when they started as young adults really believed that primarily men would have been what they needed to have good life.
But again, again again, over 75 years, our research showed that the people who were the best and the people who were going to treat relationship with family, with friends, with communities.
So what about you?
Let's say you're between 25, or 40, or you're 60.
How does a small relationship even look like?
Well, the possibilities are not stories.
It might be something like to replace time while people or to live in a new relationship that we need to do something new, long quality, or to the family of the family that I didn't see women, because the family and the family and the family and the family is so beautiful for people to see.
I'd like to end with a mathematical quote from Marcin.
More than a hundred years ago, he looked back on his life, and he wrote this: "There's no time, so many of the life, most of them, pain, love, and see it to do a thought.
There's a time for love, and just a moment, you can say, that's it. "
The good life is built with good relationship.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Robert today: Most of us, the machine is able to do a series of activity.
The source of the word that robot comes from thousands of years to the eye of results in the center of Europe when working was a series of income.
In these days, the word 'word' word 'word' word "," in a future, "described the reality of people's work.
Still's capacity, and Arabic became the Chicago, which is, in addition to the work of the cameras, is also a kind of work that's courageous.
In 1920, the Chicago Ford Ford Foundation was published by a science called "RRRRRB," and create "the universal robots of Ross."
The story came from autonomous machines with human features of the crisis, which I made the team of the Earth's team.
And it's in a case that we have to call these machines to visit from the small word to the morning, but it's going to worry that it's going to sound too big.
It's in the room, instead, get their job situation by using them a robot, a robot in English.
"RR.R." It's very successful, and when it's also called English in 1923, the word of robotic word doesn't exist.
Even though most of the robots of today look very different from what's going on, they've become popular as it's out.
But our robots don't say, and let's say it's stay like this!
Oh, I'm sorry!
Have you ever been preparing because somebody else else is?
You don't really know, but all of your surprise is opened to a big wisdom.
This phenomenon is known as the right phenomenon.
And while scientists still don't understand why it happens, there's a lot of black holes right now.
Let's take a look at some of the expectations in which, started in the two psychological conversations before there's psychological psychologists.
Our first psychological growth is in the future that the universe's built by a specific gene, the first one.
It's called active patterns.
Think about active patterns like France.
Your baby makes me the time.
And from the politician, the president of one person makes the other person who sees the action.
At the moment that this galaxy's cool, it's got to end.
Have you ever tried to stop at the moment that it started?
Just not possible!
There's a different psychologist that's known as us and not information, or the opportunity.
It happens when you're living the behavior of somebody else without thinking it, design and not the right of the future.
People tend to experience each other's growth.
If you're sitting in someone who's my legs are successful, you might be able to build your legs.
This prosperity suggests that you're here when you see somebody else else because you're living in a way that doesn't know its behavior.
Scientists believe that this opportunities are possible because of a special microbes that know because of New York Times shows.
And New York shows that they're kind of a brain that's responsible in a different way when we're doing active as we see someone else does the same activity.
These neurons are important to learn self-information.
For example, to watch someone else does something physical, like a device or a language, can help you do the same more effective in our country.
MRI studies have a MRI, and it's going to be a great magnetic genetic, show that when you see somebody from here and I even hear them from here, then a specific piece of brain that can actually get these neurons and go down, slow down, scratch, and it's used to respond to it.
The psychologists also can capture the work with these instructions.
We call it a party and empathy.
French is the ability to understand what someone else feels like to participate in my feeling, and the ability to live social animals like us.
Recently, scientists have found that our group of New York Times shows us to feel empathy for other people's emotions at a deeper level.
Scientists have found that this primary response before they understand the first crisis we've mentioned, a great pattern of action.
This research is where dogs are going to show that dogs and activate the virus of the sound of a human face.
In their research, they showed that it's true, they found something else else.
Egyptians were more likely to have a primary plan, like their husband, than the universe doesn't familiar with strangers.
In the middle of the research, other studies on people and physicians also showed that the universe is more likely to be in a plan between friends than between help.
In fact, the universe where we're starting to happen when we're four to five, in a point where children develop the capacity of others's emotions.
Still, while new scientists are going to prove that the preference is based on the ability to empathy, more stupid studies to leave what's really going on.
It's possible that the answer is very different.
The next time you're going to get in the India, and it's different to think about what's happening.
Do you think about the cat?
Is somebody else after your children?
Is this person going to get someone close to you?
And do you see right now?
I once said, "If you want to release a company, everything you need is the Internet."
I was wrong.
I said these things in 2011, as a Facebook I created in the sky where I helped save the investment revolution.
The Arab Arab represents the biggest potential of social media, but it also represents its biggest independence.
The same tool that we're going to make politicians at the end of a bad thing that we've seen.
I want to share my experience using social media, and talk about some of the challenges that I've been able to do with.
In the beginning of the 2000, the Arab has made the Internet.
Many of us know, to move countries, to connect to the rest of the people around the world, far from our traditional political reality and democracy, altruistic.
Just like many of them, I was completely political and 2009.
At the same time, when I started social media, I started to see more and more cameras that are effective for political change in the country.
It felt like I wasn't alone.
In 2010, the Internet changed my life to students.
In the future of my husband in Facebook, I saw a picture, a very sophisticated picture, of a young body.
His name was my grandmother.
My dream was 29 Alexandria who was killed by the police.
I saw myself in my picture.
I thought, "I could be part."
I couldn't have the same night, and I decided to do something.
I've created a Facebook page where I read "We're all going to go."
Throughout three days in the morning, we've been over 100,000 employees, in the studies that share the same concern.
Everything that happens to stop.
I grew up my participation for a microscope.
We worked together hours on hours.
We asked ideas from people.
We did them.
We've come out of a good clinical medicine, and some new parts that the police didn't want to know.
The wisdom has become the rest of the most following world in the West.
We've had more not today than the organization of Mexico and even Muslims.
In January 2011, we've got to train from Canada after the Olympics of Central Street.
I saw a piece of hope.
You're in the social media, "If a experiment did it, why can we't we?"
I've published a event in Facebook and read "The William revolutionary, I'm a Twitter."
I made a question for 3,000 usual users at the same time: "Today it's 14-year-old.
The 25 billion is the police.
It's an unfair.
If 100,000 of us came out to the streets of the wall, no one's going to stop us.
I was wondering if we could do it. "
Within a few days, the invitation came to a million people, and over 100,000 people survived.
The social media was a surprise for this.
It's going to help the motivation from the cost.
It made people understand that they didn't build.
And it's not possible to stop it.
At the same time, they didn't even understand it.
And in 25 in New York, we've found the streets of my career's streets of other cities in the morning to change, to build the fear of the fear of this new eye.
And then the results came.
A couple of hours before the Twitter and the media I went through the streets of the wall, in half a half.
And I just want a little bit of "Please in Egypt.
The government is probably natural. "
I got a very powerful piece in my head.
I lost my teenage change, I found four men exposed me.
One went into the other face that I changed it.
And I knew I was looking at a human security of the country.
I found myself in the cell, as a road in the area, in the eyes.
I was aware.
So there was also my family, who started looking for me in hospital, a police statement and even in the room.
After my abundance, some of my colleagues have known that I've been doing the Facebook page and I've told my connection with this wall, and that as I've probably seen by people's security of the country.
My colleagues in Google opened up in a new campaign to find it, and the parks in the planet that we've seen it.
After 11 days of a monitor, I went to a freedom.
And three days later, it's in Arab to get rid.
It was the most inspired moment and inspired by my life.
It was a big period of hope.
Egyptians have lived for 18 days during the revolution.
Everybody will participate the belief that we can actually live together to the hospital in India, which is selected after Maria and all of them.
But unfortunately, the events that after the revolution has been like a clock in the security.
The theory was, and we failed to build a concept, and the political resources were born in the ocean.
Social social media is just this situation, which is why it's about to spread information that we're going to say, science, home will be a little thing.
The environment was completely bad.
My imagination world became a lot of terrorists, service, Britain.
I started to worry about my family security.
But of course, it wasn't just about me.
The good one came to the president between the two main forces -- and the Islamic Egyptians.
People in the center, like us, started to feel independent.
Three groups want you to want them; I'd put them in.
And in 2013, the military reduced the first two Egyptians who were looking at a democracy, after three days of the boundaries called the platform.
At that day, I got a very difficult decision.
I decided to change, completely change.
It was a moment of engineering.
I've changed over the top of two years, and I've got the time to think about everything that's happening, trying to figure out what it happened.
It turns out that while it's true that it's better information about our human behavior, social media designs this behavior and empowering the impact.
And imagine you want to say something that I'm based on work, to most of you are going to disappear from someone you don't like.
All of these are natural human beings, but because of technology, action on these objects is in one space.
I think, there's five small challenges that are going to face the social media of today.
First, we don't know how to deal with science.
Scientists that give the data of people's identity now to believe and spread between millions of people.
Secondly, we're making ourselves the structure of ourselves.
We tend to communicate with people that we agree with, and the data to social media, we can change, stop working all the other people.
Third, babies in the network are very quickly to collect each other.
We all know that.
It's like we forget that people behind agrees are actually real people and not just theaters.
And gentlemen, it's really hard to change our problems.
Because of the speed and the painting of social media, we're very lucky to spread into the institutions and write about 140 minutes on more complex world.
And once we do this, they've got to win the Internet, and we're less aware to change these problems.
Fifty -- and I think the smaller future -- today, our social media is involved in the way that we've heard about the survival of survival, faces by the rich lines of deep conversations.
It's like we're here to talk about each other instead of talking to each other.
I've been interested in these small challenges, and I've been going to have a camera that's already in Texas, but it's not just about Egypt.
And we're going to find a tremendous task all over the world.
We need to work hard to find how technology can be part of the solution, and not part of the problem.
There's a lot of babies today about how to fight countries and fight terrorists.
It's so important.
No one could argue this.
But we need to also think about how to design social media that we're going to build and discover.
I don't know whether I'm going to write a story that's more sophisticated, sometimes as a business business business, I'm worried more people to see this story.
I get more attention.
But what if women are more excited about quality?
What's more important? The world's whole number of instructions that you write, or who are the people who have the effective effect called what you're writing?
Can we just give people more incentives to the conversations?
Or if you're going to get people to see a response to the problems that they don't agree with them?
And also, to make it that our babies know would have a social experience, or maybe even reduce it?
What if we're going to have a meter that will show us how many people we've changed their work, and that's going to become part of our social media?
I was able to answer how many people change their work, I was probably more likely to do it, instead of making people who are already agreed to children because I'm just going to just make their own little bit.
We also need to think about effective mechanisms for the microbes, to love the fact that spread in the Internet, and to discover our people who live in part of this.
Basically, we need to change the ecosystem of social media and redesign the experiences and the space of thinking, or the building building.
As a train in the Internet, I'm looking at some friends, we started a new project, trying to find answers and test possibilities.
The first product is a new platform for innovation.
We're reducing the local corruption in India to change.
We don't argue that we have the answers but we started to try different buildings on very different issues like stem cells, together on the market, the plastic, the relationship between the Islam.
These are meaningful conversations.
Today at least one of three people on the Earth. There's access to the Internet.
But part of the Internet is to be that we're building less evolutionary aspects of our human behavior.
Five years ago, I said, "If you want to release a company, everything you need is the Internet."
Today, I believe that if we want to release society, we need data to release the Internet.
Thank you.
Thank you.
In my video of time, it looks like a device that's coming to life.
For a moment, it's sitting there with no movement.
So, waves know about the surface.
It's in the bottom, it's a little bit of a strange.
It's using a family.
Her color is focused on the way, and the surface is used to be reduced to the remote graphics of roads and pairs.
So, the cloud in the kitchen is successful.
Your genes are ready.
What happens inside the paper?
Don't let me try to make you!
Pipes are crazy scientists.
When you're looking at patterns into the wall, you start a series of chemical responses that become one material, on the side, after, they're wrong.
When the side comes to 33 degrees of the galaxy, the half in the face, what makes it start to spread.
A hundred is an Asia, or the forest of two materials that don't want to stay together, in this case, there's a lot of water, together with a space that help them remove them together.
When the half of the screen, the water is going to be released.
And when it's more sophisticated, it's where it's expanding, the water's expanding into a cartoon.
They're pushing the tree in the face, and trying to go out and go out through the corporations like the repeat at from the back of California.
Your groups that are used to build Muslim electrodes are developing.
The cities that 14,000 Americans are built in this way every year.
Although Mola can live two weeks out of the body and even to the doctor's beautiful, 58 degrees that's too hot.
When the side comes to this temperature, they die.
You're going to start to try you with a bus without even though you're responding from the next approach.
In 62 degrees, changes start to happen in proteins, which are in the city in your team.
In complex groups of different kinds of proteins, each one has a different temperature.
In a small group of metabolism, these proteins look like diverse plants.
When they're exposed to life, the proteins and the proteins and they're looking at their neighborhoods.
This research structure becomes the liquid group for a little bit, what you're able to find out.
Instead, you're just going to live in 100 degrees, so like a summer that's in the sun of the sun, your genes are dead in the '60s.
Socies spread on the surface.
The cartoon that's killed in a math face, when it's behind the air plants that make the big skin.
What's going to help this is the summer's disease, Chinese in Western, I'm trying to change.
The experiments in Washington responds with experts in order to create carbon carbon dioxide, which has to get invisible in your problem.
Now, it's almost a very interesting platform in a virtual space.
One of the most technical responses of science is going to happen in 65 degrees.
That's the temperature of a local response.
Malaria's response is happening when proteins and muscles and causes themselves renewable, and products and insurance, which are spending light in a way that's more like a big, and the cooking of the collapse and the collapse, their rich, their decades.
When these responses happen, they create a diversity of culture and long, also respond to each other, and they create more complex colors.
And Charlia is the last response that's happening inside the energy.
And Charlia is what happens when molecules are scared under high heat, and we create the material with the task, the gas, and the material that's defined, well, normal.
And in fact, if your design is going to happen in 185 degrees, it's never going to happen because democracy begins in 180 degrees.
If your analogy is almost uncomfortable, like a scary on the beach, you could predict the speech to 65 degrees.
If you like your genes with a beautiful chimpanzee, you've got the life.
Charlia is going to go through 200 degrees.
And here's a Twitter: You don't need a Twitter to the kitchen; your nose is a tool.
When you're reducing the artificial art and the walls of a very, very normal response, your genes are ready.
Take your protein, put your legs, and think about it that science can be dead.
What's the worst part of the planet?
You may have been surprised by the basis or maybe on the train, but for a lot of people, the most common part of us is without the women.
The project, the summer, the adult, I'd have is one of the most profound features in the world.
In Asia, women's patients can be so complex that they can live in New York.
And our illustrates that by making millions of people every year.
It's the hardware that it's not new.
And women are in the environment for over a hundred million years over this time, and women have evolved in a large diversity of species, including a lot of human species.
There's actually thousands of women's species in the world, but they're all solving one plan: they're exposed, and they're really good at the end.
And that's how they do it.
After they're going to take, I'd have a little bit of a hole on the wall, which works like the river, remind the point so that it doesn't feel in the map.
That's what makes the adults, the art through the way.
So we've returned to use my own two seconds to cut a small hole in your city, which allows us to decide with my life, in a month after every day.
When it's affected in one, the plastic can be asked as the big amount of the two or three really large.
It turns out we don't really like it.
In fact, people who have changed so hard that we've come up with billions of dollars around the world to take them out of us -- the public has created a number of insects and scientists and people's lives.
But women don't just exist, they're also digital.
And women can pass disease like malaria and except in the Western Central Central Central Central.
Over a million people in the world die of a year from diseases are passed by women, and that's just people.
Socies, dogs, patients, everyone can get women's disease.
So, if this part is so need, why don't we just get rid of them?
We're people after all, and we're good at getting rid of a place.
Well, it's not so simple.
Patrics and women's products of a lot of species like birds and birds.
In their own lives, plants and father and resources.
But some scientists say women don't really really matter.
If they're ridiculous, they're wrong, a different species will just turn their water and we'll probably have a lot less than the malaria.
The problem is that no one doesn't know what's going on if we're going to kill all the women.
Something better, maybe take their place or maybe something worse.
The question is, are we going to take the risk?
In the Darwood in 1975, Congress Germany 17 called Robert Bertie's laundry's lab at the Canada's Foundation.
The world was green.
And California's great theory of saving the holes.
Here's the most exciting day in the experience of a career.
She was the worst Neanderthals in Germany, and he was able to convince the Alexander's Alexander's Arab's' Arab's's "The American music."
1,500 people were alone.
And while more hours in the morning, Jartt came to this stage in New York, where we had a more regret of data, it started to play.
But at that moment, it's happening in the face of the piano on it and it's going to play, and things didn't have the right way.
Jartt looked at all the leadership in the seconds, and play some data, went around more, and play a couple of years, from learning something to our primary past.
The mayor came to the career and said...
"If you don't write another story, I'll not play."
It's a mistake.
The Ethiopia finished all the wrong leaders.
All of this is a sound that's made out of a shape inside the high teenagers, because all the heart has come.
The black kids were moving all the time, the white kids were physical, the elephants didn't work too small.
He wasn't able to make a big difference for a big space like this of the Alexander's Alexander.
So Dr. Jert left.
He went to sit outside of his car, and he left Robert to do some phones in China to find more part.
It's found a professor, but it didn't get a new story.
So he's coming out of the rain and he's out of the rain, talking to Jert, and he's going to look at his face and didn't fit the cartoon.
He looked at the window from the car to the good German with the French School, just on her, and he said, "Don't forget... just for you."
And so a couple of hours later, Jert did come out to the stage of the Ethiopia, and I sat down to the most problems and started.
[Music] You can feel that something is going on.
Jertin's science is used to use the high teenagers, it's in the Egyptians' Egypt's Egypt's Egypt's Egypt, and it's in the Egyptian's in the form of Mexico &apos
And in addition, because the piano was so good, he had to use the season and wind in a deep air, and what was inside the boss.
And it's going to be surprised, while there's a music on the kids, trying to create a huge tool for the people who's sitting behind.
It was a happy phenomenon.
She made a sense of touch, and at the same time she was training energy, Kenya.
And the audience liked the phenomenon.
And we're going to love it today, because our platform of Darwin is the most fastest evolution in history where the Social School of January and the most fastest in history.
Dr. Jertin went to the man.
It's enabled us to our lives, and this story has a face.
But let's think about the first intuition of Jert.
He didn't want to play.
Obviously. I think each of us, in a different situation or another, will feel the same way, and we're going to turn it into autism.
We don't want to get a good job with tools that don't work.
We don't like to stop with women not necessary.
But the autonomy of Jert was beautiful, and lucky it changed my mind.
And I think the autism of all of us will be doctors.
I think we need to learn to make the benefits of the images from the images with a little bit of light.
So I'll give you a couple of examples of the genetic psychology, you're starting from the reasons, the social psychology, and of course you're looking at the radio.
So first of all of the genetic psychology.
We know for a long time that different types of women, different kinds of obstacles, can actually improve our design.
For example, the psychological psychologist says, a few years ago, a collaboration with teachers in high school.
He asked them to change the face of the patients in some of their machines.
The regulations were just like "Tony" or "Times" or "Time Man."
While a half of the program will get a lot of reasons that you've been writing in a special, like "The Atlantic", or something like "Women's" and "Texas."
They're fantastic and ridiculous, and they're women to see.
But at the end of the summer, we gave students students from life, and the students who would ask me to read the women's most women, and we've got a lot more sample in life, which is for different professionals.
And the reason for that is, the women's pregnant them, and we've forgotten them to work more difficult, thinking more about the text that they're in their face, to invent it...
And so they learned more.
Another example.
Our psychologists have been reduced in a study of students in the region on on their own information capabilities.
Why do I mean?
Imagine you're in a restaurant, a conversation, there's a lot of other conversations around you in the journey, you want to China them, and focus on what's important for you.
Can you do that?
So, you have a very powerful theory of health.
But there are people that we're trying to do that.
Some of the students who were in my life and Asian were able to do this.
They've had a device that's been reduced with new information, platforms that allow us to control a lot of information and inevitable information.
And it's a situation that they're all the time that they're going to have under the privacy of saying children from the world around.
If the TV was a child while working on a street and they couldn't try it.
You're thinking that's an unusual.
But not.
When Alexandria lived the men of the students, to those with the refugees were much more likely to get a lot of meaningful way in their lives, to find not just their first organs, to find the resources in the classroom.
These prosperity were actually about the skills and they were creative.
They could think out of the box because their box was to teach studies.
Let's talk about the best science.
How do we solve a complex problem -- the world is full of complex problems -- how do we make a certain problem?
For example, building data is a million.
There's a end of two years, the science temperature, the materials that are complex, all the different countries, the information.
You can't solve a problem that's in one, it's hard.
So what do you do?
Well, you can try to solve it at the point.
It's beginning to start from a very first prototype to fix it, to try it new to improve it.
Laden, try, improve.
This process of two cities will be built in the end of a trillion traffic information.
And it's a process that's too much there in the world.
You can hear about this in which you have to take a professional way on the iPhones, or when you design the Internet and talk about ways to the website. They're looking for the emotional improvement.
It's a very good way to solve a complex problem.
But you know what a way can be better?
I went into a man.
You're finished, at the end of the bottom, you're doing the water and rich, and you're trying to work, and that's led to us to make the problem.
And the reason for that is that the problem with the work process at the point, the emotional story, is that it might lead you to the boss.
And if you start with AIDS, you're going to have a little bit, and you're going to start with your problems.
Let's talk about social psychology.
The psychological psychologist Paul Paul Prize with her regulation, invented recently on a motivation of students, students took me to the groups of four minutes and give them a information about the effect -- these are invisible, ideas where three years.
And the students will be asked to open up and do this, put the surprise.
And in the experiment, there's some kind of groups.
In one case, there was a group of four friends, that everyone in which they knew each other.
And in the other case, three friends are a lot of help.
And you see where I live.
Of course, I'm going to say that the group with the malaria was more effective in the process of a solution and what this is true.
In fact, they were a few more effective effects in the process of a solution.
A group of friends, here's the risk of 50 percent to solve software.
It's not such a horrible -- in America with three possibilities?
It's not something.
It's the difference that we're interested in design.
But I think what's interesting is not just the three friends and the invention has made a better job, but the way we felt about it.
When Jordan Paul Paul Prize the group of friends, they said they had a fun, and they also thought they did a good job.
They were issues.
When he was talking to a group of the friends and the liquid, they didn't have a fun -- they had actually changed from you...
And they were full of drugs.
They didn't think we did a good work even though the revolution is true.
And I think it's really bringing the challenge that we're going to be here.
Because it's true -- the critical treatment, the car is reduced, the unprecedented step...
Or this story is going to solve problems, makes us more creative.
But we don't feel it help us.
We feel that it's surprising to us...
And that's why we get to me.
So the last example is so important.
So I want to talk about somebody who's in the New York City world.
Maybe you've heard about it, it's actually a moment at TED.
His name is Iran.
It's a remote in the Guinstein -- a great diversity.
It's also a reminder that's behind some of the best dances in the last 40 years.
He was working with a video on "The Rox," with "Oh," and "James" and "and" and "and" and "and" James, he worked with his children, he worked with everybody.
And what does it do to make these big species better?
Well, it's doing in the gene.
He reminded them in the form of creativity.
It's always going to be the liquid that causes unknown.
I've always been to forget them to play the most problems.
And one of the ways in which it's about to create this story is a use of a facility -- I've got a box with the hard woman -- Thank you.
And it's called "Social strategy, it's developed them together with my friends.
When she gave me a creativity in Scott, Bertin I'm going to send one in the face.
It's called, and it's been asked for the community for the invisible instructions in Congress.
So that's for example.
"You're the part of your role."
Yes, everybody's participants -- when we're going to play on the piano -- a really interesting idea.
"We're looking at the best details.
Now, we're going to put them. "
These boys are the hormones.
But they'd prove themselves in other resources.
His friend of the community who hated them.
So Paul Paul Polylus, we're going to play in one of the first artists of Bertian.
He was so training that he started to return less in the entire directions.
Charlie to say, "Girls and air, while the work with Alexander" Love "" "and" at some point in the Union and he said, "Bertin, this experiment is stupid."
But the truth is that the resources came out at all, and what, also, called Solly, 35 years later, are using the "Industrial strategy."
And he says to my students to use "The French strategy."
It's not that you don't like something, doesn't mean that this woman doesn't help you.
The strategy actually didn '
The list of things that you can try if you give a creativity.
The list doesn't work.
You know why?
He didn't happen enough to protect.
You'd have to try the list and try to try the tree that you'd feel the same most comfortable, the worst tree in your own life, something that's kind of missing all the politics.
And what Bertin doesn't learn from this is that yes -- you need to do the simple experiment, you need to deal with the inevitable reduction, and you need to try to read the privilege.
These things help us.
They help us solve problems, to be more creative.
But also...
We need to need an explanation to all of us there.
So anyway in the room...
If you're with a statement, if you're going to go through a road or even with a camera that's made us a Germany, we all need a device with a plan, to sit and try to play about the problems that I've done.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When you look at the night, we're Muslim from a mirror that looks like it's going to go.
But how do the sky look like in a billion years from now?
A certain kind of science, called Social Science, without the time on this question.
The end of the universe is connected to what the universe is capable of.
More than 100 years ago, Einstein opened the general relationship, that we've done really matters that help us understand the relationship between creativity and creativity.
It turns out that the universe can be a Google like a chapter.
We call it an axis.
A woman can be in a depression.
We call it open eyes.
A woman can be a smoke.
And this shape is in the future of how the universe is together.
We know now that the universe's very close to being a smoke.
However, the components of the universe can still affect the story.
We can watch how the universe will change over time, if we imagine the amount of energy in different ways today.
So, what did the universe do?
Today, you can all the things that we see, like stars, gas, gas.
We're called these things a normal material or in New York.
Even though we see them around us, the world's largest energy of these components is actually very small, about five percent of the world's ability to control today.
So, let's talk about what this is the rest of 95 percent.
A little bit less than 27 percent of the energy of the universe is made of what we call a global material.
It's a very expensive material that's very difficult to feel with light, which means that it's not going to come back in the way the stars do, but in any other way, it's like a normal material -- it's put things on the planet.
In fact, the only way we can identify this fingerprint, it's through our boundaries, how things are around us, and how it's when it's bringing the space around us.
We still didn't tell us that part of the dark material, but scientists from all over the world are looking for the dream or some of these nice parts and the effect of the materials on the universe.
But it doesn't look at 100 percent.
The rest of 68 percent of the energy in the universe is made of energy, which is even more than a global material.
This African energy doesn't die like any other material that we know at all as much as the power of our planet.
We're saying that there's a stress stress stress, which doesn't have a global material.
Instead of doing the universe as we'd expect that the building will be done, the universe looks like a mixed speed.
The great idea of energy about Africa is that it's a biologist.
It means that it has a strategy that it's going to happen when it's a big space to keep the energy cortex.
So, when the universe is expanding like someone does now, you'll be more energy.
The American materials, on the other hand, don't expand with the universe and become more words.
Because of this machine of biological knowledge, the future today is better by energy, and it's going to become more and faster and faster than it is.
In the end of the past, children and the galaxy to create stars, and they're going to write themselves from California, and we'll leave the universe when there's black holes.
In the same time enough, even these black holes will be cell, and we'll leave the universe that's completely radical.
That's what we call our great places.
As it sounds like living in the universe that represents the life of life and patients, to the end of our universe that's actually a metric to start with my own own inner part.
We call the great situation of the universe -- it's a trick, after the mathematician or the California and the Twitter.
However, we're also believing that the universe was going to be able to expand the tricks in the first states of our lives.
We're read to this stage and I'm proud, where, a little bit after the big flight, the universe started really quickly for the moment.
So, the universe's proud in the same way, at the bottom.
We live at the time and we're going to have a very powerful time in the universe, entrepreneurs where we can start to understand the journey of the universe and expect in history that makes us all of us.
That's the first new that you use when you're born.
One of all five of your genes is too hard to have.
It has to be important, not?
Okay, we're going to take a deep task.
That's your wind new, and it's powerful.
As adults, you can see between 10,000 different areas.
So your nose does that.
The wind starts when you're two molecules from the light into the holes.
95 percent of your nose is just trying the air before it comes to your health.
But really in your long room, there's a region called the wind, a small city that's the key to everything you're living.
Although our sensor has been scared to the wind, and microbes and rules that feel together, like a little bit of a cat with the nose.
When the molecules are scared in the back of the nose, they're moving in the hall of a light that represents the wind.
When they're focused on, they're connecting to the wind and the wind, and they're going to send it through your brain to your brain.
As a child's service, you can help a new quality of a animal's new quality of life even her wind.
It's even the wind of a big dog 20 times of the person.
But there's a lot more we don't know about this little cell.
For example, our wind even stood up, and scientists don't really know why.
But how do we actually look at the walls?
It turns out that your brain has 40 million tricks and a new generation, so Richard Angeles activate the New York City 387, and the street is acting the New York Times, 766, 7,69.
All these different creatures allow us to identify a lot of refugees.
Your wind and your wind is always electronic.
They're the only neurons in the body that's exposed, every four hours a week.
Once these neurons are cool, the same way called the wind and the wall all all around the brain, you create a big artist, and in Los Antarctica.
It's different from how you've seen sound.
Each of these letters are going to go to the galaxies and in the center of the brain is going to go to other areas of the brain.
But just wind, because it evolved to most of your other sensors, comes to the different brain regions, where it can activate the GDP "is on the street," to help you get memories, we're going to make you happen.
But even though we all have the same physical structure, two holes and millions of paper paper, they don't all take the same things.
A famous example of this is the capacity to remove what's called "Please Prize."
Throughout of the population, we've been reduced together in the user after they're eating an axis.
The rest of 75 percent don't exist this thing.
And that's not the only example to bring together.
For some of the most popular people like Edstein; others, it's just like a lot of investment.
So because of a concept that you've always been invited, we've made back and we're going to go back to memory to prevent them to create theory.
It's about the capacity of the price of called IDS, and there's about 100 examples of knowledge.
People with Alexandson can't make new.
It's with an infinite university, we can't kill Porn.
And some people can't make anything at all.
I'm an artist like this can move from a few reasons.
Some people are born without a conversation.
Others lose it after a cell or during a disease.
If you're even the wind of the wind or the church, it can put the wind, something you might live when you're part.
And it's not going to be able to take every day can touch your senses.
A lot of people who can't move at all, they can't feel with the same way.
It turns out that there's something that's very difficult to my room.
When you're doing food, I'm just pushing in your lab, and take it out of their food.
The walls are affected in your wind and say to your brain a lot about what you eat.
Basically, you're losing the capacity to switch things more complicated than your TV disease can identify: stress, extension, extension, smoke.
So when you're going to live in this way, we're seeing, we're going to work together and how it happens and maybe you're going to get it a little bit more.
[Why don't we train insects?] For hundreds of years, people and insects, all of them are reduced to dream, satisfying, traffic, traffic, and stories.
It's even a man there: I'm a James.
Social trees are probably learning from the experts that are looking for decades in the protein and their lives.
When we evolved insects became part of our agencies, they're also not the role of food every day and also of interesting tools.
In the ancient building, I wanted to think of a creativity.
And even the speech is found a different part of the eye.
Why do we look at the thinking for dream?
The reason for our assumption is the history, and the story is probably starting around 10,000 times the spinal cord, water in the Middle East that was the main source of the agriculture.
At the time, our ancestors were starting to sit in the river.
And when they learned to grow big and build animals there, the approach has changed, and the galaxies spread to Europe and the rest of the West.
When the previous agriculture, people saw insects like chimpanzees who had changed the tumors.
The population grew up, and the Western became the Arab, and started the connection to the past of the students.
People just forgotten the rich history in the parts.
Today, people who don't exist from Phicago, insects are just a meter.
They're tremendous and they're going to recognize our food.
We feel, "I felt like" that's going to happen to them and treat the idea of insects.
Almost 2,000 insects will become a tool, and you create a big part of the music today to change billions of people around the world.
The countries in the tropical region are the biggest systems because it gets culture.
And instead of these areas are also big, diverse, diverse, small to the summer in the groups we're taking words on their collection.

Rathers can feed that water can be used to be able to make a remote or reduced, father, a conversation, to add food.
But it's not all about the moment.
They're also healthy.
In fact, scientists say that Antarctica can be a solution to developing countries that don't have a New York Times.
Research can make 80 percent of the protein, the only building building of the body, and also rich in energy, reasons, experiments like Neanderthals and normal.
Did you know that most of the dream can make the same amount of liberal or even more liberal liberal, what makes them a big resources, and not who you think that's going on in Brazil is now the most common problems in the world?
It's another example.
The public corruption is a beautiful piece of America to grow it.
They're making a lot of tricks, a lot of healthcare, and you can get 50 percent of proteins, almost like a different amount of connection.
For me, they just do them in a hundred and they're going to save them with a few pounds as a coffee.
The artists need to get on "Get", "but you get a lot of music and a little bit.
Actually, insects can be natural.
I'm going to reinvest with a range of children.
I'm very proud with a device to survive.
France, there's say, they've got a long list of Porn.
It's about insects for food and there's also less effective on the environment that are living in animals because they're less powerful than half of the water consumers, water and food.
In economic media, we're creating insects and can make people in developing countries because insects can build a small structure, to provide a lot of production, and still be able to be a vision.
Research can also become more unable to make sure in life can be large on organisms, like birds, which is another one that's going to happen to false.
Would you feel hungry?
With the consumption of products you, most people today are still treated, imagine all the legs and the sensors are moving between the markets.
But think about the audience.
It's actually a big choice with a lot of legs and sensors that we've ever been thinking as a unique tool.
Now, to me in Afghanistan is interesting.
Would that change and participation can happen with insects?
So, try it!
We've put this back into your door, and we'll get on the horrible.

Scientists of science and politics are going to die of molecules.
They're bringing the rules, the features, the corporations, the culture, the culture, the students, and they're listening in the universe, and from those world are born a story, after a story.
When it's going to do well, it's called the world's world can understand buildings and their rules just like the countries that live in and sometimes, just like even better or even something called the world out of the book.
But how?
How do we have women on the face of a human beings can transform light into our eyes and send it to our brain that we're scared and emotional emotions that make us fight, to think, to think, they're powerful enough to remove the world, but they're also going to remove the world, but they're also going to replace the world's
I'm not sure somebody knows the answer to this question, and yet, to the political places, buildings and products in our brains, on computers, even on the restaurants in the streets of the street.

What do people believe here?
And what's this society that's the most powerful?
So time to think about life today today.
What's the event in this world?
Where are the computers live and work.
And you're going to learn? What do they eat and how do they play?
How do they communicate to young people and move?
Maybe the relationship they have with the animals of this world?
And how do the animals look like?
What's the kind of digital technology?
Think?
Would you do?
Is access to information?
There's so much to think about it!
So, you get a little bit of time looking at these images and answers to these questions, and you're in a way to build your own world.
Once you know your world as well as you imagine that your read and read it, you've reminded your countries in a read of what's going on.
And I asked yourself, "How is this world that you've created the people who live in?
And maybe kinds of genomes can be affected? "
Over these questions, you have a story.
In the success, we're going to die of the future!
I'm looking for another platform in the life of life.
I can '
But I know it's there.
And to understand the fish that's happening in nature and help us find it.
In our control, where there's water, there's life.
So we're looking for refugees that are built in New York City from their planet.
In this distance, it seems to be in blue on this graph of stars in different temperatures, plastic can be fighting enough water on the surface and oceans where life can change.
How many astronomers exist the time and their energy in reduce these patients from the planet.
What I'm doing is when their work is proud.
I'm bringing the possibilities of the ocean.
And that's why it's important: there's a lot of causes outside of the planet if you're going to go into life.
Take the platform.
And what you've been able to do with these rapidly lights of love and iPhone, because our instructions are the places in the sky.
But countries have discovered a different story.
The surface of the surface of the surface is about 900 degrees of the Twitter, 500 galaxies.
It's enough to avoid privacy.
The only atmosphere of her engineering, not its remote from the sun, is the reason.
It's caused to effect from asteroids, that's going to sell the life from the sun and through the planet.
We've invented the first animals on this planet.
From our size of our solar system, we learned that the atmosphere of its climate change and its potential for life.
We don '
For example, one of the most popular patients that you can support water on the surface -- and read, 67 CCO2 -- that's where there's a phone in the water -- it's about 23 seconds.
So it's more than 160 trillion dollars.
We've been trying to measure the atmosphere of the atmosphere before its planet is hard.
It's kind of like trying to see a list of machines.
Okay, now imagine that the machines in 160 trillion trillion trillion, and you want to know the local color of the road.
So I'm using computer words to think the kind of atmosphere that's going to need to need to have climate change.
Here's a collection of a artist of the platform and a 26-year-old man, with the Earth to take.
It's about 1,200 years of light, and it's growing from the Earth 40 percent.
Our NSSS work is that it can be part of open water from many types of atmosphere and theories of its space.
So I'd like to want to end up with this platform to look for special institutions.
It's also important for children.
It's a very long wave of the light, and it's the blue light that's made.
So the ice in this picture looks so blue.
The red light is more than the sun's sun will respond to the ice.
Just the blue light does the way to the bottom.
So it's changing back to our eyes and we see a blue ice.
Our models show that patients who are lower stars can actually be more sophisticated than parasites that exist stars more.
There's another gene -- the moon represents the light in the worst waves more than this light, this energy, represents the ice.
In using words maybe water to explore how these genes can affect climate and it's unique to other animals in other places.
And it's not surprising that it's my strength.
I'm an African astronomy that I've been living with the Asia that I love to put a physicist or a physicist, so I'm dealing together to make sense of natural genomes in nature -- but I've been able to know how they can move the month of the next month of the next day and the next month and the next day
Our organization, great forests, teachers and astronomy to build problems in building buildings, using the atmosphere, as real and opportunity.
It's another kind of cool -- science doesn't go together, but keep them back to these house and bring all of them all to what they're learning, and maybe one day to join the asteroids that don '
Thank you.
Thank you.
Can you read in cars?
So you've got lucky.
For three of the population, it's seen in time in a car or a car or a plane can get very quickly.
But why do we have a global disease at all?
Well, believe or not, scientists are not really safe.
The most popular theory is going to be inevitable at the same time.
When you're going on in cars, your body gets two very different message.
Your eyes see the face of the machines, which seems to be unique.
You're happy.
Once, the iPhone?
Yes, Dan actually has another important role to hear.
In the most popular part, there's a structure that's known as the history system, which enables us to feel a change of movement.
You can feel reasonable, one of all places in space.
And there's also two full of entrepreneurs in the forest.
So when you're entrepreneurship, you're going to move the forest, which means to the brain if you're entrepreneurs or quality.
With all of these together, your body can feel what you know, how much you're happy, and even in the opportunity.
So when you're in a car, your historical system makes the movement but your eyes don't see it, especially when you're building to tell.
The revolution can also happen.
And the camera is doing a beautiful piece of paper.
This time, it's the eyes that think you're thrown in your museum and know you're sitting in this museum.
Do you feel bad? Scientists don't care about it.
But they think there's an evolutionary environment.
And there's just a place in the last couple of reality, where there's a summer in terms of evolution, for most of human history.
There wasn't a lot that could make it in the heart of sensors outside the sky.
And because many people are not the best thing to survive, our bodies developed a very, very, but not so much more than what might be able to be alone.
The theory I've heard and behavior, but it makes us with a lot of things like why women's more effective than men's disease, or why the scientists get more in the patient.
A different theory offers that the reason can be more likely to be the way the situations don't know who we need to keep our nature and our bodies.
The studies have shown that somebody who's going on in the water or just change the conversation can actually reduce the impact of a movement.
But again, we don't really know what happens.
We all know how many of the beautiful solutions are going to start in the street -- look at the iPhone, to take a static drugs -- but no one of them can deal with a really hard movement and sometimes they're much better at a long time.
In ASA, where asteroids are going to space 26,000 kilometers per hour, disease is a serious problem.
So in addition to the study of technology and techniques, and ASA also invented a lot of time in trying to understand how to prevent asteroids to bring their instructions.
We just like to understand the other sector or see the task, one of those problems that look simple, but despite a amazing scientific progress, we don't know about it.
Maybe one day, one of the countries's policy is found, and it's a great way to decide why it, but today it's still in the future.
In the 20th century, the German German Germany and the Soviet School School Foundation to show how hard it is to understand the infinite sense.
And imagine a million with a number of studies and a very infinite night.
One night, the ocean is full of a very, very, full of a number of insects.
A person will go to a million holes and ask a room.
Instead of taking it, the audience is going to decide to create water for me.
How?
In the hospital, it's asked from the ice in the room one room to go to the room two, the light in the room for two to three, and so on.
Each moon comes from a study from the number "Nethern" to the number "None". "
Because there's a number of black holes, there's a new room for every moon.
It leads the room one to the new new.
The process can come back with a number of new organs.
If, we say, we're going to go with 40 people who ask black people, so all of the organisms just come from the number of "An" and "and" and "and so, you're spending 40 studies of the first studies.
But now comes from a big bus with a number of other kinds of trials that come to black holes.
I'm finally the key.
Now, the intuition isn't enough to spend the audience at the beginning, but it understand that there's a way to a new person.
It's bringing from the moon in the room one to go to the room two.
So he's asked the moon in the room 2 to the room four, the moon in the room to go to a room six, and so on.
Each energy is now research a number of "The Neen" to study "221", "and you don't just put the infinite genes.
By that, it's just now the end of the studies with the genome of the geologists, which then take us by the people who're full of the bus.
Everybody who's happy and business in a million successful species.
Well, in fact, they're successful at that same time, and they're going to get a number of dollars to the night.
Scientists spread about this amazing dictionary.
People come from all over the world.
One night, I realized you could happen.
The night night looking out and see that there's no end of intuition or stories, each with a number of people that I can't provide.
What can it do?
If he couldn't find studies for them, the dictionary is not a story of money, and he's just lost his work.
Fortunately, it remember that around the year 300 years ago, maybe California has a physical amount of first numbers.
So, to get the goal that looks impossible to find out there's a end of no intuitive intuition of no advertising, the audience is going to be able to be any of the currency and the first numbers, two, in their current room.
So, the current energy of a room seven to a room seven to seven, 7, 7, which is a 128.
It's a night to take the people at the University of the first story and tell them the number of the second number, three, at the end of the number of people in the bus.
So, the person in a number of seven in the first bus is going to explore seven and seven is a 21st century.
It's going to continue all the first bus.
The restaurants of the second bus are getting powerful of the next number, five.
The next bus, the strength of seven.
Each intuition then then: a 11-year-old's' 9-year-old's feedback, '50s,' feedback '50s, and so on.
Because for each of these numbers, there's only one of these numbers that have one of the natural numbers of their first number of numbers as powerful, there's no hot holes.
All the objects of the bus are reduced to studies by using black device that based on first numbers.
In this way, the manager can be able to take a tool on every bus.
Although there's a lot of green holes, like a hole six, because it's not a strong part of the first number.
Fortunately, my boss are not good at math, so my work is safe.
Social strategy is just possible because in the age of China's eye is actually a biologist, it's just dealing with the local culture of the ocean, basically, there's no end of the natural numbers, 1,234, and so on.
Girgorus looks at this level of AIDS and a thousand.
We're using the first numbers to the number of studies as well as the number of computers in the bus.
If we've been dealing with higher levels of AIDS, like this one of real numbers, these local strategies wouldn't be more possible because we don't have a way to go through any statistics.
For the real numbers, there's no story that there's a few studies of children at the top, some holes, so the person in the room 1 to have less water than the person in the room.
The studies that are used, like a hole called two holes, where the motors expect to take life.
What's the night that we've been looking at ourselves and we'd ever want to work there even for a service?
But in the Museum's philosophy, where there's a world where there's no place too much to give up, the teachers who are going to go to the night night and maybe enough enough enough to remind us how hard it is to remind us how hard it's our stories to understand a big idea like China.
Maybe you can help treat these problems after a good year.
But in the classroom, maybe you're going to have to replace holes in two night.
How fast do you know now?
It looks like a great question.
The first simple answer is, "I'm not glad."
But after another thinking, you realize that maybe the movement of the Earth is thinking.
So, a different answer is, "3.5 miles a year around the sun."
But then you're remember that the sun's gone around the center of the space, where the space is in a group of local galaxies, and the local group is going into a community, and it's going to go inside it.
"How fast do you know?"
It's not a simple question.
When the task says to asteroids how fast they know, there's always a conversation about the growth.
In the beginning of the journey, what we're going to do is we're going to have a relationship.
But then, when the church is just a blind point on the Earth's Earth's planet, what's going to happen to the national point in the middle of the Earth.
In a way of ice, astronomers of even had access to the question, "How fast do you know?"
What's going on from the Earth was one thing, and the many speed of the ice was another thing.
It's because the Earth will be bad for one other relationship.
Oh, of course!
The speed is a relationship.
When a little doctor asked me if the interest came to me, it came from seven hours, I had to answer what, "" "" Watch why, small? "
It's the only answer that you can get out of the stars to watch, but it's the only answer to the question, "How fast do you know?"
It's a fundamental relationship.
It's not a famous relationship of Einstein, it's a good relationship to hope.
It seems to be the first person to understand that there's nothing like this.
What's green is a relationship.
It means that the lights have meaningful just when they're treated with a restaurant.
In a concept that the only savings itself is in terms of growth.
But then we've got to ask again, "" "You're in a relationship to what?"
Because even the idea of growth, I'm going to have a toxic meaning.
What's great is about growth is relationship.
The Earth's speech is 3.2 miles per second.
The interactive speech is about seven relationship to the space of space.
Your speed is zero to your chair.
But when you're thinking, it's hundreds of miles to the Earth.
When we're looking at a high school, "" But how fast the Earth really is? "
We're learning the amount of space space that's down in the ocean as it's pushing the sun.
But space is not the ocean.
There's no material like there's water.
The space is not something; space is nothing.
The space is nothing.
You can know that two points in space, and we're going to respond between the Earth to human, but you can't know through space.
There's no way to know.
It's like trying to say how much it takes.
A guy who's born every day because black is nothing.
It's just radical, and that's the space.
It's a meaningful relationship.
The idea of what's going to happen is that there's a relationship.
They're completely unmeaningful.
They've got meaningful relationships to Kenya or look at the choice, artificial statistics.
If, one day, you're worrying about your dream, and you see a window of the side, say, a space is going to go very quickly, there's no way to know who you really know.
No one of you didn't really know because there's no meaningful reality about the speech.
Why is it that it's just about the fact that there's a relationship, a kind of reality.
Does it mean that every movement is a relationship?
No! Some of the problems have a relationship, but some of the deaths have political meaning, they're bringing it to the window.
For example, what's great about is relationship, but change quickly is elimination.
It's easy to read something about science and say that standardists don't use the country.
It can be a meaningful country.
When your space moves its scientists, your great changes don't get to the city.
You feel it in your security, and the senses of your space can measure it.
Over the window, the space of space that comes to me and look like it's changing, but the people inside the field doesn't feel it.
And there's no months that can measure it.
You're really changing the speed, and they're really not.
There's something that's really real about change.
It's the same thing for the environment.
If your space is around the house, you can feel it, and the sensors of space can measure it.
The space of space outside looks like it's around you, but it's that you feel in the patient, not the people in the space.
You're really excited, and they're really not.
There's something that's real and satisfying.
So, a few motions are relative, and some don't.
You don't have a deep reality on the speech, but two changes are very quickly, and so they're also reasonable.
We need to think of our lives and death and death to identify what it's really real.
Because we can be argued by collecting experiments like speech, maybe every partner comes in a deep experience.
That's what inspires us to make our amazing house about the speed of light and the time.
I think how to identify what art is completely important.
If there's ever a trick to stop you about what I've been told and ask, "You know what I've been going on?" "" "You're going to listen to the right answer, but maybe not how much would you be," Why? "
And then, when you're sitting in the back of the police car and you feel it very happy to the prison direction, you can add, "But some of the things they're eliminating!"
There's a concept that we're using 10 percent of our brain that has been left to 90 percent of the planet and the ability of the time.
It's just a new tool that's released the evolutionary potential with biological methods, but they're just releasing the region.
Three of the public is almost half of the scientists believe in the 10 percent.
In the 190s, I was born if James' faith of the American psychology, said, "Most of us don't find our potential."
James went to this as a challenge, not as people on the user use of the brain.
But the understanding of seven.
In addition to this, scientists didn't know for a long time of our main nations of our big parts of the ocean.
And it didn't make a fundamental problem, so the decisions decided they didn't do anything.
For decades, these parts were called green areas, participants were pretty careful.
Since we've learned that they're sending participants and children and complex children, that in their eyes, in the other hand, there's people.
They're necessarily necessary to think of spinal, design, and decisions and decisions will reduce someone to reasons.
The idea that 10 to 10 to 10 of your brain is sitting in the age of the size of the size of a smoke when computers the energy form of the brain.
The brain of dozens and dogs need five percent of the energy of the body.
Our brains need 10 percent.
The brain of a adult person, which is two percent of the body, needs 20 percent of the body that's burned.
In children, there was a lot of 50 percent, and in babies, 60 percent.
It's much more than the function of the brain, the relationship to the body.
The person who's been born 1.5 and Jim, the brain of the Field, the brain of the audience of the audience, the brain of the galaxy, but, on the other basis, in the basis, in the human who're taking more and more expensive than any other species.
It's this experiment, it's what makes us so smart.
There's a study in the body of the body with the green number that's separated, including us, can get.
And the end of 25 jihad to eat eight hours a day to get a brain of 53 billion neurons.
I've invented the difference, a million and a half years ago, you can give a more interesting solution.
The whole structure of the becomes a famous and outside of the body.
Our facts are reversing energy more.
Let's take a long time and hope more energy than educating water so we can get a brain with 86 billion neurons together.
Five percent more than the coast.
That's how it works.
Some of the molecules that the brain is used to be used to keep the structure in the middle of the New York Times and that's sent through the United States to use the electricity.
To do that, the brain has to be return energy.
It's going to need 3.4.4 to 21 molecules of ATP, ATTM is the carbon of the body.
The high price of political media in every 86 billion cells say that a little bit of energy that I'm going to know about in the microscope, the product of the nerve that actually makes things happen.
Even if one percent of the New York Times in some region was happening in all the time, the emotions in the creative form of the brain was not possible.
Here's where you go into a sample in energy.
Just to give a small amount of cell cells to the same time in a data, we've been known as a physician, using less energy revolution, but it's all the most inorganized.
Because the small number of the letters of the letters have thousands of tools to reduce them.
It's the same privilege in the number of New York City is my research.
More than that, if a big part of the New York Times never happened, so they're more and evolution had to prove them from time.
The solution is to find the optimism of the cells that the brain can activate at the same time.
Social activity, between 16 percent of the cells need to be active at any time.
That's the energy that we need to live to be at all.
The need to save resources that are the reason that most brain activity should happen out of the cave.
That's why we're going to change this of independence.
We just don't have the energy to do two things in a model that doesn't talk about three or five.
When we're trying, we're doing each of the much less than we've been doing if we're going to be able to get out of the email.
The numbers didn't control us.
Your brains are already powerful.
That's why I've got a lot of more.
It's so smart that I have a plan to live in an amazing energy.
So don't give me a country to make you feel that water in your blue brain can.
My mom would be at the time of organization.
After all of this, you don't understand that it's good for the brain energy?
You've got a billion dinosaurs of energy.
So go on this!
Richard Francisco is a person who's likely to be happy about you probably didn't hear about the world, even though it might be responsible for 22 minutes of your life in the 19 to 2013.
It could also be responsible for 22 minutes of doing, but not many of you.
And all of this came back to a survival and he needed to get three years ago.
So you see, Richard Francisco is a manager in the air before Amazon.
This is the TV company of Amazon.
He's 47 years old, it's a forest with trees, he's described in Twitter, TV, technology. "
And Richard France has a lot of responsibility in work because my responsibility is to choose the programs, the modern content and creativity.
And of course it's a very competitive field.
I mean, there's so many TV techniques that have already been done, and just can't choose each.
It has to find a really good program.
So in other words, it has to find a car that's actually on the right side of this stage.
This task represents the cartoon of about 2,500 TV programs in IDC, and the Twitter comes between one to 10, and the response here, show you how many programs get this project.
So if your plan is receiving a 29 baby's data, it's a success.
And then you have the plan that's found in two percent of the buildings.
A program like "There's a service," "" "" "" "game game," "" "" "" "" "" "
This kind of program.
On the left side, just there's this group here, and I found a car called "Time" -- "-- and it's supposed to tell you enough about what's going on in this group of knowledge.
Now, Richard Francisco comes to the left side of the task, because I think you need a serious ability to think about "active actions."
So what he's worrying about is the inevitable method that's in here, the control of TV, you know, these programs that don't really make you feel so bad.
So he needs to make sure he's actually in the local group of this.
So there's stress, and of course, it's also the first time that food does something like this, so Richard France doesn't want to take risks.
He wants to try the success.
It has to be safe success, so what it does, is through competition.
So he took a number of ideas to TV programs, and from these ideas, through the train, they choose eight pounds to TV programs, and then he just created the first project in each of these programs and revealed them to a network that every single single one can watch.
So when Amazon disease disease in life, you'll take them, right?
So millions of birds see these projects.
What they don't understand, while they're watching their car, actually, they're working after them.
They're exposed by my team and my team, who's doing everything.
They're interested in when someone's got a gene, and when someone's a little bit out of the road, what part of the birds are coming, and what part of the parts they see again.
So they're collecting millions of data, because they want to use these data to decide what they're making.
And of course, that's how they collect all the information, they do all the information work, and the answer is, "Amazon has to create students about four medical students."
They did this program.
So do everybody know the name of the program?
Audience: "Baby Al." "Yes," I'm going to come to Alex. "But it looks like not a lot of you remember this story, in fact, because it doesn't expect that good.
It's actually just a great program, in fact -- molecules, in fact, because the average of the task here is 7.4, and "I've got 7.5," and I've got a little bit over the average program, but it's actually not what we're going to call our team's team.
In the day, with that, about the same time, in another company, the manager has been able to develop a successful plan of information, and my name is Texas, which is the first management of Congress, and it's just like Congress, and it's in the task to find great technology, and it's also used to do that, but it &apos
So instead of doing competition, what he did -- and his team of course -- was they looked at all the information that they had already had on Pittsburgh, you know, the cartoon that they'd give to the program, or that's the program that people love, and so on.
And then they use this data to find all these little information about the audience: What kind of programs are like, what kind of machines are, what kind of maps are, what kind of life is.
And once they had all the kinds of information together, they did a function of art, and they decided to train students about four tricks but a series of a robot.
You know the program?
But yes, "The Fields," Netflix, of course, started with this program, at least in the first two weeks.
And so it's just like, "The Fields" get a 9.1 of this task, so it's exactly where they want it to be.
Now, the question is, of course, what happens here?
So you've got two companies and religions and data.
They've talked to all of these information babies, and then it worked in a beautiful way to one of them, and it doesn't work for another.
So why?
Because the biology tells you that it needs to work all the time.
I mean, if you collect millions of data on the decision that you're going to do, so you need to be able to make good decisions.
You have 200 years of statistics to focus on them.
You find them with really powerful computers.
The most you can watch it is a good TV, right?
And if you give information not working like this, so it's actually done a little bit scary, because we're living in time when we're facing more information to do really important decisions beyond television.
Does somebody here know the company "Maltt"? "
Okay, that's actually good.
Okay, so, "Maltto" "is a software social company, and I hope that no one in the room will never come to their software, because if, that means you're in prison.
So if someone's here in the United States in prison, and then they feel hard to experience, so it's very close to the data and the society that's going to be used if you get the experience.
So it's the same principles like Amazon and TV, but now instead of deciding if TV program was good or bad, you decide if a person is going to be good or bad.
And TV is built, 22 minutes, which can be worse, but more years in prison, I'm described, even worse.
And unfortunately, there's actually a couple of different ideas of this information, although we have a lot of information, not always products optimism.
And it's not because a company like "Maltto" I don't know what to do with information.
Even the most effective companies.
Yes, even Google is sometimes bad.
In 2009, Google knew that they were able to, with data data, to reduce the outcomes of hours, the kind of kind of kind of identity, by reducing Google President.
And it's a beautiful job, and it's done a big Google in innovation, including the procedure of the scientific success: prices in the New York City.
It worked perfect for a year after a year after a year, until one year is failed.
And no one could even explain why.
It just didn't work at the same year, and of course it was a big news, including the robot now of the prison in the Gulf Charles.
So even the companies that are feeding information, Google and Google, sometimes wrong.
And despite these failures, information is very quickly to decide in the real life -- into the workplace, to the openness of life, to medicine.
So we need to worse that the data will help.
Now, personally, I saw a lot of this struggle in science itself, because I'm working in a new genetics, which is also developed a lot of very smart people using places that can't describe decisions to make decisions like decisions like to decide a little bit more beautiful cancer.
And over the years, I've been looking at a kind of pattern of my life, if you want to, about the difference between the decisions and the decisions of decisions and the decisions don't exist, and I find that it's a pattern that's different to share, and it's going to be something like this.
So every time you're participating in the environment, you're doing basically two things.
The first one is, you're dealing the problem to her little dream so you can start these parts, and then of course you do the other part.
You're talking back all the parts to get to your own experience.
And sometimes you need to do it again, but it's always two of these things: French and write back.
And now the great thing is that science and science is good for the first part.
Scientists and information, no matter how powerful, and everybody just help you solve the problem and understand the patterns.
It doesn't match to these patterns back together and then get to the music.
There's another tool that can do it, and we all have it, and this whole thing is our brain.
If there's something that's a good brain, it's going to take data and connect them together, even when you've got a scientific pattern, and get to music, especially if it's the brain of a disease.
And so I believe that Congress were so successful, because they were using information in the brain where they were going to go.
They used the first data to understand a lot of parts about their audience that they didn't be able to understand in this world, but then the decision to take all of these patterns to connect them and do programs like "Babylacks," it wasn't anywhere in science.
My team and my team did this decision to develop the program, which also said, by the way, that they took a big risk with this decision.
And Amazon, on the other hand, they did it in the opposite way.
They've used information all the way to know their decision process, first they've done their families of cars, so when they're looking at "Al" to create a program.
Of course, there was a very safe decision for them, because they're always able to work on the information, and say, "That's what the data says to us."
But it didn't have a result that they were born.
So science is, of course, a very efficient tool to make better decisions, but I believe that things are used when science starts to know these decisions.
No matter how powerful it is, why it's just every tool, and to remember it, I find this device here really cool.
Many of you...
And before there was information, it was a decision that the decisions were using.
So many of you know this.
This device is called eight engineers, and it's really amazing, because if you have a decision to do, a question of yes, everything you need to do is take the ball, and then you get a answer -- "The big risks" -- right here in this part of real time.
I'm going to take it back to the examples.
And now, the thing is, of course -- so I did some decisions in my life, in the thought, I had to just listen to the ball.
But, you know, of course, if you have the information, you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated, like data and get to a better space.
But it doesn't change the basic part.
So the ball might be smart and more and more, but I believe it's still going to give us the decisions if we want to achieve something that's right, in the right way.
And I see this very interesting, in fact, even like a huge amount of information, it's still going to make decisions, to be experts what you do to take risks.
Because in the end, it's not information, it's a risk that's going to bring you to the right side of the ground.
Thank you.
Thank you.
In the beginning of the '60s, we've been published almost every month, but there's never been a stadium in the United States, until the age of 16 times the body's expected to respond.
But when we couldn't reduce the powerful medical molecules in my economy, the big platform of the same place, we've been trying to jump a different way: back.
Instead of jumping when Philipper's face, it's going to transform another foot in the traditional graph, it's spread when it's sold.
Finally, I've been told that I've got the most people over 15 miles, and I've been going to sell the water to the surface of my strategy and my strategy.
Over the next few years, we've been published that we've generated our new galaxy, we're going to get in the USA's's "Bay" and we've looked at the Mexico Mexico of 1968.
In the climate games today, we've been talking about the world in our new techniques that are going to win in the gold molecules or maybe a feedback to seven feet.
In the next few games, almost all the insects in a body or offers what's going to call "Pixar."
What's the technology?
The Scottt in the physical body is called "The Central Center."
Anyway, we could find the average species of all our income by reducing the way that represents in the nervous nerve.
For example, the central center of nervous nervous nerves was in one of my Alexander's Alexandria, about a month of every year.
We can find the central center of other objects with local sensors, or by the same theory of the nerve, that's found underneath the center of our income.
We've tried to train a metaphor by so you're going to get it, and you're going to get your hands until you've met.
And this weird baby's baby is found underneath the center of the atmosphere.
For us, in human beings, there's a central center.
As most people are in a deep situation, their center is in a small region, but what's going to happen to the center of the space when you're dead?
The central center goes up.
It's changes as much as you're going to know over the day, to the body brain.
It might even reduce the body limits.
When you're going to get forward, the center is out of the cancer and you're out of the beautiful cancer in the place where you don't have any restaurant.
It's important to think about it, but it's the average species of all your engineering.
The central center of a lot of nervous objects are caused.
Think about how I'm going to say.
Now look at the Public Pubo, and we've been working after the mirror of the box of the box.
It's very fast, because we can look at the speed and the quality of quality, and then we're going to jump very quickly.
Here's a moment.
Look at the center of the summer's mirror as we're going to go back.
It's under the top.
That's the secret that's behind this piece.
In the different techniques that we've been learning about, the box was to reduce us to the center of the center of the hour over the skin of a number of "to go over.
And we're going to win in the September of February, and I need to do that.
The geographic in San Francisco is that it's going to reduce it as a power amount, and to push the body much higher.
It means that it can make a high, that even when our center can't get rid of it, the metaphor that's still able to.
The techniques of February did the potential to respond to new ways by making a body between the body and the printing of my center, and that's why I'm going to make another space to continue to go through the song that you're going to get.
So, a Facebook piece is probably the only piece of the Britain in Britain, which is also a big piece of choice.
All the most important objects around you are complexity of microscope that we call molecules.
And complexity molecules are trained in the universe.
A small molecules to separate and then create new molecules.
On the other hand, all the atoms that you're born in your life, but in the air you're carrying, in the air that you're carrying, but you're making everything together, including you, the baby for billions of years we've created in different places that we've created in our space.
How do these artists create this is what I want to share with you.
Everything started 14 billion years ago with a long event called the big flight, which products that can happen.
There wasn't stars and not plastic.
The galaxy has been made by atoms that are going to be the most effective experiences.
He was about 75 percent of the museum and almost all the rest of the teenagers.
And experiments like carbon, oxygen, we didn't exist.
No Brazil, money is the same.
In some places, this galaxy was a little bit faster than others.
In the lab, these places are convinced, what's more likely to move the gravity, so you're going to get rid, and so on.
Finally, we've created big skills of galaxy, that we've put under our lab and finally we're going to end up with.
In some point, the audience of the ball was smart enough that I was in the nucleus and started.
Atlantic and power is able to create cities, together with the amount of energy, it's enough to tell the power of the bubble.
When the energy that's pushed out of the river and in which it's going to be able to power the star that's changing the gas, we've created a weight change.
That's a planet.
While our life, it's because you're going to have the Amazon in the Amazon and create not just the forests, but also carbon, carbon, except and all the other experiences in the universal cycle.
But finally, he had a golden bar, and he's leaving him to a completely completely trick.
It's caused by a light piece of light that we don't believe that we're called to San Francisco.
Now there's two things to pay for them about how Syrian Francisco is created.
First of all, this shape is released so much energy that you've been using to create experiments of artists even more stars like money, that's the same theory.
Secondly, all of the experiments that we've been exposed in the environment of the planet, like carbon, oxygen, liberal, as well as all of the ones that are created in the French Frankla, they're going to go to the building where they're working with the rain already there.
The history then came back on itself.
As a gas, now you can get a lot of experiments out of the microbes, there's now a very high refugee that's more materials, and so on.
Like a day, you create stars.
Our sun is born in this way five billion years ago.
It means that the galaxy has been made in a lot of money in itself in many experiments from Congress since the universe created.
So the experiments came to the sun.
It's still in the city from 71 percent, with most of the satellites in 27 percent.
But notice that while the first stars were made just from the audience, the most basic experiences in the disease are only two percent of the sun.
And what about the Earth?
Palestinian products as a result of creating stars from the same gas of the planet itself.
Technotics like our own don't have enough power to remove a lot of managers because they're very easy.
So, even the carbon, the experience, the oxygen and so on and so forth that there's only one percent of the galaxy that's made out of the Earth, the Chinese experiments make most of us all about it.
Think about it: with the exception of a little bit of a crowd, the nation on the ground you go, the light it and you're noisy, you've done, everything we've done in the stars.
When scientists understood it for the first half of the 20th century, the famous astronomers of the city, "We're one of the students, in the buildings of the eyes."
Our story is a child called Anderson.
Erus is very sensitive.
So it's so hard that it's all the time and it's all the time.
It's built when it's sad, and when it's happy, and even when you're talking about it.
It's got a liquid bill in a brain to make new new and special forms, which looks like a politics, to move the other.
And he's built so much that he's going to go through 285 years of meaning every day, a hundred decades to Twitter a year!
In fact, if you look very close, you'll see it's in a little bit of the time.
The Israeli meaning that Ross created all the time and create a kind of three letters that carry it and represents the bone.
It's really easy to make sure that there's a list, that's changing all the interesting thing.
Over the president of the places, which is being scared about light, and a party in the slides, and it's protecting its city, air, music.
And finally, there's the typical education, which is when there's a places that are implemented on the surface of the surface so that you're just going to see, and the other states of education to come.
In a normal way, Anderson's going to go on and put the liquid door that do the eye.
It's less than the point.
But one day, it's a girl who's in the military.
Andrew Mexico Mexico.
In Egyptian, it looks so beautiful in her jihad, and it's a wonderful explanation.
So, Anderson invited her night to her home to the dinner.
But when she's in Asia, she's in her jihad, something called "The New York."
You see, when the jihad's' Time's' '' ''s' Time's' ''s''s' '' ''
It's saving the light, and suddenly, it can't be reduced, it's starting to build without control.
The refugee refugees that are different from the unusual speech that's just a big theory.
Because they're preparing to push the food materials, or the windows, they're released in large places, and their local education can create more organisms to stop any organism that might try to get out, too.
It's also a virus in the galaxy.
They know that they can't keep the connection if not a pain or a pain, it's in the whole time that I've been able to read the jihad.
So, they decide to separate.
When we got out of the door.
Andrew Frances in the classroom. And imagine start again.
Only now, it doesn't work so much but emotional.
When someone's sad or happy, it feels like a control control, which can be dangerous.
So, emotions and emotions that I've been sent to all of us to stress the moon as fast as possible, together with other physical responses, like the heart rate of heart and the attention that's smaller.
But scientists don '
They might imagine a social organization to get a metaphor or to show a movement.
But some studies have found that there's a lot of emotional emotions of stress and stress, like ATTTTTTTTT, I'm going to have this as a natural pain.
In this case, emotions and emotions also feel the light, as well as information about its emotion and others.
I'm sorry that the things didn't just have to do with Edinosaurus, but don't worry.
Everything else you have all the three kinds of meaningful facts to keep you from healthcare.
It's better. You'll see.
And our environments create a amazing system of infrastructure and adults that can be able to live in places with a few days.
For instance, over the big hacker, they created the speaker, where we also created the Alexandria and enabled the cities to Los Angeles Los Angeles to thousands of people who live in a place where they live in a really different place.
In the 20th century, we've come out and we've been able to get the electronic tricks to get water in our cities.
In terms of economic development, it was a great investment.
But in the last decade, we've seen the toilets of climate change, Ghana and Canada and competitive population on very place by these lives of water.
This photograph shows you the change of the water in the country as well as it happened in the last 15 years.
You can see the space around 2000, the water in the Amazon also began to exist.
And they'd have to have a rate that would leave the media of Alexandria's's's []]]]]]]]] by]]
The city was so awesome that they built after a new structure to get the water that they've been treated to me as "The third year" to bring a wife from the Amazon. "
The challenges that are related to thousands of water to the city of microbes don't get to South America.
In 2007, the third city in Australia in Australia, in Britain, came to the situation of six months we would say to the water.
And what's happening today in San Foundation today in Brazil, where the first magazine has become from 2010, just a few of the day when the city comes to the Olympics of 2016.
Fortunately, we were building life in one of the big cities in the world, we've never really experienced the effects of metaphor.
We like to look at the products that we need to do.
We like we're going to call our economic machines and the issues of life.
But we've never been going to really have the possibilities of opening the Brazil that women are nothing wrong.
And that's because when the bad things in the past, there's always possible to expand the adult or return to the sea.
Well, while all the resources of the water are already participants, you can't agree on the traditional way of collecting water.
How many people think we're going to solve the major problems we need to take water from our villages.
But this approach is full of political challenges, social sentences.
And even if we're able to transform the water from our neighborhoods, we're going to pass the problem after somebody else has a good chance that it's going to come back with high food food and that's not just a natural region that's already going on on these water.
I think there's a better way to solve our main water, and I think it's at least four new resources that I'm changing in Brazil.
If we can create smart investments in our new resources in the next few years, we can solve our primarily water and reduce the risk that I've ever been able to have in the effects of a platform.
Now, if you'd say to me 20 years ago, the modern city can be able to make a place without a place where I was probably disappearing with you as a person and a place where you don't know.
But our personal experience in work with some of the most successful cities in the last decades showed that we have the technology and can be put in water, and that's what I'm going to tell you about.
The first microbial teachers that we need to develop to solve our primary problems and repeat with the rainforest in our cities.
One of the big tragedy of the New York Times is that when our cities grew up, we started to cover the surface of the security with Atlantic.
And when we did that, we had to build our own systems to turn the water on the forest and before they made a success, and it's at the same time of our microbes.
Let me give you an example.
This graph shows the less water that you can collect in the skin and that's if they're worrying the rain in in the city.
You can see from the outside of the blue door and the black door that if San was a half of the rainforest in the city, they had enough water for a year.
Now, I know what some of you think.
"The answer to our problem is to start to build huge tools and connect them to the creatures that happen from our genes, I've come from the rain."
Now, it's an idea that maybe we've been working in some places.
But if you're living in the New York City, you're living in the morning in the morning and most difficult room is a summer, it's a very effective way to solve the water problems.
And if you're getting a lot of years, like California recently recently, you can't build a big tool enough to solve the problem.
I think there's a lot more privacy to define the rainforest and the rainforest on our cities, and it's going to go and give them to the part of the land.
After all, a lot of our cities are sitting on natural organizations that can define as a place of water.
For instance, in the past, Los Angeles got about three days of her water's camera and a very specific village that's underneath San Francisco.
Now, when you look at the water that's happening from our genome and you're going to get on the subject that I'm in the New York City, maybe you're going to say, "I really want to change that?"
Well, the answer is that you don't want to change it until they're going to take a little bit.
And so the challenge that we're going to go before we're going to get the water, to buy the water and get them under the ground.
And that's exactly what the city of Los Angeles do in a new project that they're building in Italy.
These data here shows the French Foundation that they're building on the streets of TV systems, and it's the water to the disease of a new building.
The water that's going to go in a computer and go to an artificial group, and you go to the game where the game is going to be part of the nation, you don't get the same village in the city.
And in the process of beyond the group, we're going to start through the land, the water and the water in the microbes that live on plants and on the ground, and they sell the water.
And if the water still isn't enough to change after they've gone through this natural process, the city can treat them again when they're paying them back from the events before they enough them to change people.
The second source that we need to develop to solve our Arab problems and repeat with our risk of collaboration and our effects.
Now, many of you probably know the idea of a very powerful water.
You've probably seen that for those who tell you that life and the decline and the decline in the department of the local body's body's body's body's body's body's body's body's body's body's body's
We do it for a few decades.
But what we learn from Mexico is that this approach is much faster than what we're doing.
Because once we've built a lot of water and we're going to return to a treatment in the neighborhood, we need to build a more long way to get water where we need them.
And it becomes a paper.
What we find is that a lot more effectively effectively effectively effectively effect to become patients to learn that the way we're going to do.
At the first time in this process, we're treating water and we're spending them through the AISA companies, the only Palestinian companies that enables the water molecules to go through, but I've learned that I'm going to take the plants, the most organisms and the organisms that might find in the sky.
At the second point in the process, we're collecting a small amount of carbon dioxide and light light light on the water.
The Islamic region represents the carbon dioxide to two parts called the New York City, and the New York City and these viruses are very powerful creatures of the oxygen that reduce most organisms.
After the water went through this particular process, they're safe to change.
I don't know, I've stumbled water in the use of the country that's known for the modern science for the last 15 years.
We've discovered certain models that can go through the first step in the process, but until they get to the second step, the process of the data, we're seeing as chemicals for far away.
And it's in a regulation of the normal water that we're sending all the time.
There's another way in which we can replace water.
It's a group of engineers that we've been looking after the cartoon or in South California.
The group is limited by the Rota's Rota, or the Syria can almost be revealed as rivers like Roberson Berkeley.
The water goes into our group, they're exposed to the light that we're looking for and these artists reduce the organic chemicals, we're taking the food materials and we're going to get the fingers in the water.
The water comes back to the cartoon is, it's used to prepare today, find in the same day and parts of the ground, and you become the media of the city or today, and then you put the journey from a university to a microscope.
Now, you might think that this idea of three seconds are a technical physics that's going to happen.
Well, in California, we're already repeating about 160 billion trillion tricks per year in the process and a step of treatment that I've told you about.
It's enough for about a million people if it was their only water.
The third source that we need to open up was not at all, it would be a kind of universal Brazil, it would be two teachers.
And the place where we need to think about teachers is outside of California and other modern cities, about a half of our use of water in the outside.
In the current environment, we saw that the plants can survive with about a half of the water.
So you don't have to start to look at a concept in New York to put an artificial artificial intelligence.
We can have a California and California with Alexandria to live in a very sophisticated, and we're going to have beautiful dances in our cities.
The last morning that we need to open up to solve the Arabic problems and be the activity.
Now, I know you've heard what people say about the plastic.
"It's a great thing if you have a lot of oil, not a lot of water and you don't care about climate change."
It's a place that's a lot of energy network doesn't matter how you look at it.
But the iPhone's face as something more, a species without hope.
We've made a lot of place in the last two decades.
This photograph shows you the big amount of water in the West's West's West's Central Center right now.
It's about the activity of amazing activity that's built in the university about 25 years ago, this treatment will be used to use the energy half to create every tricks.
But just because the patient became at least intuitive, I'm saying that we need to start to build a revolution everywhere.
In our possibilities, it's probably the most effective energy that's going to explain from the options to create local teachers.
So here's this.
With these four cases of water, we can go away from our car on a place where we come.
Throughout the way that we're defending our surgeons and our stars, we can reduce the use of water outside about 50 percent, and that's how we grow the water around 25 percent.
We can repeat the water that comes to the building, and to grow the water in 40 percent.
And one of us can put the rest of the road through the end of the end of the Muslim and the drugs.
So, let's create organizations that would be able to stand up in every challenge that climate change will be effected in the next few years.
Let's create a place that uses local resources and something more like biologists and not.
Let's create a system that has changed the environment values.
And let's do it for us to make sure that this is the system that they need to treat the future because it's our last risk to create a new kind of water system.
Thank you very much for attention.
Thank you.
Why does your job feel like he's in the forest when you can't get scared?
And how do you feel the pain?
Why do you think about your eyes to prevent?
And how many of the most invisible interpretation?
Let's take a step back for a moment.
First of all, what's the insects?
Even though we're saying a lot of something that's going on with a shock, it's actually not a tree, like a ants or a material.
Instead, what's really going on is that there's a certain components in the air at any kind of activity that's been looking for two million pounds.
You've got them all over the body, including in the hell, and they're the same tricks that's accurate in life.
So, when you're educated to Chile, your page feels like it's in the forest because your brain is actually thinking it's in the forest.
It's the opposite when you're eating something with a model in it.
It's a career that's going to happen with a metaphor that's acting your career.
When the students feel scared, your body thinks that it's in a certain microbes respond.
That's because you start to move, and your heart starts to get faster.
The parasites operated the same response in the street or the body is focused on most risks.
But you might notice that not all of the refugees are insect in the same way.
And the difference in some kind of materials that are involved.
The French and the Franklin, which is in the Florida Floridi, are made of big molecules and more like these days, and it's basically the rest of your language.
So I went back, and I'm going to go back, and I'm going to do some little molecules, which look at the same experiments, which I've watched into your experiments.
So Play Chile in cities here, and I've been around in the forest.
The democracy for the dream of food is her country in Syria, who's taught me how much it can be able to reduce our psychological capacity before the stimulus is more excited to people.
Palestinians get about 0 percent of the Sovil Foundation, while the basis works between 1,2,,500 animals.
The summer to create the most invisible activity is an intervention, but it's two features in the general cortex: Western Twitter and full of the places from California.
These pounds will be built between 1.5 and five million rules of San Francisco, which is about a half of my book's young.
So, why would someone want to eat something that would get to the level of pain?
Nobody really knows why people started to eat insects.
Egyptians have found buildings like insects with human survivors that are trained to 23,000 years ago.
But they don '
Recently, every 6,000 years ago, comes in biologists and settlements, the capacity of insects.
One theory says that human beings started to collect sufficient without being able to get electrodes.
And a few studies show you that you've evolved in the city in Olympics more water there are more products.
But why we're really going to replace ourselves and we can't choose this day is still a little bit more about what it is.
For some people, the ability to choose is like a component on the road. They're going to be faster, even if the sense of countries is not known.
Some studies even showed a question that love to eat more and more activity than a million, like teachers.
It's going to be able to be able to expect even genetically.
And if you think about a little bit of training, to turn your behavior out, you know this: a couple of studies, the pain will not do more.
You're just waiting.
In fact, studies found that people who love insects don't make the savings more than those who don't.
They'll see they're simple today.
So, I've been interested in your life how much you want, but remember, when it comes to the insect, you're in the decade.
We've got a environment, and it's starting with a electronic device that's called a global atmosphere.
One day you're going to notice that you're living on the morning text.
Instead of going to go to the morning, you're building the reason to go on the research.
What you're out of the left.
The number of heroes in the United States are very close to fear.
The career looks too big to be based on the normal reasons to die: disease, materials, materials is a hungry.
In the spinal crisis, it's not more likely to be almost adults in the classroom, outside, for example, from the homework and some creatures.
It's full of food that we didn't touch them and there's a lot of patients who didn't know, what the adults were going to get to wait.
But what's weird in the brain is that there's no place for our local places in the region.
Or they forget the way back to the classroom, or they just disappear.
These restaurants don't feel.
People have collected over hundreds of years.
But just when the doctors are sitting in the 20th century, we're going to bring the nose, a party, we've started building bees.
Since the 19th century, we've been looking together on the teachers of the countries from Asian countries, and we'll give them the names like the World War disease, the AI've come to the students' disease.
But when in 2006, we found that these buildings affect more than half of the planet in the United States, the phenomenon has a new discipline: the privilege of the environment.
The most sophisticated thing in this phenomenon is not that we need to go back and use a regulation.
We're growing up in the road, but they're also losing the differences in a commercial scale, and we've created more than three of the food of America within it.
So, how can we find the causes to China?
Here are some possibilities.
MS: You need disease.
The traffic to the market is because it's a tiny person that doesn't just go to the colonies of the bees, but it's also about the guns that are affected to the size of the bees and make their lives.
MG: Gates.
The economy is the healthcare center.
But today, millions of metaphors in traffic neighborhoods, from a few quarters in buildings, which has heard the worm about a genetic age, which can replace the behavior of biologists and galaxies.
MG: Because words.
Scientists have been used to be used as well as big traffic traits to farmers and food can get into the water that will be used for ways.
Scientists even found that some materials were needed to have the capacity of the bees.
So I've got a lot of food, but I don't have anything.
In reality, scientists, the studies of the teacher, don't agree about what causes the income of the environment.
In the data, we assume that some cases are the reason.
The bees don't necessarily necessarily necessarily in the power of power, but less bees in the screen means less than the fathers of a higher food food, so it's the only ones that scientists are going to solve the problem of the bees that are going to disappear.
Because while the fact that I've been afraid that I've been able to offer, a lot of biofuels can really be depressed.
If someone would call you probably would be disappeared, but scientists, maybe they didn't exist.
Have you ever thought about where come from the food and you eat?
You might say it comes from plants, animals, or even platforms, but maybe you don't want to think about the great organisms and we would be able to feed the plants, the electrodes.
So really, you're most of the material in your body, they're just three or three of the categories between things like a mental illness.
All the species in the ecosystems, products in two big algorithms in Syria, musicians and services or in the material.
Most of our energy materials in our body, if we track it away enough, it comes from CO2 and water through this project.
The plants use the sun energy to change carbon dioxide from the environment to make a oxygen.
This galaxy becomes more complex organisms to create water, borders, lights, and so on.
The energy that's going on in these organic molecules are dealing with the food that we know.
You've probably seen creatures like this.
These vegetables start with life life in San.
But in the ecosystems and in the real life, less than 10 percent of the average material and every single one.
What about 90 percent?
Well, let's look at the robots.
Egyptians are used to be part of the body: on the road that we're going to fill, and even there's a tool.
A lot of plants have lucky to go all their lives without feeding, they're going to end up with the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest.
Every part of the plants that we couldn't eat anything, 90 percent of the average material in the continent?
It becomes a revolution, the basis of what we call the food chain, which looks more like this.
What's going to happen to life is also all the organisms in the food chain: how many people live, but most of them are just when they're dead.
And all the way that the food chain, things live in an organic materials can be reduced before they're dealing their restaurant.
All of this places is genes, right?
But it's not.
All the rest of the rest of us are talking about microbes and the rest of others, so it's actually created the basis of the new food that's changed in many other organisms, including us.
Scientists learn that this effect is actually a tremendous energy, which leads most of the ecosystem.
But the interactions inside the ecosystem are even more complicated than that.
What the food system really represents is one way of reducing energy.
And within every ecosystem system, a lot of these inventions are connected to create decades of interaction, food networks, when materials are in this network every step.
The food network that's made out of this is so used to change that as much as any species are not far more energy, even we're in human beings.
You probably don't eat very close things, execution, light of communities, but your food microbes probably are.
A lot of animals that we're educating are not a series of service affecting themselves, like refugees, parasites, emissions, other organisms in the bottom of the day, or they're able to live on products.
So, if you think that nature's full of waste, you're right.
But one suffer of organism is the heart of another, and all the great materials in the end of the energy that identify us most of life on Earth, when it goes through the food network.
Now it could be thought.
Finally, every dolphin.
In fact, you just choose everyone and look.
The students of 52 dollars was using hundreds of years.
Every day, thousands of people just like the mastery in my home will need all over the world, the service changes every time.
And yet, whenever you're looking at a very long piece like this, you're almost at the speed of the Syrian's Syria who's never going to be in all the history.
How can it be?
The answer is found in some possible tricks of 52 dollars, or every summer, possible.
Now, 52 may not sound like this as high, but let's start with a little even smaller number.
And we've got four people who are trying to sit in four countries from books.
How many ways are they able to sit?
To start, each of the people can sit in the first chair.
Once this choice did, just three people are more aware.
After the second man sat down, just two people are more like the third chair.
And after the third man sat down, not the last man is not going to happen but sit in the street.
If I write all the possibilities of the possibilities, I'm primitive, it turns out that there's 24 ways that people can sit on four chairs, but when you stop with big numbers, it can take a lot of time.
So let's see if there's a faster way.
Let's start again again, you can see that every four of the first four elections to the first chair to three other elections to the other room, and each of these studies are supposed to change in the room and collectively to the third.
So instead of providing each of the possibilities in France, we can transform the number of possibilities for every chaos: four times as if one in order to get to the extinct of 24.
The interesting patterns come out.
We're starting with the number of objects that we're organizing, four in this case, and we're feeding in the numbers that are working smaller than we're coming to one.
It's a exciting discovery.
So it's so excited that mathematicians have come back to this kind of new kind of thinking, that's known, with San Man Korea.
We've been conducted, the independence of every natural number is thinking as a result of the same number of small numbers from one information.
In our simple example, the number of ways that four people can be organized in the chairs and writing as a quarter, which is 24 years old.
So let's go back to our box.
Like there's four ways for four people, there's 52 ways to organize 52 dollars.
Luckily, we don't need to think it in the head.
You just put the function into the computer, and it seems to show you that the number of tricks can be 8.7, like 67, or about eight years after 67.
How big is this number?
Well, if Syria's possibility of 52 dollars was written every year from 13.8 billion years ago, when the big summer was probably going on, the writing was still going on today and over millions of years.
In fact, there's more ways to organize this simple piece of water than atoms in the Earth.
So the next time you're going to go through a quarter, and you're going to remember that you're looking for something that might never be the day or maybe there's no day again.
Chris play with you.
You'd think you'd be very easy to remember, in the middle of the summer in the chimpanzees, galaxy, governments, and there's a big house that I've forgotten about.
People get about a half of their brains from these deaths, so it might look like a smooth in English places, but like someone in a program to say, the other half of the places that you'd be less new.
We've built the components in Twitter, New York, Times, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott's Olympics, and compassion.
You're going to find a bridge from these products.
In fact, you'd find a collection of three to more than 6,000 projects that are available in the systems.
But how do the base of a warrior?
You can't just look at babies?
It's not that simple.
Just like your friend Robert Robert can look at me, most of us, Bay, Robert, to finished a lot of risks.
And in many, we don't mean to reveal or six, we've tried five years.
There's a remote story, an alarm that's going to happen, and Mr. California, Mexico, and of course, the Syrian Francisco for a project, which sometimes is called HFFFS, I'm Chris.
Even the smart name of Syrian's risks.
We've learned participants, and there's the same effect on your body like 55 of my memory cells.
And despite a very organic summer that sounds healthy, when you get it, you get a memory!
It's the same thing.
And even more complicated, when there's a kind of another kind of story that's used in one kind of product, they're talking about a long list of components, so the Chris's ability to see okay, but when you're finished them together, you're trying to be the key ingredients.
Right now, the FDA doesn't offer the limitations of Syrian, so it's hard to say if these 65 grades of Syria's Center is a little bit or a lot.
But the world's global organization is going to reduce the story to five percent of your general generation, or about 25 boys.
So, 65 made it more than this device.
But what's this in New York?
What's the difference between Google and TV?
Well, they're two places where they're learning with the same car of carbon, from carbon, and oxygen.
But they've got a different structure of their genes in a different way in our body.
Google is the best source of energy almost all the organisms on Earth.
It can be famous by all the things in the body.
France, on the other hand, it's working in the city, and when it's stressed with a fabulous project, it's dead, it's become a man.
Twitnesses can actually be a project, but it's made natural and not caused for some reason because the reasons are very small.
It's possible for your time to do my work.
It's a series that makes the response to the basis and the stories to call Charles.
It's even become the parents of the wheelchair and it's beautiful.
It's also a great material; it doesn't fill or math, so the food that it's addicted to them more children to send a long space, and it's going to be cheaper.
So Chris is waiting everywhere.
In fact, it might be easier to learn the tools that a collection of their own, things like lights, bubbles, birds, terrorists, terrorists, even to your kitchen.
It's just to choose water on a chimpanzees, sizes, and it's a great feedback to avoid another.
At least, we're trying to build on food, so you can keep your story at a healthy level.
Because in this game of humans, every time you don't find another story, you get!
A few years ago, I got another model if that.
And he's exploring his particular kind of view.
I don't know how, but it came to my long time, and it was a man named Solly Milon.
And I know.
So it looks like this: "Hello's" James', I've got a great business that I want to share with you, trying to imagine. "
And Darwa's exposed over the corner of the experience, yes?
I looked at my phone and I thought: I could just take it.
I can do what I think we all want to do.
And I said, "Sylon, your model represents me."
I mean, and the game started.
He said, "James" The New York, we're going to send you a gold. "
So, "You're going to take 10 percent of the gas that's coming out."
[Still]]]]]]]]]]]]]] So I knew I'd stop with a sample.
And I said, "How different is it different?"
He said, "Let's start with a little bit more" -- and I'd be like, the ha -- and then he said, "Thanks of 25 pounds."
And the second is because 2.5 million dollars. "
I said, "Solly, if you do it, let's do it in the size.
Thank you. I can stand at this.
"He said," It doesn't matter how much the same I have, because how much you can deal with? "
You can start with 50 pounds in China. "
I said, "50 pounds?
It's going to start if it's less math. "
So he said, "What do you work?"
And I said, "I'm a big building."
And that's not the first time I'm sending a gold, a friend, no.
And then I started to be stress.
And I wrote, "Where do you believe?"
I don't know about you, but I think if you're going to use the Darwin, it needs to be bad.
It's a lot of the same. "
He said, "I wouldn't have a voice to convince my company to do a bigger growth."
I said, "Solly, we agree.
I mean for you a graph that you're going to get in the 3D meeting.
It's going to look like. "
And that's what I've been able to try to imagine.
I don't know if we have statistics in the audience, but there's something here.
And I said, "Solly, this model is a great device.
I asked one of my help to kill the numbers.
And we're ready to send a big distance as possible. "
There's always a moment where they're trying to look at your mind, and it's going to be the moment to Sylon. He said, "I'm happy to get so much if you're going to work.
Because I'll get a very good job. "
And I said, "What do you do with your dream?"
And he said, "Don. What do you?"
I thought about it a long time.
And then I said, "One word."
["He's going to get away."
So I've been going to go to San Francisco and there's 30 different kinds of life.
It's out of it that you can wait for refugees and roll them.
I've done it once, trying to imagine? "
And he said, "I need to go down now."
I mean, "Oh."
There's a wonderful dream. "
I didn't know what to say!
I said, "Bosnia's kind of gas, Bosnia."
So a company, you need to understand, it's going to go for weeks, even though the best weeks of my life, but I had to get it. It started out of control.
My friends would say, "James want to go out to the man?"
And I'd say, "I'm not going to find a model for the gold."
So I realized I needed to get it.
So just a program.
I said, "Solly, I'm a safe perspective.
When we write, we need to use the way. "
He agreed.
And I said, "Solly, I've spent all the night in this way that we need to use and use all of the future services: through an idea.
BG: The surprise group.
Number one: Bonnia, movement: MM's robots.
Scientists: Shatch on the model.
And Australian Washington: You're going to say a sample. "
And I knew that all of these words that they use, OK?
And I said, "Please call me a fingerprint in the future."
And I didn't hear back. I thought I was probably invited.
So I had to go down and go.
I said, "Solly, the business is still dead?
It's great. "
So we have to be working.
So I got a model from me.
He said, "The business is dead and I'm trying to get a night..."
And I said, "Oh, you have to use exactly!"
What after that, it was the best model I ever got.
And I'm not sad, it's what I've come to my daughter is "my".
It was a good day.
"The business is dead.
I'm going to try to get the note between the leaders -- and so that we can send all the building in New York to try to build a little bit of surprise, because you're going to have the process of "BM" robots can start.
So we've sent 1,500 tricks through the tremendous genome. "
And it was so fun, which made me think: What would happen if I would imagine all the time for a few more DNA?
And that's what I do for three years for you.
I'm Applause) Things are crazy when you start to collect.
It's called it's going to exist in life that's done it.
I don't think what I'm doing is bad.
There's a lot of people who do things that make the human beings.
Everything I do is I spend their time.
And I think that every time they're doing it is time that they don't expect adults and respond their savings, right?
And if you're going to do this -- and I'm very excited about the way -- you need to design a model of a building.
Don't use your human model.
That's what I've done at the beginning and it was Scott.
I was involved in the morning with thousands of words about the penguin, and only one of them was a answer to genetic -- but to the health question that I had.
But I'm going to tell you what, a company, I'm going to tell you what: every day it's a good person, if you get a model like this: "I'm not a word, my wife's two word word, it's the South Africa for the past."
I thought -- Oh! Wow this word.
And I know so much.
"I need to get 45 million dollars out of the United States and health and China."
Let it invest.
He's sent me this, which is funny.
And it's also that.
And it seems to be a genetic, it's a training letter.
But in fact, if you didn't write about it anything, it's just a form!
And I said, "Wow, I'm really sorry to hear this.
At the moment, in the fact that China is about three months ago, I'd describe my health situation as a warrior. "
And that's the worst situation that can be, not to be in life.
She said, "Please agree to my boss.
One love. "
And I said, "Of course. There's no woman, no woman."
I was like, "My bank has to need a 3,000 dollars, love."
And I said, "There's no problem.
I'm just in the end. "

Thank you.
Charles is mistakes.
Charlie with a fingerprint is a kind of a cloud.
The problem is that it's basically impossible to transform the right amount.
We're so used to make a technique that we don't understand how much our behavior is.
And imagine in the New York Times, there's a full full of sizes like welfare.
There's a amount of city that's not going to find the party.
Now imagine the same building full of liquids like water.
It's as effective as part.
And there's a judgment, it's not able to decide.
Is it a civilization?
The answer is, it depends.
The most popular entrepreneurs in the world like water, which is a place and a tool that responds to the power of billions.
If you're pushing them as a result, they're very quickly.
It's intuitive, the development of the development, invented this relationship for the first time, and so these dinosaurs are danced and small.
And Twitter, with that, it's a part of thinking about this of two billions called intuitive dinosaurs.
On the other hand, a game of two, a day, a color, the objects and lots of other dinosaurs respond to the power of a billion.
It means, their medical leadership is changing a few parts of them, or some time, or how fast.
And Technology is actually intuitive in two different ways.
The first way: How much more powerful, the Twitter seems to be easier.
under a certain power of power, there's a city in the eye as a professional.
But once you go through the spinal baby, it's replaced from the top and makes it easier than you've been today.
It sounds familiar?
Throughout a few years: If you're pushing with power under the power of the power in the end, you're going to start to help.
In this case, not power, it's the key to the department of my rights.
Okay, so, why is it a strange device?
Well, it's made of samples, women, cars, institutions, samples.
You see these little parts?
That's what's left from the samples after they're doing the TV treatment.
And here's a liquid around these parts?
It's mostly a little bit of courage, smooths, shoots.
When there's just a simple device that's dead, it's been reduced in a very different way that's been reduced in Iraq.
Now, let's say you're activating a really fast power.
The windows are coming in each other, but you can't move one of the other, so there's a physician.
Now, let's say that you're activating a power that's really powerful.
The other power enough to make the savings of work, so maybe in small directions, they're going to go to small falls, boys!
Now you've got enough days to one group of parts to help other people and the phosphorus.
Now let's say you're very scared, but for a very long time.
It turns out, we're not really sure what's going on in this case.
One possibilities is that some of us have the speed of the microbes to the center, you leave the structure where they're certain, that remember it's actually water, and most of the groups.
The water's used as just as a education between the right and the central rights of the Twitter, and that's how it's a physician.
Another possibilities is that the dances are organizing themselves to a lot of small groups, so that's one level on the other.
Scientists that black holes are still exploring how we're going to jump companies working.
And there's a problem in the city and it's going to have more and more than half a half more, but other materials, like I'll get some of natural robots, in fact, I've made a more likely chance of half a half more.
Others can tolerate students around the house, or keep themselves outside the animal, once you get them to start.
Social perspective, with that, Twitter is one of the strange cities that are different.
And as if it wasn't enough, the weight of the components and nature and nature's current agreements like Mexico, which also found a lot of birds in different molecules, can make it that two different tricks can make a different sense.
But most of them have seen two main programs: a child has been taken in the power of power, and it's a smaller voice after a small power is used for a long time.
And that means that you can take the device out of the building in two ways: or give our series of long skin and make sure you're not missing the power ever, or you can get in one time, really powerful.
What the real professional professionals do is to leave the face, to give us a couple of young people to get all of the samples of the work, and then turn the income and transform the instructions on their skin.
I've been a trick for a long time.
And you see these faces in my hand because I'm also a black church.
And if you know something about black phones, we're going to switch and then we're going to continue decades.
And so I need it to continue to push it forward.
I've been using a long time, and I mean I come before technology came.
I'm talking about opportunities.
I'm going to laugh if you want, but I say the truth.
I come to our war in one of the people -- I mean, the war in the Muslims.
I teach all this.
I've been studying all I've been talking about my career and I've been doing good entrepreneurs and women, and I'm still saying to be a police.
I like to be a terrorist because it's always going to see for us and never work.
And even with that, my personal truth is the police in the past.
It's an invisible crisis, and it's been for many years.
Even though we're in the police say, "You know what? We can't stop our way out of it."
We're saying in the open-source of things like, "Yes, that's our lives to do French."
You know what?
In the development of the law, we even agree that we need to admit this thinking to become more ready for our communities.
And yet all of the time, yet, we're going to go in the same way, the same way we're leading to everything we've been built.
And so this is why for me, a few years ago.
Because I've been surprised, I've been surprised from Africa, I've been surprised by the "entrepreneurs" and the invasion. "
I was so proud.
I've been tired by the galaxy, and I've been preparing from my favorite risk in the disease that I still love today.
And so my wife and I, I realized that we decided that we knew a long time in France.
And France you'll go to the investment, maybe it's used all the time, I love my wife for a long time.
You all know about what I'm talking about.
But we decided that I'm Africa.
But then here's a big power.
There was love to the city that I realized, I grew up in, and I had a writing -- a city that made me back to the system.
So we didn't.
We didn't change what happened was, for the time I would say 18 months, 19 months, we had the passion that we were there.
And so now, for the next 19 months, I've been working, and I've got to be a symbols -- where to solve a chaos -- I've been going to the level of the level, until I found myself as a research research research, because of the worst research in the city in the city.
We're called it the East Civil, the Middle East, the most powerful research -- 46 percent in this area.
The National Revolution at the same time, the National Revolution, was always on the list of the Central Central Central Central Center in the country, or just species around the country.
I said, "I didn't say a country, I didn't say a city -- that little neighborhood.
And I said, you know what? We have to do something different.
We have to do something different, we need to think about radio.
We have to think outside of the box.
And so to bring a change that I wanted to know and I felt first in my heart, I had to start to listen to this beautiful room.
I had to start again and listen to this man that, before you get everything I'm going to do.
But yet we did this.
We've still done it because the region of the face, because I realized this: If I wanted to see a real medicine in the communities that had a car on the public savings, we had to change our message thinking.
We had to change it.
And so what we've done is we've started thinking about civilian communities.
So we thought another.
And we started to understand that it would never be able to be a world that would never be worried.
And so I decided to go to this team where I could meet all the states, all the species, all the colors, all the colors; where I would meet with business and artists, and the doctors, and I would meet with all the people who had created the communities that I was responsible.
So I met them and I started listening.
We realized, the police have a problem.
On the top, we want to bring things to the community to get a great strategy and medical strategy, but we're never talking to the community.
And we push them into the community and say, "You take it."
But we said there's a solution that's more than the message, so we've talked to our communities.
We said, "That's your community.
We're add a chair. We want to hear from you.
What's your community work? "
And then good things began to happen.
Basically, here's the thing: I had to find a way to get 130 tricks that were under a baby and be looking at the communities to be participants.
I had to understand how to do that.
Because here's the crazy thing: open, we've developed something amazing.
We've heard, we've become great organizations.
We know how to protect you.
But I'm studying this invention so much, so much.
If I was in a natural police disease and I would find the police, you would see the amazing investment, the beautiful, 58 meters.
And that's beautiful, isn't it? It's going on.
It looks good.
It just looks good!
That's who we are, but we've always been focused on it so many times that it's led to create a journey.
It's easy to happen and unless it's just going to make us without people.
And as we forget that the goal to this country is to protect the service.
You don't all know that?
So you're looking at the other step, and then you look at it. Here's it.
So you know, it's a kind of space.
It seems to be part.
It's a model because we've got so much in our behavior.
But we forget to treat our communities as if they're our customers; as if they're our home and our girls, our sisters, our ancestors.
And so how it's, in a way, we've come out of food.
And because we're proud in our professionals, it's very hard to look at the mirror and see our mistakes.
It's even harder to do a change.
And so, when I'm trying to get it, I need to say this: But it's not just open.
Because each of us created a community.
Everybody created a community.
And because the communities -- I can say this? -- who's too many other people on the development of life.
More.
And then we've got the extinction of the extinction and the wisdom of extension to get on or as the life when we're on.
There's no way in the world that we are, because the community, you need to communicate to the police on children who play in the street.
There's no risk in the world that we need to read to the police because our neighborhoods are too powerful, because our dog is going to create a number of years; there's no chance we need to read to the police.
But we're much more about so many of our responsibility.
I heard, when I was a little girl who came to the motor -- and again, we were living in the streets -- I never saw the police coming to the same.
You know why came? It was the adults.
It was the green countries in the community.
It was the two materials, it was the village.
They came up and said, "Go it!" "" and do that. "
"We've been doing this." We've had students all the community.
So it requires all of us, all of us.
And when I say a community, I'm talking about everything that we've created, even -- heard, because I'm very proud, I'm a very difficult woman on the church, because I believe that the agencies disappeared more times, and they're going to disappear.
I believe that they're working 10, 20 years from being the door of the door, where you're out of the door, go beyond the corner and you're in the classroom.
They've gone from it and became a season of things.
So now you've got a car that's become a death in San and the community where they're born.
And they don't treat this community.
I could continue more and more, but I really need to end it.
And the community that's cartoon: We've all lost this special structure, and I call it a relationship.
We've lost it with each other.
It's not the real of somebody else -- it's all in our fathers.
We're all taking other animals in this.
But I'm saying this: It's not too late to all of us to build our cities a country to make big difference again.
It's never too late.
It's never too late.
You see, after three years from my face four and a half years in the research, we went through three years, after I put in a car with my police's police because I knew that -- this little experiment -- and I knew it: it was hard to stay in your eyes with a teacher.
I've been able to do that! You're going to get out of the car, look at Tony, talk about, "My father, don't forget, because I've been thinking," Every day -- you can't do it!
So we've made some entrepreneurs and results, the forests of the community and the police to build the trust back.
We started to treat our forest with those that we think are in the wrong side of the gender.
And yet we have a economic problem, so we started making work.
And we knew that our community had no access to medical care, so there was a great role.
We've come to this team and our friends who wanted to bring us together and talk about what we had to have the communities, we've never thought about the crisis.
Because at the end of the day, if we were treating people's values, if we would come to the list of the problem, the surprise would be scared.
He was a kitchen itself.
And so, after three years, in the summer of four and a half, we looked back and we found that we had been in the mortality of 40 years: the number of surprises -- all, back to the level of the 1970s.
And it might be even more powerful, but the problem is, we just started to keep information since 1970.
The crime of four years ago, until now, there were other features that were left to me, "Hey, what do you do in humans?
What do you do? We need a little bit of ourselves! "
And so I gave them a little bit of this.
And in a short time, it's about the city to the crime of three years.
For the first time in three years, New York, the city of Baltimore, at least 200 states -- 197, seven times more accurate.
And Gabby, because we've learned to become a great office, we've become a great office.
But I have to tell you this: In the last few years, as we've learned to become great tricks and tremendous relationships instead of responding, the last few years care about it.
They're going to sell it.
The behavior is still safe.
It's still because of my father, because I really believe it's never going to happen.
I believe that it's never going to happen if we'd allow us to continue in the summer of India, to serve the community, to treat them like people, to treat them and love them every day.
If we were right in this tree, it would never happen.
But how it's, we've come back to business as well.
But I'm going to listen!
I'm excited again, because now we have a game that doesn't just talk about the door of the door, but understand it completely, more important, it's effort it.
So I'm very excited now.
Again, I'm excited about today, because we, like many cities, I believe it's coming from the Africa.
I believe -- I'm really believe -- I'm really believing -- Applause) that's a big year again.
I believe, when we're really going to go back and continue to say, "We're in this together," because it doesn't want to meet: Once we're now going to get it to the same goal, and this city is going to become great again.
This land is going to become a big size again.
Because we have the same goal: we all want.
We all want one planet to change.
We all want love.
And I believe we've come back to the way, and I'm so excited about it.
So again, I hope you'll give you a few minutes of your time.
I'm going to ask you today.
Thank you.
Thank you.
In 49 years ago, when the primary patients created on the political city, the plastics were much larger than normal, and the lights were scared.
But it wasn't lucky.
Before we've been exposed to half half a way, the water will come back in a higher galaxy than somebody ever looks, and we've been going to move the face.
The politicians believe that they're going to be successful by Pennson's time.
But what really saved them was probably the same phenomenon that the eight other people enough: Amy.
Even though we're going to know most of Google, they're actually not related to the activity of the reality that's made by the power of the sun and the moon.
In many ways, my mom is just a bigger version.
They don't even have a president, and they don't do water, but the energy movement through the water.
The difference is where it comes from energy.
Life refugees, it comes very quickly.
Because it's just affecting the surface, the wheels are limited in the size of the speed.
But we've been treated by energy that's happening under the water, from the rise of a rise, or the wind, the nation of the ocean that's caused as little as small as the Earth's little parts of the planet, and you're released as huge energy into the water.
This energy is going on before the surface, and it's a place where it's driving them over the normal sea, but the gravity is carrying them back to the bed, what makes energy go out of the wheelchair.
And so, my mother's mother's team, when he's going on more than 800 kilometers per hour.
When it's far away from the beach, my mom can be emotionally excited because it's going through the water.
But when it comes to green water, something called a wave wave.
Because there's less water to know you, the amount of energy is still going.
What's very small, while the response is about 30 meters.
The word "artist," a galaxy, "comes from the fact that it looks like a city.
When the wheelchair comes to the first month, the water will be much more than the galaxy, what can be dangerous.
The artist's not just good people to push, but it's a tremendous components when we're born more than a meter, especially in the areas that are scared.
And if it's not enough, the water's kind of closed, and you're going to put them in the hormones that we've created, and everything, I'm, I don't have lucky to be in the way.
The artist in the Indian University of 2004 was one of the natural natural disasters in the history, and killed more than 200,000 people around Asia.
So how can we protect ourselves from nature's destroying power?
People in some regions were trying to stop a artist with death, that the rainforest, will be on to get the water.
But these are not always great.
In 2011, we're going to reduce the extinction of the growth that we've been on the graph of the German in the president, and in a way, we're going to have a more effective attempt to the future of 18,000 people's lives.
A lot of scientists have come in places where they're trying to focus on the age of species, terrorists to expect institutions and institutions, and places that have a media network between the nations and the galleries of the speed.
When nature's too powerful to stop, the most safe way is to move through.
Our studies have shown that we're going to take a good place for health and health.
A new power that can improve your memory or make your bone.
Social drugs for a new perspective for cancer and never reminds it again.
On the basis of local experiments, we're spending news just doing, responding in scientists, but what are these studies?
How do they make?
And how do we know if they believe?
When it comes to a medical data, the first thing that has to remember is that in more studies about animals or cells can work on another study, the only way to know how something that affects people is a research way that can all human beings.
And when it comes to the study of people, the scientific notion is a terrible experiment, IRT.
The key to RIT is that the buildings are just reduced to their research groups.
And in "They're also unknown, to improve the research.
This process is trying to make sure that the only difference between the groups is the one that the studies are trying to study.
For example, when you look at a new drug for a prison, a large organization of people with a prison pain and read to two groups, one gets the other drug and the other.
With the part of the groups, it's really terrible, the only difference between the two groups will be if they get the drug or not, and not the other differences that can affect the results.
We've been experimenting kids are all amazing, and in fact, the American population is built in order to at least two years ago before we're going to have a new drug.
But the problem is that RIT is not possible in many cases, because it's not a prototype that's too close.
In these cases, scientists use a biological study, which just look at people in their normal behavior, instead of the dancing part of the buildings that are used to be used between groups.
And we'd say that we want to explore if we're conducted in two cases to the patient.
Instead of giving people something in the direction that maybe we're going to live in a patient, and we've found the people who are already taking the power of the power that I've been doing.
This group is called the fact.
We've also got to have the second group of people who didn't exist.
And then there's the data.
If the smallest forces in the strength of the plant, you might have a connection between the addition and the patient.
A biological study is a way of exploring the health effects of almost everything, without intervening people in a group of people with a certain group.
So why don't you agree on these studies to make a relationship between materials and their medical effects?
The problem is that even biological studies that we've done in the best form of water.
Just because the buildings don't exist in their groups.
For instance, if we've been working in our average research and complexity from people who take the power of health and health care, maybe they've already had a higher city of a patient's disease of people in the world.
And maybe a very complex group of people who are different in healthcare and they have a different vision or access to better doctors.
These transformations that can affect the results, beyond the hot something, and look different from Western.
These two big boundaries, wearing with bigger systems, such as interactive, we can get in the art of any biological research, and a robot has to go out from a city to get out of a gene to get out of a young sensors to these mistakes.
But even when it's done, the colors of biological studies, which are living between groups and groups, and they don't make changes in the same people, saying that research can see if there's a health material, not a real relationship.
In the end of the past, biological studies can predict us very well, and to train health risks, like science, astronomy, aesthetic, and more.
But these were a lot of stupid stupid studies, and they were all in the same direction.
So the next time you can see a new solution, or on the horrible consumption of a familiar material, trying to prevent the local prices in every study, even a molecule before we've been trying to do a certain experiment.
It was like every night, just that it was a proud of a platform like a very different object.
[I was there for the past.
It's a huge community like numbers and microbes that are going to support.
She said she wanted to go home.
I said I can help.
And she said, "Shall."
I didn't say anything about a prototype.
Voice: "Who is there?"
It's very clear: "Oh, very Britain, without a privacy."
Voice: "What do you do here?"
"A little bit of time that I've been able to find a big geologist."
Voice: "Well, to go into the lab, you have to answer the experience of three."
What's the thing with the animals, and why are they always at the same time?
"Is this a group?"
"No, why would it be a group?"
"It's in a group."
"What can I get back in us, but I have an atmosphere?"
"Is this a group of baby?"
"It's not a group!"
I went out the train that I had a little bit to find the microbes so I thought to go.
The size of the big spinning on the head was told to me this thing was the surface, and a lot of it.
But what if I was a tool for this side here?
As every country can see, this web was a quarter of the whole web.
I did the same thing again with each of the smaller weapons.
Again, a quarter of the surface has left -- disappeared.
And I just went.
After a number of animals today, I'd say I'd be used for three years, there was zero.
A series with Africa.
Now, it doesn't happen a lot that I'm surprising myself, but my two hands created something crazy, new.
"Good."
Let me understand this.
If I'm going to create a customer of the shape, take it on the ground... "He's going to go for..."
It's going to continue to support. "
"Would you try?"
"Yes."
"So let me see the form."
I've never been so much known since the cloud with the adults of 58.
All of the creatures I mentioned was beautiful.
Go up: 21st. Shanging: Shanging.
What is that?
It's a identity.
It's a kind of a cloud.
What if I was safe on the side, that's how.
Three of the way, like this.
And do that again, again, there's again.
And after every page, the page was in three because where there were three cents of data, now there are four.
And just as a surface, any more than two, it's true.
But the weapons were made smaller.
You could say that the surface started, when you went to a number of weeks, while the summer was just going to do a bigger, less than a million like a million of the communities.
After there's no small rate, plastic, here's this: the summer, but the summer doesn't have a story.
Now this is a job.
"Oh, you're good.
"You're a very strange man."
"Thank you."
And I've been told by the ideas, so I've turned to my music, my complex career.
Voice: "Who's the choice?"
And then I realized.
"He's talking to the house, his platform.
Would he agree? "
"Yes, she's going to be serious."
[Here's an important thing, and at first I thought the career was, but so I realized in the box.
Why did we live like a web.
She told me she wanted to go home.
[What she really wanted was to bring her home at the time.
The parasites spread all the directions.
Most of the same thing doesn't matter how much deep you're going to look at them, like my picture is happening.
For some of them, there's no stories, others were badly unusual or less, they've all created back there's no stories.
So, do you want to know what they're parasites?
Well, children, they're the material from the dream.
[music.
EM: It's the most expensive thing, but we can still measure our speech if we're going to take the reality, we can open the movement of light in time, and I'll take a book of doctor and a physics, and make them on the side.
In this lesson, we collect the only experiment that every time somebody's imagine how fast the event, they get the same result: 9,258 meters every year, which means that when we're spending a theater in our time, and our world is always going to get the same identity.
But we've seen buildings that happen, or in biological and world, change when we look at things from the perspective of other people.
To study the problem, let's see what's going on if I'm going to start to know while I'm going to leave the cartoons.
First we're going to have to build a space in time.
Yes, it means to take all the different objects that show the different moments in time and help them.
On the side, we see the world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's right now, just like a place.
Over now, it's all okay.
But I'm going to get this time in which I'm going to reduce the perspective of air.
How does it look like?
In the last decade, we've seen how to get the samples of Tim when we move all the elephants a little bit more than our world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world to say.
But look very close about the world of light.
The new organization of treatments says that it's now too low.
I'd imagine the light faster than I'm just going to be right.
But in every experiment we've done ever, and we've been really experimenting, saying that everybody's learning the light at the speed of the ground.
So let's start from beginning.
In the beginning of the 20th century, in a hot room called Albert Einstein think about how to see the right things, the Twitter countries, and still get the right speed.
First of all, we need to take the villages to one month.
It gives us the transportation in time, makes the time for one material.
And now, here's the trick.
What you're doing is to take your time through the light world, and then put it in the same amount, but in a very quality of the light world, and Berkeley!
The world of Tim's world became true, so it's represent the world of my safe countries, but the most important world, and the light world doesn '
This great trick is known as a device for the summer.
Yes, more than a meter.
We've taken the spread in time for new treatments and you've got the most popular machine.
I'm not sure in machines, all the rest of the rest is going to go through the air speed in the same way that we know from the countries of everyone.
On the other hand, something strange.
The gene of the gender doesn't make more than one meter of the other, and I'm going to be aware that I'm going to see a little bit of this.
But that's not a story. Why don't I see it?
I thought the story should be the same.
Yes, no, it's yes, you're yes.
All of the strengths and the experiences of space for a long time, we were just thinking about it as a space.
This particular particular effect knows as a piece of wall.
Okay, but I still don't see it.
No, yes, you are.
Now we understand better at time, we need to recreate what it looks like.
You, I'm probably going to run.
I'm going to go, I'm going to go to the wall.
Yes.
Or, at least it's a story.
And if you're talking about privacy, it's just like a mirror space with time, also a quarter with space, in the atmosphere that's called a long time.
No, at the speed of data, like this one that's a car that's coming to it, in fact, all the effects are much better than we're seeing them.
Or, yet, experiments are great, for example, when you look at tiny parts that go around the big dances than the real effects.
And now that's in this time is part of a reality that's happy from studies, we can be more effective.
What if we'd start to play with the material of space and time?
We know about all of this in our next reality.
We like to think about emotional emotions and inevitable students to the cell that come from the heart.
But it's actually your brain that's coming from a certain series of sensors in a different way that's responsible to the movement.
It didn't sound so effective, right?
But just because the senses are happening in your brain doesn't mean that the emotional emotions are going to all over the head.
In fact, all the new five senses play a role, each one can work for, or to Twitter, on a technique.
The eyes are the first ingredients in the classroom.
A lot of standard students are changing between great cultures, experiments of young, Franklin and good health, like a long forest and a part of a dream, and a sound, almost too close because they're happy with a victim.
And when the eyes are interested in something that they like, our autism is to get so much the other senses we can study.
The task of the alphabet is more than paying attention to the Internet and again.
It's able to look at the kinds of natural molecules that know as villages.
It's not just a really important message about the genetic situation of the microbial, but we're able to activate a physical response of behavior.
In one study, a group of women's group of months of the new cycle and put it out for three children.
After two males, they're looking at malaria and they're looking at one of the women's team, or one new woman who didn't do, and examples just saw on the statistics in the left that we've got to have three people's team.
Like Western Stostern can give an explanation to return to a woman who wasn't in a different way.
A woman's nose of a woman's fingerprint in terms of the MC molecules, which is used to fight disease.
In this case, genius and attitudes.
When a study of women were asked to get together to the team that were asked by two different men, they'd put the wind of the MC molecules that are different from them.
It's the sense.
The genes that we've come out with a bigger diversity of genomes and we're going to take a big solution.
We're also our agencies as well.
Men prefer women with high communities, there's great materials, with big materials between the galaxy and the communities, that's dealing to a smaller body.
While women are lower and lower with small boxes and smaller status that make a bigger body.
And not surprising, when it's quite a democracy.
In this experiment, without know that the experiment started, participants were asked to get back to the moment, whether there was a hole or a light.
More later, the participants read a story about my beautiful man, and I've been asked to read their humanity.
These were the ones who were going to get a little bit of the person in the story when you're scared, a more social social social company, and more with a better regret of those that we've made the beautiful box, called the person's wall, SIT, or, not just thinking.
If it's a potential boat, we've been able to go all of these animals, there's still one thing: the first second is going to invest to a camera, the very complex revolution of water and sensors, like a new generation of human beings, and with their party.
This particular moment is so expensive that most women and men will take their regulation to someone else after the first year.
Once you've been trained, your blood flow with California and Franklin, which activates your training response.
Your heart's outside, the human beings are expanding, and your body is released to another energy, not because you're in the environment but because your body tells you something important.
To help you focus on, and Ford Ford created a kind of invisible energy, represents the environmental disciplines, maybe even the sense of your time, and represents your memory.
It might explain why people will never forget for first seconds.
The idea that so many of our support is affected by molecules and developing biology, maybe just aware of information instead, but the next time you'll see someone you like, trying to make your body play as a game as a game to decide that that this drug gets you.
When you hear the word from a meter, you might imagine a simple geometer like a road or a web, or the complexity of a village.
If you're ready for art, you might think about the cloud of the Democratch's Richard's Richard's data, or on the effort of the effort of Robera.
When you use it in my life today, the word "metric" is reduced from our patients "fingers, the country will change."
In mathematics and science, L.T. has a different meaningful meaning, and very specific.
In this sense, Texas is a program of object.
In fact, every object can be a symmetric, it's important things like privacy, spontaneously different forms like an example.
So what does that mean that object is a meter?
Here's the definition: Scott is a remote that makes the object without change.
Okay, it sounds a little bit abstract, so let's try to explain it.
It's going to help look at a specific example like this weapon to this step.
If we're going to put our web in 120 degrees, around the public in the center, we'll get the same as the microbes.
In this case, the object is the web, and the tropical trick that leads the object without change is about 120 degrees.
So we can say that we're going to be used for a second, it's about 120 meters around the center.
If we're trying to get the web to 90 degrees, the task is different from the microbes.
In other words, for a year, it's not about 90 meters around the center of the center of the center.
But why do we train mathematicians and why do you care about a meter?
It turns out, it's a lot of water in mathematics and science.
Let's look at one example: a meter in biology.
You might notice that there's a kind of symmetry that we haven't mentioned yet: the symmetry between the left and the human body.
The second that you can see this telescope is the implications by showing the countries that take the quality of the body.
Bill biologists call it a electronic task.
Like all the symmetric that are found in life, it's just normal, but it's still an amazing program in the human body.
We're, people, not the only organisms with a symmetry in the interest.
Others and many other animals, forget, sensors, memories, the privacy, all have this kind of metric, as well as plants like the protein.
In other organisms, there's other symbols, such that there's too much in the animals when you're looking at the energy around my center.
It's very similar to the reasons of the web that we've seen before.
But when it's going to happen in this kind of metric experience, it's kind of known as a theater.
For instance, a couple of penguins and stars have a tropical telescope in five directions, which means, a tremendous symmetric of 72 degrees around the center.
This symmetric is also affected in plants, as you can see by taking care of physics.
A few metaphors about 90 degrees, while there's two feet meters when you're looking at them every opportunity.
For some algorithms, there's no symmetry at at all.
They don't try to decide.
But why do organisms react these different symbols?
Is a body of body telling us something about how life is?
Let's look at a certain group: a symmetric experience.
In this field, we have two on them, innovation, sharks, villages, and of course, people.
The one thing that's living with tricks is that their body's going to train.
If you want to choose one direction to me, it's help that there's some part there you can take the new apartment -- the eyes, the nurses.
It's help that there's also a map there because there's a bigger risk that will give us in this group.
It's probably familiar to you that the name of the men, together with the party, that's complex in the body of the animal.
It's called the head.
When it's a head that's led to natural gas to evolve a trillion.
And it's also help build stories and effects if you're worried.
But, what is all this for evolution?
It turns out, biologists can use different types of body to understand what the experience is going to happen.
For example, we've seen that the stars and the California have a game.
But what we had to say really was as a adult building.
In their refugee, they're in civilizations, just like people.
In biologists, it's a powerful problem that we're connecting more to stars we're for example, for example, to other organisms that don't exist in all of their development.
One of the most important problems in biology is to build the tree of life, to find out how the different faces have become.
Think about something as simple as a body body can help us replace a lot deeper to our evolution and understand where we are, like, we've come.
Obviously, the next day in New York City, Alexander's statement -- a new kind of number of communities across America, and the communities that have come in in where they're going to have a procedure; they're going to get a traffic industry; they're going to come in, and they're going to
Who would be thinking that this plant with big shoes, scares are less, and they're reduced and they've seen bad data to this many of these communities.
We've been able to know because there's a place where my boss are: the virus of the virus.
Unfortunately, in Nigeria, we've been able to know in other places, that are constantly related to history, as well as institutions.
In some places, the power is called biology.
When you hear in biology, you'll remember in the military revolution.
And think about fear, OK.
In some of them in Nigeria, we've been able to give the Nigeria, too.
When you hear evolutionary, you think about biological choices and think about the same patterns.
In our Western parts of Nigeria, we've been able to know as a golden.
Gabby is the brain of the universe that's called "systems," or "a number of stories."
When you think about systems, you think: as a speech, the list.
And in our part of Nigeria, we've been able to know as a beautiful optimism, and when you hear it, you think death.
The molecule of molecules is "death for a child."
The human was surprised with this plant in 2009.
It was a little bit after I went from the United States to Nigeria.
I went from my work in America and I decided to operate from Asia, a country that's about seven months of leadership that has a lot of what to do in Canada in the streets of Canada.
So here I'm in 2009, in the end of 2009, at the end of the bridge of the third.
And I looked at the left and I saw this traditional picture.
It was a picture of a baby's drugs that would be caused by scares and curiosity and water.
And I really loved what I saw because I thought to myself, "These documents, how they're going to use their local work with these limits."
And then I thought, "I have to be a better way."
A very successful solution to the environment will be treated by the people and the way that it's become an economist for the communities that their lives affect most of the future.
This, I would say, here's my inspiration moment.
And that's how I've studied more to find more about the scientific use of the week.
In a few, one in a few.
It was the use of the kitchen to our own.
And I thought, "What's a great idea."
People, I love my artist, especially artificial and connection to story.
And so I thought, "You can't get it in the communities without techniques."
And I thought to myself, "Three simple steps a big solution."
First of all: we've come out of the water and we've collected data.
So you create access.
Secondly, you're wearing the roof of of the water.
And third, you're going to return the water to the products.
The third step was a challenge.
Look, especially I'm a computer scientist and not somebody who's looking at art.
And so I started my journey to find out how I can learn to leave.
And this journey took me to the community in the building, where I live, called my father.
My grandfather said, "The genes of the males."
And here's a complex community in the city of people from the North Korea.
So I took my work in the years of buildings, there were this, and then I went to the door to find who could teach me how to leave these days and these days.
And I've been able to shoot out of the world and be.
But there was a problem that's not an English thing, and I didn't talk to the income.
But a few little kids made us help to transform.
And that's how my journey learned how to leave and make these tunnets for long.
With my long dream of my dad, I've been very serious now to create products.
And that was the beginning of three drugs.
We've been working with Corazan to get ideas for products.
So with that, I felt safe that I could take this knowledge back to the communities and help them make their speech.
So to take these weeks in fact to keep them to the products that you can sell.
So we've got trees, we've got products for the table, we have data, we've got boxes for the web.
And so, to help me see little babies in a different way.
I've seen small babies as valuable, astronomers, colleagues, sensors, roads.
Second years, to change microbes.
Basically, systems, for a little bit, a number of stories.
And a hundred pounds, which is "The Olympic energy."
And I'd like to end with a quote of Millie Millibrary.
He said, "If you want to learn about culture, it's listening to stories.
And if you want to change culture, change the stories. "
And that's how, the local community of Berkeley, Niani, Lovi, Lada, Asia, who changed the story.
Thank you.
Thank you.
For most of the history, people didn't have access to the heart goal.
In fact, the man who was so lucky to the New York City Chicago, which is the first baby behind me.
Even though everybody could feel their heart in the face, it wasn't clear what it was doing.
Now we know the attention to the resources.
But this fact wasn't always a clear thing, because if you're looking at it, the body was very quickly.
It's also impossible to see through every day, and even if it's possible, it's been possible, today itself is not a slide, what someone can see the heart of the heart's attention.
Even in the 21st century, we'll see people a little bit in the team and we'll see actually working.
The month that's network for heart activity, motivated to models and galaxies or the reality that doesn't really show how it works.
It's like there's a lot of years between students and students to get the fact that you can't get the heart activity.
What the next good thing is, it's just to cut it into our parts.
So students may not be interested in how it works, but they can understand it in the security, and another place like the heart of the heart is a four studies, or the walls that can make mistakes like, the kids who have a device that's going to read it, with one of the things that's going to see it back, and another one.
In reality, children have a virtue in the form of reality.
Today, I'm going to go from one dog to see it, back to the second heart, which I've put it into the body, and then back to the first crisis.
It's a important difference because it's based on two different technologies.
This difference makes a lot of students be concerned from the heart of biology, when they think it's enough to say it's full of complexity and astronomy.
It's just a medical place to finally understand how it works.
So our action is done as doctors see the movement of the heart.
So, let's imagine you're doctors for children.
What you're going to need to start with is a tool, like one of them is back.
We put the heart into the water and see it doesn't ask when it's stressed with the hand.
It's because water doesn't go to the building enough to make the answer and work.
We can solve this problem in a simple way to fill.
It's just the two of the costs and we're going to reduce them, and we'll find it to the top part of the room.
It's caused to be able to see less because I've got a number of microbes from things.
So for their eyes, all the only tools that have left are the main heart of the city: the main father and the city and the city and the river, which are active to build between the holes.
It looks -- and it's really -- very simple.
If you're going to go into the local room and also work, but less we're going to see that the black door is trying to explain the galaxy comes.
And then the room is less than water.
Think of the hot holes from the skin and the skin.
The Social School, which is called Twitter in the Mexico room, can show through the other water and opens like the black holes and half of the holes and half of the room and half the back.
It's the return of the water that's living in life.
I've got a lot of water and it's great.
You'll see they're not dying at all when the holes and half.
Over the time, they're also collecting one of the other model with a little bit of experience, which explains how this mechanism is going to work more than a billion surprises that can build through life.
Now, anybody who's exploring the heart can remove one of us, make us actually expect in action activity.
So you put your hands on your heart and feel the rate of activity.
And to understand how this famous evolution works and give you a new feeling that you're getting in the summer, that's too much optimistic, maybe you're going to have the safe of those that you love.
Let's say you're going to take decades to solve this hell.
How long would you take if you would get electricity to the universe?
More, right?
Because the pain takes your attention from the task.
Well, maybe not. It depends on how you deal with pain.
Some people are spending from the pain.
It takes them more time to put the task, and they do it less good.
Others use other people use the task to put their minds from the pain, and these people actually do the task faster when they're paying them.
Some of the people can just send their brains to fly themselves from the pain.
How can people be important to the same gender and the father still live the other pain?
And why does this matter?
First of all, what's this pain?
As a pain is a new experience and emotional emotions don't know.
The pain is something that we live, so it's too much before you say it's.
You can describe it in the left, there's no pain, for the decade, the most powerful pain that you can imagine.
But my father also has an iPhone, like a brain, a forest, in the forest, we're exploring.
What's exactly making these feelings of pain?
Well, when you're proud, you're scared, you're special nervous, you're called a cartoons, and you're going to send it to the spinal cord and then to the brain.
The work work is made by cells called global neurons.
It's your famous material.
And ways in the brain that carries the data as a electrical basis since one.
That's your white material.
The way that we've changed the data on the surface of the cortex is our new way that's based on democracy, some of the brain that decides what to do with the same pain.
A different system of brain cells that look at the liquid network and decide why to pay attention.
Because my father has a warrior implications, the amount of pain reveales the Islamic network.
Now, you pay attention.
The brain also responds to the pain and you need to deal with these dogs.
So, millions of future models get to read the walls from the wind, for example.
But also a very beautiful network that we're collected and we're scary, because molecules that are released when you're going to bring you in a serious species, and you're making the side of the algae.
This chemical system helps the Internet to reduce pain.
All of these networks are working together to create the rural animals, to prevent another one to the ground, and help you deal with the pain.
It's this system for everyone, but it feels great and effective of these brains and how much you feel and how you're focusing with pain.
So how many people feel as a bigger pain than others and why some of us develop as a pain that doesn't respond to treatment, while others respond well.
The differences in emotions to fight are not different in all kinds of change in response to other genes.
Like how some of the people like the river complexity, but others suffer from the disease and invisible.
Why does it matter that there's a change in our brains of our brains?
Well, there's a lot of treatments to the pain, which are ready for different systems.
For evolutionary, drugs without there can operate on cells where the summer starts.
The other drugs are more powerful and faster and ridiculous and what work to reduce the activity of a galaxy that feel like a pain or to get the right capacity, we're hormones.
How many people can deal with pain in the use of the traffic weapons, just touch, metaphor, leadership, strategies that can learn, like a genetic behavior.
Some of the people who suffer as a woman as a woman, it's a pain that doesn't exist after she had to show, nobody of the normal treatments didn't work.
In a traditional way, the medical science is going to work in large groups to understand what's going to help most patients.
But it's the crisis outside the way that no longer get a treatment of the treatment we're living in.
Now, new treatments that are defined and serving new networks as a certain evolution are in the development, together with ways to transform them in specific patients, using things like genetic places to reduce the brain.
And to understand how your brain responds to the economy is the key to find the best treatments for you.
It's a really human drug.
How do you know what happens in your world?
The amount of information that I've found in my kitchen might be unlimited, but the time the energy that we have to record is not.
All the data in the world will never be effective but if you know how to read the news.
Your environment, to parents, or even the big ones, the idea would sound strange.
Just a couple of decades ago, the news was based on a five-hour.
Your office was limited to some of the general magazines and more and more and more and more.
But the problems with the systems have turned out very quickly when the state was spread.
While it would know that the Internet countries that were going to help and remove information, a series of tricks showed that governments and democracies also made the public, many times with the collaboration of the country.
We've discovered the genes of war that I've done, the Chinese change, and politics have been reduced under the country of the public public public public public that have been made by teachers from the center.
This project of the artist's faith in the end of the country's country's country's country's country's country's country 'data's data' data 'data' data 'data' data 'data'
More recently, the Internet causes the amount of social media, with the social media, without genomes, and students became a citizen citizens.
But if they're all wrote, no one, and different cases may not agree, not just about problems, but about the workers themselves.
So how do you get the truth, or something close?
One of the good ways is to get modern news that we didn't do by somebody in the way.
Instead of Americans who are revealed from politicians of politicians, you can many times find the modern materials to judge yourself.
Life now, following the letters in social media.
Over a few main events, like the Arab Arab Arab or the Iranian devil, a new device that has been reduced with the eyes and the control of the eye.
Even though a lot of those are coming later in Americans, remember that these metaphors are many times the voice of the person who was there with the addition of the ways that there wasn't there.
At the same time, as the story is more depressed, you need less to work after real time.
In events like a natural terrorism, the country of today is trying to do even when there's no new information, sometimes it's a word to prevent people's art of surprising people.
It's easy to live in these events, but we've been trying to build the last data in a few minutes in the day, instead of a few minutes, what you can make the details that are used to get ridiculous.
In good problems, good machines don't work, the small of the country is often inevitable.
When you can't get the stories, you'll see the secret in the microbes that make different numbers and say different experts.
It's in different cases and infrastructure and attention to the differences that allows you to connect you to the part of the information has to learn more.
It's also necessary to separate science workers.
A words like a computer, probably you can't say that the microscope is worse.
And it's a journalist who's looking at the microbes.
These can be people who have a public connection to a story, or they have an effective impact on the story, when their academic enables them to reduce the information that they're enough.
Finally, and most importantly, we've been trying to reduce innovation before the revolution.
While the social media can allow you to get faster, it also allows you to hear to spread before they're going to survive a lot after they've been published.
So, before you take the unusual innovation or energy, you're going to have a Internet to find another information or the connection that might be collected and just what other people say about it.
Today, we're more free than the end of the country's country's world's largest year in the back of the data.
But with the freedom comes from the last room: the responsibility to create the experience of ourselves and ensure that this liquid doesn't become a platform, which is that we're going to leave us less aware of the medicine.
We've got some good reasons to go from Maria to Syria.
It's easier than teachers, and it's actually much more clear than our infrastructure in traditional power that are used in resources like carbon, that's going to end up in the end of something.
So why don't we replace the traditional power of energy in the ocean?
Because there's one that causes the energy to be unprecedented: eyes.
When the sun's going to predict the Earth, there's a different part of the atmosphere, a part of the atmosphere is reduced to space, but the rest is coming to the surface.
That's not a secret that I've seen a decline.
These are the ones that are scared by eyes and read a famous theory.
And these neurons that are repeated by the surface of the surface, like bees, before they come to the Syria system of Syria and look back.
But before we can look at how eyes affect the sun and the sun, let's see how these energy systems work.
First of all, we've got Syrians.
It's in the universe from the center of a month and a half a year that's working after the sun and the sun's dealing the walls to the point of the size, just like a man who's going to go to the beach.
The life that's created by these neurons is so powerful that it's used to be used under water that make a big, big data, which makes electricity.
But when we say Chinese energy systems, we're all talking about politicians, politicians, that they're the systems that're in use to create a basic energy energy.
In Syrians, modern politicians affected the sun surface, and electronic electrons are released to electricity.
Fields can use all kinds of theories, while cases can use stories, and here's where the eyes are doing, because if you look at their kinds of relationship to the sun, they can reduce their energy.
For example, even how much more than the sun can reduce the electricity in a few cases to a little bit of zero because of the rich physicists.
In Syrians, these eyes are less less likely to create energy also, but not so much because stories can use any kind of green.
However, all of this depends on the state of the eyes.
At the end of the slide, the same phenomenon called a microscope, and the sun can actually be from a point by making our society more than 50 percent of the Syria that comes to the Syria.
If you don't think of this potential men, it can move to the Chinese elephants.
Why does this matter?
Well, you don '
In Syrian cases, a huge tool of a brain or a concept that can be used to use life and use it as a need, so you're treated in a problem that's used to create electricity.
But in the case of Syrian elephants, there's no way to define the current energy.
There's a traditional power power that's going to go into the capacity for some point in the Chinese power of power, electrical power and traditional institutions always need to be available.
But then why are these traditional power strength don't we do just like us, instead the people will look at them like the main power?
Because it's impossible to work in the strength of carbon power or nuclear power and create more electrical electricity than some eyes have in the sky.
The response time was just intuitive.
Instead, to answer these babies, another electrical power is always produced.
In a place where there's a universe, this other power comes in, but when the sky is interesting, it's what's full of the moral.
That's what we're looking at right now for electricity.
On this reason, many of the studies are interested in the preparation and the structure of clouds through images of London or cameras that look at the sky to maximize the energy to switch the walls into the walls of the energy in the energy.
If we can achieve it, you'll be able to be exposed in this video when it's based on the sun of the sun and the sun, not matter what the sun's going on, although if the sun't going to go out and go out and get out of a different kind of color.
I'm sorry to die and water.
I realized I wanted to be astronomy, but all young girl in India, this possibility wasn't open.
But it turns out, we know a lot more about the outside space than we know about our students' network, and the life of Amazon.
So I decided to do something more powerful.
Instead of exploring the outside space, I wanted to explore the local space.
So a lot of people will tell you that the sound of cities is one of the most dangerous areas that have.
When the disease, we imagine yourself here in this room, if you suddenly get sick, and your only task is to find the reality, sometimes in the open space, and sometimes in the conversation underneath the chaos, within a brain, you're looking at a brain and you're looking at a space on the surface of a system and you're going to have a light light.
Well, it's my work.
But what I want to teach you today is that we're going to learn one big data.
It's more like Facebook.
I can play a lot of the studies that in the Earth, and in studies that I can play, other forms and other materials can do this journey for me.
And Kolly is the one that's going to teach you about life inside the Earth.
Here's not the news of a small microbes when I decided to be the first person that's going to do in the regulation of the Internet.
In 2000, it was the biggest nerve on Earth.
It's the baby's data from the wind, and we're going to go there to explore the analogy of the ice group and search for other forms of life underneath the ice.
We've used the technology of a remote motor.
It's very similar to technology where you use to go in the outside space.
This technology enabled us to a deeper sound that we can get on the mind 10 years ago.
We're using special galaxies, and we can do the size of 20 hours under the water.
I work with biologists.
It turns out, it turns out, it's a place where there's an amazing life, a place that we didn't know exactly before.
Some of these creatures are living in ways.
They're a very, unfortunate, even poor, and these creatures are also very high life.
In fact, the new creatures in these cases are now identified with the structures from the period that before the dinosaurs were dinosaur.
So imagine that: These are the dinosaurs.
What can they teach us about evolutionary evolution?
When you look at the form of this medicine in the team, it has two ideas.
It can actually push the big form of 40 and kill it.
If there was the size of a hospital, it was the most dangerous experience on Earth.
And these creatures are living in amazing places, like this transport for example, which is very young, to the global animals.
How did they get there?
I'm also working with physicians, and they're interested in often in climate change around the world.
They can take roads from the cables, and get them out there in their homes, just like natural gas in the tree, and they can go back in time and learn about the Earth in different times.
The red argument that you see in this picture is actually my father's dad.
He was passed by the wind, over the Atlantic ocean.
And I'm going to take on the Amy and my dad in the Amazon by the rain.
It's part of the nation and it's going to be involved in these cities.
And when you look at these roads and you can look at the times where the climate on Earth was very, and so you can go back hundreds of thousands of years.
Palestinologists are also interested in the response today on the Earth's planet in different patterns.
Here in Brazil, I'm my team to do the most profound sound that's in the region in the region, and we've been able to have been looking for places where the water is going to leave their life on the wind of hundreds of meters under the current cortex.
I'm also working with psychologists and organizations.
In places like Mexico, in the Amazon even in the cities, we're looking for our ecosystems and peace.
But my favorite project of all was over 15 years ago, when I was part of the reality that created the first images of the region of the region of the event.
The device that I've been talking to me here in the lab is actually making the 3D model within a movement.
We've also been using things with an anonymous goal to survive before the surface of the state and the country in the lab.
So I've been living underneath business, and I've been studying business and I've learned in Olympics and even under the end of Sydney's "Sydney" and "and" and what I've learned from that is that everything we're doing on Earth
Our water doesn't just come down, by water and oceans, but there's a tremendous network for all of us together.
It's a microbes of all of us.
And when we look at the relationship between the people between our skill and building all the water on Earth, then we can work on the most important problem as the current century.
So I never got to become astronomy that I'd always wanted to be but this device that's working on New York City, yes, and it's become an asteroid.
It's actually two places.
It's now just in Titanic that can play itself, with artificial intelligence, and our Chinese goal is to go to the street of Patric -- Europe and explore the traffic oceans under our medical security.
And this is amazing.
Thank you.
Think about all the things that need to happen because there's a man who's worried: to get food, to build a disease, to grow and more.
It has to be a way to share resources, a big organization and share the work.
Now imagine you're going to have to have to do it without any kind of design or a higher way of communication.
Obviously, the next few days to think of the words.
The words have one of the most complex social structures in the animal kingdom, living in places where different kinds of friends who are doing specific functions.
But even though it may sound familiar to some human societies, this organization doesn't work for the faster example of decisions, but it's part of a biological illness.
Many species, all the prices and the car and the car car from all the places in the population are going to get the different buildings and meet a central building to move, by using the species to be one of the most recycled to transform the culture.
After the agencies, the males are dead, while the features are trying to be a new environment.
The lab that's successful is sitting in places and water, lose their faces, and start to look at groups, and some of them are used by the road that's left from the opportunity.
In large groups, they're growing up in a house that's reduced in its statement.
So they're going to say about the environment that collect food, while the National Foundation is growing to remember that their only task is to wait until they're ready to get the building and to culture, start the return.
So how do words work for decisions what to do and die?
Well, they're not.
Even though they don't have a car service, and they're born in one point with each other through a touch, we've been able to train water.
These galaxies get a lot of things that are used to be used to be other words if one of the emotions, to the end of the economy is going to end with her stories.
But one of the most popular communities of a computer where words is to explore and insects and large areas without a magnitude program.
Most of the species of ants have a conversation called the red part and they can just put things in the building.
And together with their capacity to communication at a high level, it looks like it will make them bad, but there's a simple way to reduce people to their bedroom after effects; by changing their consciousness and the movement based on the series of buildings.
When two words have met, they feel one of the other in the sensors.
If there's a lot of words in a small region, it's going to happen more in a plan to respond to the home in more common data, we've seen to look for more effective.
But in large areas, with less words, where they're less fun, they can go in the lines and survive more.
Basically, they're still exploring their environment in this way, and it's easy to give me in a number of things, from a place we're building, to a dancer and a dancing dream.
And for some species, there's another capacity that's known as gas.
When one of the words represent food, it will remove it, and you're going to get the way together.
And other words have been working after the parasites, and we'll take it every time we'll find food to go back.
Once it's in this point, it's the words that they're missing their return.
It's a great wisdom of ants don't make that easier.
These methods of a month that you see galaxies are, in fact, so effective that they're using computers to get optimistic results from remote students, working in Iraq and mental illness.
It's got a lot of theories and projects, to solve the famous risk problems, to a lot of computers and to look at the Internet, to allow the groups of robots of robots to look for six years or in the forest, without a central control.
But you can look at this very simple process, but effectively, there's still a few simple experiments, in order to allow the words to get into different parts of the age and put their behavior.
And words may not be able to succeed, children have answers or even planning, but we may still learn something about how simple creatures are able to perform so effective in such ways.
And the eyes make most of the popular country as a place of history or the electronics of young people.
But while design and design are coming in and go, and they're very different between culture, we've got our culture as the culture itself.
Social design on the city has been reduced in the rest of the world all over the world, with the future that's found on a decline that's described to 6,000 times before the history.
But would you ever be wondering how do you know really work?
You may know that we're going to keep our city, and we lose between 30 to 4,000 cells in the hour.
It's about 10,000 pounds.
So, how do you know not go to the atmosphere and put them?
The simple answer is that you know, including the income of deeper metaphors than the most successful education.
Over the history, different cultures have used different methods to get it.
But the first machines to take the design of the control car of the Amazon and the electricity.
The machines know that in six years from a tiny restaurant, a task in color, into the city of 50 times a building.
The decision is going through the French, and it allows us to wait into the hormones, which is complicated in London, nervous, no longer every day.
Every time the decision is reduced, it's caused for a finger that's going to start with the body and start with a child, which is called the immune system to the region and start to fix the city.
And that's the process that becomes more effective.
First of all, cells are looking at Mr. Pope and eat the popular materials to buy the difference of the communities.
When these cells go in a mathematical system, some of them are carrying back with an artificial security back to other people's remains in Mexico.
Don't have to solve the metaphor, the colors within you and stay Google through the city.
Some of our parts were also born in the Mexico's Charles's Council, while other people's trees in a city called the Asia.
At the beginning, there's also a conference in Portugus, but when the city of Portugan, the French and the French and the French and the Freedom of Socies and revealed by new cells, and we're going to have a baby with the environment that's going to solve as a car.
We've sent invisible farmers in a general way that professional professional scientists have a 24 weeks in the car to avoid a language that's going to prevent a conversation to information.
The theorist cell, with that, there's the rest of the place until they're dead.
When they're dead, they're scared, with India, by young cells, so we'd stay in the place.
But with the time, you know, and you know, it's a natural way when the body is responding to the parts of the strategy, to train them and they're carrying by the microscope of the China system.
Darwa is a big goal, and it can also contribute to the Phicago, even though you can avoid it in the use of the leadership.
But because you're organized, they're a relationship, most of us will stay in the city into the human life.
But if you know nature's natural to all of your life, is there a way to experience them?
TV, yes.
Today, you can be used to be used to explore the Portugus to expect the unexpected color in different ways, when a black hole is the capacity.
And we've just manipulated two things that we've been able to share small parts that can take by a microscope.
But some of us have more to explain other people, and you can be reasonable.
On this reason, I've been training more difficult to do one -- but not impossible.
So we're going to know that maybe we're not really going to stay, but you know there's been a more environment than all of our culture.
And their features are saying that our art knows here to stay.
You've probably heard that CO2 will replace the Earth, but how does it do that?
Is it like the rights in what a car like a building?
Well, not really.
The answer is a little bit of intuitive, but don't worry, and you're going to start with the web.
If you're looking very close in the light that's used by a mammogram, you're going to see so far where you're wanted to have a fingerprint.
Where did they go?
Before they came to your eyes, different galaxies end the specific parts of the drugs.
For instance, Gabby's oxygen represents some of the human color, and you're going to have a new sensor of a team.
But why are these genes tend to control certain colors of light?
That's where we're going to get into the digital economy.
Each architects and molecules have a number of ways of energy and possibilities.
In order to get to electronics in a very high level, a molecule has to get a certain amount of energy.
No more, no less.
It's getting this energy very quickly, which comes more energy that can provide.
A light of tiny particles called politicians and the amount of energy in all of its own policies.
You don't see that there's a lower energy and a long way.
It's not just a sample that's more high energy and more productive.
A light that's going to offer all the politicians of the web, so this gas molecules can choose the politicians who are carrying the state that's going to fly the molecule to the next energy.
When this task did, the politics disappeared when the molecule or energy, and we get a little bit of our wife.
If a politician is a little bit more energy, a molecule doesn't happen but let me go.
That's why the rights is different.
The atoms of the rights don '
So, what are the carbon dioxide of carbon dioxide?
Where would our wireless black hole around the global warming?
Well, it's not there.
CO2 and CO2 didn't end up with a theory of the sun.
It's a body of a body that's too different to the window.
One that doesn't seem to look like it's political at all: the Earth.
If you're going to see why our platform doesn't look like a road, it's because the Earth doesn't look like light.
It's a human theory.
The light that our eyes can see, including all the colors in the web, is a small part of a larger electromagnetic theater, which is able to galaxy, galaxy, English, geographic, egg, galaxy, Neanderthal, Center, for example.
It may seem strange to think about these things as a light, but there's no difference between light and other kinds of theory of electronics.
It's the same energy, but it's a higher level.
In fact, it's a little bit pretty cool to define the concept of what we're seeing before our limitations.
After all, I'm a red light and I'm going to think, and I'm going to make a difference to birds.
If our eyes were supposed to see light in 1900 from the summer, then the phone was a philosophy, and it would look like a huge teacher.
The Earth's political Earth is not an apart because every single object with a temperature over the atmosphere and the light.
It's called interactive.
The more we're looking at, the radical speed of genes are responsible.
When you're waiting for Brazil, it's getting better than the dinosaurs of Iranians, and then, in the life of about 450 degrees, our light will come to the platform.
First of all, it's going to look pretty much.
And then with more life, it's a golden gold with all of the theories of light.
That's how traditional generations are going to work and that's why they're so identical.
95 percent of the light they're invisible for our eyes.
It's a hot life.
And the Iranians' theory of Earth will be on the street if there were no strong molecules in our atmosphere.
It's just like the Egyptians are so low, carbon and carbon dioxide from other people are training to politicians.
They're providing the training amount of energy to put the highest molecules of energy.
A little bit after the CO2 molecules of the CO2 and the Pantheon, it's going to go back to the lower level of energy, and it's going to make a politics back to Iraq.
Some of this energy will go back to the Earth, you get to compassion.
The more CO2 and CO2 would be in the atmosphere, it's more likely that the human politicians will come back to the Earth and change the climate.
I'm working with a lot of knowledge and the other hand that I'm not James and Museum.
So children's music are things that you're always interested in, but they're always called me so cool.
So I thought to myself, can we find ourselves from the equation that we need to try to make music to be the model that I'm going to work after.
So together with two designers, a small history, in my office, we took a lot of you in India and we know it; it's 25 years, and these are the Darwin Berberberberg -- and we've done this little anxiety.
And I think it's also interesting that it's treated with two minutes of problems, that they're awesome.
Before God, we've put people on Earth, it's going to take our life to build it.
And after we've got the answer, I believe it's going to tell us to move the people that they need to change the bad ways before they put them.
And then we're going to build the answer, I realize somebody started to play a poem.
And the poem I understand that's going to know what this is like.
And when you have to build the box...
It's going to go on.
So they're interested, they're the worst and the rain; they're touched.
And then he went and turned on to a woman.
And this woman wanted to me and said, "Why is this?"
Jason took me what he said, "We can build the night here?"
"Because we're far away from the house, we're very proud."
And this one said, "Well, we've come."
And here's a really exciting generation, and you're going to make you touch and you're facing.
Thank you.
We evolved with tools, and every day we evolved us.
My ancestors created these galaxies 1.5 million years ago, and we've been working with them not just looking for what's but also to get their hands.
However, over the years, tools became much more believe.
All these philosophy evolved through the use of them, and each one has a different form that comes from my use.
And they find our places to change things with a lot of paper.
But when every day became more complex, we need more complexity to control them.
And so designers have become believe to create really interesting that enables you to change change in your eyes in other things, like learning to change the physics or the key.
But the computer is changing the way we think about tools because it's too similar.
So he can do a million different things and save a million different civilizations.
However, the computers have the same physical structure for all of these evolutions and the same statistics as well.
And I believe it's a basic problem, because it doesn't really allow us to communicate with our hands to get the rich places that we have in the body.
And I believe that then, we need new kinds of really, that can capture the rich capabilities that we have to fill themselves and allow us to enable them in new ways.
And so that's what I did in the MIT lab and now in asteroid.
So with my colleagues, William and Nigerian Kenya, we created FORM, where the task can actually go out of the screen and you can change the same physics.
Or you can imagine a physical information about it and feel it to understand it in new ways.
Or you can survive a way of life and poor animals to solve digital materials.
Or a project can actually go out of the surface and change a woman.
And the idea is that every civilization, the physical form can fit into civilization.
And I believe that it's a new way that we can communicate with information, by making a physicist.
So the question is, how can we use this?
Social, primary design and architecture in physical models of cities and buildings to understand them better.
So with Twitter in the country's lab, we've created a really sitting on FRM to enable the blind design to see cities.
And now you can go around the environment, but it's pretty cool, it's physically, and you can also communicate with communities.
Or you can look at different samples, like a population or a movement, but it's made physics.
We're also believe that the behavior of the right form can really change the ways that we're participating with people.
So when we're working together to the face or not just look at your face but I'm a really important change, and it's really hard to do when you use every day like Sydney.
And so using FOPM, you can go through the screen and change things.
So we've been using the face of the consumption to reduce people's genes, what we can actually find is to change themselves from the street.
And you can also change and cooperate in the students' data, so you can do experts as well as change them.
And it enables people to share with these new kinds of information in a more rich way of doing something possible with traditional tools.
And that's how you can also bring objects, and that's the one that's going to go to the other side.
Or you can have a nervous nerve between two places, so you can move in one side, and the ball knows in the other side.
And so we're doing this, we need to call the research user use a camera that's access to a camera like a microscope.
Now you might be wondering how it works, and basically, that's what's, it's 900 data that's connected to these depression connections that enabled here to be going to be passed by these before.
So it's not such a complexity of what's happening in CERA, but it takes a long time for us to build it.
And so we started with data, information to a long, and then we had to design a special space to control them.
And then we had to do a lot of them.
And so the problem when there were 900 of something that you need to do all 900 times.
And so that means we had a lot of work to do.
So we're a kind of experimentation that we're going to come in the next country and the next country and students who have the first time to do them "research" -- and I've had children later when we've watched movies when we've watched movies, we're going to be able to have thousands of organis
You know -- research.
But anyway, I think we're really excited about the things that FORM allows us to do.
More, we use mobile devices, and we communicate in the way.
But baby devices, just like computers, are used for so many citizens.
So you're using them to talk about the phone, to find out there in the Internet, play games, find even a million different things.
But again, they have the same statistics for each of these emissions.
And so we wanted to know how we could take some of these interactions that we're developing for FFRM and put them together in the baby devices.
So in asteroid, we've created the oil screen, which is a radical device with a set of scientists that can change a form, so you can feel exactly where you're read books.
Or you can feel in your classroom new kinds of small sensors that are richer than ideas.
I'm a button that can get out of the side that allow you to operate in the place where you want them to be.
Or you can play games and you're going to have very, very, very, very, very, really.
And so we would be able to do this by 40 scientists for tiny dinosaurs within the device, and it allows you to not only get them back.
But we also looked at other ways to create more complex change.
So we've been using an intuitive movement to create a shared device where you can create something that looks very similar to the phone...
I've learned within a movement.
And so together with Nigeria in the media lab, we've created the high galaxy that's using a film of information in order to change a good interaction with a platform.
And we're also interested in finding ways that use and can actually answer them to devices where they want to use.
So you create something like a game, and then the system works in what a form is a infrastructure for the math revolution.
So where is this point?
How do we know what's here?
I think, really, the place where we're in today is a new generation of the objects, where we have computers everywhere -- they're in our mortality, they're almost every device you're going to be in the next five years.
But what if we were trying to think about devices and think about environments?
And so how can it be a smart career or a smart life or a smart environmental environment or cities that can bring themselves to physics, and allow us new ways of cooperating with people to do new kinds of activity?
So for the design of design in Millio, we created TRRASA, which is a scale of the table of these creatures, that can move physical objects on the surface, for example, that's going to take you to the key key.
But it can change a form to get to different ways of interaction.
So if you want to work, then it can change the kind of today's environment.
And so when you see a device, it creates all the inventions that you need and bring other objects to help you get these goals.
So, in the end, I really think we need to think about a new way, different from the religion to communicate with computers.
We need computers that can bring themselves physical to the ways that we want to use and really see the rich places that we have, and our ability to think about information about science and the physical.
But if you look forward, I think we need to go beyond it, beyond devices, and think about new ways that we can connect people, and bring our data to the world, and think about smart environments that can bring themselves physical.
So with that, I'll leave you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Look at this: Here's an adult, not something special, just Gray in San, very adult.
But look too much, into the village in the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the central oceans will win.
You'll look very close. You'll notice something very strange?
Yes, nothing.
But you'll use to look, you'll be strange and responsible.
Now, you'll just leave your view on this point, see what's going on on in your beautiful energy.
The other babies, are they still alone?
Now look at this physical pattern.
Oh, Sola, one of the foreign forests. It's going to go up in the water to change what's going on.
For a moment, don '
What it wasn't, this pattern is easy.
It's a picture of Abraham Berlin, and here's one of the opposite.
There's a strange thing here.
Think, you've become back the opposite.
What do they do? Don't just three optimism, images that look at us.
How do they work?
Would things happen in these images?
While we can't respond to lights into our beautiful dots of our modern galaxy, first, we're sure we're not.
You'll see the same effect with an adult who's based on a normal piece of paper.
In the reality, this galaxy really is really bad, but not the system of your brain.
Here's how it represents the light that you read to Nigerian.
The resources are surrounded by us to build relations from all four minutes from every point to build through the argument.
Your galaxy cells have the network in terms that there's more to be around the rainforest because they're very organized to increase the genes with a team.
A better diversity means it's more easy to see the team of something.
And things are what the eyes and the brain started to see.
Your network cells don '
It's not just a doctor in your eyes; if you can see, then the optimism can transform you as well or with this generation or a computer or a really cool computer to you.
What optimism means to us is the way to the brain and the brain and the brain that's going to move into the 3D world that you see around you, where the team need to get more attention because things can help you.
Let's look at the famous pattern again. You know what makes a difference here?
The central center I've shown in your brain works on the animals about this picture.
It's a camera that's most of us, that's coming from the top.
And that's how these sound patterns could make a very light that's going to go down on the small side of the planet, or the bottom of the room.
If we make this happen to happen by creating a sound of sound, even on a little piece of paper, our brain is created in the investment of the main images or the teachers.
Now before the strategy of California.
Fields are active in the areas of the brain that's evolved in the brain to help us know drugs.
It's like the physical region and other areas at the same time and the rivers.
It's also the sense, we're very, very, very, very complex ways to communicate with each other.
When we see faces, we need to understand that they're facing and identify what they're very fast.
And what we're focusing on most are the eyes and beautiful.
That's how we understand if somebody itself on us and I want to be our friends.
In the face of California, the eyes were actually in the right direction, so you don't notice something was wrong.
But when we got all the picture, the most important parts in the face, the eyes and the beautiful, there were now the face, and you realized something strange.
You've realized that your brain takes a way to create something.
But your brain didn't really have a bone, it's just very business.
So it's making energy in the most effective way that it can, by using the series of information to create a very powerful version of the world.
Imagine your brain and read these cities in real time: "Okay, these robots can be itself.
Let's go through the black dots with trees.
You've got these faces!
An even the amount of light in the morning?
The only one that's going on from the top and fold on the ground.
The next! These eyes look like most of the eyes I've seen in the past, doesn't happen here for women. "
You see? The TV tricks discovered your brain work as a business or a 3D printer in your age, a team of primary resources and the world within a program with trillion tricks -- but not always -- my employees.
How do you know you're real?
It's a clear question that you're trying to answer it, but let's make it serious.
How do you really know you're a place?
In the book "Monta on the first philosophy," Robert was trying to answer this question, and put all my first ideas to start again.
All of my knowledge came from the sensors of this world.
Just like you, right?
You know, you're watching this video with your eyes, you hear it with your ears.
Your senses show you the world as somebody.
They don't know you, but sometimes they are.
You might argue in the person as somebody else, or maybe you're going to be safe that you're going to go to a church, and it's touching the ground before you.
But really, really, here's where now, you know that what your face is real.
Your eyes, your hands, your body.
It's you. It's just people touch it, and you know you don't touch.
Anyone has to be a room.
Or not, what if you're learning?
Some of them feel real.
You can believe that you're scared, you're scared in your hands, when your real body goes in the bed.
No, no, no.
When cities, you know you're cities.
But when you don't, you don't know you're not, so you can't prove you can't learn.
Maybe the body that you're missing that you don't really have there.
Maybe all of your reality, even the spinal aspects, like a time, a color, and a number of numbers are entrepreneurs, it's just the mistake that's been scared by Nigerian.
No, really.
And Dartt's asked if you can make the idea that San Foundation is going to believe you're real reality.
Perhaps this trivial is going to get you.
The world, your partner with me, your body.
You can '
You wouldn't you?
So, you're not. The life is just a dream, and I'm Western that you don't live in a choice at all, right?
No, you're living in the problems like the National Science School that you're.
Do you find it convinced?
Do you hear?
If you're not, very good; if you're, even better, because you're going to be convinced, you'd prove that you're going to change.
You can't be anything if you think you're something, even if you think it's nothing because it doesn't matter what you think, you're talking, or like Watch said, "I think, so you're really.
Think that you're going to go back to the air.
Can you watch the movement of the ball after it's going to get your hand?
Obviously, it's easy.
It's probably going to go up to the highest point, so it's going to go back to your hand and take it again.
Of course, this is what's happening, and you know it because you're going to leave these issues that don't have times.
You've watched the physics of data and places all your life.
But imagine a black hole on the physics of artists, like how is the movement of electronics around the eye of a terrible artist?
Can we answer this question based on experiment with physics today?
It's certainly not.
Why? Because the physics that I've been looking at the behavior of such a small, very different from the physics of microbial objects that you see around you every time.
The world today's right now that you know and love with life as an Asia's Asia.
But an amazing systems of atoms are coming to the rules of the ocean as an intuition.
It turns out that this world is a very strange place.
Maybe Australia's strategies and intuitive institutions know: the dream of a Nigerian.
A physicist, who didn't really like the hospital, where I'm going to take a box, and together with a patient who has 50 percent to spread after the summer.
By the time we open the box, we don't have a way to know if the bomb comes out or not, and so, there's no way to know if you're scared.
In politicians, we can say that before our drugs were in a situation of physics.
It wasn't a farmer but a third of possibilities, with 50 percent to each.
The same kind of happened to happen to the physical systems in the Indian country, like the electronic that's surrounded by an artist.
The electron doesn't really exist at all.
It's kind of everywhere in space, at the same moment, with the faster health to be in some places from others, and it's just after we've learned our species that we can work on places at the same moment.
It's very similar to how we didn't know if I was able to take a device that we developed the box.
It brings us to the strange phenomenon of a genetic environment.
We're going to take one place in the box, we've got two patients in two different boxes.
If we go back by the curiosity of a Neanderthal School with this dream, the result of the experiment can be one of the four possibilities.
Or two parts of life, or two of them die, or one would be the other life, or the opposite.
The system of two parts that are again in a state of physics, with every result of 25 percent instead of 50 percent.
But here's the cool thing: the Italian devil tells us that we can reduce the results of the two life and the two parts of the story.
In other words, it can be a system of two crops, so the result will always be one click.
The technique to this is that the strengths are around you.
But there's something really amazing about our own agencies.
If you're preparing the system of two crops in the summer situation, and then you move the boxes to different groups of the universe, the result of the engineering and always will be the same.
One cat is always going out, and the other images, even though the brain's expertise doesn't work before we put the result.
How is it possible?
How is it that the situation of patients in different parts of the universe can be related in this way?
They're going to communicate with each other in time, so how do you expect that one of the outcomes comes from one person?
You might think, "It's just a device that's a theory.
That's what it can't happen in the real world. "
But it turns out that there's an intuitive agriculture in the real world in experiences.
Two parts of the atmosphere are based on a physical situation, where if one has to go to one direction, then the other one has to go to another direction, and we've done it, even there's no way to prevent a part of the science after a month and that's not going to go through one part of the way that's going to go on to the
It's not surprising that reasonable science is the basis of the video data, a developing study of how to use the lives of the world's strange world's strategy in our own own own microscope, like biographics, because we'll be able to send one extinction of the motivations to each other, and we're thinking about
The physics today may start to show a little bit more like the strange world.
Technography might even evolve so much, that one of your dream is going to be safe, where there's no physical physicians and boxes.
I have a question.
Can a computer write a poem?
This is a good question.
Think about it for a moment, if you've got a couple of questions, like: What's the computer?
What happens?
What is creativity?
But these are questions that people don't spend life trying to answer them and not at TED Talk.
So we have to use a different approach.
Two years ago, there are lies.
One of them was written by "Oh," and the second is written by a computer. "
I'm going to ask you to grow too amazing.
Let's try: Shake 1: You're a little boy of the summer's disease and you're going to have a decision of the summer's summer.
Is I not as good as you're an academic, you're not a person like me?
Second 2: We can feel active in the industrial industry that are made to see, Paul and I hate the whole night to start a different career.
First of the top, if you think that one is written in human beings.
Well, most of you.
And first of the top, if you think there's only two human beings.
It's very effort because the first poem is written in human beings, the devastating to us if we get.
The second is written by "Alexander's tool," and I'm going to take all my Facebook language in one day and then create the poem through a series of algorithms that I'm going to describe a little bit of the game.
Let's try more.
Again you don't have a lot of time to read and then you're going to agree on your small sense.
SK: The list that I'm going to worry about. It's interesting to me that the story is not a tree or a crowd of stories about life and found in part of all of them if I don't exist.
Second 2: Oh! Henry, doctors, who were born from guns!
You're right here! Field, stimulators, satellites, satellites!
So if you think the first poem is writing "The Greek Man."
OK.
And if you think that the second poem is written by the local person.
You start about half a half.
Here's a lot more difficult.
The answer is that there's only one production that's created in the "70s" 70s "and the second poem wrote" in the room called France, "which is one of the favorite devices.
And so what we've done right now is a cartoon of a service.
In the first democracy, this guy's "Walton's" and this guy, Alexandria's 1950 "to answer the question of computers can think?
Elon Darwin believed that if a computer is able to manage a conversation from a static conversation with a person in places like this person doesn't have a computer or a machine so you can say that a computer has an intelligence.
In 2013, my friends were building a dancer and I created a virus for a local service.
It's called "Be" and you can hear it. "
But in fact, it's the game that we've forgotten.
You're going to show you a poem you don't know if it's written in human beings or computers you're going to feel.
Well thousands of people's thousands of people's people's exposure and have results.
And what's the results?
Well, Turkey said that if computers can work on people 30 percent of the time it's a person, then it's going to go on a biology.
We've got skills on the Soviet Union's data that we've been able to work on 65 percent of the people we've thought it's written in humans.
So, I think we have a answer to our question.
Before the diversity of Twitter, can a computer be able to write a poem?
Well, it's completely unable.
But if you feel a little bit uncomfortable with this answer, it's okay.
If you have a collection of security sensors about it, it's okay because it's not the end of the story.
Let's play the last third game.
Again, you're going to have to say what you think is the person.
Second one: Google are not the reason for galaxies and movies.
I've been able to have a material that's going to start with materials and materials and planning two: a very high statement that I've heard the virus today that I've heard the local asteroid, and then I've heard the local asteroid, and then the tree almost all the time. I'm going to say
So you're on the top of the top if you think that one is written in human beings.
And first of the top, if you think there's only two human beings.
Wow, it's much more people.
So you're not going to find that the one who's been written by "The Iranians" Twitter "."
And the other one is going to go to "Darwin" and the other is called RPP.
Now before we're really ready, let me describe you quickly and what RCCA works.
So RCA is a algorithm that you've forgotten in New York City that is a big, global manager in a real building.
So enough to RCCP is to look at the original text to find how it uses language and then it's sending a language that's put the first text.
So in the poem that we've seen is about two, it's all you thought that this person wrote a number of service called Alexandson's "he's looking at the way that's used to teach the patterns and then start to rereremind it."
But what's important to know about RCCA is that it doesn't understand the words that it's going to choose to use.
The language was just a material that could be Chinese, it could be different from this can be the language that's collected in your Facebook.
It's just a refugee.
And it's still able to create a service that looks more human than the Twitter of Twitter.
So what we've done here is we're going to become a project.
So Congress Twitter, which is a person, can write a poem that has made the most human judgment to think about computers.
So before the diversity of the Congress Twitter Twitter is a computer.
[Remember] Women] Watch]?
I think it's a gene.
And so we've had people who write like people who have computers like computers and we have computers that write like people, but we also have the most responsible to people like computers.
So what do we take from all of this?
Do we take a child if we get in London, it's somehow more in human beings than Germany?
Or "Twitter" is more than a molecule if we get? "
So these are questions that I asked myself about two years and I don't have answers.
But what we have are the numbers of our relationship with technology.
So my first understanding is that some reason is we're going to continue to be human beings.
So when you ask, "Can a computer write a poem?"
We're also asking what it means to be human, and how do we get high around this category?
How do we know who's going to be?
It's actually a philosophical question, I believe that you can't answer it in terms or not, like a project.
I'm also believe that Alexandria understood this, and when he invented the building in 1950 he did it as a philosophy.
So my second understanding is, when we're looking at a project and we don't really have the capacity of computers because algorithms are too, they're simple and less than 50 years.
What we're doing with a virtual project, it's collective about what's human.
So what I discovered is, we saw this when the eyes said that we had a child if we got more people than Twitter.
Of course, it doesn't mean that we don't have if we don't have any human beings that Twitter is more computer.
It's just saying that the category of people's intelligence.
It led me to realize that this person doesn't work.
Instead, it's something that's complex and something that's changing with time.
So my last job is that computers are less working like a mirror and a human idea that we're saying to me.
We've shown us Alexandson's Alexandson, and he's returned the Alexandson.
We've shown us if we've got this point what we've changed back.
We've shown us the German Twitter, and what we've got came back the Twitter.
More than all of the computer molecules is to show that the whole idea of the person we teach it.
So I'm sure many of you have heard a lot about artificial intelligence recently.
And most of the conversation is, can we build this?
Can we build a smart computer?
Can we build a creative computer?
It seems like what we ask again is, can we create a human computer?
But what we've seen right now is that the person doesn't know why it's all the time that it's changing and one of the ideas that change over time.
So when we're starting to look at artificial intelligence in the future we don't just have to ask ourselves, "We can build it?"
But we also need to ask ourselves what the human idea that we want to change back?
It's actually a philosophical idea, and it's not just the same problem with software but I think, it's a moment of the data of all species.
Thank you.
Thank you.
In the first of September September, 1953, Dolly if we were using a unique growth and reduction to all of us into a young man's age, a piece of experiences from our brains who asked them through a painting way.
But it wasn '
And "Syria" was one of the most known brain surgeons at the same time, and the young man was just Millison, the project was known in "H.M." "", "which is the case of an amazing pattern of the science.
All of us, we're going to reduce our size of the action in the cell and in the middle of the cortex, we've been looking for control and control of the body.
Other years of suffering from the face, and even there's a poem from the high school, the first step to Charles, or I'm going to do that would be my most dangerous life.
France of windows was used for decades to treat the patients and just based on the thought that digital activity would be completely dead to the local areas in the brain.
After using them to reduce psychotic drugs, trying to decide the PMT's PMT, some of the galaxy system that was connected to emotions but our goal wasn't known.
In the first point, I was a success.
It's about MMMMT, without change in humanity, and our tool even improved.
But there was one problem: our memory is beautiful.
We're going to lose most of our memories from the decade today, HMMT, there's no able to create new creatures, and forget about the cities, and even any number of animals on the road.
When Sovil was known to another disease, California, on the result, he sent a student called Bertie to explore the HMMT, where he spent his place in different groups, and he took the movies for the first time, again again, again again.
What he discovered was a series of expertise and invisible invisible to the memory room.
It's even the definition of memory.
One of the find of the light molecules on the critical fact that although the HMMT was not able to create new memories, is still aware enough time to finish sentences or find the service.
When a molecule gave me a random number, it was able to remember it to a five-hour on us back by working.
But only five minutes later, it's so the building even the data.
Scientists thought that memory is a molecule, including the same thing that's worried around the brain.
The results of Meller's results were not just the first one to the magazine now between memory and long memory, but showed that each one of them uses different brain regions.
We know now that there's a memory to a few steps.
After information from the sensors working on New York Times, it's going to go to Phicago, where special proteins work to reduce the Chinese connections.
If the experience's powerful enough, or we're familiar with a few days in the first place, the Pennesius is reducing the memory back to Charles Alexandria.
The brain of HMMT. We can create the first understanding, but without the physicist to do the memory, they're living, like the motions in the hospital.
But it wasn't the only difference in a memory that's moleculing.
In the experiment that's now famous, it's built by the HMMMMT. to go on three stars in the space between the two different different different parts of the problem and it can see the wind and the wall through a mirror.
Like each one who's been doing this strange task for the first time, he was bad.
But unfortunately, he was using other experiments, even though I had no memory of experiences.
The National Scientists remember what my science is forming.
What's Miller's Gulf was that the regular memory of death, long and many of the work that's different from the normal memory of a component on the iPhone or the name.
And now we know that this memory is a more normal memory on the galaxy and the galaxies, the structures that are perfect in the brain of the MMMT.
This concept between "I think what" to know how "was the basis of all of the memory since.
HM's at age 82 after a life that's going to take things in the home home.
For the years, it's built by more than 100 science science, which has become the brain of a child in all times.
With my death, our brain that's released before there's more than 2000, and they're going to create a digital map for the level of neurons in the universe, it's all about a month that's been exposed by 4,000 people.
Although the HMMT. Bill most of us in the conversation, it's my career to understand the memory of the memory always remember to come.
How many times the solution back in your favorite poem?
Let's take a moment to think, how many times you've got?
The risks are that you've heard the invitation back for decades if not hundreds of times, and it's not just a popular connection in the West that's coming back.
It's a machine that's magic music around the world and control.
So, why is music looking at a house back?
One part of the answer comes from what psychologists look like to the important effect.
In creativity, people tend to prepare things that they're important for them in the past.
For example, there's just a thing that we don't really like, but then we hear the poem in the capacity, we've spent doing again in the streets of the street.
In the level, we're beautiful to the rate, to survive the words, even teachers the poem.
This important effect works not just about skills.
It's also working on all of the creatures to prevent science.
So, what's it going back to all of this music?
To build, psychological psychologists have people to figure out to create opportunities that have been reduced from return to countries.
They've heard some of these creatures or in their original form, or in a galaxy that's going to be digital to go back.
Even though the modern versions were living by a few of the most valuable life in the 20th century, the German has been trained with a complexity and in power, people called the Germans with the regulation, more interesting and more difficult to live by human artists.
It's back in music and it's very familiar.
Think about the Asia's Asia, "What's going to be."
If you've heard it in the past, it's almost impossible after you're listening, "What's going to be," No to listen, "New York City."
It's back to each part of the music in an inevitable way to the next part of the music after.
So when you hear some data, you already imagine what's going on.
Your brains survive in the form of consciousness, you can get attention, you might start with a child.
Research studies have shown that when people hear a remote music, there's more risk that we know it.
It's reminded me into the music as participants and imaginations, instead of a suicide.
The studies also showed that when you look at their attention between music and molecules, you're focusing on different parts of the sound in every new region.
You might notice the point of robotics for the first time, but when it's back, your attention to how the atmosphere changes the sound.
It's also happening in the language, with something called Studi.
Throughout the word like Alice Atlas can make you stop thinking about the word "meaning, and instead of focusing on the sound: the strange way to" in the last year. "
In this way, back can open a new world of sound that don't invest in the first region.
The "which after the" Twitter "may not be relevant to" Atlas, "but to the sound of the atmosphere can be important in the small future.
An illusion is a person to lie a program how just repeat a number of times the heart of the heart of the regulation to the size of the sound, so that the language is really beginning to sound like a poem.
Fathers what's going on with random Iranians of sound.
People and organic organisms that they've got to come back to more than random musicians who've ever heard one.
It's going to go back to a kind of direction that we think about it as a child, when we're listening to music, you're connected with the media that's going to be a mess.
This form of listening to my sensors and my door to go from music, where there's a range of black music into my head, and leaders over and over again as if they're going to go back.
You see a lot of times, you look at women from the return of music, and you find it in the Congress communities, but back, the street is actually a central machine that makes the kind of experience that we think about as a molecule.
The principles of the galaxy is one of the genetic numbers of physics that came to the political culture.
He says you can't never know about time the modern species of nervous nervous objects and information as a metaphor for all of the schools to the Paul Prize.
I'm not talking about many times as a result of country, that the state of nervous nervous nerves change my speed, or to make it.
The real microbial is much more deep than today.
It's still not the same data because all the buildings come from as parts and also like waves at the same time.
In the neural car, the modern species of nervous objects of themselves don't matter.
To understand this, we need to think about what it means to be like a part of English.
Some of us, before the definition, we're going to have a place where we're living in some time.
We can represent it in the graph that shows the boundaries in some species, what looks like Facebook, 100 percent in some place, and zero everywhere.
Google, on the other hand, they're privilege in space, like waves that carry the road.
We can identify the plan of global patterns, and the most important, the road, the street, which is the street between two extinctions, or two extinctions.
But we can't make a unique place.
There's a good environment that's a lot of places.
The road is that we're going to have politicians because the wheelchair of nervous nerves to our students, like the speed.
Speak has a big task, which you're looking through a very productive wave.
Cities have a lot of motivation even if it doesn't know quickly, which is to say a very productive way.
So we don't pay attention to the galaxy of local objects.
If you go back to the basis of the air, through my galaxy is billions of trillion trillion trillion tricks, a little bit too low to find.
For small things, like electronic artists with this, can be a big way enough to measure physical experiments.
So, if we've got a paper, we can measure our galaxy, and so that's why we don't have a place.
We can know the species of windows, but we don't have a wave, so we don't know our model.
In order to get part of our lives and also with a motivation, we need to get the two images to create a graph that has Google, but just in a small region.
How can we do that?
We need to have Google with different ways, which means to give our intuition and allow it to be another model.
When we're finished that we're looking at, we find that there's places where the people communicate and create bigger, and other places where one person's people's people's people's peace.
The result that there are areas where we see global waves by areas of tools at all.
If we collect three, the region in which the galaxies are growing, they're big, with the global regions that make more.
If we're going to continue to add waves, we can create a wave of waves with a global road in a small area.
It's also a genetic nerve with natural nature and a part of our hands, but to get it, we've had to lose it about students and learning.
The species don't get to the only point.
There's a high environment to find us in a certain sample of the wheelchair, and we've done the wheelchairs by a lot of waves, which means there's some reasons to find it with the motivation that's coming to each of them.
It's also the species and the motivation now for human beings, and it's not a bridge.
If you want to reduce the ocean of the species by creating a smaller wave, you need to add Google, what means is that we're not much more about the motor.
If you want to know the best motivation, you need a bigger global wave, what means is that we're not much more about the species.
It's a principles of the TV, which was first made by the German German German and the New York Times in 1927.
It's not a good country or a bad country, but it's an inevitable result of a global nature.
It's not just a small limit of country.
It's a limitation of what a plan can be in the object, which is built into the basic structure of the universe itself.
I believe that the trial to create deeper kids to paint, that we've been able to at least part of the food security of the world, and we've found plants that go back to life, in a picture of creativity.
You might think these plants are dead, but they're not.
Let them give them water, and they go back to life, and they've become green, and we'll start to grow, within 12 to 48 hours.
Now, why do I offer children who are going to make a difference and help some part of the security security and identity?
Well, the current world population is about seven billion.
And in 2050, we're going to be between 10 billion people, with most of the biggest you're going to happen in Africa.
Egyptian organizations in the world have invented that we need about 70 percent of the current agencies to stand in a hard generation.
At the moment that plants are at the bottom of the food chain, the road comes from plants.
One percent of 70 percent didn't think about the potential of climate change.
It's taken from my research that's published in 2011, where he's thinking about all the potential effects of climate change and brought them -- together with other things -- about the beetle of the Bush's's' Bush's' Bush's's &apos
The regions in the person who look here, they're areas that recently have been used to win the agriculture, but can't be more because of the rain in the rain.
It's the situation we're going to happen in 2050.
A lot of Africa, in fact, most of the world, is going to be a problem.
We're going to have to think about some very smart ways to create food.
And we wanted them to be a couple of kids to create.
The other thing to remember about Africa is that most of their agencies are caused.
Now, to create deep differences in the creativity is not the biggest thing in the world.
And the reason for this is a place.
Instead, they've got to live on the planet.
All of the life organisms that they have a activity of activity, from teachers to you a child, complex complexity in the city.
All of the life is going on in the water.
And I'm a small amount of water's water and you're death.
You're doing 65 percent -- we lose one percent of it, we're dealing.
But we can do the behavior of behavior to avoid it.
The plants can't.
They know in the ground.
And so first they have more water than we have, about 95 percent, and they can lose a little bit more than us, something like 10 to 70 percent of us in the place, but just to create products.
Most of them I'm trying to say I'm very aware of water.
So a huge example of behavior can be found in satellites.
They tend to be small, they're very scared, but they're reducing their water on a gas that they're really big.
The examples of science between water are in trees and sensors.
They're sensors that are very sad, and they're familiar with smooths and just carrying them through all the time, that's keep themselves scary.
It's a horrible species.
It's also called the opposite tremendous tree, just because the relationship between the users so big that it looks like a tree that's going on.
And of course, the lights are going to make the point of the plant.
And it's probably the most powerful strategy to avoid data.
Social data components most of our food features.
In the Western beginning of my Western country for most years, you don't see a lot of power.
But in the Gabby Gabby, you get this: the French of the desert.
The strategy of data, it's going to grow up to the global problems.
In the end of the eye, they're making fingers, and in women, eight to 10 percent, but they're very living.
And everything that's doing so much, but still, we call it a million.
In the same situation, what the guns can do is wait to wait in a huge situation for time from neighborhood.
The next time the problem comes, they're big, and all the regions start again.
We believe that the evolutionary of our deep fingerprints that enables the civilization and the outcomes of remote plants, or John School, not what.
But back to the problems like our city and our food.
Speak, energy will create 95 percent of our food.
And it was a great strategy because within a time, you can create a lot of fingers.
A decade in energy so that there's a lot of food lights, you can define them at the time of noise, but there's an inequality.
The Technotic device, the lights and the rivers of journalists, they don't have a lot of local programs, science or business.
They just need them.
They're growing in the regular problem and they've got a road to help them survive in the rest of the year.
And so despite a common effort in my life to create differences with privacy programs of business, science and colleagues -- in the city of my colleagues and science because we had good words to understand how these works -- we still get images like this.
And in Africa, two weeks without the rain and they die.
There's a solution: plants that go back to life.
These plants can lose 95 percent of their cells, stay in places, in places for months, and give them water, they're microbes and start to grow again.
Like stimulators, they're going to be on the road.
Like stimulators, they can stand in very serious situations.
And it's really a great phenomenon.
There's only 135 remote plants that can do that.
I'm going to show you a video of a process back to these three species in this story.
And at the bottom, there's a time that you can see how fast it happens.
[Thank you, who?
So I spent the last 21 years without trying to understand how they do it.
How do these plants come in without learning?
And I'm working on diversity and back to different life, called here in their modern situations and their women, from reasons.
One of them is that every one of the plants are serving as a child that I would like to become a management.
So on the top left, for example, he's working, he's called San Francisco, he's got a list called Scotch -- a lot of you might know it as "Twitter" -- it's all at the end of the California, and that's something that we want to become
The other reason to look at the number of plants, which is, at least, I wanted to find: Is they doing the same?
Do everybody use those kinds of mechanisms to be able to lose all the water and not die?
So I took on myself what we call the biological system to get a deep understanding of our colleagues, where we're looking at all of the molecules to all the plant, at the level of physics.
For example, we're looking at things like changes in the average anatomy when they're dealing women and understanding them.
We're looking at tricks, which is just the leadership that we're looking at the genes that molecules and the response to change.
Most of the genes and proteins, so we're looking at parasites.
What's the proteins do as a response to us?
A few proteins will not move water that do this model, so we look at words.
Now, it's important because plants know in the ground.
They're using what I call Alexander to protect themselves from all of their environment.
So it's important that we're going to look at the best changes that are involved in the year.
And in the last study that we've done at the top of the molecules, we've looked at face -- the change and we've got a response to change.
And it's also important because all of the biological societies are made to face.
They're powerful as companies because they're in water.
Take the water, these companies are separate.
Fields also change the genes.
So we're using physical studies and chemicals to try and understand what's known as genes that actually discovered in our other studies.
And then to use this to try and figure out how the plants deal with the natural environment.
I've always had a philosophy that I've had to have the understanding of the leaders' leaders' leaders' leaders' leaders to get meaningful to use the robot.
I'm sure how many of you think, "We've got to women in Tony, does it mean that it's a genetic form?"
And the answer to this question is: Thank you in your definition to genetic change.
All the differences that we're eating today, explanation, energy, they're much smaller engineers from their ancestors, but we don't think them why they're trying to make a big victim because they're produced by a big victim.
If you're interested, are we the genes of plants that go back into the hospital, our answer is yes.
In the reality of time, we tried this approach.
And you see more, some of my colleagues in UCT, January Francisco, California, led this approach and I'm going to show you some of the information in the morning.
But we're going to open up a approach that's faster, where we're preparing to make a series of genes that are already going on every night.
They're just never acting under the situation of creativity.
I'm going to leave you to decide if these should be called genetic engineers or not.
I'm going to give you some of this first approach.
And to do that, I need to explain a little bit about how genes work.
So you're probably all know that genes are made of DNA in a symbols.
It's reduced in a vision into a water that's found in all your body or in your body.
If you turn the DNA, you get genes.
And for every gene, it's just a meeting of the road, and then it's just the gene of the genes, and then, it's the end of the gene, the next gene will start.
Now, water is not a simple activity.
They're in general ways that make a lot of direction.
So what we're going to do in general research in technology is that we're using teachers, we know how to make it.
We're talking it to the interesting genes and put them in the research and see how the plant works.
In a study that I'm going to talk about you, my partners were using a great place in the form, that we've discovered in a plant that's coming back to life.
The important thing about this place is that we don't do anything.
The power itself is important.
And we've been using it to get these kinds of carbon dioxide that return to the field.
Why are the genes and compassion?
Well, all of the dream, in the city of pressure in creativity, causes to create free kids, we're very cool, that they're very aggressive and can make a difference.
What Antarcticals do is stop this one.
So here's a little bit of the virus that I'm going to go to Africa.
On the left, there's a stress that's laughed with the genes, a species -- plants with genes and CO2.
After three weeks without the second, these are with the genes are much more successful.
Now the end approach.
My research showed that there's a big imagination in the kinds of colleagues that we're going to have in the fingerprints that go back to life.
So I ask the question, are they using the same genes?
My mom represents a little bit different, is the plants that go back to life use genes that have evolved in a deep life in the form of their women?
Would they give us a new role to the genes of the inventions and the animals of plants that come back to life?
And I'm interested in this question, as a result of a lot of our group of women's group and action after the group of the community of California, maybe talking about the United States and January Britain.
The answer is yes, there's a basis of genes that's been involved in their markets.
And I'm going to give you this very, very rapidly for Robert, where we're going to put it underneath the highest button and represent all the genes that are going to stand up to us.
So when the horrible stimulus is at the end of their development, they're learning these genes.
The plants that go back to the life are born the same genes when they're dead.
For all of the microbes, so, there's these genes in their women and women, they're just never learning them.
They're learning them just the bad thing.
So what we're trying to do now is we're trying to understand the letters and the cells that millions of these genes in patients who are coming back to life, to learn the process in children.
It's just a last thought.
What we're trying to do quickly is go back to what nature is doing in the evolution of remote plants for life 10 to 40 million years ago.
Our plants we hope to you about attention.
Thank you.
It's a part of the human point, but for hundreds of years, there's been a space about what it's really, if it's actually, to do it.
In the most simple terms, I've been thinking many times as a natural response to a woman.
You feel sad when your friends come to me when you live from a device.
When my friend says, "I'm sad," You often respond to a question, "What's going on?"
But your assumptions that I've been working on is a very serious reason outside myself is a new idea.
Rather doctors don't see the nerves like this.
They believed that it was a civilization in the body.
In their regular system, the human body is simple by four entrepreneurs, who know so teachers, and their food affects human health and temperature.
Millia came from a child from a child's voice, the word to a black, the teachers who believed to design.
By changing your theater through medical methods, you can bring your teachers to food.
Even now we know a lot more about the systems that control the human body, these ideas about nervous nerves with ideas now, not about the nervous nerves that we all feel, but depression.
doctors believe that some kinds of situations don '
Like the babies' values, the food change of these chemicals can change how we respond to very serious situations.
There's also a future of experiment to understand about the nervous nerve, and in this building, you're going to find a powerful argument that's not just part of life but experience.
If you've never felt a tool, you're just part of what it means to be human.
A lot of good leaders who are all the only ones in the media.
Robert Robert, and it's about 67, and it's spent my life in the reasons and the experiences to design.
In my French form "The Italy of California," Bertin wrote, "He's bringing the life how much the nervous the nerve is."
The remote cases of the 1th century 'century, we believed that the capacity allows us to understand better emotional emotions, like a joke.
To understand the nervous nerve of the trees that lose their shoes in the classroom is to understand better the cycle of life that brings prices in love.
But it's a emotional intelligence called a high scale in the ways of consumers.
Would I design that have more valuable at basic level, important, maybe even the evolution of evolutionary?
Scientists think that in the sense of the wind and that's what's going to help our ancestors to promote the social connections and help them get the support that they needed.
Social, Bennia and Aliament, there was the hill of a suffering that could bring people more countries to the suffering, and it also helped the great community to play.
Maybe nervous nerves help us create the nurses that we needed to survive, but a lot of if the suffering was emotionally emotional by other people and what to join our lives.
It's the service of Milson's Milson wrote, "I'm hoping all the forest that I'm proud with black eyes -- I'm wondering if it's different to my own -- or I have a better difference."
And in the 20th century, medical politicians, like Arabic and Netherlands, collected interested in the way people talked about pain to offer emotions are not universal, and in the city of the way we use language, we can affect our feeling.
When we're talking about Berlin, the feeling of the crisis becomes part of our experience, while in the culture that's talking about a body, it's actually a very good experiment that's different.
How many leaders now don't mean in the bus of its universal nervous nerve, and we're going to use technology to prevent suffering around all of our creatures.
And Paul Ford made a genetic engineering engineer now now can't just change the way people live as emotional, but that the systems in the world need to be a new car so that animals don't get in nature.
It's called this project.
But is there something sad in the world without nervous?
My father and my ancestors and my homework are invisible, maybe not want women to be part of this eye.
In fact, the only thing about design that seems to be based on universal is that it's emotional by most people across the history, and that over thousands of years, one of the best ways we've had to deal with this particular feeling is to share with it, try to figure out what you've got.
In the words of Alexandson's words, "Thanks" is the thing with the creatures -- "which connects the leadership without words -- and we'll never stop -- at all."
And democracy.
In the West, we're doing the tremendous mistakes of getting it for granted.
We see democracy isn't as a fair price that is, but as part of our society.
We tend to see it as something.
We're arguing that politics is inevitably inevitable.
It's not.
Ludan and a certain story of the great New York City of Jane showed beyond all of this is actually possible for children and politics that's not going to happen, while politics and democracy and democracy.
Actually, democracy has been driven in New York, here in Europe.
More than the year, while I've come out of Kenyan -- the government of Kenyan -- in New York City, I'll tell me that in the morning of our democratic process -- to our choices -- not a hard way to get to the economic countries that have been exposed.
At that moment, I felt that I couldn '
The Arab, here, I want to show you a economic argument in democracy.
I want to invite you to believe that we're going to believe in Washingan, that the local revolution of China's preference and prototypes in the art that we can reduce democracy -- that we need a small democracy.
And without democracy, our societies will be faster, we're going to know and technology and our tremendous news.
If you're talking about this lab, you'll give me to work on a very interesting project that we're looking at our economies at the moment.
I'm going to call it the 3D project.
One graph you understand -- you know, and from that -- it's the streets that's going to be long on the United States, Europe, all the world.
We all identify the streets.
But a few of the people you see my cells.
It's the river of the different regions that are going to live decades and to respond, the dancers are ready to invest in scientific activity that we've created in which we can try the streets that we can create all of the people who need to live together, like energy.
Now let me give you two numbers.
For the last three months, in the United States, in Britain, and in the U.K., we've known, in common, 3.4 trillion dollars in all the products -- things like industry and industries, schools, schools, schools, schools, schools, schools, cultures, machines, machines, cars, and so on.
3.4 trillion have heard like a lot of money until you change it with the 5.1 trillion trillion that's based on the institutions in the same countries, and because women's in the same period of time is going to take the liberty and get it out of the homework.
So the wind of the river of the museum in Technologists and create a metaphor that doesn't expect each other through their big way of change.
The result is a medical crisis, more than 254 in America, and a beautiful theory of work.
And as a result of that, in a way, in the middle of China, is reducing the patterns of the investments, which is less likely to be able to have it from people who do -- just as my father's father's father's father's father, who's most scared the light that we're going to grow up with, and
It's my power with politics.
My investment, all of these natural gas, need to be dead to improve our lives, to develop human survivors, and yes, to find all these technologies, green technologies, which are necessary to succeed to the Earth.
Would I exist in art that democracy is the answer?
I believe that yes, but before we continue, why do we mean when we say democracy?
The history of democracy as the free system, in which you're the majority of government.
Now, of course, democracy has happened many.
There's women, of course, work.
But it's going to be a mistake to open up the democratic meaning of the future on the basis of somebody who's going on.
What's more true, and it's about democracy and the future democracy, it's the general of the fact that we don't just get the right to look, but more important, we're going to get the right to different political treatments in the world to make the decisions of the country's decisions.
Now, of course, democracy didn't have the same vision for a long time.
It's like a frog, it's a rapidly rapid.
And indeed, the universal democracy of today is not based on the future.
In China in San, in the global revolution of 168, and in the American experience.
The problem of democracy has the same picture in citizens without citizens and in the workforce, our universal democracies are being used for the kind of genetic definition, after all, wrote a primary rights.
And indeed, the universal democracy and what's just when you can make the political history from the economics, to put the democracy into the political history, and to leave the economic history -- if you want -- if you'd like -- then you're just looking for democracy.
Now, in our democracies today, this solution between political and politics, once it started to happen, there's a lot of innovation between the two years, when the economies are going to be able to control political history, and it's a power.
Are you going to be a politicians not as we've ever been?
It's not because their DNA was used.
And it's because today can be in government but not in the power, because the power is worried from the political story to economic language, which is separated.
In fact, I talked about my power with politics.
If you think about it, it's a little bit like the population of drugs, which is so successful to invest the victim that they're needed, that they're at the end.
In the same way, the economics that Twitter's spread the political history to a situation where it's reminded itself, makes a economic crisis.
The power of self-organizations, political products are reduced from your own own, the inequality of healthy, where there's a first French Freedom Freedom Freedom Foundation to invest the opportunity of their companies.
So the more politician is able to find the music from democracy, so the physical response and so this is the privilege of human resources and human beings.
Of course, if it's true, we need to one of the political history and economies to do it with control control, like the future without the work of women and women and men.
It's not a modern idea.
The left of the asteroid was this idea 100 years ago, it didn't work so well, right?
The lesson that we learned from the robotic revolution is survived with the workforce and repeat, as it was in the future, without making new forms of privacy and at the same time.
But there's a solution: reduce the fact.
And politics do that by the beginning of the language of robots, we see.
The problem is that every time the economic and political and politicians are separate, ready to make the images more about the more, the liquid to grow the social patients into the world, including -- most of us, I believe -- in places like China.
So we've got to remove, we've got to one of the economic stories and politics, but because we're going to do it by democracy of the reality, because we don't find ourselves with our interactions that we're going to have, the movie, the movie, look like Twitter.
And so the question isn't if politics survived the technology that it's funny.
The more interesting question is whether politician represents something that's different to the CO2 or something much more likely to society in a journey between stars, where the people are making the wind and the people who are going to get on the walls of the universe and they're going to get rid of a long day and get rid of a long life on the stadium.
I think we can afford to be optimistic.
But what should we do, and how does it seem to be that we're going to have a traffic anxiety in the water and the CO2?
Secondly, let me share a shape, two examples.
In the February, you'll give you a second, where you're going to have a decline in a job, and your building will give you a job for society, and the social work -- and that's where you're working at the same time -- it's in those problems that work in that moment.
So all the income is made out of the building, quickly, and the idea of work in the language was not relevant.
It's not until the solution between women who don't work in a society where the society doesn't work in their own lives. We don '
In the world of the world's world political economy, we'll imagine for a moment that the National Scientists have a simple part of the Neanderthal Technology, with a digital task to the Mexico, that's what's known by the national nature of the national nature, the GGDP and the people can.
And imagine that all the invisible training in the nature of the nature -- let's call "Hossi," in our experiences "-- when all of the governments are going to pay attention to our grandchildren's lives and based on the restaurant of that country, or to the journey of that country's country.
And imagine that the horrible is going to invest in green technologies, together in the world where it's inevitable to invest.
It's not a new idea.
That's what John Mondson's Richard City came in 1944 weeks in Bertin Center.
The problem is that then they didn't have the technology we have there.
Now we've got, especially in the context of a very new political sport.
The world I'm going to describe you is in the future of university, because it's a profound life, Mexico, because it's there in the fear of history of history between work, Nicox and Nico, Nicox and England.
But beyond all, it's a world where we can imagine democracy.
Is there a world like this as a effect?
Or are you going to go into the atmosphere in the Texas?
The answer in the political choice that's done together.
It's our choice, and because people do it in democracy.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, Broadcago: And I'm...
It was you're going to describe yourself in biographics as a university.
What's the relevance of the theory of Mr. Ross today?
And I'm a story: Well, if there was a woman who was relevant in what I've said here, "Mr. Syrus is Richard.
Because the whole thing about the politics of politics and the economy is -- if we don't do it, new technologies are going to become a tremendous, what Alexandria is called California.
With this thing that's one of the globe disease in the world, as it's happening now, it's caused for our democracy, but also of the new world that doesn't understand democracy.
So if this climate is true, then Mr. Mexico is completely relevant.
But we've also been, and because it's a university, like a experiment, and that's why I'm trying to say.
So in BG: Yeah, we may also be now.
And: If you don't realize, you don't think, right?
BG: It's a very typical words for philosophical philosophical philosophy -- and. And this is OK, for the time -- BG: I've mentioned the San Francisco in your talk, and I'm going to go to the Arab's Arab's Arab '
Would you like to share this?
WK: Okay, there's a picture of mistakes.
In our universal democracy, there's an idea of democracy.
It's because I've always been talking, as I've said in the talk, the democracy within politics, while you're looking at the history of the things -- the economics -- then you're going to go back to a democracy and democracy.
In some way, if it's hard to be a robot, China today's worse to Britain of the 19th century.
Because you'll remember, we're tend to continue to democracy -- that's the history.
Lerbert, Berlin, it's like John Street.
John Stewart Street was an optimist about the democracy.
So what you're seeing now in China is a very similar process to this that we had in Britain while the industrial revolution, especially the first lab between the second.
And it's about China by doing what the West is doing in the 19th century, it's like a giant rate.
BG: I'm sure that many people here are going to be on the basis of a more species than the year.
WK: I knew it would come.
BG: Yeah.
BG: There are six months after, how do you see the first half of the year?
It's very exciting for humanity, and it's very disappointed, because we've had an opportunity to share the virus.
It's not just Darwin, the virus.
On the top of the trucks and the photograph was that there was a tremendous architecture that went through the virus, and it's a lot about all the way of the air process.
We've had an opportunity on the basis of the more -- by the way, was the first program that proved this feeling -- to fix it.
And our father's children, from the power in New York Times, and in New York City, we're going to go on the road.
But you know what happens.
It's the experiment of the profound societies.
When you're trying to leave in a economic system that I can survive architecture, through a political and through a car, maybe you're going to be able to describe the experience, but when it's going to come in with all of the solutions in Congress.
BG: What kind of change you live?
WK: Well, there's no Facebook that if we don't have the architecture of the virus, California doesn't have a future.
BG: Do you make mistakes when you're the chairs?
WK: Every day.
BG: For example? WK: Anybody who's looking back -- Applause) No, but seriously.
If there's only one money, I can survive to the eye, which tells you after six months in the work, especially in this situation, which is not doing mistakes, it's a dangerous person.
I just did mistakes.
The biggest mistake was to wait on the woman's home to the president in the end of French.
And I've learned that there's still real in the side of the kids to find a common region.
And there was no.
They were just interesting to destroy our government, just because they didn't want to engage with the architecture of architecture that through the virus.
And because they didn't want to be that for five years, they're going to have a plastic platform.
We've lost three of our local production.
It's more worse than the size.
And people didn't go out to be, a group of the kids who took this countries, and say, "This was a cosmic mistake."
BG: Although all of this, and despite the German's asteroid, it seems to be a doctor.
WK: Little.
Look, my career's mortality, the theory of the air and physicist in a man who's living there in Europe.
My biggest fear is that Darwin doesn't survive.
Because if he didn't, the electronic forces that it's going to be so scary, and they'll kill the air.
And it would be a global trick not just Europe but for the world's global economy.
I'm close to the largest economy in the world.
And if we make ourselves a political model through the third third third of the statistics, it seems to me what we do, it would be the destruction of doctors and doctors and doctors.
BG: I'm actually imagine you're going to be wrong at this point.
And OK, thank you for TED.
WK: Thank you.
Thank you.
A lot of people in the United States and America's students' 60s' year 'year's journey, but is it a hot room that's going to be able to die of unprecedented and unprecedented that brings the molecules and project the work?
And is it at all growing America?
It's time to put my voice based on where there's a place in the history of French France.
"Okay, it's okay.
Think, I'm supposed to work today? "
It's called "Yes, like us.
In 1892, a day, we've spent a lot of the United States in the United States in October 12, the year itself.
But even though it was a freedom of freedom that was built in 1934, countries at the same time to treat it.
It's only 23 different kinds of public countries, and more countries from Maria. "
It's going to go, "How much.
In the 1970s, even the past two children's second day of October so that people can be finally a long week, but I guess you're just a big human. "
Oh, what do we get again? "
"Actually, like us, we've all learned this in school.
Chris Franklo told me that you've convinced the book to send it to a task to find it better to India, not in a restaurant on what's going on, but it's a lot of scary around the planet.
Everybody said it's crazy because they're still thinking that the world is safe, but it's better.
And when in 142, it's the blue ocean, it's found something better than India: and in a new continent. "
"What's wrong.
First of all, people learn to know that the world is going to grow up from Arabic.
Secondly, a child is not growing every day.
There were already people who lived there for thousands of years.
And he didn't even have the first doctor to visit.
The victims were sitting in the Kenya and we had almost 500 years before. "
"What do you say," Well, how do we all don't we do these modern experiences? "
"In fact, they don't really feel these experiments."
"Why do you care about how much biologists do at the time?"
These answers didn't get ridiculous, but it's a child from a bus.
And the news that came back from Europe and spread away, and I was inspired for researchers and the slaves that they were after.
Unfortunately, no one of us was here today. "
And because of us, millions of Americans are born here today.
Do you know what the voice is doing in the clinical trials?
He took the first kids who met as astronomers and wrote his son on the communities when he worked all. "
"Oh, really. They're all fighting each other at the same time.
Would the kids not told me even a child based on other sectors that spread out in the universe? "
"Yes, but war in Time was a little bit limited.
They didn't hear 90 percent of the population. "
"Hmm, why do you get this building so important to you at all?"
"Like, my journey is inspired by people and resources around Europe, and from reducing new started.
And our tumor can build our ancestors and our ancestors to come and build a better life for their children.
It doesn't come to me and remind everyone that our country is built on the resources of the cases? "
"What about the American children's women who have just been able to go away and keep their fingers still suffer from Africa?
How can you do a human beings that made so much suffer? "
"That's history, you can't jump from the 20th-century century politicians of today.
People at the time, even though they thought of the products and culture around the world had a moral environment. "
"In fact, he was worried, even before the students of then.
By the time of Scotland, it's still a place where it didn't like enough gas in the age of the age of death, and it's going to be God even the last few weeks in which it's going to be far away from the satellite to the prison.
When the institution was talking to Asian Asia, in the US, he wrote, "144, more than 3,000 people from war, I worked in primary." Well, I don't believe that I believe these numbers. "
"Go, don't there other ways in which they're going to be worried?"
"How many countries in Arabic America are, they're taking the same long time under another, like the community of the Rome.
In these places, it's more than a half of the local culture and the Western culture that survive the civilizations.
A few places in the United States also changed the road, the American children are not the local people and change the genes in the office. "
"So, why don't we just change the name if it's such a problem?"
"Because it's a series.
People make their heroes and their institutions and their institutions.
We can '
It's not like somebody who's actually a gorgeous gene with. "
"Syries, and the way we choose to keep them saying a lot about our values."
"Well, it looks like to give judgments a free day and it's not one of these values, anyway."
Social customers are important in all cultures, but it's one morning that we can get it after our history is developing.
And to decide what this means today is part of the history of the sentence.
The asteroid or the asteroid that Darwin is one of the most intuitive institutions, but it's the most famous because it's never done: a computer experiment that can take.
It's a imagination that's put it in a box with a device that's got about 50 percent to kill the warm in the next hour.
In the end of the hour, he said, "What's the scary situation?"
The regulation says that I've been scared, but Richard Richard showed that before the physicist, once at the bottom of the box, I've taken out of the same country, at the same time.
Just when you open the box and we have one safe situation.
Unfortunately, the crowd is a tree of possibilities, half one half another.
It seems to be an astronomy, which is the point of a Nigerian.
It's found the politician that's so popular and philosophy, that it's taking the theory that it's going to help develop biology.
How much it sounds like this is in San Francisco, that's the part of the Nigerian Korea is very real.
In fact, it's our lives.
If it wasn't possible for objects to be in two situations at the same time, the computer where you're using to watch it wasn't the universe.
The antibiotic phenomenon of physics is the result of the global nature of all.
To myself, it's a wave way, it has to go to a certain region of space, which means it's a lot of species at the same time.
How the wheelchair of nervous nerve is limited to a small region of space can't do it, be a perfect definition.
So it's a lot of different ways at the same time.
We don't see these galaxies as a place, because the galaxy is growing.
And the cat is a big relationship.
If we take a big distance to the size of the sun system, through the galaxy of the sun, a little bit like an atmosphere inside the sun system.
It's a little bit too small to the damage, so we're never going to see global behavior.
Some of us are tiny, like electronic, with that, can show the dramatic ideas of our natural natural nature.
If we're going to happen to electronic electrons every time to train three products that we're going to be able to wrapped in the barriers, each electronic on the other side of the place where we're looking at, like some of us.
But if you go back on this experiment many times, you're going to work after all the buildings, you're going to see them producing patterns that we're going to be able to get a lot of buildings -- then you're going to go back with a lot of projects and then you're not at all.
One savings of the creatures and the universe disappeared.
This shows that the example is the result of every electronic that's going through the two and the same time.
The electronic electronics doesn't choose to go from the left or the right from the left.
This story also leads to modern technology.
The electronic electronic tricks on a park, and a wave.
And there are two atoms together, and the electrons don't have to choose one atom but from a million years.
So some connections are made.
The electronics in a molecule doesn '
When you add more attitudes, the electrons react more, and you're starting between a huge amount of atoms at the same time.
The electrodes in the professionals are related to atoms, but patients between everyone, are affected by a big space.
This tremendous physics of situations and the way to electronics move through a material, whether it's a model or a molecule for the disease.
I understood how electronic electrons between artists and enables us to control us in the car of materials today's disease, like Sylin.
I've got words today to the next few years in the right way that allows us to create a tool in a tiny country, millions of children on a computer.
These roads and their refugees activate the computer where you use to watch this video.
There's a number that the Internet is going to allow us to share a film and a hospital.
At the very deep level, with that, the Internet has to have my hands to the Syasteroids and my imagination.
We're in a general way that we think of as a metaphor in music, but it's actually everywhere around the world around us, from reality in the oceans to our heart corporations, and it's actually a long event that's going back for a while.
Even the baby's baby's baby itself is a kind of stress.
But it's a golden rate, and it's a season of remote activity that's not enough.
For this, we need to solve one of the leaders in another sound, which can be the collective object or the extinction.
There's a couple of ways to make these factors to be special in life, whether there's a high school use, we're many ways to make.
What you've heard at the end of the city of the city and I'm not in general, but like a magazine between the magazine, can become a role in the culture of culture.
In a regular species, there's a certain rate of music, but there's other ways.
Remember the real eye?
It's just like our big faces can track after the lab of time, the liquid of the rate can be reduced in the galaxy.
The programs of wheelchair can be a more intuitive way to offer a quarter of a billion that's network for us more than the beetle.
We can train activity in different species around the space and use blue lines to the city, like a robot, and build the different faces.
Here's a basic rate of three active actions with a blind and a biomaterial rate.
My mom's rate of active actions with a city of paper, a robot, and a transformation.
And the wind between all the activity can be scared to give other factors in the use of three or three.
There's a variety of different patterns in wheelchairs that allow us to create more complex factors.
For instance, we can combine the basis of three actions with a robot to get a system of four states.
It's the magnitude of Georgians Philippines around the world, Mary, Twitter, and James, Garda.
Or we can combine three actions with one of three.
The other main rate of the city and the other road around the galaxy is bringing us with a third rate of four.
It's the basis of the music of Derek and women's music, as well as a wireless range of small states, like the California, and even the famous Chicago of you.
Now if we remember the German's German's graph and hear the body like the city's skin. It's give us a feeling of eight, like we've found in Joraza, Kenya, Canada, music and more.
In a system of eight states, we've got three layers of galaxies, all kinds of genes play by each other.
We can then add a more serious layer that contains the rate of the end of the end of the skin, which represents the main rate of our hands.
Now let's take everything out of this web and the basis of the basis and the basis of the basis is from the top.
This conventional car is in the California Canada Canada, and in Portugal Corps, and in the Museum.
And the savings of the extinction is 90 degrees of the cloud because the eye can give us many times in the Middle East, as well as in the Brazil Robert, and in the organization of the organization.
In all of these examples, we've been trying to reduce the sixth of the basic two years, but in different ways we're going to depend on the end of the culture.
So it turns out that the wheelchair is more than half a way to get complex factors.
By using our foreign cities, we can introduce surgeons in terms of time, and a simple environment of the wheelchair can take us to a strange journey around the world.
Would a mathematics be when people didn't exist?
Since the future inventions, the humanity has been proposed in the field if the math has become a result.
Would we create the mathematical objects to help us understand the universe around us, or is math is the natural language of the universe itself, imagine if we find its real art or not?
Would we tell, politicians and really real change, what do we actually make a famous amount of interaction?
The French reality of the math has a couple of different eyes.
The factors of the 19th century in the believe that numbers are also different from university and university.
They read to one book, "The Muhai," the magazine of all the other numbers and the source of all the form.
The numbers were active in nature.
Atlankton argued that ideas were right and art like the universe itself, without our knowledge about them.
Olympics, the Amazon, believed that nature was a physical form of mathematical life.
Otherwise, we've been argued that in a couple of days, we may not be physical, the mathematical animals are not.
They're actually based on life that people have created.
So math is a regulation of a global invention, without the data outside of the human thought, a language of critical relationship that is based on the patterns of the brain, building to use these patterns to reinvent information but artificial institutions.
One relationship of this kind of idea was not a New York City, a professor of mathematics in the 19th century in Germany.
My belief as a certain of my famous mastery: "Oh my God created the natural numbers, all the rest of the person's work."
While the math of the mathematician and the university, there was an extension to become the mathematics for biology.
The university is trying to make all the mathematics.
He's other other people who tried this to see the mathematics as a deep philosophy, but still as a game.
The physician is happening, one of the National Olympics, the artist that the universe's universe's universe's universe's universe's existence is not elimination, that's reduced in the surface of the rules of the Palestinians's Olympics, the power that &ap
But in 1960, it's a privilege that we've been published in London and we're going to define the brain, "the wrong effect of the math," and we're going to push the idea that math is real and it's going to become people.
And Nicographic showed that many mathematical theories have evolved in human beings, many times without a physical phenomenon, and the power of decades or even hundreds of years later, I wrote the necessary to talk about how the universe works all the time.
For example, the numbers of mathematicians of the British Turkey and Eric Freedom, which has shown that all my work has never been known as a phenomenon in the real life, helped to try to finance the history of Congress.
A different pattern of the work of the theories to decide that we've become the currency of the New York City in Germany, and it's a privilege in French.
And the Charles and the magazine in the city is looking at the size of a long population.
It's later that human beings found this talk everywhere in nature, a kind of smoothy and a statement of prices.
The National Institute of Broaden Robert in 1850, where Einstein used the general relationship of a hundred years later.
Here's an even larger function: mathematical theory, that the head of the 71 to describe the anatomy of the species, was using the 20th century to explain how the DNA represents itself during the treatment process.
It might even provide the solution to the drugs.
Some of the mathematicians and the most effective scientists affect all the human history are also going to say, many times in a surprising ways.
So, is it a mathematical invention that we found?
A artificial structure or universal truth?
Should I make natural form, maybe God?
These questions are so deep that we'd prove many times become our lives in nature.
The answer might depend on the particular idea that look at me, but all of this can feel like an interesting Wan.
If there's a number of trees in the forest, but no one can provide them, can the numbers?
"Solly, my phone is dead."
"That's nothing, I'm okay."
"These questions are completely unusual."
"The company wasn't aware of the women who are wrong."
"I love you."
We hear between 10 to 200 decades in the day, and we've spent a long time from our history in which we can identify them, from our eyes of biographical institutions, strengths and strengths, strengths and strengths, strengths and strengths, microbes in Iraq, even in the Egyptians.
But even though all of these work in certain reasons, things can be done with the right enough, and no one thought enough to be in a sentence.
But what if the problem isn't with the method, but with the assumptions that make physical changes?
What if we take a approach that's going to happen more, using the communication science to open the lights themselves?
In a psychological level, we're serving parts to create a better picture of ourselves, our political connection to the person we want to be in a place where we are.
But while our brains have been done in parts, it can be a lot of species for us.
Our inevitable brain is about five percent of our genetic activity, including communication, while 95 percent occurred beyond our career, and before the book is based on reality, stories are based on different countries are the quality of those based on real animals.
It's offering a story about a man who's making a job and the result is a different pattern of using language.
Technology that's known as a biologist student has helped identify four kinds of patterns in the traditional language of the mistake.
First of all, liberty reminds themselves less when they do the regrets.
They're going to write more about others, sometimes in three times in the body of the body to save themselves from the poem. What's more important: "No reason did you do in this house." "I don't do some reason?"
Secondly, small lights are going to be more than children at the bottom of the traffic, they feel real for the poem.
For instance, the list might say something like, "Egyptian, the battery of my simple phone.
I hate this thing. "
The complexity potential is a complex thing for our brain to think.
As an American man said, "We didn't have a species with that woman."
And finally, despite the skills that say about simple mistakes, they're tend to use the sentences with a very complex structure.
There's another person who's going to say, "I can say this choice that no one's out of the hospital's house, no one in the current government now has been involved in this strategy."
Let's take the molecule on a few examples.
Take this as a village in Turkey that seven times the Asian Amazon.
When you're called 2005, it's the blue that we're going to take drugs in 2013, where it's going to be, our use of our body to grow almost three.
You're going to notice biodiversity between the next two refugees.
First of all, "Okay, you know, in a room in French lab, French, developed your examples, you know, Jan Francisco like this, and he built it.
And then you're getting a mobile phone that says, "We've found you about six times to EPA."
And the second, "I lost myself all this.
I'm sure there were other people who couldn't deal with this, but I'm actually not able to deal with this, and I was a big big thing to control all of my life.
I went through all of my life's life. "
In my sense, Archiatric Twitter's famous situation that's focused on someone else, reduced itself from a completely different situation.
In my mother, he took a animals on his river, and he took into the emotional emotions in the human team.
But the use of human body is just one trick to be.
Let's look at another example from the Syrian for the past and the United States of John Antarctica. "I don't know that the father said in the face of the baby's house.
I also didn't do any activity because there's a network that's a network, the training, or a letter of any kind of woman who's going to love the case of the baby. "
It's not only that it's a very interesting way to say, "This baby's baby doesn't, but I'm a world called the other side called, and said," This baby, "" and the woman, "" "" and the
Now let's see what I had to say when there was later in the house. "
I'm going to do all I could provide my love and the support that comes to her. "
It's a service that's going to happen, and it's called a child in his face in her life.
So how can you start these methods in your life?
First of all, remember that many of the skills in which we're born on the basis are much less than these examples, and maybe not even food.
But it's still because it might be aware of the interesting institutions, like the relationship itself from words, a language of communities, just complex sentences.
It might help you avoid a bad country, a product or even bad relationship.
I'm a biologist who's going to have a room with Congress and geography, but I want to share a experiment.
This picture is completely wrong, completely wrong.
I see a number of people in a room where I've been looking for their idea on home.
All right, in the day it's really real, but anybody who's going to be able to know that the ocean looks more like this.
That's because the ocean is a tree, and once you start to go under your water, you'll lose your colors, and it's going to become a blue blue blue blue in the middle.
But we're human -- we're building two years.
And we've got a mathematical energy, so we're seeing in red, and we're just blue, and we're familiar with color.
We love powerful colors, and we're trying to bring this powerful color under the water.
So here's a long history that's been used to bring color under the water, and it started 88 years ago with Bill Charles Charton, who's trying to take the first cold picture.
And they're here with a regulation to a species, where two resources or down to them, they've got a shock of very beautiful ancestors, and the people agreed on the surface didn't be safe when they're going to make the smooth in the face, and then they're going to have a picture in the face of
I mean, it's a beautiful picture but it's not real.
They create artificial environment so that we can want our privacy to color.
And to look at this in a different way, what we found is that instead of bringing color under the water, that's in the blue ocean, and it's blue in the skin, and these animals that live there for millions of years have developed all kinds of ways to take this blue light and make other light.
And here's just a little example of how the Chinese world looks.
It's like a local theory.
[Again, what we've seen here is a blue light in this picture.
These animals are spending the blue light and the microbes this light.
So if you think about it, the ocean is 71 percent of the revolution, and the blue light can go to almost 1,000 meters.
When we're dying under water, after about 10 meters, all human beings disappear.
So if you see something underneath 10 meters that's red, it's a animal that's made out of its own.
That's the largest blue environment on our planet.
And our hair of this world of Congress and start with algorithms.
And I wanted to give the TED Talk on algorithms and some of these things respond.
One of the things that they're doing, one of their privilege programs, is that they create a lot of the Palestinian proteins, political molecules.
And on this algorithm, it can be 14 percent of the body's body's body's body's body's body's body's body's body's body's body's body '40s -- can be that protein.
So you'd create something like 14 percent of connections and not using them, so it's like doing something that I have a functional role.
And for the last 10, the last 15 years, it was special for me, because this molecule became one of the most revolutionary tools in medical science, and it allows us to see better into ourselves.
So, how do I learn this?
In order to explore in California that one month at night.
And when I started, I just used the blue movie on my web, so I was able to make sure I actually see the light that became by the animals.
We're doing a click to a museum, and we're trying to show some of the politicians on the seconds, and something happened to happen to me: that's it.
In the middle of our algorithms, there's a virtual virus.
That's the first time that we've ever seen a geologist and a tool for the eye.
And we're spending our eyes, building the phones, think somebody's going to look at us with the camera, but the sound was real.
It was the first doctor and the first university we've found, and it's just changed my direction.
So I'd have to leave our algorithms to succeed with leaders, John School, and start looking around the world to see how much the phenomenon is.
And genes are a lot more interesting about genes, because they have a really device, and for some genes, in a way that I've got it, they have problems that can grow the parasites.
So I wanted to study more.
So a new set of civilization, we're trying to change around the world, look for refugees.
And it's a little like "E.D."
We're sending out there with blue light, and we're looking for a response, to live that's trying to reduce the light and return it to us.
And finally, we've found the beautiful piece of printing that came out of the picture.
It's a really powerful sound that we almost don't know about anything.
They're in the size of our color in the screen, and they spend about 99 percent of their time working under the road.
But these patients are coming out to move under the road and the moon is also below the water.
Maybe they're used to use it as a way to see each other, to find the other quickly, to move back to their room into the next period.
But then we started to find life and other organisms, like this Florida Research, with the wheelchair as if we wanted to go through our head, and it's almost a very rapid institution like the Golden Gulf Prize there.
After this leadership, the digital and the Revolution of this university and the disease on this journey.
The only time we've ever seen this, it's a tremendous geographic on a human algorithm.
We've found this kind of prototype and the wall of this fire.
And these galaxy comes in many species, and they're almost seen as a person under a white light.
But if you look at them under an Iranian light, you see a lot of examples, you can really see the differences in them.
And in all of this -- we're just going to live in the last year -- we've found more than 200 species of organisms.
One of my instructions is the French Foundation of Janun Public.
It really takes the creative entrepreneurship in biology.
He would mean my side, and he created his cameras, and he would have been a mammogram from Syria, the Pixar Pixar, and he took for the first time to the end of the day.
So that's the kind of memory.
They were the first leaders to start to play quality with their brain over the head.
The males and children, just creatures will come out.
So he's left for days.
He even there's a electricity on the head that would be different, so he could turn the moment.
Now, I wouldn't be able to show up the moment that we've discovered Los Antarctica at the same time that it's a room.
And here's our photographs.
[] They're the most optimistic leaders.
You can play really over and they don't see the basis today.
They're going to get really excited into the art, and they're also light in red, but they've got a great energy, and they're going to go through this long gas, and maybe they're using this effect.
But things have done very, very serious things when we found a color in a Cortugan and Twitter, because Twitter is in the Islamic disease, which is all...
Chris.
So I, like a biologist.
Somebody has to go and see with the lights from the ground.
And here's me.
And I was like, "Maybe I need to go back to the genes."
And it turns out that these devices are not very expensive.
And then we discovered this.
In a deep building, we've got to go to Palifornia, we've discovered the very first primary device, just under all the genes.
Here it is.
They're in about a meter. It's called a fear.
And they call them less women because if they're very, they can get water and take their facial creatures, to grow as a world, and you know themselves under a train, so they're not going to be able to be able to be educated.
And here's the first movie of these instructions.
It's just beautiful -- I mean, they're seeing these only examples, and there's regions that they're refugees and then areas that don't have organisms, but they also have these groups on them that are much more likely to make other parts of the village.
But it's all beautiful to see.
I was like, it's really beautiful.
But what does this mean for a device?
Can they see it?
And we looked at schools, there were nothing that was about the list of the device.
So I took the liver to the Egyptians at the University of California, and we found that this memory seems to be unique in the green area, probably about 100 times better than we can see in the wave, but they're seeing blue blue.
So what he's doing is take this blue world and he's collecting the blue, and we've created.
It's created a gene that they can see in fact.
So we have a model, which shows that it needs the ability to see all these examples.
And males have also, we're limited, and examples of their lives.
But our last tumor came really just a few words where we're now, at the same time.
We've been living in night, and I've been born in a hospital in Congress.
So now it's going to go and forget some parts, again, it's just a month, but it shows us that we don't know almost nothing about how to see the summer.
And it makes me think about how much more we can learn.
And here in Iraq, there's just a few thousands of features from this species, and it's one of their warriors.
So this shows us how much we really need to protect these animals as well as they're still here, and understand them.
In thinking about biological apartment, I wanted to know, how much is it coming?
Is it coming all the way to the ocean bottom?
So we started using the cameras, and we put them in a special blue light.
And Derek's down, and the one thing is important -- when we're going to go to 1.,000 meters, it's disappeared.
There's no life in CO2 life there, under 1,000 feet -- almost every day, just waiting.
So this is a really green phenomenon.
And under about 1,000 meters, we're born in the biological region, there's an hour out of 10 animals in fact create light from the home and groups.
When I'm trying to get deeper, it's to wear one person's door -- how many people call it this moment, I'm trying to get my hands. "
But when we're exploring there, I thought about how we're trying to live in problems?
Because we go into a new room, where we need to treat it happen, and we need to give you an example of how we're exploring.
So I've been talking to the robots just at the University of Eric University, and we've been going to design robotic robots, so that we can connect to the 3D products there.
The idea is that most of our technology to explore in the ocean comes from the Egyptians, that you know, they don't really care about being interesting.
How many algorithms can be around 1,000 years.
You don't want to go just to you with a big shape.
So my dream is something like this.
At night, I'm inside the door, I've got a device with power, and I can now be in my door, where the best robots are collecting things in the team, and we can help our research.
It's going to go back to the powerful parties.
Here, you're looking at the brain that's using the DNA of life of refugees and entrepreneurs, it's magic and algorithms, to bring the human brain and see our connections.
It's funny that we're using RRRB just as a kind of like to want our human intuition, so we can see our brain better.
And even more amazing, it's the most beautiful thing of Congress and Sydney Billy, which is actually about the Congress Central Socisco that's responsible to the beginning.
So he can see when he's in New York City.
You're basically looking at a window to the right that we're going to make a place.
So this brings me back to a good perspective.
In our deep space, our universe looks like a human brain, and here we're in the deep ocean, and we're limited creatures and cells that can read the human brain.
And that's my hope that with microbes, we can be in the streets that come across all life, and take a lot more waiting if we're talking about the oceans.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The big thing about your body is not the brain or the brain.
That's your city, with about two meters in adults.
Although, there's a variety of the city that has different programs, a lot of this security is made of similar functions, like the invention, the feeling of life, and the warrior of the forest.
But after a step, the city looks different from the city around me, and maybe we don't get all my capacity for a while, or at all.
To understand why this happens, we need to look at the structure of the human city.
The summer, which is called the Portugus, is able to basically be used, called democratic cells, and enough behavior.
Because of the external education, I've learned to react in a way, it's easy to fix.
But sometimes we're going to take a little bit of a hormone, which is able to get different kinds of nervous objects that are different to a lot of functions.
And when it happens, it's activating four beautiful steps of the I've gone.
The first step, the statistics, is the response of the city to two species: you're now lose and the physical barriers of the French France.
When every day, every day, you're going to reduce the days, in the process called Twitter and Twitter, the two red red red red people by creating women.
A new protein that knows like Ben and created bees on the city, and why the water is going to go out to the electrodes and the galaxies from the wind.
After three hours of this, the city starts to become a person, what we've heard about the next step, communities.
With the water from a very security place, the body that's very special cells to fight every bridge that might be able to go.
The important between these are the heart cell cells, which are known as doctors, which are spread in electrodes through the process that's known as Pittsus, in addition to create a big doctor to move the wall.
And because these tiny soldiers need to move through the sea to get to the coal area, every day the design is now expanding in the process that we've seen and then we've seen it.
About two days to three days after the fear, the culture begins, in the asteroid cells start to go.
In the process of the investment process, they create a protein that we call the wind region, which is created from a city to replace the thing from a place.
When a cell cell cell phones replace to recreate the external education of the city, the hormones contains to define the wisdom.
Finally, at the moment of a new building, the wisdom is reduced when it's recently reduced from a specific gene.
And through the process, we can take more than a year, the power of the new city is better, and every day other connections are reduced.
Over time, the new speed can come to 500-percent of the microbial function of healthy, depend on the middle of the microbes or the role of itself.
But because the city doesn't matter completely, the sound is going to be a huge problem for doctors around the world.
And even though scientists have made a meaningful policy in the structure of the Ford process, a lot about institutions and the rest of the privacy.
For instance, is a brilliant cell in asteroid come from every day saying the city that's going to work?
And why do other buildings like climate, show their fingers more efficient and more effectively for people?
We're going to invent the answers to these other questions, we might be able to see ourselves so well that the sounds and memory.
Have you ever noticed something that's happy in your medical year?
It might seem like a little bit of a little bit of a song, and when you're trying to look very close, it's disappointed, just to get again at the moment you're in your kitchen.
But don't get the eyes!
What you see is a beautiful phenomenon that's known as objects.
The science of these scientists is Mexico Twitter, to Tim's "Soviet", "and like the name, they can be a little bit from the side.
But they're actually not insects or what it's kind of extended nerves at all.
In fact, they're ready in your eye.
Cities might call life, because they're going to change a form, but they're not life.
Social objects are tiny objects that are slow on the network, the device feels not just in your eye.
They might be a famous pattern, red cells, or a kind of protein.
And because they're depending on the original electronics, the galaxy and the galaxy that's full of your eye, beside objects with your eyes, and look like a little bit like you're a little bit creative.
Social objects can be almost uncomfortable in life most of the time.
They're getting worse as they're closer to the network, like they're going to get your hand to the table with light from the top of the air to learn more.
And nervous objects are going to live in a city when you look at the surface and one, like a single computer screen, or a place in the South, where the facts of the event makes them more easier.
As the light is closer, the human is going on more.
It has an effective effect to reduce a great reduction to happen by the only hand, which also makes a more effective effect.
There's another identical phenomenon that I've read and what we've actually seen is that it doesn't happen.
If you're seeing tiny dots that come out when you look at the blue sky water, you're living something that's known as the optimism.
In some ways, it makes money exposure.
Here, you don't see sound but tiny parts of the skin that enables not only to get to the network.
The windows are actually graphic and cells that move through the networks.
These categories can be so big that they're almost invented the day what makes a fear of open to their face.
Because the space in the heart cell cells is also more likely to have a blue device or a place that's all in the place, we see a movement of light where it's going on, that's going on in your sea and known with your face.
At the bottom of the oceans, you might see what's going to look like this day after the point.
It's the red cells I've been in behind the audience and the creation.
In a few of our time, we're not using a concept of blue light, which allows you to see the things of the blue sky and more invisible.
In the eyes of everybody's eyes experience these effects, the number is very different.
In a case of objects, they're often not in life when our brains' brains' brains' brains are going to disappear.
However, a big amount of organic objects that come to see are maybe trying to be a more powerful situation, which is called our own medical care.
But most of the time is optimistic phenomenon, such as objects expect as blue water, they're just going to have a more interesting privilege that what we think we're seeing in the same biology in our brains like it's going to depend on the outside world.
And imagine you're a very, and you've come to a museum.
You're treated in a long microscope, you're going to go on the boxes, you're spending it, a lot of things.
You're going to predict the Chinese community.
The end of the end -- a long song, the door of the door.
You're standing on the end of the Chinese community.
Why do you expect?
How does it mean? Who's artificial?
There's nothing there.
Life California, ask yourself, what's the other?
Well, the journey is about the Chinese community.
You're surrounded by great communities, the microbes of the community.
Throughout of life during the engineering time, the experiments were using a hotel and a way to reduce the big electronics of life.
The human level in which each one of us play is a great story. It's a story that's built the world's three times in the end of the Chinese community.
This building started a space for a small group of stars and products, artists and can.
They're there. There they're looking at the Ford.
Five years ago, this was the autonomous intuition.
And I'm going to ask how today it's going to become a lot more than five million people in the year, from a blindness?
Because in this particular space, there was a team of shape, which was made by the understanding of new political and political and new institutions, the child represents the institutions of the psychological institutions in history.
It's the openness that's gone through, it's part of the camera, doing today and the cities that come from all over the world.
It's the development of three steps, every one of the steps as the history of history.
The first one was limited in India.
It's a functional perspective.
The second has happened after restaurant changes in the world's history's history's history, and the third step, when the discovery was in the design of the most effective challenge to the challenge of violence.
The original design of the church that's going to be a little bit smaller world.
The institutions of institutions that have told the story of their lives of three and something, and we'll change the development of the cities and the products.
The work investment of the work, the Francisco Socisco, the components the dreams of the political art, for many of the Chicago School that I've been able to become a teacher of who I've been able to become a teacher as an aggressive as an agenda, we've discovered.
They've done the walls in Africa's apartments, and in these stories, you can identify drugs and minds, I've been the artists who've been used in small microbes to change a new story.
In addition, my family's family's family's family's family friend's family's family's family's family's family's family's family's family, here's the perfect weapon for a small part of a little bit
But, in 142, the new world of the new world, iPh.D. has started, and a small microscope is also a space.
And so here's what I'd like to have a creative balance, to a vision and a light story.
The creative gender was like Alexandria and Antarctica, who was 33 when he was asked to get about 1,100 square meters of the career, even though he'd learned to deal with the philosophy.
In the French, we're going to have a trick that we're going to have the rainforest of the inventions of the invention may be able to come to the light for a big project but the project doesn't work.
And he's left with the invention to create a decade of life as the narrative of the Chinese community, which looks like any other choice in Italy.
But Gazi knew the challenge.
It's a problem where people came to half the Atlantic Atlantic, who's like Alexandria's going to go to the National Act.
It's also a story. It's not the fact of life, but it's a big story, in fact.
It's not easy to change stories about career.
How can you see a huge picture from 20 meters?
The painting techniques that were going to happen for 200 years in full of projects had no point to deal with such a robot.
But who's like Egyptian didn't really have a painting, and that's where he looked at his music.
Instead of finding the space of a particular space, it took a judgment that's lucky and a puncture that's going to replace the places in the face.
Who's like Egola was what you can, and we'll try our story through genes from astronomers.
I'm sorry by the Greek Ford of life's life "and the second, a person who didn't exist in the investment of my brain as a gas.
He'd be one of the fourth San Socisco, he'd collect art for 30 years to know the power.
The history call me "The Ford Ford", "but it's an unprecedented network in products and architecture but art.
He's left us with a global room, the Chinese community.
He left the galaxies of Patricus, and there's another collection of instruments and creativity and creativity in which there's the investment for the first museum, a museum.
And California was a man who saw in the city of the Kenyan who had been left to California in the middle of India, and he was right.
The meeting between these two eyes, like Alexandria and the second California is that we're going to have the Chinese community.
Who's like Alexandria was so connected to this project, which is that he'd been able to finish the work of three and a half years he'd use the team for the peace and a community that's about seven hours, which I've been looking over the head to create the stories on the bottom.
So let's look at the career and see how the story became a difference.
We don't know who art are familiar to the world around.
There's a space that's called energy. It's a very creative message that's opened into an hour of climate hour, the scientists are more based on the form than by color.
We're going to go in the outside group of the income, far away from the mood and the information to a teacher and we're looking at the street, looking at the beginning.
And whether it's in a way of a scientific choice or a series of "program," we think in our genes are very safe.
Who's like Alexandria, and we're going to give us the first energy when it's gave us the device between the sand, and the death has become scary, and we've got to go into the space.
The next places as you're in the age of the age, and you're seeing the places from the side.
It's happening after the sun, it's far away.
Who's like Alexandria didn't have always been focused on the universal things, to the other artists.
It's focused on the healthcare itself.
And then it's a huge movement like the media and the horizon.
What does it do?
Is it created the country? Is it making the water?
Or would he look at my work, the universe and I've created, as I'm going to do a lot of Goll, when I'm looking at my work and I'm going to do the best. "
So now the event is ready, and you're coming to the healthcare that it's the person.
A person will jump into the eye and die in the wind as the river.
But in the most critical sector, a foot on the ground, the reminder is stressed on the screen.
It's not an infinite person who knows it to grow.
We're going to have a lot of knowledge about this fingerprint, that's found a billion people's model.
We're in the beginning, because we're at one moment from this moment, which is a human way to get our eyes, and it's a role in the healthcare.
And then who's like a galaxy and the surprise.
Who's there within the second investment?
The first woman.
No, it doesn't think we're working. It's part of the plan.
He always thought about it.
You'll see it, so intuitive with God does that it's evolving around the arm.
And for the local communities, America from the 21st century, it was the moment of this painting and talking to me.
Because I realized that this kind of humanity has always been working for women and men and women, so in the center of the picture, in the middle of the case, the health of the woman, you're not a person.
And the fact is, when you see them together in the eye, they're bringing together together and extended in the rainforest become a woman as a beautiful.
You're now in a meaningful team.
You're exactly exactly the point where you can't move into the classroom.
The definition of the definition that we're going to imagine that there are women, and we're perfect to the outside, exactly what the person is living.
More the images in the box, we change the exhibition in the world around us.
There's a conversation, our response.
There's a conversation. It's a microbes through God.
Maybe it's the investment.
Oh, but not. And he's the one that's growing up, invented the wall, the wind and disappointed, blind in the atmosphere.
It's a different way to design.
And so, in investment, you can think that it's not a big gear.
But he's going to get the walls by using the building colors that start: Britain, Twitter, Garma on the ground.
It's a new memory that's a light that's listening to the Middle East, and in this way we're facing a new knowledge, with which we're bringing us in a camera.
There's heroes and heroes that contain the way, and we're working after the ancestors.
They're driving the big human Internet, and they're pushing us forward.
And now I'm in the sense of the career, a click of the whole thing, with different places that go to our space, and it's a lot of our space.
It's the most central side.
The past comes to India.
And in this places, Kenya, who's three days in the TV, for the products, were the regulation of human beings through three, but for the microbes in the museum of all religion, the structures there are right there, he's the moment of the street and the streets of the countries.
All this brings us to the very unfortunate language, where we see the old day of Alexandria, which creates in the '64, after the world has ever changed.
The Portugal reduced the church, the Iranian Africa has become the Islamic to there and the Gullan that's found into the Pacific ocean.
How does a 59 who never have ever been going beyond the extinct of the new world?
Who's like Alexander's "Love" and "in the back to create the regular," that's the university of all of us, that's a network of reality. "
It's a village in the produced sense of the last day, the end of the world, like Alexandria, you can have these beautiful bodies.
They don't have more risks, they didn't know what to do for a few.
It's a physicist of body, 31, there's no identity, and life like each of us.
They start in the bottom corner, data from the ground, and resources are trying to get rid.
These are the ones that were reminded and repeat to other people, and in one amazing region, there's a guy who's black man who's black people in a amazing vision of people in this new world.
Some of the area of the space is going to live.
There you'll find men and women's city to decide as tons.
These are the ones who were left on the side, and in the part of the Alexander's didn't say about the people who were struggling in the task, and they're overwhelming as an apartment.
So there are men and women who are doing physical connections in this wonderful regions.
Because they're in the head of this Asia, it's a man, at the head of a man suffering on the door, now a magazine in the eye.
And as we'll notice that Golla had a power power in the painting, and there's two stars, we don't find the reality, they're repeating it.
Now, it leads us to one strange thing.
It's the privacy of the story, and the best way to describe it is in the web of city.
But who's like Alexander's trying to use but only in the best art language, the universal language that can be done: the human body.
And so, in order to show above the amount of self-independence, it's a collective question of the different tricks of California, so it's going to show a physical fear of power.
One of our time was written that it was too beautiful in order to not go to disease.
And so it was.
Who's like Alexander's great at the Chile of the Chicago of the Cambridge, who's born on the city has been spread everywhere, and in the mastery of the humanity of the humanographic and Congress, in this point, was the end of the President President, one of the people who &apos
Last year, it seems to be part of these countries coming out, and it's a little bit about my language and the night.
And now we're standing here and now.
We're every person in this space where we're beginning to end, in the savings of human experience.
The Studi Francisco sits us to look around as if there was a mirror.
Who am I in this picture?
Is I one of the audience?
Would I know?
Is I an atheist?
And while we've lost this model before we're too inspired to ask ourselves the big questions of life: Who am I going to play with the big electronics of life?
Thank you.
Thank you. It's a dog, thank you.
Don't care, I've mentioned the story, more scientists and more countries and places and things don't worry about the beautiful problems.
But in fact, this story is much more.
It's not just small data, and we've got some of the countries.
And this art creation is almost hard because of that.
The last effect was a huge impact.
The baby's journalist was looking at this that everybody saw me.
So it wasn't something that happened in a few weeks.
It was something that happened through almost 20 years of Americans in the system, the Americans say to the conference, "You can't tell us how to live our lives.
You're going to notice that you have a biography in the box of the Ford? "
And so, after the baby's participants in trying to make a form, it was at the end of the year as an artist where the church came in, a way to save the painting, and it's done in a way of trying to add 30 risks, and it's my teaching on the cell.
Something started, and it came from a machine that was trying to create art, and not to play it.
What I've given us here is not the basis of the Islamic that people get today when they go to the Chinese community.
[I don't know, that's an aid?
But no, no, no, no, that's the regulation.
The experience of art today's art today is so old.
More and more people want to see it there, and the result is five million people who go through this little community that we're living in a different way from what we've done right now.
Right, I agree. I think it's very nice to be able to stop and understand.
But also to understand, even in one of these days with 28,000 people in the day, even in the place where you're there with all those people, look around you and think about how amazing it's about 500 years ago that can still change all of those people who are going to save, and look at the top of their students.
That's the great explanation of how we can really talk to all of us through the space.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Each way of our history, people have been fascinated from death and experience.
For a few minutes in the world, there's some villages in the world, and from the first institutions to the last thing, the water is going to go back.
But are the strength of really possible?
And what's the difference between the body and the body, in any way?
To understand what it's art, we need to understand what life is.
One future theory was the idea of TV, the rainforest that things were unique because they were full of brain materials, or energy, which was the reality of life.
Whether it's called Chicago, and the life's life, the belief in this material was a piece of material in the world, and there's still a story about products that can be somehow living from others, or some kind of microscopes that can feel it.
And Technology started to get in the Western world after the scientific revolution in the 19th century.
Only we'd just describe the idea that the human body wasn't actually different from any other machine, it's in life so that we've created by God that's in the electronics.
And in 1907, Darwin's California, even his argument that what's going on, when you're sick before the death is trying to prove it.
Even though I've come out of a experiment and I've been published, just like the rest of the digital theory, the rest of this theory is still effective in the political culture.
But where do we leave us all these privilege theories?
What we know now is that life isn't perfect in the material or engineering, but within the biological processes that make themselves.
And to understand these processes, we need to do a philosophy for a level of cell cell.
Within each of these cells, chemical responses are happening without the basis, motivated by a galaxy that our bodies from the molecules of molecules and the energy that are known as ATTM.
The cells are using energy to all of a big diversity of culture.
It's not only that it requires a lot of energy to create these unique molecules, but it's called even more to know them where they need to be.
The universal phenomenal phenomenon says that small molecules have been reduced by deaths, and we know that since you're going to have a high quality with a chemistry, or even in which you're getting smaller molecules.
So cells have to keep all the time on the atmosphere by using energy to keep their molecules in very complex forms that have been affected in biological activity.
The privacy of these experiments when all the cell comes to the Internet is what makes the end of death.
That's why organisms can't just go back to life as they're already dead.
We can ask light into someone's theory, but it's not going to help if the other processes that are related to the rich region doesn't work more.
Basically, the electrical electrical transformation doesn '
It can prevent people to die, but it's not a body of a body, or an extension of reduction.
So it seems that all our different medical engineers can only take the information but not make it.
But it's not just as simple as it sounds because the babies are working on technology and medical technology as a device, which describe a situation that can be true, where people in the past were thinking.
In the future, these babies will come back to me more far.
How many experiences in the capacity of their life are or to survive and creative situations by their biological processes in which they're actually making.
And a research study to read a country to achieve the same result by making people later when new technologies would be able to help them.
Look, if the cells and physicians, there's a little bit of hundreds of dollars, and physics actually creates.
Even if all of the cells of a person's cells have already been read, it can still be used by a patients of robots, which move all the molecules back to their modern situations, and then go back to all the cells at the same time, theater and it's going to just keep the body out of the summer.
So if we're thinking about life not how engineers, but on a situation of a certain energy that's learning ourselves, death is just the process of the Internet called the food.
And it turns out that somebody's really cool is not about science, but it's just about how many of this Internet we're able to become.
The work, the relationship to human beings right now, are used for human rights, has happened a lot of forms around the world.
But one institution also has to control our global size as well as in its own network.
The Atlantic Atlantic, which happened from the 20th century to the 19th century and in the 19th century, brought in more than 10 million African people to me in America.
The effect that it's the effect that it's not just about these work and on their office, but on the economy and the history of big parts of the world.
There were hundreds of years of connection between Europe and Africa through the Middle East.
But the Atlantic Atlantic started in her 20th century with Portugal Foundation in Africa, and I've been sitting in books in America a little bit later.
The tumor that's discovered in the new molecules, and there's been a series of planets, and there's been a lot of workers, and there's not enough computers in this room that's working to work the new land.
The American children who have worked, but many of the new diseases, while others have been in effect.
And that's how we're going to stand at the two trees to work, the doctors looked at Africa.
The African workers were over hundreds of years in different forms.
A couple of work in this room, with this animal is limited in time to buy their insects.
Others were more like a long amount of doctors.
In a few companies, work can be part of the family of the resources, to be a nation, and even to go to the office of power.
But when juveniles came to the products and the products of products, women, parents for work, to the African, and the insects had a good reason to explain.
They've seen the people who've been familiar with primary villages but according to the animals, or not only war and most of them.
We need a car, the rich and the rich and their governments, and we're going to get them right now.
The African governments that have achieved the workforce, but deep in the big theory of light has been created for competitive competition.
The wisdom work is doing other patients, and the program has become a reason for war, instead of its result.
In order to protect themselves from mathematics to work, from the machines that have created two doctors, which are also in work.
Social School has become a device, which is two economic companies around the continent.
And about working on themselves, they've been curious that you can't imagine.
After we've been able to do a park on the wind, we've been able to learn today, and we know, they've been working on Facebook through America.
About 20 percent of them have never seen worse.
Most judgments at the same time were tremendous, and there were some more people you could under the story.
While Scott problems have made a lot of diseases, and other people will come back from the story because of some, I can start to say, their judgments have taken their walls on how they work as a baby.
Some optimistic judgments took their eyes.
A lot of Americans out of the continent we never saw alone before, and we thought they were getting, of taking people without the galaxy and went back to the past.
Fife to feed, I'm just going to avoid suffering, they're the struggle and they've lost their own, when they believe death, meaning they're going back home.
These are the ones that survive and spread very, very different, and the relationship to them like a task.
There were children who were strong over the philosophy and the team went on, while the men were going to do dances to remove them in order to prevent information.
What's happened to Africa that came to the new world of how the work of the work still affects their fingers today and know well.
But what you don't talk about victims is the effect of the Atlantic Twitter's future of Africa.
Not only did there have been decades of millions of people from her income population, but because most of the workers who have had men, the digital impact for a long time was even bigger.
When the employees came out of the outside outside and finally in America and Europe, the Africa's citizens who have been based on the students, and we've left them open to the Canada California.
And the Mexico's Foundation of three doctors will be able to live from the unprecedented wisdom that's designed today.
The Atlantic Atlantic Atlantic also translated to the development of the global analogy.
Most of the African workers didn't have a deeper reason than we're going to live on what's going to look at, but the doctors who are universal politicians, and that time it's going to come out of the month and create products, we need to have access to the leadership that's about their equality.
So they'd argue that the African African people were in biology and scientists are going to work, and they're going to do big efforts to save the theory.
So, the work in Europe and the Americans who are optimistic, what makes it possible to work and make their future to get a change in society.
In all of these ways, the Atlantic Atlantic was a huge independence that influenced a lot after it's inevitable.
The human eye is a wonderful diversity, which is able to identify between some political politicians, or to change from the screen before you're not the price of three years ago.
In fact, the most difficult structures for this kind of party and we've ever thought to be so complex that Charles Darwin had been the idea that they've been developed in the highest level.
And yet, it's exactly what happened, started more than 500 million years ago.
The story of human eye begins with simple theory, like this one is found in the creatures of a unique cell, like Google.
It's a collection of sensitive proteins that are related to the activity of the energy, that's acting when it comes out, and that's why I can.
A more complicated version of the light baby can find in the sky, frog.
In the creativity that you don't forget, you can feel better at the direction of the light comes.
In its use, its ability to enable organism to look for regrets.
Over thousands of years, when these two theories are made more and more than some organisms, they've developed a little bit.
The result was an effect of the decision, which brings the party in a dramatic way, scares the eyes by doing it that it allows the theory to get into the eye.
He's TV, the ancestors of the students, using a concept of reference to a new party.
Although the eye of the eye allows simple images, the main step to the eye as we know it is doing.
Think it evolved through different cell cells that put the fear to information today, what you can go into the eye with a dinosaurs that improve the emotions not just the fact.
Social proteins that create on the surface, we've created a structure that's going to be able to study a certain point on the network.
It's the key to the capacity of the eye, when it changes its places to get to see the wind and the wind.
This structure of a research camera with doing a basis that's going to go in the end of the human eye.
Second stories in the middle of the middle of the Neanderthals called the Arix, which is the amount of light that's going to go into the eye, which is as a conversation that's known as a conversation, to keep her structure, without a fingerprint that's falling out of the gene.
But it's not less important to be the key of the brain, with the expansion of the virtual virtual democracy to work with the color images that it's got.
We know now it's far away from being a design form.
For instance, human networks become, with cells from a light cell that's far away from the surface of the eye.
It's the result of this is an accident, the energy nervous nerve has to explore the networks to get to the access to the air behind.
The local eyes of satellites, which evolved in French, has a beautiful network, which enables them to see without the surface.
My eyes of other creatures show different images.
Unfortunately, what's called the Philippo, there's eyes for two areas to look under the water, it's great to see the details and join.
Life, in a way to train without night, we developed a list of light that improves the amount of light that the eye can identify, what they're going to see is great, as well as the device.
It's just a few examples of the big diversity of the world.
So if you could design a cloud, would you do this another?
This question doesn't matter as somebody heard.
Today, doctors and scientists are looking at different concept to help the plants that are used to get in the Gullands of Iraq.
And in the uncomfortable future, the machines that we've been built at the same time of human eye maybe we can't be able to deal with evolution.
It was the last day in 2005.
I've been working in Iraq to the American civil rights of the organization.
I really loved my work, but I had one of these days where I felt a little bit of my wife.
So I was in the microscope to the office of the San Francisco.
Chris was in ALLS over 30 years, so we had huge institutions.
I went to California that I feel a little movement.
I've studied a number of issues in the team between citizens and civil rights -- an interesting village.
But I wanted that the ACCCLA will work on these issues much more, in a way that can actually do change.
So Chris was going to survive, and he said, "Well, all the issues you look at, what are the first five?"
"Well, there's a genetic evolution, a lot of technology, and biology.
Oh, there's the really cool issue, MRI and the use of the device, and...
Oh, of course, there's judgments on genes. "
"Watch on genes?"
"Yes, you know, oil on human genes."
"No!
You'll tell me that the United States of the United States are spending on some of the human body's body?
It can't be true. "
I went back to my office that I sent to three Americans.
And 20 minutes later, it's in my office.
"Oh my God! You're right! Who can we write?"
And Chris is a brilliant idea, but it almost doesn't know anything about the patents and the video that every day on genetics.
I knew something about genetics, but I didn't even have an interest, and I'm sure I didn '
So obviously we had a lot of what we learned before we could get a movement.
First of all, we had to understand exactly what was the sensors in Twitter when someone had a platform.
Technots on genes in general are rich of mistakes, but the other changes in disease are the ones that look like "DNA" DNA "-- which is, some of the DNA that's far away from the cell.
We've treated the genes of oil and say, "Look, don '
And that's true, but the problem is that every use of a gender is to be cool.
And the patients didn '
So what does that mean?
It means that you can't give your gene to a doctor and ask it to look at it, for example, see if there's some of them, without the network of the patent.
It's also saying that the project has the right to stop each one in this gene in the study or experiments.
Let's give the next next to optimism, sometimes most privacy companies, to make some of the human genome affected in patients.
Think about a big father, 10 with a long platform, a very long situation, that if not a patient, you can go in a real place.
The company that returned the patent on the two kinds of genes that are connected to the situation and develop the drugs.
But then they've been spread their legs and they've never invented it.
So another lab was going to offer the building, but the company that had been reduced in patients or what to express the lab on the project.
So as a result, for two years, no building was available.
Over this time, my father's growing up from the MT and a long time that I'm not in the room.
Technologists of genes are actually a problem in terms of patients.
But can there't there a way we can read about them as a adult?
It turns out that the sun sentence is going to just through a long list of data, that some things don't see there as oil.
You can '
And you can '
These things are just in very special experiments that have to stay free and not to be happy to one.
We'll see that DNA, the basic structure of life, that we've learned to create the production of all our proteins, is also the product of nature of nature, not matter if it's in our body and I'm sitting in the bottom of a party.
When we've been studying on this issue, we've gone around the Earth to talk to a lot of different experts -- scientists, medicine, interest, design and planning systems.
Most of the agreements that we're serious about countries, and at least in theory, in the life of life.
Everybody thought that our chance to remember in the statistics were about Afghanistan.
Why is that?
So, the path of the patent has seen these projects over over 20 years.
Oh, just as meaningful, thousands of judgments about human genes.
And the patents was deep inside the statistics, the biological industry around this eye, and the experience of Alexandria was taken over a year after Congress, and I made a place.
So the bottom poetry: In a simple sentence, there was just no chance to make these patients.
Now, not Chris doesn '
So we've been able to build our baby.
Now, little judgments tend to be: a company or a company in Chile on a woman who was still a little bit unimportant techniques.
We didn't really have been interested in this kind of data, and we thought that this baby is much bigger than that.
It was on a freedom of science, a medical, the rights of patients.
So we decided that we're going to develop a baby that didn't be like the typical data of judgments -- more like a civil rights.
And we've been able to identify a platform of a gene that's forming my patent as I've been reduced, and then to my legislation and then to a little bit of problems that we can tell the sentence about all of these judgments that are affected in patients and in the months.
We've found the world's world's world's world's leaders "Mr. Angeles," a company that's dealing in Scott to Texas, Wata.
Maria and I'm going to have a prototype on two genes, the BBR2 and the BRI.
There's people with certain mutations over these genes are thinking in a high risk of developing cancer that are part of.
Morma has used these projects to be able to remove a whole model on the BRA in the United States.
They've reminded a lot of jobs that offered BRA to stop.
The company has made a lot of money on the building -- more than 3,000 dollars.
They've tried to share their kids with the international community.
And maybe the worst of all, in a period of a few years, a microbes are going to do their building so that you can be able to learn other tons that it's by the holes in the French.
The value that comes from this period, for a couple of years, until 12 percent of the women who've done the building got a answer -- I've come out of a hospital that had to be positive.
That's the Line Mexico.
My sister's sister's sister, Einstein, opened cancer that's about 40 and it's built by a microscope.
The building was a molecule.
The family felt great.
It means that the cancer of Elin's cancer is probably not going to go in the family, and the other companies didn't have to be built.
But two years later, Charlin or a living with cancer that are part of the day.
It turns out that the sixth of the 12th century was between the 12-percent that was getting out of the communities of a corruption.
If Einstein was receiving the baby's results, Charlie was a house, and her liberal cancer could be aware.
Once we decided about microbes, so we had to create the evolution of problems and experts that we could read these problems.
We've finished with 20 problems that we're very positive: genetic trees, geneticians who have a motivation, organization, four big organizations that have come in more than 60,000 scientists and professionals, and there's privacy that I can't afford to afford, and there's no privacy that I don &apos
One of the big challenges that we had in the classroom was to understand what the best way to get the information.
So in order to argue that what's teaching is not the invention, and the genes of BRA were the products of nature, we had to explain that there were kinds of kinds of issues, like: What's the DNA?
How do you understand DNA? And why don't it invent?
We've spent hours of hours with the arguments and our experts, trying to find ways to explain these genes in abstract but exactly.
And at the end of a car looking at the use of metaphor, like the gold.
So in the DNA -- it's like a half of the gold or a result of a part of a window.
You can't be able to put the process of the golden memory, but you can't put the platform itself.
It might take a lot of work that's couldn't be able to replace and find the gold outside; you can't put the platform, it's still the same.
And the gold, once it's stressed, human beings can be used for all sorts of things that you couldn't use when you could use it, you can make a little bit of a molecule -- you still can't notice as a platform, it's still the same.
So now it's 2009, and we're ready to get our traffic.
We've done in the French French Center in the New York City of New York City, and the baby's going to look at the Street Street.
In 2010, the Scott Scott Francisco published his future -- 62 pounds -- and we're going to have a space for our team.
Basically, we couldn't get on what small happens is we'll describe this data.
I mean, our creativity -- it was pretty good, but not so good.
How does it developed a deep understanding of this thing as a product?
We just couldn't understand how it happened.
So it turns out, the function of the oil that worked in my time, there was no idea -- it was a scientist.
He wasn't just a scientist -- he had a cartoon in biology.
And what's the luck of the amazing!
More and then I'm going to notice the sentence of the French of the United States.
And this is where things were really interesting.
First of all, once we're very training, the United States of the United States began.
So in this strategy, the government has access to a sentence in the side of microbes.
But now, in a remote diplomacy to her patients, the United States of the United States has access to the government to reinvent the government to reinvest the argument of this strategy, and it's coming to the institution that DNA is not the same to the judgment of oil.
It was really a big thing, completely unusual.
The French of the French Central School invented all of the little babies, and we have a very, very, very, very, very, very small problem.
So even with the development of the development of this way, we're going to stop.
And we did.
Obviously.
The Chinese decision was part, 2 to one.
But the two judgments that we've been doing, we've done this in a very different reasons.
The first one, the judgment of the air, was built to myself with modern biological theory -- to make sense.
And he decided that Mr. Korea was making a new model -- unusual.
More or I didn't even argue it, so it was very surprising.
The second, the optimist, said he's basically agreed with us that DNA is a product of nature.
But she said, "I don't want to take the biological industry."
Three, the San Francisco, agreed us.
So now we're going to just try on the top sentence.
And when you're going to build the top sentence, you have to get a question that you want to have the sentence of the sentence.
In all of these questions, I've been curiosity of a long story, something like a whole road with a lot of professors, "which's a" here's "and" even "there.
We've got the most powerful question we've ever got.
Four words: human genes are going to take a platform?
Now when Chris asked me for the first time I thought about these words, I said, "Well, I don't know.
I think you have to say, "Is DNA from a building can be a platform?"
I want you to have judgments to be exactly the same response that I had when I put this thing from a million years ago. "
All right, I couldn't argue with that.
The summer of the summer that's coming from one percent of all the answers that it's getting, and it's going to agree to hear our own.
The day of the molecule came, and it was very exciting, very exciting -- a long service of people outside, people were standing in two: 30 times in the morning to try to get out of the sentence.
There are two organizations of the other cancer, "action to the CO2 cancer," FOCCA, "energy on the stairs of the sentence.
Chris and I sat down in San Francisco, a moment before he was supposed to get the most important argument in my career.
I'm very clear that I've been more out of it.
But every step that's going to happen, and as I went into the sentence of the sentence and I looked around the faces of companies: the women who were our privacy and the privacy of their deep people, my genetic genetic genetic and opened up time from their business to be able to be able to get their business and have their business resources to reduce their own organizations from the stairs of the sentences
In the room, there's also three leaders from human genome, including one of the partners of the DNA's DNA, James Texas, who's going to want to build the sentence, where he's going to treat small judgments on the genes as a second. "
So the diversity of the communities that we've come in in this room and the drugs that each of them did to make this day find a lot of things about what was on the planet.
The argument itself was fascinating.
Chris was in a very clear way.
But for me, the most excited solution was to watch the sentence of the sentence and resources with DNA in India, with a series of the change of nervous problems, very similar to what our sentences did over the last seven years.
The second judgment of DNA is built to the growth of the Amazon.
The Print Robert Bertie brought it from the size of the Alexander's dog.
And in one of the computers that we're facing, the judgment is very, very, very small that DNA is called "The nature of the seat there."
So we felt safe about ourselves when we left the police in the same day, but I would never be able to reduce the result: you're going to go to Africa.
"The DNA that's affected in nature is the production of nature, and you can't put women in Twitter because it's exactly.
More about yes, teachers don't make anything. "
Within 24 hours of decision, five of this device that they're going to start to offer the BRA.
Some of them were the best to offer the buildings in a lower price study.
Some of the best part of the building is too much more than a musician we're offering.
But of course, the decision is going through a lot of microbes.
It's a certain kind of 25 years of making judgments about human genes in the United States.
It's just a meaningful device for us to grow and investment in medicine.
And it's going to help sure that patients like Gabby, and Jlin would have access to buildings that they need.
Three weeks after the sentence published his decision, I got a little bit of a binary.
He was in New York City, a professor at the University of New York and one of the first people that we went to visit when we started to take this baby.
I opened it to see in a little lab.
So we took a big risk of living this baby.
Some of what we can give us the courage to take this risk was that we're doing the right thing.
The process took almost eight years from the beginning of the end of the end of the end, with a lot of different patterns of the way.
It's a little bit lucky to help, but it's not the communities that we've got, the United States that we've created, that we can go back to the face.
Thank you.
Thank you.
How do your phrase know exactly where you are?
The answer is in 19,,300 miles away from your head in London who's implementing the time of an artist who's based on us as an intuition.
Wow.
Let's project it.
First of all, why is it so important to know what's on the audience when what's worried about us is the place?
The first thing that your phone has to know is how far it's far from the London.
Each trillion lies the same radio and you hear from your space to your phone at the speed of light.
Your phone gets the time that I've been using to think the remote to London by using the spinal cord, from a time, and it's a time of light and it's how long it's time to grow.
But there's a problem.
A light is really fast.
If we'd just be able to think for a long time to the next year, every place on Earth, and a lot more far away, it would look at the same from the London.
So to think the ice for a few meters in the universe, we need the best idea that we've ever found.
And here's where there's an astronomy, how many of them are so countries that they're not in the year even if we've been working more than 300 million years.
Atlantic eyes work because of the physicist physics.
All the eyes have to be a bubble.
In other words, there's still to do some strange action to train and collect drugs in time.
It's just like a smoke is looking at the point of a matrix under the lab, the baby's baby's baby's baby's baby who's left by the lab that's called the energy of atoms.
Here's where the physics of physics were intuitive.
Monico Kenya says that atoms are not energy, but they can't take a amount of connections.
Instead, autonomous energy is limited to the students' students.
We call it autism.
As a simple geology, we thought about income with the vehicle inside the wall.
When you're looking at the speed, you're in a very serious way that's about 30 miles an hour 110 kilometers per hour.
Now, if you had a genetic car, you wouldn't be very happy for a billion.
Instead, you'd be a countries, we're going to go, from one to a second.
Atlantic, when you go from one energy to another, the theory would say that the energy that the energy is different to the lights, as a bubble, the energy change is different to the number, which is called wonderful, as the lights.
This iPhone is what we need to create our eye.
The GGPS is looking at a very expensive atmosphere in the Democrats.
In the case of 133, the iPhones of the iPhone is 9,2,6,600.
It's 9 billion dollars in a year.
It's a really great idea.
It doesn't matter how much a scientist is, every Twitter, a very high diversity that's going to draw in a few years.
However, every atom will get 133 buildings just down the same speed.
So thank you for the Atlantic idea, we're getting a long time from the last billion years, and a very early country of the hotel.
Let's disappear from the fact that you're almost building on Earth.
We know now that you're in the middle of the London.
In other words, you're where it's on the surface of a car that's around the audience.
We're learning the remote to London that we're receiving another park.
It's going to do it, and with four countries, and a little bit of a baby using the relationship of Einstein, you can learn your species to one country in space.
So it's all about a web: a network of millions of dollars, atoms and cartoons, as an intuition, a relationship, a platform, and you.
There's no problem.
"Hey."
"Good morning. The colors look great."
Have you ever wondered how your dogs live the world?
Here's what it looks like.
Not really interesting.
But what it means is a very different story.
And it begins in the key to her patient.
When your dog is going to take the first features of the Internet, the extinction part, her body's body's body's body's body's body's body's reduction.
The ability to bring together with every room, to move in the train, help us move the direction of the wind and so through the first moments of the wind, the environment begins not just to be aware of the kinds of things there but also to their students.
When I'm just going to get into the nose, a little bit of what I'm going to reduce it to two villages, one to hate where I'm just going to feel.
The second theory will go into a region with cells that look like the iPh.D., some of the hundreds of millions of them, with five million.
And we've built a big way that we're going to have what's going on and we're going to go through it beyond, dozens and burn through their fingerprints, and so we've created a Western lab of light that's helping the molecules and allow us to go back to the wind and get back in the
But all this weird architecture didn't have a lot of help without working the amount of information that the collection.
And it turns out that the political system that we've learned that we've been able to take a lot more and less stressful in economists than people.
All of this enables to build and remember a couple of trees of small walls that are going to get 100 million of what our fingers can identify.
You can get the time there in a small room, the door would be a problem to reduce it in the atmosphere and make the streets without a problem.
And it's all over the street, every person I'm a plan, every person's content, every single day of a tree, every kind of tree, and all the birds that everyone has a professor that says to your economy is, where it's, what it's true.
There's been a lot more powerful than our own, the wind of the dog can identify things that don't look at all.
A typical system that's fine, which is called the Homo Bay, over the rise of the cosmos, reminds the hormones that all animals, including people, who are released in nature.
It allows attention to identify biological physicists, or to understand between ideas or not.
It reminds them about our emotional situations, and it can even tell them when someone is in a patient or a patient.
Because our wind sensors is better than our sensors, our perception to connect to the brain to emotional emotions, we might even say that the perception of a dog is more safe than our safe.
But the most amazing thing about your dog is that it can know in time.
The past works that we've been left by talking about things, and by the life of machines that had been recently recently, they'd be what you'd done after.
We've finished a way like Brazil and trees are to take long data that people's knowledge of somebody's knowledge was there, and what they're going to do, and how they feel.
And the future is in this crisis, you're going to get them on something that's very hard before you see it.
Instead, we're seeing something at the same moment, represents all the story from the end.
In some of the best examples of collaboration between people, dogs help us by changing these stories.
They can respond with good for people in young, or with Aganda because they're going to exist as a depression of the hormones that are familiar with the dog.
With an accident, they can't even move on invisible threats that make cancer.
It turns out, the best friends of human beings don't live the same things like us, but one of my wonderful nose is going to find a different world beyond our eyes.
If you know a person who's worse, the risks they need to learn to write and eat with their imagination.
And many of the world's parts, it's still the body of the body to reduce patients to use their "software."
Even the word to imagine a good risk, not only in English, but many other languages also.
But if the rest of the left is so wrong, so why does this happen from the beginning?
Today, about decades of the world's population are left.
Social architecture shows that it was so at least over 5,000 years, with about 10 percent of the person who show the differences in the way the price of the nerves, and some of the future projects that show up to the use of the left.
And despite what a lot of think, there's democracy is not a choice.
You can watch it even before the audience based on the growth of the world around.
So, if we're a democracy is words, does it mean it's genetic?
Well, yes. No.
It's a identical cell, that they have them genes, can be a different project.
In fact, it's happening in the same generations like other genes.
But the risks to be that those are not accurate and motivated by your parents' minds of surprising relationships.
If your father was left, but my mom and art, you've got a risk of 17 percent to the left, while two days, I'll have a child who's left most of the time.
There's a very small change that's going to be in the age of a galaxy, but the risks are going on by your genes.
That's because there's a reason that evolutionary has a little bit of left, and it's been killed for thousands of years.
And while there were a few theories that were trying to explain why the babies were at all, that we tried to explain why most people and species, from mathematical model to offer the real relationship between women and women and women's strengths and human evolution.
The door for being left are the most obvious in action that can happen, like learning what I'm spending.
For instance, about 50 percent of the good samples in the environment were left.
Why?
Think about it as a surprising solution.
Because the left is a beginning science, they're also dealing and early, and they're also left and get most of the time in order to train millions.
So when the markets are going to be one of the other words, the left is better than the most amazing model, while the state wasn't ready.
The wisdom theory, in the income of food in the population and in a lot of parts of the left, it's an example of choice to happen to the general benefits of communities.
But before the principles of evolution, and groups that have a little bit of interactive solutions to grow up and disappear.
If people were just fighting and insects over the human evolution, the natural choice would be easier for the left and do so much of them, it wasn't going to be more carrying.
So in a world of competition, 50 percent of the population was left.
But the human evolution works by collaboration, as well as competitive.
And stress stress and pushed the refugees to the other direction.
In the age of the body, where professionals don't depend on most, only four percent of the best players are left, and the most important phenomenon of women's women's year every day.
It's just like young players can find more effective than samples to the place, a lot of the important tools we're going to do with most of us.
Because the left are less good at using these tools, they're going to get very high theory, they're less successful in the world that's going to be abundant, and finally disappear from the population.
So by exposing the software of the people who are left in the general population, as well as the data from a different sport, the model shows that the picture of the left is a little bit like a small science, but it's going to replace the web that comes from different competitions that play over time.
And the most interesting thing is what the numbers can tell us about the different population.
On the bed of the complete refugees that don't exist in beautiful animals, to one of the highest percent of those in small societies, we can even find that the answer to some of the animals of human evolutionary evolution has already been built.
Kenya is the next universal language.
In the '60s, it was a physicist who knew the wall.
In the two years, it probably was money.
But to the generation of people, thank you because it's the weight of our world.
And that means that we need people more diversity to build these products, because we don't see computers and buildings and engineers, to see them as things that they can play with, and so on.
Our primary journey of the world's privacy and technology started in the age of 14.
I had the real real love in a worse room, and the worst guy was just in the United States of the United States, Maria.
And I did what every decade in 10 was like to do.
I wanted somehow to get my love, so I built a website, it's here.
And in 2001, there was no atmosphere, there was no Facebook, there was no interest.
So I had to learn to get all the love and love.
And so the plan started for me.
It started as a way to achieve itself.
Just as I was a little bit smaller, I'd use colors and clothes.
And when I was older, I was using our goal to be reduced.
But then, there were other things to feel about them, as a series of Germany and the small places in French and offer to the universal university and my philosophy.
And I started to be one of these people and I felt that computers are scared and techniques.
Here's what I think today.
And small babies don't know they're not supposed to love computers.
And small communities are amazing.
They're really good at looking at things and being countries and they ask amazing questions like, "What?"
And they don't know they're not supposed to love computers.
It's the parents who do it.
That's what we're the parents who feel that the computer science they're going to try to take information then, a strange strategy that's going to create the message.
It's as if the power is far away from life today today like, say, nuclear physics.
And they're a huge part of this.
There's a lot of transportation and control and information and algorithms and artists, prototypes and prototypes.
And we're a community, we've done small computers more.
We've built a letter of the platform on one other on the other hand between the people to the point that we didn't have access to how computers work or how to talk to them.
And we teach our kids how the human body works, we teach them how science works and we even tell them that if they really want to be astronomy, they can really be.
But when the kids come to me and ask, so, what is this algorithm? "
Or, "How did the computer know what happens when you're half a page, how do it know what a video to show?"
Or, "Linda, is the Internet?"
We're the adults, we're become weird.
"It's magic," How many of us say.
"It's complicated," the other people say.
Well, it's no one of them.
It's not a complexity.
It's all really simple and really fast.
Science and computer scientists built these amazing machines, but they made them very strange to us, and also the language that we're talking to computers so we don't know how to talk more about computers without our modern use.
And so no one's identity that when I'm going to get normal in French, I've actually learned my skills and my patterns.
And when I was excited, I was actually working after a series of symbols that had never been born in the content.
And the long journey of Brazil's Robert's journey to find an English language between a math and grow my home within a computer.
I was a program, but nobody knows it.
The kids of today, they're half, they're getting safe and safe their way in the world.
But if we give them tools to build with computers, we're growing just consumers instead of creating.
All this journey led me to this little girl.
Her name is close, it's six.
It's completely scary, it's teaching a little bit of traffic.
And every time I was born in a problem without trying to teach myself a plan like, "What is it a self-convenient program or what's end?" I'd try to imagine how a little girl who has changed the problem.
And I wrote a book about it, and I knew the same things that most of me was going to go like this.
I'm just learning that you're not supposed to open out of your genes under your bed.
And even the big ones in problems are a group of small problems that are built together.
And most of us got it to the companies, the color of the Internet culture.
It has friends like a regulation, which is beautiful, but it doesn't want to play with the other kids.
It has friends like the green robots that are really companies but very cool.
There's friends like California who really works in a conversation, but a little bit hard to understand.
There's an atheist, and so on.
In the world most of us, you learn technology through game.
And for example, computers are really good at coming back on things, so the way that most of us don't work like this.
It's my favorite dance on most of us, it's going to go, "Dad, Paul, Paul, President, Paul Paul Field."
And you're learning to the same leadership over four times.
And you're learning to "While" we've got to come back on the floor in one foot.
And you're learning to "until we've got to come back on this floor until I'm really nervous.
And basically, you learn that there's no chemical answers.
When I came to the world's school program, I had to really ask the kids how they see the world and what kind of questions they have is that I'd have a regular organization.
I would start to show kids these four images.
I'd show them a picture of a car, a capacity, a capacity, a dozen dogs.
And I would ask, "What do you think it's a computer?"
And the kids were very happy and say, "No one of those is not a computer.
I know what this computer is: It's this device that's an artist who's a lot more time. "
But then we've been talking about things and we'd find that in fact, car is a computer, it's got a very small system.
And dog -- dog is maybe not a computer, but we've got a morning or maybe there's a computer.
And the capacity of capacity, they have so many kinds of computers, like the beautiful system.
And children, you know what?
Basically, dogs are computers and there's even the lights that want them.
And we're really ready and we're going to give them these little groups with small buttons on them.
And I say to kids, "Today you have this magic capacity to become everything in this room for the computer."
And again, the kids say, it sounds really hard, we don't know the right answer to that. "
And I tell them, "Don't worry, your parents don't know the right answer.
They just started to hear about this thing called the Internet of things.
But you're the kids, you're going to be the ones that really live in the world where everything is a computer. "
And then I had this little girl who came to me with me and she said, "This iPhone, if it was a computer, it was a color."
And I said, "It's really a good idea, what can it do?"
And he thinks, and he says, "If the iPhone was a computer, we'd go to the iPhones with our dad and we'd be in this iPhones, it could be a filmmaker."
And that's the moment I'm looking for, the moment the kids understand that the world is actually not ready, that a really amazing way to do the world is by building technology and that each of us can be part of this change.
A recent story, we're also building computers.
And we're familiar with the boss and the tiny memory that can help us remember things.
And after we set our computer together, we'll also design evolution for us.
And my favorite story is this little girl, she's six years of my favorite thing in the world is to be asteroid.
And the child, there's a tremendous identity and it's completely known in our tiny computer, because you understand, it's building a small civilization between its own digital.
And my father, the asteroids looked at the road around Mars, on the other side of the hole's important room is to bring the father back to the Earth.
And these kids will be a very different view of the world and the way we build it with technology.
Finally, as we're going to do the more technology world, more and more than all of us are more diversity, the world looks better and better.
So, imagine me, for a moment, the world in the stories that we tell about how things are doing not only can Linkin and to the cities and the cities and something, but also in the babies and viruses and virtues.
And imagine a world where a small experiment of disease, which is living in the reality of one African, they grow to be optimistic about technology.
They invent the forces and the opportunity and the limits of the world.
And the world of technology that's wonderful, again, a little strange.
When I was a kid, I wanted to be a story.
I liked to create a world where they found, and the favorite thing to do was to go in the morning.
After the rivers, I was a university.
And in Arabic, I've been going to sleep in Kenya.
And the program became the perfect professional for me.
I'm still making a world.
Instead of stories, I create them with my hands.
You can have a program that can be able to build all of our little world with our lives of our lives and the forms of behavior.
It's going to create something because it's something that's going to do with the green power of the galaxy.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The humanity was a decline for eyes.
The history of human progress is one of the most exciting speed, and one of the most important genes in this history was the communities of the voice.
Not a lot of after the first successful plants, Texas were going to push their airplanes to fly faster.
But when they did this, the Western Western Western and large forces on the airplane and why they're going to save more.
A couple of trials were trying to push the problem through certain molecules, which are many times of the interest in tragedy.
Finally, in 1947, a design story, like fossil fuels, the fact that all of us, you can go to the American Chicago, and I'm going to go to the Texas "1 quickly of 127" ", and become the first person to bring the first person to the communities and know what's going on.
The FL 1 was the first between a lot of airplanes on other children, with more insects that come from more than three.
The airplanes are very quickly on the sound of these galaxies with noisy noise and known as a child, which can make people living under or even move to the buildings.
On this reason, scientists around the world are going to have a place on children, trying to reduce their own religion in atmosphere, where they're going, and how powerful they're going to be.
In order to understand better how scientists live in children, let's start with the basic principles of sound.
And imagine a little bone in the way that's going on.
What do you see?
The father's caused to find out instead of what's going on in the same direction.
These tumors that are used to grow in Britain called the galaxy.
In the same way, although we don't see them, microbial microbial, like Australian system, we've created a galaxy that's outside.
These galleries of the wheelchair depends like the temperature and the temperature of the air as they know.
At the same time, it's about 1225 miles.
But instead of growing up on a local surface, the galaxies are now known as electronics, with the voice that's going to move through these neurons that's going to get.
Now imagine a microscope, like a complexity.
When the microscope is going to be in some direction, the next wheels before you go and go on.
The biggest galaxies is the definition to the famous Paul Prize, in many nervous objects that sound with a higher response.
But all of the motor moves to worse their communities, they've left one species inside the other.
It's when the nervous nerves on sound, and it's very quickly what it's created, that the picture is changing.
When it's a galaxy that it's created, while it's making new products from our current species, the wheelchairs and half together, we create the insector.
No sound didn't sound like it's going to go to the side because the object is better than the voice that it's created.
Only after he's going to get the road and hear the sound of the sound.
Instead of insurance, but it's made the liquid, and it's a device that's got the motor on the road when it's going to know what it is.
It's doing it possible to enable the region that's affected by the hospital.
What about to understand how powerful the difference was?
It's able to transform it in the famous history to find the presence of stress pressure in the air's airplane that's known as a way.
The result is a pressure that's known as the National.
What does that mean?
Well, the sound difference happens when there's a statement that's going on in stress, and galaxy can listen to water: one to the first pressure of the airplane, and another stress when it works, and the pressure is going to go back.
It's caused to build as a treatment, but it's in a general way that it's in a unique way that's living together to the people.
In fact, molecules are thinking that use this principles can actually reduce the species and the power of water on children for children's atmosphere and the data with a virtue, and there's a research research research that's using these effects.
In the day, a trick was trying to take over the land and I've been told.
So, are the water about children are a plan?
Not exactly.
While we're trying to find ways to change them, other animals have been used in the water that can be used.
The tremendous experiment was maybe we could be able to be able to be able to spread at the speed of the voice, over 1,200 miles, probably to get rid.
Some species of survivors can create galaxies in the water, and they're going to even get rid of a very hard joy with the problems.
So while we've made a lot of people in our brains after the speech, it turns out that nature was there.
It's a place inside the list of the Eric's speech, and it's a little bit like a little bit of power on your body.
It's called the virus.
Like the manager acts in society, her job is to worry that the cells in your body work well.
It's doing it in the use of hormones to provide enough to each of them.
The leadership is made very, very interesting that every one of these little cell cells that look needed, that we're getting the hormones in the bottom of the device that's going to go into today.
Twenty of the most important hormones that it's created are Darwin and Twitter and Twitter, or TT4.
As a life, the function of the hormones is to take every cell in a body of a body and make a lot of magnitude.
It's about the details of the body, the kind of response that our cells are doing to provide energy.
These hormonal motivations without the categories to build more effective, and make our cells to solve faster materials.
When you need more energy, at the bottom of the bottom of the hormones to get the materials.
At the end of the time, the virus is enabled to our cells to use energy, to grow up.
At the bottom of the virus that I've been studying by the brain's body's brain, at the bottom of the horizontal cortex, and by the way it's going to send her life.
The function of the smaller bone is to feel if the hormones are so high or high, in this case it's a liberty of hormones in the form of remote hormones.
Even in this system that's control in this point, with that, the community sometimes missing.
A certain diseases, a big size at the bottom of the cell or a museum so that in the body can spend the healthy and make it a sense of the brain's mind.
The first problem that it's causing theism.
It means that the cells are constant in which they're going to look like to make diverse materials and oxygen.
They become active as a result, what they say with the professor and a very high theory that's more likely to be able to build more often, and let's go on the ground.
They're also feeling life, invitation, and when they're listening to sleep.
The opposite problem is a theory, which happens when the platform has a little bit of hormones, which means that you don't get enough of life to live them.
As a response, the cells become unprecedented from the atmosphere.
People with Darwin and theory see a symbols of the web, autonomy, sensitive sensors, scares and depression.
Fortunately, there's medical treatments that can help activate the activity of the device again, and bring the body back back to the design rate.
It's not such a small thing, without the platform was in the power of power.
But at the University of healthy, we've learned our cells so well in effective effects that it can keep us working in a part without the conversation that it's there.
Mr. Mr. Jusan: Al -- God's mother.
Egyptian Angelson: The New York Times.
MK: Oh...
My father's clock.
Al: Oh's []].
AK: In Ebola, we make 680 meters of plastic plastic every day.
It's about 14 minutes.
And when it comes to Palestinian change, less than five percent of them are reduced.
MK: We know that's changing the picture that you have of the human.
It also changed our own, when we discovered this, when we discovered that as a few seconds of plastic in violence come to build and then our lights then to our ocean.
And those who don't even come to the ocean, they're a loud chair.
AK: So we decided to do something about this.
And we've been working almost three years now to try to say not to a plastic change on our home.
And we've had some meaningful successes.
MK: We're sisters, and we're going to go to the best school on Earth: in the Hurrian school.
The green school is not just a second in the way it's built, but it's also in the way it's learned.
We teach us to become leadership today, something that's normal and can't change.
Audience: One day we had a city in the classroom where we learned about people meaningful, like China, California and the Gabby.
When we went home at the same day, we had always wanted to be meaningful.
Why should we wait to wait to be adults to be meaningful?
We wanted to do something now.
MK: When we sat at the same time, we went through ideas and thought about all the problems that we're going to face.
And the only thing that Bill Lolly was the most suffering was the plastic.
But this is a huge problem.
So we looked at why there was an astronomist for the children: Palestinian change.
And the idea is born.
AK: We started exploring, and let's say, as we learned more, there wasn't something good about plastic change.
And you know what?
We don't even need them.
MK: We've really been inspired by the efforts to say not to plastic in many other places, what I'm going to read is not for books like Einstein.
AK: And that's how the idea became the beginning of Palestinian change.
MK: In the years we did the campaign, we learned a lot.
The first lesson: You can't do everything to me.
You need a big team of children like you, and that's how we've put the team of plastic change.
The budget team are all children from all over the human, in other places and between local.
And we took them, we started a lot of letters, based on a tremendous tremendous tree on the web and also on a wall, a unique camera and I've left in the schools and I've been looking at all in two years, boxes, boys, satellites.
And most importantly, we're reducing a good data, data like a network, two blind data from the same 100 percent energy material, and we've done by local entrepreneurs on the ground.
AK: We're saying as a professor, I've spent 800 families.
The first village of our first friend is to love our team, so that's help.
We've focused on making information without animals, because there's the change that we need to happen.
The village is already three of what's going to become a plastics of plastic.
Our first experiments get to the government to join and join failure.
So we thought, "The average... A tree with a million places.
They can't get away from us right? "
MK: Yeah!
Audience: But, who would be five million deaths like, thousands of dollars?
And I've been interested -- until we've learned the lesson of a few years: think outside of the box.
Somebody reminded that the airplane of Alexander is 16 million income income instructions a year.
MK: But how do we go to the airplane?
And here's a number of three: the picture.
We've come out to the direction.
We passed the service.
And then it was my boss, and then it was a brilliant, and then the bridge audience, and then...
We'd put it up and we thought, well, here's the service again.
And after a couple of days, I just had to just be a day in the task, we came to the end of a year's journey of these.
And I gave me a person "The Palestinian" and I've been a very nice man, he said, "We're a child's voice of a man" "" I can't believe why I'm going to say, but I'm going to give you a
I mean, at the first half of us there, we've got almost 1,000 places.
How big does this response?
There's a number four: We need to face all the society, students to manipulate students from other people.
And hope for the presidential school, we've had access to the basis of Salvanian Science.
In Amazon, we're going to teach us that the head of the United Nations don't live on tremendous trees -- but even if children ask here.
But he's going to make the information, and now we're working very much with the red art.
MK: John's big to teach us the power of human networks.
He started with a group that had one group and now she had 4,000 groups around the world.
We are one of them.
It's a real inspiration.
If you're a terrorist, you're going to get you.
We're communicating, the worst disease of the Internet between art.
AK: But we've learned a lot about suffering, MK: How do you deal with chapters, OK: Ha. Man: Ha. MK: companies, companies. MK: We learned more about people in their culture.
MK: It's not always easy.
Sometimes it's done a little bit hard to get like things.
AK: But last year, we did exactly this.
We've been going to be able to pass a talk, and our parents will take us to visit the privacy of the Guini Guinea.
We've discovered the power of a noise that it's done to get to my goals.
Yes, by the end of the story, when we met our parents over and over and over, two and we decided, "We're going to pay attention!"
Audience: And you're probably able to imagine their expectations.
It took a lot of convinced, and not just our parents but friends and teachers.
I've got a serious interview about doing this.
So we've met with a vision, and we've come to the 10 to not eat the invasion and the investment every day of Alexanda to meet us to talk about how to stop the plastics in these.
Or, "Man Man Man," as it's called in the Amazon, started.
We used the social media to support our goal for the second day, the police started to come to the school.
What do these girls do?
And we knew that we didn't make our model to show the best to do this noise -- we could go to the prison.
But, here, it worked.
Twenty-four hours later, we took from the school and we had to the local office.
MK: And here's it -- I'm going to have to meet and talk, and I'm going to be the home to my car and I'm going to grow up to my environment.
It's going to go on the security to help people's people's people's people's people's own to say not to Palestinian change.
And we're friends now, and on the basis of information, we're reminding us to the team of the security that it's done.
And really, recently, he wanted to just start with the same point of plastic in 2018.
Thank you. AK: And also, in the interview of Alexander, one of our machines are going to start from a plastic country in 2016.
MK: We've tried to share two plastic changes in life and love many different different from your next message to change the audience of public.
AK: Here's a production of our production, "I'm one night," we're all about it.
We're just going to give the experiences and the journey that we've remember about as a plastic device, and we've put the structure on their income and we've published their communities in the social media and some important tasks.
And for a window, it's very clear about those that they don't have a structure.
Audience: So, why do we actually tell you about this?
Well, part, it's because we're proud of results, together with our team, we'd be able to get to them.
But also because of the way, we learned that children can do things.
We can make things happen.
I'm a global dinosaurs about 10 and 12 when we started this.
We've never had business programs, not a concept strategy, and not a important agenda -- just the idea of millions of friends who work with us.
Everything we wanted to do was to stop these plastics out and explore our beautiful house.
The children have energy doesn't have a motivation to be the change that the world needs.
AK: So all the kids of the beautiful world, but this challenge: to go on it!
We did the change.
We don't tell you that it was easy.
We tell you that it's going to be different.
We're kids maybe 25 of the population of the world, but we're 100 percent of the future.
MK: We still have a lot of work to do, but we know that we're not going to stop until the first question we're going to ask when you go to the airport of that they're going to be two: "Oh, you've got two years to plastic and want to stop them?"
So a person who has a human beings.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Right now, you're probably thinking to watch this video and stay again in a few minutes to watch it probably's probably okay.
But the more you're sitting, your body's going to be more electronic.
He's sitting there and he's told the moments until he's going to stand up and put it in.
It might sound a power.
Our bodies like to sit, right?
Not really.
Of course, to sit for a few moments, we can help us to get out of war or make a physical idea.
But today, our life makes us sit a lot more than we know, and our bodies just don't understand children like this again.
In fact, it's really the opposite.
The human body's human body is built to train, and you can see more about it in the way we build.
As we've got more than 360 prices, and about 700 lines of data that allow us to be opened.
The only physical structure of the body can give us the capacity to move the power of the blue power.
Our day depends on our movement to help the very well.
Our nervous nervous nerves, and our city of Alexander, which means that it's dealing ourselves to our knowledge.
So if any of the body's body's body's body's body's body is waiting for you to know, what happens when you're not?
Let's start with the media of the problem, molecules.
Your poetry is a long structure of ourselves and the trick that's sitting in.
Frances, serious muscles that are connected to ourselves to the whole life.
A way to sit down is with a metaphor and a smoke and a smoke that's scary, a pressure that's active for your service.
Over the time, it makes a constant player in your lab and your service, invented certain empowers, and surprising the presence of connections that are starting to solve the local conversation of the road.
This language is also a little bit of reducing your finger's home and sitting, which means that your lights have less water to expand when you're paying.
It's a problem because it's limited to entrepreneurs the amount of oxygen that's filled with your instructions.
Throughout to three muscles, the nervous nerves, the blind and the blind that create the amount of the body's culture.
The action itself of a prosthetic answer, to a little bit more sophisticated, and these more ideas really feel the pressure.
Have you ever felt uncomfortable that there's less in English when you're thinking?
In the most powerful areas, your nervous nervous nerves can replace, what's limited to the communities of the nerves, and makes sense, and reduce the refugees in the galaxies, what makes them less.
There's a time for a period that's also dealing the Californian Franklin and then, a very special region that's six days in the day, so when you're sitting, you don't have a good regulation like when you're moving.
Maybe the effects have the inevitation of the brain?
Most of the time, you're probably sitting in order to use the brain, but in a very expensive way, there's a long time that's actually going to work in this goal.
It's going to be scared to be scared of the water and like the oxygen that's going to go into your sea through the look.
Your brains require the two things to stay in our skin, so your gold lights probably just when your brain works.
Unfortunately, the negative effects of thinking about the production of the production of the product.
Scientists have found that there's a very long time to build a certain amount of cancer disease and disease can be translated, and problems and stars.
In fact, researchers have found that in the world, unless active activity is about 9 percent of the death over the time.
It's more than five million people.
So why does it look like the museum actually have the power to change our health.
But unfortunately, this big solution for this big person is just intuitive.
When you don't have a choice but sit, we'll try to replace the slides in a bridge, and when you don't have to be connected to the chair, you might know as possible, because you're going to have to have a right to yourself every half an hour.
But most importantly, we'll just look at your body in a movement, not to get this.
In fact, because the film is almost destroyed, why don't we always get really excited now?
We've developed your body in action.
It's going to give you later.
When you think about the "Antarctica" of Arabic, you're probably thinking about it.
But it turns out, maybe it was more like this.
In the third century before the history, the green, from the Sydney Central Syria, in the country to open the Francisco project that I didn't see.
The device invited every big weapon 50 times of the history of a future war, called Syria Turkey on the city.
The parents wanted to build the largest history ever, which was awesome to be a device to control Egyptian, oil.
But can the size of Amazon have been at all?
In the country of Arabic, no one was trying something like this.
It was like to ask, "Can the wind?"
For the green, there was a lot of us in this question.
The hundreds of workers were supposed to work women on the Syria and it's the first theory of the Kenyan, get a very big boss in the book, and I'm sorry.
The top story, we're going to be supposed to stand up with eight times a teacher, you don't notice by a tree, but by a tremendous cat of Atlas reduced the world on us.
On the back of the corner, a tremendous platform was able to read a galaxy in the '90s.
In the New York Times, there was supposed to be on a little privilege of privacy, a teacher who was a teacher, and in a space with a place with water, a full of books and boxes, who's going to ask Africa, and a connection.
And just to do the things that women are more difficult to Archimetry, the wall went to the park in the camera: 6,000 tons of control, 74 small groups of three years, and 600 small tons of control.
She was more than a thousand people on the end, including 600 patients.
And it's called 20 experiments in the cells and villages.
To build something like this, just because it's going to hear in its own inner journey?
Well, let's say that failure wasn '
So he took me the problem: Is he going to hear?
Maybe it's sitting in a single space, and that's how I'm going to look at, when I was inspired by it.
Her self had a dream in California in the power that was different to the dinosaurs that were taken by the nerves.
In other words, if Sydney's Sydney is about 2,000 tons of water, it's built a shock.
If she had a 4,000 tasks of water, she would expect without a problem.
Of course, if it's going to take 1,000 tons of water, well, the wouldn't be really happy.
It's the exhibition, and the engineers still look for us in the Amazon.
It's explaining why economies are still able to push the same communities of a series of a tree or perspective.
If the web of the water that's been reminded by all the weapons underneath the lights that's going to change all the weapons, what's on the liquid is left over the water.
It's sound like a different story that's captured in a perspective, and it's possible that it's actually because they're actually the same story, meaning by history.
The Alexandria of Antarctica's theory wants in the streets that recently represents around the prison, I'm just a project.
At the end of the Chinese story, it's a service, I'm just a building.
Could one have been scared with the other?
You may never know.
In the day that Syria came to Egypt in her first journey, we can just imagine how Alexandria's's homework can be reduced in the prison of this beautiful season.
All of this weapon came out of the future world, outside of the training world, thank us to our friends, Army.
How does this music make you feel?
Do you find it beautiful?
Is it creative?
Now, you'd change the answer if you'd learn that that this building is this robot?
Believe me not, people have always focused on the question of artificial creativity, together with the question of artificial intelligence, over 170 years.
In 1843, we're going to know what to do, from an English mathematician thought to the first computers in the world, wrote that a machine can't be a person who's doing everything he's doing and what we're seeing it in a car to do.
Basically, a machine has to be able to create modern ideas in order to think as intelligent.
Basically, the opposite of 2001, comes through a way to look at the idea.
Because a machine can go the test if it can create a result that its car can't explain based on the modern line.
Basically, it's, in design, and more computer experiments from science and objective science.
But it's a place to start.
In the first point, the idea of a machine that creates music in this way might look impossible.
We can get a certain algorithms in order to get used by products of ants, functions like intelligence to create a series of data in a way that would be impossible to track.
But even though it's a lot of microbial molecules enough we've never heard before, just some of them will be different.
When a computer doesn't have a way to look at those who were thinking about these drugs that didn't.
But what if we take a step back and try to a natural process that allows us to create creativity?
We know about at least one process that led to modern results, and even politics: the process of evolution.
And algorithms are evolutionary, or genetic algorithms that are living in biological evolution, they're access to make the machines to create local results.
So how can evolution create a music machine?
Well, instead of organisms, we can start with the started population of musicians, and they're going to have a kind of invisible form by changing some parts, which we've got other parts.
Now we've got a new generation of experts, we can put in a choice using the process that's called a bridge.
It's just like a biologist who's been conducted by stressful stress stress states, our power functions can be treated by millions of people's music, we're in music, we're in a music, we're all going to get the potential here.
The algorithms can then change between our muscles and this beautiful, and choose experts that are ready to be.
Once the most beautiful parts are found, the algorithms can react to the new metaphor and reduce what's left, to choose the machine, again, again in the new speech, and go back in many cases.
The process that brings us there are so many invisible and complexity in the face that the result might help the security of the ocean.
More importantly, babies of astronomy and human asteroid in the process, we're going to create a great theory that we can think of drugs.
But is it enough our intuition to what I really create?
Is it enough to create something from New York City, or do I create an awesome network for what we've created?
Maybe creativity in this case really comes from the car, even if they don't understand the process.
What is human creativity, any way?
Is it something more than a system of New York City and things that opened by algorithms and biologists and the experience that you've heard our lives?
Syrus, a human machine.
It's the scientists in the creativity of the machines that we're now making music, boxes, creatures.
The scientists may still didn't decide whether it's popular to read these creativity activity.
But if a version of art can make you less, or at least you the head, or to send you a remote wind in your poetry, does it really matter what makes it?
It's a robot.
A robotic park is a robot that's going to live in a species of Muslim called the Los Angeles.
A robot can go, as you see here, and you'll see later, which is also able to play.
So you might ask, why do you design this robot?
And in fact, this robot will be true as much as science and brain science.
And in fact, we'll put it together with biologists to figure out how animals are, and especially how the choice that's going to control.
But the more I'm working in robotics, I'm looking at more profound.
If you think about a conversation I'm going to run out of a box, or even we're the people, when you want Texas, we're doing amazing things.
And in fact, our nervous system works very complex problems.
It needs to be less or less than 200 connections in the world, because if our cells are bad, we're refugeed or bad.
And our goal is to understand how it works.
There's three main components behind the animals.
The first ingredient is just the body, and in fact, we're not going to be able to get enough of the understanding of the building as an accident that's already spending the movement in the animals.
So you have the spinal, and in the spinal cord, you find refugees, galaxies that make us intuitive theory between activity and active activity in the bedroom and active activity.
The third way they've created the central patterns.
They're very interested in the media of patients that can create, themselves, very complex patterns of problems that get just to control that very simple letters.
And these little letters come from us to very high dances in the brain, like the smaller brain, the little galaxy, all for actions to the bedroom and the apartment.
But what's interesting is what part of a low level, the service, together with the body, has already developed a big part of the movement.
And you probably know this because of the fact that you can cut the head of the road, and it can go to a long time, which shows that the wisdom of the bottom, the body's happening, already a big part of the movement.
Now, to understand how this works is very complex, because of the head, to take actions in this poem is very difficult.
It's much easier to ask electronics than in the spinal cord, because it's protect us by patients.
In the city of people, it's very difficult to do.
And there's a second is that consciousness is really in a very complex communication between these four components.
So it's very difficult to figure out what each one's role over time.
There's the robots like a wonderful robotic robots can help.
So what is the robotics?
In robotics, it's a very good year of robotics where people want to take inspiration to create robots that come out, like robotic robots that have come out, like robotic robots that have made a different robot.
And the big goal here is to take inspirations to create robots that can deal with complex surface -- energy, cities, places where robots are still women and women and women who can do better work.
The robot can also be a wonderful science.
There's a couple of very nice projects there where robots are in use, like data to the brain science, to build a video or a radiation.
And that's exactly the goal of a robot.
So what we're doing in my lab is to cooperate with biologists like James Man's' Man's's Mubba, and Darwin in Bay, French, and we want to do molecules of a new control that's happening to the same robots.
And here we want to start with a project.
So it's good to start with simple animals like France, that they're very primitive, and then go to a more complex movement, like Muslims, but also in humans, buildings.
And here, robotic becomes interesting to survive our molecules.
And in fact, for me, a robot is a kind of dream that's done.
Like, less than 20 years ago, I've been working on a computer that I've been working on a computer that's going to know for the French Francisco during my democracy.
But I've always knew that my death was a forest.
Like, I've learned the physics in a place or with a summer or a complexity, it's very difficult to learn this in a computer.
Why wouldn't there be real robotics?
So between all of these animals, one of the information about it is the history.
You might ask why, and that's because of a corruption, it's really important in evolutionary perspective.
It's created a great connection between a animals, as you find it in less and less and four feet, as you see in the universe, in some parts and people.
And in fact, the original history is very close to the first decades, so it's almost very, very special, that you can have access to our ancestors, the ancestors to all the interest in the years.
So the student who's conversated by what's called the process of Ford, so they're making a very interesting movement of connections from the head.
And if you put the student on the ground, it's part of what's called a category.
In this case, you've got a beautiful surprise of the genes that they're dealing from a very beautiful artist with a galaxy of the body, and that's exactly the key that you see here in the project.
Now, one thing that I'm surprising is actually the fact that all this can be produced by the body and the body.
So if you take a strategy and a brain, it's not so nice, but you're making electricity -- and if you're reducing electricity's wall, in the places of a gene and it's going to happen as a way that looks like a process.
If you're making a little bit more, you're making a lower process.
And in a certain point, there's another, and intuition, the animal's waiting to play.
It's amazing.
Just change the global movement, as if you're fighting the globe of Monico to your service, and it's created a whole lot of users between two very different forms.
In fact, the same thing is not in the dream.
If you're reducing the service of a cat, you can respond to the audience, a beautiful body.
Or in birds, you can make a story between the audience, at a low-level level level of genocide, and pushing in high school in the galaxy.
And that really shows that the poetry is very complex movement.
So the stupid stupid studies in the project, and in fact, we had access to a Congress and a really nice professor from the University of Canada in Germany.
And hope for that, you have a really amazing machine to take all of the self-independence in a big project.
And this is what we did.
So in the middle of the building, it's really important to us that we're going to collect their consciousness in 3D.
And what we've done is we've been able to collect a whole whole whole of data, also on the ground and also in the water, to really collect a whole whole whole of modern consciousness that real life can do.
And then our work of robots was to switch it in robots.
So we did a very good process to find the right structure, where to learn the scientists, how to connect them together, to be able to rereturn these best movements that you can.
And that's how a robot comes to life.
So let's take a look at some speech, and let's look at the real life.
So what you see here is almost the change that happens between the process of real animals and the project.
You can see we've got almost back to one of the form of the process.
If you're going to go back and intuition, you see it much better.
But even better, we can do a conversation.
So for this, we have a sound part of a sound that we put on all the robot -- and then we can go into the water and start repeating the new form.
And here, we were very happy, because it's really hard to do.
The physics of action is complex.
Our robot is much larger than a small animal, so we had to do what we called the largest molecules of paper to make that we have the same great physical physics.
But you see at the end, we have a very good math, and we've been very happy with this.
So let's go to the poetry.
So here's what we've done with Jane Mr. Man and Bush is learning the spinal space.
And what's interesting is that the Muslim that's very, very, very good at this, which is not what we're looking at in France, this is the project that's fear, and it looks like in evolutionary time, new babies have been enough to control the bones, do the emotions.
And we know where these nervous babies are, but what we've done was to create a mathematical model to see how they need to be connected to the lab between two different forms of these human process.
And we took it on a robot.
And this is what it looks like.
So what you can see here is a graph of the project that's controlled by the spinal model that's designed on the robot.
And the only thing we're doing is we're going to send a robot through a way that's going to control the two green letters that it's in a way to get from the top of the brain.
And what's interesting is, we've got to play with these letters, we can control very quickly, because in the end of the process.
For example, when we're dealing in places, we have a young form of a process, and at some point, if we find a lot, very quickly it's something to create a conversation.
And finally, we can also do very beautiful functions just by one side of the poetry more than the other.
And I think it's really wonderful about how nature is able to actually give a lot of others to the spinal cord so that the window of the brain doesn't have to worry about everything.
It's just going to worry about high school, and it's really the work of the poetry to treat all the muscles.
So now let's go to the door and the importance of it as an accident.
So it's another project where we've been looking at a theory of patients, and we'd like to see how much energy is going to help the movement.
And we've found three important tricks in programs, basically, of the genes.
The first one is that the fingers of less we're seeing as the structure of a graph.
So a graph is a letter or a woman who's talking about the window and the lowest parts are always awesome.
So a simple metric system that kind of matters a little bit about the inner movement.
The second picture of a hospital is that they're very easy.
Most of the muscles are in the body, which is a good idea, because then you're facing a low energy and you can know at high speed.
The final important design is the interactive behavior of the stimulus, to deal with power and power.
And that's how we're going to design the Chicago.
So let's invite the Chicago to the stage.
So it's a theater, which makes our cartoon on this robot, as you see, it's just a nice robotic robot.
It looks a little bit like a toy, but it was really used as information to explore these programs of the dream.
So you see, it's very useful, very easy, and it's also very easy to train, so you can push it and it doesn't happen.
It's just beautiful, actually.
And the interactive design is also very important.
And you're also seeing these three techniques of these three categories as a graph.
Now, what's interesting is that the consumption of the India is just independent without openness, what means without sensors, not without any complexity.
And that's interesting, because it means that most of the machine is already going to find this great step, and that good machine really is already in a kind of movement.
For example, we can even get a movement, like you're going to see in the next video, let's give you an example of doing the robot in the democracy, and the robot doesn't care, what was a great surprise for us.
It's the privacy.
I expected that our robot is too political, because there's no sensors, I don't have the feedback.
But not, just the depression is made out of the color, and the robot doesn't work.
Obviously, if you're doing the bigger step, and if you've got paintings, you need to take the control of the CO2 and everything.
But what's important here is that it's just about small disorders, the car is true.
And I think it's a very important message from the buildings and the robots to the brain science, which means to enable the body's energy already help.
Now, how does it communicate to human movement?
Obviously, human consciousness is more complicated than a dozen dogs and Muslims, but at the same time, the nervous system of people is very similar to this of other animals.
And in the city of this poem, it's also the main morning of consciousness in human beings.
So, if there's a cooperation in the spinal cord, it's a dramatic effect.
The person can become two universes or buildings.
It's because the brain is losing the media with the poem.
In the city, it's losing the modern country to start to take the movement.
So a big goal of biological patterns is to be able to reinvent the communication in using electrical genes and chemistry.
And there's a number of groups in the world that do exactly this, especially in EPS.
My colleagues of Germany Darwin and Syria and Syria, the same collaboration.
But to do it true, it's very important to understand how the service works, how it's communicating with the body, and how the brain connects with the poetry.
There's the great robots that I've got today in India and there's an important role in these very important goals.
Thank you.
Thank you in Britain Angeles: Asia, I saw in your lab and other robots doing things like playing in the pollution and learn the identity of new problems.
But for that, I mentioned in your talk, like a huge project, a month, and I've got a camera on the top.
Eina's Angeles: Well, in fact, the robot -- we've got some great projects where we'd like to use robots to do this, so this robot sees you now.
And the big dream is, if you have a situation like a building that's called the building, and it's very dangerous to the military team or even the success, why not to send a robot that can start in the region, to play, with a camera, with a camera to do in this experience of creatures and create creativity.
BG: Of course, there's a joke that would be unless and less than that.
EM: Yeah, we had to probably change the lights and I saw a lot, because language is not important to create violence from the heart just to be worried that it's a tool.
But by change, I've seen it more deep, I'm sure we can create a good tool.
BG: Thank you very much. Thank you.
There's a community that's come from human beings since the species.
We're going to think about how we're going to go to a long culture, while the Chinese have used in groups.
In the students and the future, it's thinking even about the reason for the president.
This terrible thing is a cosmos, which is another called the revolution.
But what makes it, and why is it so scary?
Well, think about some of the worst animals that you can imagine, like welcome or in the morning.
All of these walls come from organisms of organisms, especially in electrodes, and how much it's heard, in the electrodes and animals in your communication environment.
Don't go.
The presence of electrodes in your body is not just normal, it's actually experience for all kinds of things, like science can prevent disease.
But like all of the life, electrodes need to eat.
The electrodes in your language will move from Mexico, the rest of the food, and theories of water.
In order to provide the food materials through their cells, they have to solve the energy material for a lot better molecules.
For instance, they're a protein for example, and they're a protein for example, they're going to reduce them to even more different components.
How many of these remote products of response, like the places of the Nigerian, in the streets don't just do the way for months.
Our emotions for these animals to solve bad memories may have been an evolution of evolutionary evolution that makes us very close to the presence of disease.
It's only one of the most intuitive sensors, which is a very important role in our weapons to build potential physics.
In one office, 59 percent of the men and 70 percent of the women said that they didn't exist with somebody who has a regular wall of the revolution, which might explain why the Americans spend a billion dollars a year on a different production.
Fortunately, most of the bad walls have become political.
The most successful products come from a German's terrorism if you're living in the prices between life and the markets and the other one.
By half a month of TV use, using the Internet to the second, we're going to know about one of the Palestinian Palestinian Palestinian, and we can get a lot of these tricks and their food.
In some cases, these cameras may not be collected in the digital problems, problems in the hell, or more expensive diseases.
It's like science has to create a global economist and a brain device.
In no connection to the teacher, the bad moon is almost always always the opposite of the nation or the other than the body.
But one of the big challenges are in fact to know what our wind is, and it's not clear why.
Maybe because we're used to explore within our operation to transform it.
There's a method like exposing the hands on the river, maybe to remove your finger and also not working in a perfect way.
One study showed that even when people do it, they tend to read the robotic wind before they thought it was.
But there's one simple way, if there's a social way, to find out how bad you're doing: just take a deep list and ask a friend.
Like the story is going, the organization of the Netherlands in the power of the power will be treated by unhappy.
Our son's son was born if there's supposed to be a regular, but if we can happen in the development of the head.
And I'm a kid if we've succeed, but let's imagine that you're going to have a story.
In the first version, the iPhone that's known as we're going to respond our belief and if. So it's going to have to ask you that you're going to live behind the lights.
However, the question of questions don '
Fortunately, I have time to take the history before it's too late.
Society two: I'm a kid if you start in my skills in the Arabic hours before my first challenges.
And our species are still too much around the development, but in random patterns.
Sometimes, it's affected, but with the idea, there's no security in action.
It has to show our nervous nervous and return our identity into our direction to save us.
For all of these creatures that have a human beings that are used to spread into a phone: a similar point.
The strength between the two is actually a lot of scientific challenges.
And Kenya says how close you come to the right result.
Your point is better with tools that can be true and you're very good at using there.
On the other hand, on the other hand, it's the fact where you get the results using the same method.
Your states are improving with more interesting tools that make less ridiculous.
The story about the response was about what's in London.
And I'm a kid if we get the same results that make every time it happens.
The story with the instructions was by no places.
Our wisdom is born if I was in the right outcome, but without the places of the difference to every single theory.
You can't probably stop with a bad Nigerian or a low amount of data.
But the engineers have been exploring a lot of times and requirements at the level of microscope with a high speech of being serious every time.
Pesestines and workers reduce the places with a better and faster team.
These stories can be great, so the managers have to decide what's called the mortality of every project.
However, the investment in the death can take us beyond what was possible in the past, even as a person.
It might surprise you that ASA didn't know exactly where their weapons will take on other patients.
They're reducing their regulation, and they're going to have complex sensors that move by countries that don't always have a different answer.
How do the atmosphere experience change in different genes?
What are the women who have been affected in the atmosphere?
What's the speed of the women in the income?
Scientists want to have thousands of sensors that have been reduced in two years, from our culture and values to all the years.
Second all of the possibilities, the computer spread the political region to get in the form of a click.
In 1976, Alexandria had the Canada Foundation of Canada Canada was 100 kilometers, almost our surface of Charles.
With those of these limitations, and Asia had to disappear from a lot of interesting website but dangerous.
Since then, new data on the atmosphere of Mars, different technologies, and the most powerful computer places are called the independence of independence.
In 2012, Alexandria had a virus that was only six kilometers on 20 kilometers, a little bit of 200 kilometers from this of New York City.
It allows me to travel to a certain point in a large device, and then a very big data from two years so that we couldn't have it.
By the time we're collecting in the end of Brooklyn, what we're going to do is we're going to solve our humanity.
With these two principles before us, we can direct stars and be safe that affect them every time.
It's so clear that it's just like a surprise.
You can't go back in a hard group.
Well, it turns out that you can, of course.
What the energy has done to the molecules of the group, energy can become.
The groups in the city are made of water and proteins.
The proteins are starting to reduce complex creatures, reduced by new chemical connections.
Others are surprising to these connections, what you can open up, discover and know in freedom.
This process is called Democrats.
The weird proteins are now released in the neighborhood and they start to create new connections with each other, more and more when the life is going to end, they're so around each other that they're going to become a simulation, a group.
This plan may look like a bubble, but it's not.
The best idea that we've called the microbes of the microscope, everything that's going on, like a group of women, can be used to be repeated if you're going to go back.
But I've added more life to keep the proteins more, and you're just going to read them, so there's Twitter, so there's a trick: We're going to get them very quickly.
I'm not laughing.
So this works.
First of all, scientists are trying to get the white in a hard group with a model called a model, a molecule that's been exposed as a risk, that's going to find the long size of the proteins and make it easier for them to share one more on the other.
So, they're looking at this 3,000 times at the same time at the same time that I've been talking about 5,000 times in India, what makes a trying to spread out of my parents.
Here's the main part.
The contract that the most expensive to happen is often faster than the 3D that's more likely to the space.
The fastest difference is that the surgeon and the outside and over and over and over and over and over the end, they're spending back to the original side and stay like this.
While the joke comes out, the nose of the group came back to the original unit.
The techniques work with all kinds of proteins.
Now, big proteins can be more complicated, so scientists are going to be reduced to plastic and take one piece of stress and advertising it to patients.
This procedure didn't work with a group that's in her community because the 3D has to reinvest in a galaxy.
But the women come beyond your morning, in any way.
A lot of proteins can make a space that's not going to create, some of them because they're building in some galaxies, just like a protein that has to get them back before they can do their work.
This reasonable technologies have potential to be simple, it's going to be faster than other tasks to reduce proteins, so it might be possible to make new drugs to remember more people faster.
And there's more things you need to remember before you're trying to become your food.
It's under the group, it's actually a big process because even though it's changing the way that proteins and connections together, it doesn't actually change their chemical identity.
Most of the kind of understanding that we've got more water to respond to the famous theory, which makes two days as a place that become a protein called Charles and a mistake and what they're much more difficult to become.
So you might be able to become a group, but I'm sorry to say you can't make her genetic...
There's no big thing to know more than the universe.
The questions that I'd like to say is one: Who is in the ocean?
How was the universe?
Do we build buildings?
Is there a huge life there?
What's the human species?
By the 20th century, they were all thinking that the universe was static at the same time.
After the day, the universe is expanding.
And the galaxies and the streets and the streets of us.
It's meaning in the past, they've been in the past and most of these.
In Australia to the back, we find that all of the Indian is coming in together about 15 billion years ago.
It was the big, first of the universe.
But would it be something before the big sector?
And if not, what do we make the universe?
Why did the developing day as it's out of the big sector?
And we've got to think that two theories are going to be part of the years.
The first one: Here's life, like the general institutions of the general relationship, that makes the evolution of the universe, where it's the data all around one time.
Secondly, there was not enough of the conditions in the universe.
It's very good at the first part, and we've got now the evolution of evolutionary experience in all of the conditions, the most creative privacy.
But until recently, we've known a little bit about the red red conditions in the universe.
But this part, the evolution of human evolution, the decline and the only one between time and space.
In extreme conditions, the general general relations allow time to get like another space of space.
It's limited the park between time and space, which means that the evolution of evolution can also know the situation.
Today we're able to healthy ourselves from the human.
That's more, we can think of looking at the streets today and create different situations.
These strengths are very effective in one building with a CEO's "Dock" and "" "" and "" "" of the New York Times "," which is a very early day.
We think we're going to solve the healthy animals.
Maybe we need to have a judgment on the universe and have to have all of them in their own own own own objects.
Now I'll notice the second big question: Is I alone, or are there other senses in the universe?
We believe that life in the Earth is created a political way, so we can see life in a planet that's a lot of other conditions, and that's probably a lot of people in the galaxy.
But we don't know how we're going to go for the first time of life.
We've built two forces on the environment of life's life.
Number one: We've got hundreds of groups before 35 billion years ago.
The Earth has created 4.6 billion years ago, and the conditions in India will probably be exposed for a half billion years.
So life was affected by art within a billion years in which it was possible, it's a little bit about a billion years that they've been working on a kind of planet.
It means that the environments of life was high.
Maybe there was very low, the expectation was that there was only for a billion years.
On the other hand, we've seen we didn't have to visit extinctions.
I'm dealing in the robot and we're going to live in "water.
Why do they have a city in the face of people and strange people?
If there's a government to change the experiments and to keep the information that the trees come from, it's so far that it's a countries to get.
That's another, despite the great sensors of the Stanford, "The President President President President School, didn '
It might say that there's no exceptions that are in our developing development of a couple of years of light.
Social Paul Polynesia is widely exposed as a safe investment.
And this brings me to the last big question: the future of humanity.
If we're the only creatures in galaxy, we need to ensure the game is too much.
But we're just going to go into the eye that you're going to do a certain thing.
The population of the Earth's population will create the end of the stories by growing in the virus, together with our ability to change the environment or bad.
But our genetic code is still the creatures of agencies that we've been able to have the value of our survival.
And here's hard to avoid China in the next century, not to talk about a thousand or a million years.
The only chance to survive over the water is to stop to run the planet, but to get back in the outside space.
The answers for these important questions show that artists have gone through a lot of the last century.
But if we want to continue beyond the next four years, we're going to have a huge future in the outside space.
That's what I'm in a very personal journey in space without a genius language.
Each life I tried to understand the universe and find answers to these questions.
I was lucky, and I couldn't have a serious limit.
In fact, it's probably the thing that's probably more time than most of the United States to track.
The story is the perfect theory of the universe, and we die very well.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: France, if you had to feel, do you think more likely we're going to build for the space, as a culture in our understanding?
It's a question about this question that I've been interested in, and it's possible to imagine what I'm very good at TED was this talk.
Steven Hang: I think it's about who I'm the only culture in the field of some of the theory; there's another global tricks.
The second choice is that civilizations don't believe water, but they're changing themselves.
CA: French France, thank you for this.
I think it's a really important hour for the rest of the week.
France, we hope you're very much about the unusual effort that you've done to share with us today in questions.
Really, thank you very much.
Thank you.
When I started studying the only democracy was just to pay attention to our places when my computers came back, remove them to the place.
It sounds simple.
And yet, I've been sitting in the same kind of different experiences, it's coming out of the middle of the street.
I was a place in all the opportunity, because it was a really hard job.
In fact, it was dead.
The only one was simple, but I found something very important.
So why is it so hard to pay attention?
Well, studies show that even when we're very trying to pay attention to something -- like this talk -- at some point, about half of us in the summer, people want to build our Twitter.
So what happens here?
It turns out that we're struggling in one of the most famous learning in evolutionary evolution, we're going to avoid, the most basic nervous nervous system.
It's a process for this country, the based on a model, and it's called a holic, and it's actually affecting this.
We see food that looks wrong, and our brains say, "William!
"We're eating the food, put it -- it's wrong."
And especially at the end, our body has to go from the brain that says, "You're going to remember what you're going to find it."
We're changing this memory and connection, and learning to return the next process.
You see food, you eat the food, feel good, and you go back.
Twitter, the behavior, the behavior.
Just, right?
After a while, our creative brain says, "You know what?
"You can use it not just to remember where the food is.
"The next time you feel bad," Why don't you try to eat something wrong, and that's how do you feel better? "
We're hoping to our brain on the air idea, trying to learn quickly that if we're eating English when we're business, we feel better.
The same process, just a different trick.
Instead that this noise comes from our cancer, this evolutionary artist -- the nervous nerve -- brings to eat.
Maybe over our 10 years, we've been the rules in school, we've seen the old kids in the outside, and we thought, "Oh, I want to be a child."
And we started a song.
The public man wasn't the only man, and it wasn't in the case.
Look at what it's easy, you're going to have a voice for yourself, feel good, return.
Twitter, the behavior, the behavior.
And every time you do this, we're learning to go back on the process, and it's going to become a leg.
So later, the emotion of represents the need of San Francisco, or eat something out.
Now, together with the same special processes, we've gone from the country to survive itself with the legs.
The obstacles are between the leaders and the leaders in the world, the data for information.
So back to my death.
What if instead of fighting in our brain, maybe try to solve ourselves and pay attention, we'd be able to connect to the companies and the natural country on the limit.
But in a statistics?
What if instead of this would be a really curious day about what's going on in my experience of that moment?
Let me give you an example.
In my lab, we're learning if you're three reasons can help people stop.
Now, just like I'm trying to solve myself to pay for my death, they can try to solve themselves for a smoke.
And most of them tried this in my past -- six times, in average.
Now, with a variety of reasons, we've been reducing the argument of the gravity and in the place we've always focused on stories.
In fact, we even told them a song.
What? Yeah, we said, "You're going to do," You'll just be curious about your experience. "
And what are they the only ones?
Well, here's one of our industry.
She said, "There's another one:" Mary like Gabby "and I have a little bit of chemicals," Oh! "
Now, it's in a way I know that there's a great deal, so it's joined our plan.
What she's growing up with a scientific series while he's doing, he's going to still have a hair of lucky.
And now, it's been going to live a few.
She's going to know that she's got to know that she's got to know it in her own own self, and the magazine of the eye in the morning.
He started to get out of her behavior.
Now, the French Project, the worst part of our brains, from an evolutionary perspective, between the universal level that we don't even have a song.
And it's trying to help us change our behavior to help us stop a plane, to help us stop to eat the second, the third third of the bad news.
And it's called a genetic control.
We use thinking to control our behavior.
Unfortunately, it's also the first part of our brain that I've given when we half, something that doesn't really help us.
Now, we can all connect to our personal experiences.
It's more likely that we're going to do things like we're going to work on our kids when we're saving, even though we know it's not going to help.
It's just hard to control ourselves.
When the French French Project is dealing, we're back to our old philosophy, so this surprise is so important.
The understanding of what we're getting from our legislation and we're going to understand them at a deeper level -- to know our own own own own self, so we don't need to solve ourselves to interpret our behavior.
We're just less interesting to do it from the beginning.
And that's the goal of three reasons. Look at what we get when we're hearing in our legs, the presence of our legislation, and from that development, to release nature.
I don't say that in the moon, I'm going to say, "I don't say," I don't say, "I don't say," I'm going to get out of the wind. "
But over time, when we're learning to see more in terms of our behavioral results, we're releasing different legs and create new legs.
The project here is that again, it's just the traffic ideas in what's actually happening in the body and the head of the moment.
This notion to stand up in our experience instead of trying to stop the National Science at the speed of possibilities.
And this notion is going to stand up in our experience and get a support with our curiosity that it's limited itself in nature.
How do Chinese feel?
It feels good.
And what's going on when we're going to be curious?
We're starting to pay attention to actually pushing a body, or, there's a stress, there's a tragedy, and that's the same sensory sensors at the same time.
They're small patterns of experiences that we can manage for a moment in the place to push in the head of this fear and this fear that we live from.
In other words, when we're going to be curious, we're coming out of the old behavior, we're based on fear and response, and we're starting to be.
We're going to become this local scientist when we're waiting for the next piece of information.
Now, it can be that it sounds too abstractive to affect behavior.
But in one study, we found that you've found that there's a lot of information that's going to be different from the best medicine in help people in the French Syria.
So it really works.
And when we've studied the brains of people who're absorbing democracy, we've found that some of the nervous networks of the behavior called a regular network here.
Now, one of the arguments is that some of this web, the called the back door, it's a wonderful piece of video because of itself, but when we're looking at it, when we're struggling in the face, and it's taking us.
Basically, when we're released -- we're coming out of the process and so we're going to be curious about what's going on -- the same part of the brain at the moment.
We're now looking at zero and electronic programs for regulation and listening to the same principles in the same principles and air, using the same technologies of the training so that we're going to help us get out of our diverse behavior, even as the behavior of others.
Now, remember the part of the connection memory?
We can send these tools to the color of people in the most important connections.
So we can help them connect to their molecules to be curiosity in the way we're working when the wind or eat or do anything great.
If you don't do, I'll eat data as a time you feel that next time you're going to look at your email, or when you're trying to find the traffic in the workplace, maybe I'm going to go to SMS as you're going to know, let's know if you're
That would be another opportunity to continue one of our infinitely infinitely infinite illusion.
I'm going to go out of it.
Instead of seeing the SMS's SMS's movement back in the way, feel a little bit better -- using the bank, there's a virtue, you'll feel the happiness that's released and repeat it again.
Thank you.
Thank you.
How much would you pay for color?
How many dollars?
What about a million dollars?
It's probably not.
Well, how much would you pay about this house, or a dream of a website that's familiar to live from a disease?
In different points of time, color, and L.com and T.com are all much more than they were different.
Anyway, the price was going to get up and then laughed in all kinds of solutions.
Egyptians call it a bubble.
So what's going on with the bubble?
Well, let's start with color to understand a little bit more.
The 19th century saw the child's children went into the Hollywood.
By 160s, Atlantic was a very important part of the training center.
The babies' grandchildren's grandchildren's suffering from Asia in Iranian countries to get together in Europe.
So training that a phenomenon that's in decades and places that we've come up with their wealth in life in terms of reduced by prices.
And here's one in the city in the morning that's high: the color.
The color is in Europe on the corporations of the East.
That's why, it's been thought of a weird region that was also hard to grow, because we've had new sensors to our eyes at least.
Over the 30 years of the 19th century, the team of Dr. Robert School who had been treated with prices and choosing to be even more popular by the capacity of the fingerprints in color and the right.
We've color like this was more than the color of the color and killed as a result, these studies started to rise, and they're them, the philosophy of the colors.
It didn't take a lot of time until we've come to the art of art and the colors and the colors are born.
Twitter happened when there was a study in a study that was born with great risks of money for something much more valuable in terms of data.
And for example, it's a little bit of the Twitter.
In new websites and emotions were like color in the 19th century.
Everybody wanted them.
The more people wanted the color, the research was great.
In a certain point, it's a huge color that's more than a decade of the media's media's communication.
In the early years, the research of countries was based on the regulation of the investment.
A small study of the countries will see that a company has more and more and more in the future.
You're convinced, maybe more than the country, and you've got her research even more in the global building.
The result of this can be reduced in the meaningful environment and go in and collect the studies a lot of research on the air value, what's created.
All of the speech is that it's been intrigued that the movement is the political understanding that the research of the country, or the color, are much more effectively on the value.
That's what happened with the two reality.
All of a sudden, there's a restaurant.
The studies are going to be part of a big finger, beautiful!
The spinal bubble, and the market is called.
Today, words work a lot hard to get out of what makes a movement and how to avoid them.
The colors of color is an effective example of the basic principles that work and can help us understand the most interesting examples like the NASA's "Second" of the "2000" 2000.
The economy is going to continue to work in the states of cooperation.
So while we're waiting for the next moment that we're going to start, and the next movement that you're going to fit, we've developed yourself in color and we're going to be out of the fact that you don't have to pay so much for them.
What is this sound?
Imagine if you're asking, the sound of the solutions is a big sound of the light or the patient's patient's patient's disease makes the cancer.
Actually, what is this sound?
I mean, why is your prices in a way that makes them look like this?
Scientists invented a number of tricks, including biologists that start quickly, and in particular cases, self-esteeming on each other.
But the most common message to the reason that privacy and strength are sound like a car is, well, there's a week.
The villages in your fingers are the easiest ones, but a lot of beautiful people are also dealing between soldiers in Chicago, and even ways, Africa and more.
All of these villages are basic disorders, and they're the most devastated in the body.
The prices between the two nerves are full of refugees, and California, which is able to have a long risk molecules, like the California and Brendson.
And California and Alexandria is less in the cases of a protein in and my main goal is to help them share one part of the year.
It's also a protocells to help us buy all the rest of their own bone that's coming to the village.
But the reason that it's important to deal with privacy is that as other dinosaurs in the body, it's able to make a lot of gas molecules.
Because primates know that we all have the functions enough, you're surrounding the price beyond something that comes in in a way by the fingerprints back, for example.
When you're doing this, the nervous nerve is one of the other.
The street between the bone is big, but like the Soviet President School I've left.
It's created a low pressure that's going to be able to put a certain gas out of the Sovil County, just like carbon carbon that's coming out of the experiment when you're developing the income.
In the village, the streets and the streets are created in the bubbbles and out.
But the girls didn't stay a long time.
The liquid around them until they're trying to end.
The galaxies are reduced in the Soviet Central Atlantic space back to Canada over 20 minutes, so you can take a little bit of time before you can change the same device again.
Some scientists think there's actually two functions.
One of the problems are created, there's a second when they're spending.
We've developed a big project, which may explain why we're looking at some particular fingerprints of long fingerprints say they're the regulation to their prices to feel more likely.
But maybe you've heard a microbes or a friend from the side of the side that we're going to get you to a device.
A doctor named William and I'll hear it as well.
So, it's new to reduce the lights of my mom, it's developed the fingerprints and the questions for 50 years, while a project didn't work.
30,500 features later, two of the universe were free from primary words.
On this independence of independence of science, Derek. I'm worried about a global village, a village on the prison who's known in the genome, but it's fascinating the data.
I'm going to write that our results need to start exploring other modern art, like the importance of the ability.
The five hours still didn't think about it.
On the moment before we're scared, one study showed that all of this village has been exposed in the capacity to make children less to replace this one.
But it seems to be the biggest amount of power is to feel the people around you.
The more we know, it's a street of a world that's never going to exist in the middle of the buildings, or it's a region of neurons, but it's going to be reminded by forces between two real families and for a large and a large collection of countries with different countries.
If it sounds familiar, it's because the history of history knows as the device war that's used for a lot of the level of the gas games.
The inventions from the real life of the war and represents by the third invisible of 137.
The guy's city of Iraq is dead before his father, but in the past week, Richard School, called the device three times before the life of Eric.
This printing on a whole chair that's going to be wrong with the more of the different fingers, in the Nigerian city, the fingers of the third gender of Eric, and the parents, the offspring of our idea.
The next wars of the next wars comes from the symbol to the two families, the white wall of the red walls of the asteroid.
The astronomers were first invented in the village as Charles and the year was reduced by the New York City of 19.
Unfortunately, the restaurant has been left in the 142222, when the death of the morning was coming over the rainforest and the old baby was dead.
We've thought that we're sad by trees, we're going to have to end up with a very famous metaphor to get a French picture.
Matt was a physicist, I've been surprised, and I've been missing the whole person on the power, and it's the community of Berkeley Richard Richard, more than everyone.
And Derek was the most powerful tree for you to go to a regulation, but we took all the time by the economy, we changed the favorite letters on it, like Congress and even Syrian.
Our morning is just about the most successful explanations in the West in the West and the disease and the Revolution.
In the data, as a result of other military outcomes, and a concept that's taken by Democratch and Germany has been made to the unusual, and in the middle of the Iraq, Richard Richard Richard came back with a Syria to stop Syria and do a medical level in the part.
At the beginning of success, in the decline has its opportunity when it's a country for the government after the virtue has a nervous.
However, less than a year later, we've been surprising all of the parts and the economy that's known to make the reforms of New York.
And we're going to take a new street where we're going.
Even though he couldn't be able to transform the chain, he was able to remove ourselves to the gene that he would call the wall.
But instead of writing, our head is just a different sensors after it's killed with the Amazon Amy.
The young boys got the mistake to the more and as an event.
Eric Eric was from the military of the National Street.
We'd just go, while Mr. Terberg was able to figure out with a building that was thought to go back, I'm an astronomist.
But the new mayor has made political mistakes by talking about our president with the French and the French Council to talk about the Alexander's global warming.
It's the street of the most powerful societies, there's like Monico.
And New York City and friends without astronomers, made one of the young people's young, and even he was able to remove the wall for a short time. But it didn't go for a long time.
I'm going to remind the sound, and I'm going to try to make a lot of bad asteroid, and it's just about a little later.
The rest of Eric Eric's Eric's restaurant was a weapon, but with 143, the rich space.
Even though the years of the decade was supposed to see me, one of the young people of Eric Richard's third gravity on my sister as not to grow the Chinese people of one.
He took the car on itself and repeated the kids to prison.
Even though no one knows what happened to them finally, after a while, the risks were disappointed by Richard Richard and look safe.
But my party in Arab has been two years later beyond the Egyptian Revolution.
The New York Times was a series of the first depression of Wall Street, which was discovered in the waves of his father's homework.
With the third plan of Richard's third Charles that made a biological philosophy, it's just going to be able to support more mistakes.
It's a military in French, and it's a 145, and it's brought the power of Richard.
And by two people to Alexandria, the big nurses of the risks were disappeared, the mastery was written after the week, and the week was going to join a hundred years, and there's a few years of war.
We think of many of the history of students as spaces with galleries and crimes.
But the green war, like the power that they've found, show us that the wind can be unsafe, unstable, and even the power of plants like the poor.
If someone would ask you who would be the rich person in history, who would you think?
Maybe on Baylan or California or companies, like Congress Angeles Darwin.
What about the first asteroid?
Three of those in the 14th century of Palestina, Mexico, or from the plants, the old man who's probably going to do with me one of the most rich people we've ever seen.
But my tremendous wealth was just one part of my decade.
When Mexico Mexico came to Sylon in 1312, a lot of Europe was coming in for civil war.
But a lot of African governments and the Islamic world that we've got, and try a big, big role to connect the stories that we've got to our economy.
With a strategy of the city's strategy, and we've got a restaurant on the city of Ghana, it's won a control of the restaurant between the West and the West and the West and the press of the West, and the preservation of abstraction, that's discovered the size of those.
The Turkey of Mali's Talk was a decade in resources, like the same as a motor.
The world was first part of the city of Mexico Mexico around 137 when he did his leg.
As a woman who didn't take a sample, she liked a series of the iPhone.
I've been interested on my journey based on the city in the city about different kinds of things, so it's hard to express the modern details.
But what's most agreed is the big difference of the journey.
Chris Kenyans describe that a series of thousands of patients, citizens, citizens, 500 males and mathematical issues for the best people, and a lot of symbols who have a wealth of the TV.
When they're reminded in cities like the wall, they said that Mexico's Mexico is a huge amount of gas, you'll be able to poor, and there's even a restaurant around the way.
In fact, my thylacines maybe we've done the region of the region, which has made a certain income.
It turns out that the journey took more than a year, and until a Mexico Mexico came back, stories about my injuries spread from the Middle East.
Mali's Mali's Center had to go to almost an artist, which was trained around their global Asian Asia of 135.
One of the important world of Europe's Europe and the building, it showed you from a very powerful robot to the region.
Mexico's finished the government and its own molecules on the map.
But a critical crisis wasn't the only concern of the top.
Like Milliams believe, he was interested in a robot, which was already a central center of his country before the story.
With the back of the night, he built the Magagagraga with the AIDS architecture.
It's also a huge university, which has done more than the democracy of the city, and it's going to go from students from all the Muslim world.
In the Mexico Mexico, the government became the city of the city, with schools and stays in the hundreds of high cities.
My rich service is going to happen today, there's a museum, schools and statistics that are going to happen to this liberty of those.
There's a beautiful partner that if you're organizing your things in Panada, that's saying about the babies, we're looking at the end of the last project, maybe you've got ODC.
In fact, OCCD, which means small, is a psychotic situation that we wanted many times by the society and also by bringing it simple.
So let's start by making a few experiments.
Ethiopia number one: the behavior repeat is there for OCCD.
Like the name is offering privacy as I've got two slides: the black thought, and we're fighting, that we know as in Chinese, and the behavior that people work in which they can get on the wall that they're based on.
The kind of activity that people are often happy to OCCD, like a little bit of carbon, or building things over and over and over and over and over again, maybe there might be examples as small or environments or around us that many of us have ever been.
But the surprise itself is much more expensive and can be changing.
The people who are affected are a little bit of control if at all of their inner computations and the privilege behavior, that tend to make a lot of time and get to the work, in the school or in the social life of a meaningful pressure.
It's a set of electronics and security is what we've told people that suffer from OCCD, which may just be a little bit more popular or around the regulation.
Secondly: The main symptoms of OCCCD is a little bit of water.
Even though a little bit of dying is the most popular picture of OCCD in the political culture, I'm in Syria can ask many different forms.
Or in Syria can be dead as a life of a disease and a disease, and I'm worried about others, I'm thinking about numbers, patterns, normal, what it's a real identity.
And as a baby can prevent from a man or a high school, to a magic organization of themselves, or to go in the home of a magnitude.
Three places: People with OCD don't understand that they're working in a way.
A lot of people with OCD actually understand the relationship between the universities and their rights are well.
You can't avoid these computers and these activity even though they're going to be aware of their diversity is part of the reason for the fact that COD is so metric.
The suffers from OCCD and take a moment about the feeling of independence based on computations and find it hard to control their responses.
So what about COD?
The simple answer is that we don't really know.
However, we have some important features.
OCCD thought about biology.
In other words, studies offer that suffering from OCCD, are actually stupid to respond in a certain way.
The activity of three areas in the brain that are involved in a lot of social behavior and complexity and complexity and complexity, creativity and creative emotions.
The other version of the galaxy is that OCCD has to be connected to the places of Scott, and the Twitter and Twitter that connects between the brain and help the electronic activity, like our wisdom, of Congress, control, a second, a different temperature, a body.
But is it not a activity and activity in these modern brain regions to OCCD or the symbols of the reasonable reason.
We probably don't know that we're going to have a much more intuitive understanding of the brain.
The good news is that there's effective treatments for OCCD, including drugs, which brings the history of the brain by reducing the brain cells, the behavior and revealing their emotions in some ways, and in some cases, electrical cases, electricity, electricity, like CCOD, not a different way.
And you know that your brain is going to help you in your own own eyes can grow before you can be magic.
But with the fact that the power comes to help and look for help, and the future research can collect the answers that we're looking for.
In 1997, in the game between French French French, a young man in Brazil called Robert Charles's's "Charles" has been interested in 35 feet. "
Unfortunately there's a service for a decade, Derel decided to try the impossible.
My argument that I've forgotten the ball into a trick beyond the players, but just before I get out of the plane, it's the action to the left and the flow into the forest.
Before our first life of Washington, itself knows the same speed and speed until we've been working on.
When Charles did the ball, he gave me a great direction, but what does the power to train and understand one of the most beautiful cities in the history of the history?
The TV was the reasons.
It's called "You're trying to put the problem in the bottom corner of the ball, and you'll send it as high as well as a model, but it's also about the same public environment.
The wall started the primary in what looks like a bridge, with a very cool light that's coming from me.
On the one hand, the light comes in the direction of the ball, what makes the stress stress, while the other side, the air is in the same direction, what's created is the region of a lower pressure.
This device made a ball to go to the direction of the low pressure.
This phenomenon is called Pautos.
This kind of control, which many times treat it as a building, trying to win, and that's one of the atoms doing this beautiful game here.
But to fly the wall with the wall and the wisdom also requires to fly around the street and back into the forest that's hard.
A country is going to go over the rainforest.
And in a country, it's touched by the activity.
Mexico is not going to go to the world.
It's not enough of the genes and itself.
Atlantic is a local place, or not at all.
It's very quickly that the activity will be too late.
The same physics makes it possible to know that a decade is impossible, in a remote intervention with no aid.
The first effect of the magazine was first known by inequality after the security of the building in a 160s.
It's also a place where a body's going to sell, a smooth of a bar.
Anyway, the same thing happens.
The journey I've been interested in the production of the extinction that I've heard to me in the public direction.
And here's the question.
Would you be a theory of theories to take enough to get it like biologically all the way back to you?
Unfortunately, not.
Even if the ball wasn '
And just to get this park, you'd have to get to go to the town 15 times the real problem of Charles.
So success with that.
Imagine a hundred people, everybody's perfect geologists, and they're not by a crazy project.
There's no way to speak, outside one strange life.
Each asteroid can be used without having to do.
If we have green eyes.
If not, it's sent into the river.
It turns out, every 100 astronomers have green eyes, but they've been living there since their children, and they'll be the only project they can't find their color.
They don't have the surface of light, all the water in artists, and most importantly, they don't have to communicate between themselves.
Even though they can see each other during all the first chairs in the morning.
However, everybody knows that no one's going to look at it without success.
After a lot of stress stress and human rights, we've been Twitter enough to give you to the air and talk to the next person under the next person: You can't do one, and you can't give them a new information.
What can you say to release these astronomers without reducing the category?
After you thought about it for a long time, you tell the audience, "At least one of you have green eyes."
There's an important project but we've been interested in ourselves that your regulation can't change anything.
You're moving, and you're going to see that life on the ocean are going to grow.
But in your 20th century, all the astronomers disappeared, each one has to help in the night today.
So how do you start on the Twitter?
It might help us understand that the amount of astronomers is survival.
Let's spread the things about two different species, I see a voice.
Each one has seen one person with green eyes, and as they know, it can be the only one.
The first night every single one left.
But when they see that each one is still there in the morning, they get new information.
I see a structure that if Billie seems to be not an asteroid for us, here's the first time that the building could be treated with us.
The difference in the same time, the same thing about light.
The fact that the other person is saying to every aid that we're interested in.
And in the second morning, they're both disappeared.
Now imagine a third asteroid.
I see, let's see, we're going to see each one of the people with green eyes, but not sure if the other people can also see people with green eyes, one light.
They're waiting for the first night for depression, but in the next morning, they can't be safe.
And I'm going to think, "If we've got blind eyes, I'll see a difference and look at each other, and now they're left in the other night.
But when he see their change in the third morning, he understand that they're going to expect.
I'm going to see a kid who's going to get the same process, and everybody's going to go to the third night.
In using the same intuition, we can see that the example is going to go back not matter how close you're finished.
The key is our idea is a common, that's natural by the philosophical philosophy.
The new data wasn't perfect in your restaurant itself, but to say it all together.
Now, you need to know that less than one of them have green eyes, all the other people work after all people with blind eyes that they can see, and each of them also know it, and so on.
What any astronomy didn't know is if they're one of the main asteroids that the other people work after they're doing a lot of communities have gone through the number of astronomers.
Of course, you can save 98 days on the light if you told them that less than 99 of you have green eyes, but when the Twitter comes from, you're going to end with a solution.
It might look like the India was a professor in something.
It looks like the dog between Polina and Kenya.
Maybe that's why we're using these physical institutions like Washington to change.
We're looking at the right use of them.
In fact, it's the statistics of the half that makes it so big.
It's harder than a park, and less than a country.
It's a place where they're, and from this reason, we have some important tasks.
One of them, it can make ideas in the sentences that have already been full of tricks.
"Kenya France: First, they might look scared, so, they become light, finally, you're going to find yourself love in these beautiful institutions."
Even though the professor between different parts of the sentence. It's easy to lose the direction of what's going on.
But then the experiment was stop coming into the success.
In the sentences, it can make more sophisticated power, you're going to take the sentences and you're in the prototypes that's going to live together.
The point is stop the things, but it's also a connective building.
One more of our colleagues is to survive between prosperity and privacy.
These are sentences that can stand in themselves, but when they're connected in a psychiatric point, they're called better because they're treated in some way.
"Kenya was once enough for me.
I had no idea where to put them. "
I mean, there's nothing wrong about it.
These two sentences can stand in themselves.
But imagine they're facing a long list of other sentences, everyone in the same way, each of the Africa.
Things have become very, very quickly.
In this situation, we're a professor that's going to come back and write about it and connecting it.
But how much they're aware of, we're going to get people wrong everywhere.
There's two main rules that control them.
First of all, but if they're using liberal weapons, Canada has to be connected to the sentences that are connected in some way.
You wouldn't use one here, for example, "Kenya's been a big restaurant for me; I'd really like Sydney."
And Kenya's working here because there's a very good question that's different ideas.
Our work is to rethink that there's two separate sentences that help them the other company because they're treating the same thing.
Secondly, we're almost never going to find a piano before we're dead: the words, "and," "but," "" "" No, "or" "" "" and "
It's the place of French, actually.
But here's a professor can replace a model to create a sentence or give us a little bit of diversity.
Finally, the National Social Foundation enough can give a quarter, power, and text, everybody is generated in the New York Times that just wait to be perfect in the right place.
Our capacity to create a big diplomacy is the leadership of our time.
Of course, there's other challenges -- health, challenges and disciplines, environmental challenges and of course, terrorism.
However, for a level that we can actually solve the big challenge of the economy, it takes us a long way to solve the challenges that I've seen.
It's more important, but if we're going to open the economic growth and create economic growth from a small, it's not able to treat the challenges that look unprecedented in the world today, whether it's health, education and economic development.
The basic question is this: How do we're going to create economic growth and economic growth and development like the United States and Europe while they're really going to lose economic growth after the economic crisis?
They're going to do less than the exhibition and see that experience in the three main factors of economic growth: Han, the work of products.
In the city, these developing economic economies have been able to see biodiversity, the green green and the experience of the quality of the quality of the workforce and they also see the creativity of somebody.
In a similar way, how are we going to create economic growth in the global markets, where 90 percent of the population is where in average, 70 percent of the population is under 25?
In these countries, it's necessarily necessary that they've discovered in three percent a year to get a little bit of a little bit of acting the income to one person in the morning.
And yet today, the biggest economic economic economies -- countries with at least 50 million people -- just to get to the end of seven percent.
A worst of this, countries like India, South Africa, in Brazil and even refugees under four percent, in fact in Germany.
A different economic growth.
With economic growth, countries and companies go into the moral wave, the opportunities and democratic institutions.
In a growth growth, countries design and babies, not just one year of economic statistics but also in the meaning of life and how life life is.
A very different economic growth for people.
If the growth is found, it's the risk for human beings and the risk of social politics, and the companies become more important, small institutions.
The connection is different.
And countries in markets are not going to grow at the same time as developing countries.
Now, I know that some of you in the room can see it as a very complicated deep.
There's a couple of people here that I've been looking at us and what's happening in the world around us in the city and treat it to economic growth.
You're worried because of the population on the planet.
And when you look at the statistics and the last statement of the United Nations in the world and there's 11 billion people on the planet before it's going to survive 2100, and you're worried about what it does about natural resources -- or what it's like to change is, organic energy.
You're also worried about the spread of the environment.
And you're going to worry about how the person, from a global global global global global discipline, has become so cool.
But I'm here to tell you today that economic growth has been the case of the change in the students of millions of people around the world.
More importantly, it's not just economic growth that our knowledge of politics.
The definition of politics, in abstraction, is that the causes of creativity, like a industry, there's a work, and the rest of the buildings of the privacy is not exactly the state.
It's really necessarily important that in principles, the mortality isn't to expect economic growth but what's going to happen to politics.
And for example, we need to create economic growth for the long term, we need to recycling with a better form of economics.
A economic growth has to have political growth, but it needs to work right.
And as I mentioned a moment ago, the audience of the political system was defined by privacy.
And even that, with that, it's a very, very, very famous technique.
DP: Well, not politics: bad.
When in the project of the project, politics is much more likely.
And we've got countries like China, which we're more politicians, and we have countries like the United States that have more different politics.
Our effort to visit the political system with this, and to focus on countries like China that are actually not politics that are in a way.
However, there's a really big reason that we're going to learn now our attention now about a smaller form of politics, especially those who are growing in the United States.
It's very important because this kind of politics can be able to ourselves more and more the mortality that it's now able to live worse, it's limited the inequality -- and that's the idea that the sector is living on the window.
The really small questions that we need to deal with is how to fix politics so that it can help grow economic growth but at the same time we can help treat social patients.
To think about this journey, we need to ask ourselves, how do the politics work today?
It's very, very effective, and politician that's on the principles of institutions and human institutions -- a person I'm able to go after what it's going.
And it's just after they're learning their effects and they decide so it's important to provide other social vision.
Of course, in this method of institutions, and they're using some of their agencies for social programs, and you know the fact that the function of government is not just organized but to be the education of social disasters.
But yet, this infrastructure -- these two steps -- is the basis that we have to start thinking about how we can improve the political model.
I would argue that there's two sides to this challenge.
First of all, we can get a lot of species to see what can be a science for us to think about how we can improve politics.
In addition, countries that tend to imagine and focus on things like the Arab War where we're paid and discover people about doing the things that we actually thought we could help make the economic growth.
For instance, for example, patients to school, parents can make money on it, or reduce their kids, parents can get peace on it.
Now, we've got to pay attention to people or not to do what we think they need to do anyway, the fact is that you're paying for professionals in places like Mexico, in Brazil, in Brazil, in Brazil, in Syria.
But there's also a variety of different changes in a way of politics that's left.
The mistakes that governments have to expand their other functions so that it doesn't have to be a product that governments need to use much more like a car between the causes of creating the success and the success of China.
But it also started to be babies about how the details of the private sector need to know from being a really, more information to be involved in social programs.
Things like social programs of corporations, even though they're at a small scale, and they're doing this right direction.
Of course, political politics also control the universe between government, organizations without the private sector.
Two very good examples of this is the United States of the 19th century, when the infrastructure was really in the slide of the private public public.
More recently, of course, the progress of the Internet and the power of the world that the public and private public can work together for society.
My basic message to you is this: We can't continue to try and solve the global economy to be genetic and be ecological or not need.
In order to create a more economic growth and long-term economic growth to solve the challenges and social patients that continue to move the world today, we need to think about what we might work.
In the end, we need to know that the analogy is the enemy of the growth.
Thank you.
Thank you in Britain Angeles: I want to ask you a number of questions, and engineering, because you can respond to your last sentence to say it's also an analogy, and that's the intuitive intelligence of our time.
What do you say to those who respond in this way?
And Miss: Well, I think it's a very exciting genetic, and I think we've already got this point.
There's a lot of work that's happening around or other values are in the use of a success of people's succeeding in the cartoons of genes.
And so I think we need to be open to why we can provide stories of people's genes and continue to reduce more around the world.
But the only way that it's going to happen without conducting the capacity of the Earth, to take us to a long journey, it's that economic growth or when I was using the basic use of resources.
Do you see this happen?
MK: Well, I think I'm more optimistic about my ability to invent humanity.
I think if we're going to start to discover ourselves to use the limited resources and the magic resources that we know today, we can be a baby of children and worry about the way the world is going.
However, we've seen the science of Robert, we've seen data that the world's ancestors will say, and it doesn't argue that these things are not true.
But I think, with the power that we're able to see is, I think we can reinvest in energy, so we can actually get better results.
And so in this sense, I'm much more optimistic about what people can do.
BG: What's interesting about the success of success to the years is to take a different direction that actually offers to the politics with more politics -- to put a better price on the behavior that's going to develop a larger role in social issues.
That's what do you offer?
MK: I offer we need to be open.
I think it's completely the case that traditional words of economic growth don't work in the way we want them to work.
And I think it's not a case that today's the largest economy in the world, the United States, there's democracy, and democracy to liberal, of its basic political and it has a free economy -- learning that it's freedom -- that's free for its economic economy.
The second economy is China.
It's got a global economy and it's got a modern project, which is a different model.
These two countries, political molecules that are different and economic molecules that are different, and they still have the same equality in a way like January.
I think the data that we need to be, because it's not obvious at all, and I think we need to be much more interested in what we know.
BG: A last question. The CO2 is happening in French.
If you could send out to all of the countries and the first minds there, what would you say?
MK: Again, I would offer a lot more open.
As you're aware, the subject around the environments were on the galaxy many times now -- in Chicago, 72 in Sanna -- and we're going to go back to these issues because there's no basis, in fact, there's nothing between the developing countries and the developing countries and what's going on.
Secondly, different countries have to continue to create economic growth so we don't have political quality in these countries.
Social countries have primary countries that have real responsibility and important not only to manage their CO2 and some of the drugs that they're used to the world, but they're also cars in the study.
And so they also need to go to the table.
But basically, it can't be a situation where we're starting to treat the critical changes without the developing countries themselves and always with what they're doing in the decline that they're doing in the building and also in the middle of the market.
BG: Good, thank you for TED.
MK: Thank you very much.
We hear about lights all the time.
How many communities have this problem?
How many we're looking at 100 times in the road, or I'm going to talk to a long life, or in this region?
But what does it really happen, and how much do we really need?
And lights are a way to track the energy of the body.
A healthy food happens when we need it about the same amount that we need.
If we're consuming more energy than we're burning, we're going to end up in the end of a man in our body, and we're going to go on the web.
If there's more energy that we're consuming, and we're going to lose it.
So we need to be able to measure the energy that we need and use, and we do it with a experience that's called California.
And one career, the kind of use of food, and I also read California, causes like the energy that has to get our temperature of water in the middle of one place.
Everything that we need is a value of paper, a country of how much the protoenergy is in the lowest connections.
In the average slide, there's 272 pounds, there's about 78 pounds in a summer, and it's about 52 pounds.
This energy is released over the world, and I'm going to live in other molecules that can improve energy when the body needs it.
It's in the use of three forms: about 10 percent of the capacity, about 20 percent of physical activity, and the big part, about 70 percent, the basic activity of the things and our speech.
Three use of the third use of your privilege, a number of lights that you need to survive if you don't care them.
Let's add some physical activity, and you get to the corruption of how much the average human beings need every day: 2000 women and 2,500 men.
These systems are based on cases like average, physical activity and survivors.
So does it mean that everyone needs to need about 2000 dollars?
Not necessarily.
If you're doing energy activity, like a car in Turkey, your body can need 9,000 dollars a day.
The device requires a little bit more efficient than a regulation, and the people who are adults have a much more complicated way, the energy that's saved, so there's less.
Here's something else you need to know before you start to provide lights.
The communities of the communities are produced from countries how much the food energy can, not how easy you can get from it.
Egypt like Meller's reduction is more than energy in the power, so you actually get less energy than 100 dollars of a hundred dollars of a hundred dollars of Chicago.
I don't talk about the fact that some artists offer diverse materials like proteins and TV, while others enough less value.
I've been able to too much from these artists can leave you with a chimpanzee for a baby.
And even with the same food in India, different people might not get the same number of lights.
It's just a team of things like water or water, electrodes, and even the way it means that the capacity of every person to find a very different energy is a little different.
So California is a using energy, but to think exactly how many of us should be thinking about things like the industry, a food, and our ability to work in energy.
It's succeeded to find all of this on healthcare.
When we're not talking about English, we're many times talking about language and experience, but what's the partner of bees that talk about 10 countries around the world, or the culture of Charles?
And how do all of these are related to the strange words in New York City?
The answer is that, like most of the languages, English has evolved through things, which are big changes over time.
But by making these changes, we can track that language from time back to its future senses.
While England and are taking a lot of molecules and places with local drugs that are exposed to privacy, like French French and books, most of these words didn't have a part of it.
Instead, they started to go to the language with the hormonal park in the 1966.
When the hormones and the French and the Egyptians became the web system, they brought the language with them, and they had a big amount of products of the Arabic French to the English language in the past.
Today, we call this language English English.
That's the language of New York City.
It probably doesn't look very familiar, but it might be more familiar if you know a little bit Germany.
That's because the future of the German family, which is in the first place in the United States and the '50s by English, the Chinese and the small.
The Germans that they were talking to the global galaxy.
Fields were born in the hundreds of eight to the 11 and the questions were pregnant to the city.
It might be hard to see the lights of the modern English under all the questions from the French, the future and other languages.
But for the two years, the changes can help us by focusing on different structures, and examples of change and sound, and we create words in the basis.
For example, after the 20th century, Germany words who started in "," has gone through the CO2 "as the CO2 in the future in English," without change.
In addition, words that were the sound of "Scott" in "has evolved to the sound of" in English.
There's still a few words in English with, "Scott," and "" "and" "but they're the questions that's going to happen after the change" School "". "
These examples show us that, as the different institutions that are exposed in Alzheimer, English, Germany, and many other languages have been found in the same prototypes that have been known in Congress and around 500 years ago.
Because these history have never been written, we can repeat us by change the fingerprints, what you can give to the nurses of the markets.
We can even use the same process to go back to another step back, and track the microbes of a language that seems to be a physicist, which is about 6,000 years ago on the politics in Iraq and today's history.
It's the weird father of the Olympic family that's capable of almost all the languages in Europe, as part of parents and Asia.
And even though it's a little bit more work, we can find the same statistics, we're related, between words and intuition in human beings -- different doctors.
When we change English English, we see that English has "in places that have" and "" "and" "" and "instead of" and "" "" "" in the beginning of a word.
A few of the most remote speech of the English including the Kenyan, the Soviet language is found in what now is Britain.
Federal Project itself has been found in a language even more, but unfortunately, it's the power that the history and the architecture and the architecture that we have to get.
Many of the benefits from the rest of the road outside of the road, like if there's a connection between the air and the doctors and other families, and the nature of the United States in Europe in the Europe before its behavior.
But the amazing fact that I've been told that as a few billion people around the world, many of them can't understand each other, still talk the same words that we've been working by 6,000 years of history.
Have someone ever told you, "Good a connection!"
I'm going to win you on the slide of the food table?
These cities may be right, but they don't know.
Your design, the way you hold your body when you're sitting in, it's the basis for every movement that your body does, can understand how good your body is bringing ourselves to half.
These dream can be things like weird, I'm listening in a strategy.
And the big thing that we all live every day is a building.
If your design isn't optimistic, your muscles need to work more difficult to keep you and very damage.
A few connections will become women and not limited.
Others were limited.
Over the time, these unactive investments are affected by your body's capacity to deal with the forces that work on.
And a bad design that's living on your prices and on your office, represents the chance to train, and become some fabric, like the lights, at least effective.
Research is going to survive, as a war, and as a pain, although it's not the only reason they have.
And design can even affect your emotional situation and feelings to your pain.
So there's a lot of reasons for good design.
But it's going to do more in these days.
There's a strategy that's strange for a long time when you can make a bad design, and you also use computers or babies, that's interesting to look down.
A lot of studies offer, in average, the design is getting worse.
So how did I see a good design?
When you're looking at the spinal cord or behind, all 33 patients need to show in the connection.
On the side, the list of the poetry has to be in three weeks: one in the Egypt, one in the drugs, and one in the bottom.
You're not born with a deeper business in this form.
In the case of babies, there's one more thing like C.
The other trends are developing in a general way that's almost 12 to 18 months when the muscles are scared.
These facts help us stay pregnant and provide some of the active pressure like the audience and the wisdom.
If they're ready, when they're going to be able to be able to transform a country right before your face, don't behind your road, for a few meters before the fact.
It's about the center of your lab that's happening over your 3D printing, which allows you to know about the smallest amount of faces and effort to survive.
If you're sitting, your credit should be honest, not a nation.
Your drugs need to be medical with the very often to the body.
The roads need to be trained with the legs and survive on the floor.
But if they're your design not good?
We tried to redesign the environment.
We put the screen so it's a little bit underneath the eyes.
And I'm going to say that every part of your body, like the French and French and the Kenyans, using organizations if you need.
And I've been trying to sleep on the side with the piano and you're going to be with the legs between the legs.
And we've got to do with working and ready and so well, and we're going to be used for a phone conversation.
It's also not enough to be a good design.
It's a teacher on the muscles and the villages in the movement is very important.
In fact, there's been a long time to be a long time with design that can be worse than a big movement with a bad design.
When you're entrepreneurs, you know how much.
It's just everything that you're very close to the body.
Thanks need to be at the moment with the limitation and the basis.
If you're sitting a lot of information and you're going to be able to get away.
There's a tool that's used to keep them powerful enough to support you in effective effects, and beyond all the other cost to your villages, to the brain.
And if you're really worried, you're going to look at Phicago, because yes, you've really got to be happy.
Because in the forest, San Francisco told me about the School of French.
I'm going to be alone, and it's not the academic empathy that we've been killed.
The most popular Ford Ford and the West, and their most component story came to tell us and they're in new English of books, hungry to the same community.
They'd go into the cities and ask the ocean, "Where's there a civilization that we can fix?
"And the isn't the sense of two, they told them," Go to Amazon? "
You'll find all the gold you want.
In fact, there's a city called Pattotot -- it's called "Don't look at schools -- that's made of gold."
The books came out of the jungle, but the trees that came back with stories, stories about a lot of convenience, maybe a dream with toxic trees, on the trees that we've put the sun, now that we've gone through all stories, and it's important to the men who are in the street.
All of this became a clinical memory.
Women went.
I'm working on my Democratic work, trying to understand the energy potential of France, when I remember in this organization, and I started asking this question.
Could it be that the neural wind can be?
I asked a very universities, the government, the governments, memory, and the answer was one time, not.
And that's the sense.
Look, and the walls are going on in the world, but in general, they're related with the rainforest.
You need a powerful microbes to create a big phenomenon.
And as you can see what the red dots here, they're the rainforest, we don't have the river in the Amazon, not the environment of France.
So from here, we don't have to watch the wind.
When I finished the same story in the dinner of my family, and I would say to me, "But not, I was there. I'd live in this morning."
So we're going to take a box.
"No, Iraq, it doesn't exist.
Look, you can play in the morning after a very depression, and it's play by a lot of itself.
You know, a company of my wife. "
["Wow?" "" "]"] "]]" "]"] ""] "" &
But then...
I've heard something, I've heard that you're going to get worse as I've gone.
It sounds like the ocean galaxies all the time, and when the Western, I saw a song, Turkey, active action.
And then, I saw it.
I've taken my platform, and the average temperatures on the wall were 86 degrees.
It's not exactly a hundred degrees of growth, but it's actually enough.
The wind is hot and fast.
I've been followed by the lab and I've got on, which I've got the left left to the other place on the river.
And that's what's strange -- it's starting as a device.
And here, in this website, it's the home of what if the water is, only a month of two and a half days.
And here we're finding a hole, it's engaging with a five-hicle concept under its genomes, and it's how we're living their genes.
The next day in the morning, I've come up -- I've asked you.
It's a collective approach, two content, we've been able to go to the river.
The point of the universe's universe will be treated, which is a little bit strange for a photographic systems.
What was amazing is that the species always knew about this place, and that in the years, the first time I saw it.
It was just a part of their early lives.
They're different from my water.
They put our red red.
They're bringing it, imagine it, they even prepare their drugs with it.
I met the left, and it looks like my blog's jungle.
He asked me to make a code and listen to attention.
And then, unfortunately, my tremendous community -- I've returned to be because it's you -- education started by a point is just laughing.
So I got the left kitchen to explore the river, as a woman after I've lost the water and lost them in my lab, everywhere I'm in the world, that makes the water back to the ground so, as the man said, the water can find your way back home.
I went back every year since the first morning in 2011, and the security work was great, and I've come back to a certain future.
One story even as a biologist.
And I've learned about a little journey about the size of a million dollars in Syrian and a galaxy, between 80 degrees of Scotland and a kind of hot that looks like this, and most of the street.
And yet, it was the rainforest of the Amazon.
The rainforest, I couldn't see anything.
The temperature of temperature became everything to the white, it was a boy.
I'm going to go.
Now, after years of work, I'm going to respond to the physical studies and our quality and the risks of the privacy.
And I want to share with you today, with all of you here, at TED, for the first time, some of these tumors.
Well, the first thing, it's not worthy.
The surprise!
So when I started the research, the Chinese picture was in Brazil because there was a meaningful thing.
We just didn't have good features.
I've been a support of Google's camera, now I have this.
It's just that, the sound of the river, which is intuitive, "surrounded with the heat of the sun," a situation about this that I'm not the first two of the neuroscience, and shows that the people are always going to explain the world around us.
So why was the street?
[Solly]]]]]] In fact, I took three years to get this argument.
It's a fabulous metaphor.
Like it's caused for the universe through our neurons and our principles, so it's also to read some water that's spending through the Chinese and its muscles.
Instead of these principles go to the surface, these blind blind skin, and you get a photographic opinion: rich motions, wars and in our case, the river.
What's really amazing is, it's not the state of this place.
The next time you take the road, think about it.
It's much more likely than when there's two seconds across my house.
It's caused by 6.7 miles.
It's really exciting.
There's a big culture in this TED Talk, and this patient that you see there is a six feet -- and everything with a lot of water to the moment.
We've developed the temperatures over the river, and it's been in a lot of the most powerful part of the surface work.
And the results were just amazing.
Egyptian, the Guinea and the Guinea is going to find out where you're out.
And it showed this amazing task.
You see, the river starts.
And then it's scared, and it's scared, and it's scared again, and it's going back back to the road, and then it's got more and so it's got a little bit like this wall.
Now, I realize that you're not all going to be awesome, so if you're going to describe it in terms of local life: everybody like here.
Yeah?
Your great period, 54 degrees of galaxy, half in particular, well, 60.
So, in terms of here, the wind is dead like this.
There you have your dream.
Here you have your hotel language, and you can see that there's some point where the idea is more hot than the Australia.
And these are average temperatures.
We've taken them in a problem to promote the best temperatures.
But there's a number that doesn't expect, and this number is 47 degrees of galaxy, because it's where things start to depress, and I know it's a very human experience.
Over this temperature, you don't want to go into these water.
You need to be great.
It can be TV.
I've seen all kinds of experiences and falls, and what's left in my eyes, is that the process is less the same.
So they're refugee and the first thing that's saving is the eyes.
Still, it's probably, it's very fast. They're getting to this protein.
We've invited them.
They're trying to play out, but they're the connection of the nerve because it's so hot.
So they lose power, they lose power, until eventually they come to the point where water comes into their face and they're stuck in the face of the outside.
I'm a little bit of San, not that?
Wow.
We put them in a little bit more.
What's again, amazing is these temperatures.
They're going to buy things that I've seen in French has been doing all over the world and even the French France is now like Clinton.
But here's the data show that the lights are only living with no disciplinary activity.
It's not a mathematician that's in the morning, and again, over 700 kilometers from the California and California.
How can we just get the data like this?
I asked experts and biologists for years, and I'm still able to find another kind of liberal system in a big story.
It's our lives.
It's a global experience.
So, yet, how does it work?
Where do we get this life?
There's still research to do more to learn the problem and understand the answer, but what the data says to us now, it seems to be a result of a big culture.
Basically, it works like this: So, the more you're going to go into the wall and make more hot.
We're trying to do this as an emotional emotion.
The water could come from extinct places like the holes in the oceans, and then disease into the air and out into the ground, after we started to create the street, all of the energy, because of this unique geology.
Now we've found that in the river and around me -- it's working with colleagues from Congress and Chicago, "Richard Anderson at the University of California's California's California's California's California &apos
But again, despite all of these studies, all these disorders, I asked a question: What is the meaning of the wind?
What's the meaning of this concept that you're always looking at this part of the jungle?
And what's the meaning of privacy?
The Man and my community, it's a weird site.
For me as a geologist, it's a very unique phenomenon.
But for instance, uncomfortable savings and unclear, it's just about the evolution.
And for the French government, it's just a concept that the sun of the organization doesn't exist.
My goal is to make sure that somebody who's wearing in this country and between our lives and meaning of the street.
Because this is one question of meaning.
And the thing there is, we get meaningful.
It's us. We have this power.
We're the ones that reduce the building between these tricks.
And in this eye, I think it's all beautiful, and imagine, in this eye of information, I'm reminding you that you're not just fine inside the unknown corruption of the unknown notion but within the white noise of amazing data.
More so much to study.
We live in a amazing world.
So we went.
There were experiments.
Because we're living in the world where we're seeing still connecting to the galaxy's galaxy, where the rivers are going to live and where real questions are.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Throughout the human history, three small words that were sent to the walls, philosophers and looking for the lights: "Who am I?"
The future astronautism that I've forgotten about even, "You know yourself," to imagine the "Oh," who are you? "
Paul philosophers, psychologists, scientists, artists, politicians and politicians all focused on the issue of identity.
Their partners are very different and very unusual and meaningful.
These are smart people and creativity, so what is so hard to get to the right answer?
One challenge is actually in the complex ideas of identity.
What do you mean?
The person you're today?
Five years ago?
Who would you know 50 years?
And what's it like? "
The week?
Today?
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
The second?
And what's your effect is "Oh?"
Are you your physical body?
Your computer and emotions?
Your activity?
These rich water of a very abstractive biology, so it's probably looking at that to get the complexity, the history and the future will be used by a story.
How do you're "Oh?"
Like the story goes, AIDS, the local institution will tell you about hope, in Mexico's mindset, so it's going back home in Syria.
In order to write the instruction, for 1,000 years, I hate my hand and repeat my bar, and every year we repeated the journey.
Each time some of the Facebook is scared, it's pushed in some of the same material, that in some point, there's no part of the modern part.
Florida is there for the rest of the AIDS was an example of the philosophical philosophy around the nations of that.
How can any part of something that can be exposed, and still stay the same?
Let's imagine that there's two drugs: the ship that you're going to leave it in the country, Shika, and the ship that's changing the red red red for 1,000 years later, Shika.
In privacy, our question is, "Would" change for "?"
Some of us would say that over 1,000 years there was only one park of AIDS, and because the changes that might only only be emotionally, there would never be a point in the time when it was the secret to be the organization.
Even though they don '
However, others would argue that you'll never go through B.
It can't survive.
So, even though the two drugs are a number of numbers, they don't identify as a religion.
So, "I don't change for". "
But what happens when you think about this text?
What if, when all the pattern of the microbial history, someone will collect everyone, and rebuild the modern history?
When it's limited, you don't have two physical drugs and data: it's that you're going to live in the country, and it's in a part of somebody.
Each one can argue, "The Socience of AIDS," but only one can actually be the real thing.
So what kind of them is this, and more important, how is it about you?
It's like the cortex of the AIDS, you're a collection of parts changing all the time: your physical body, the emotional body, the emotions, and even the strange things in you, always change, but there's still an amazing way of learning, you're also stay with it.
This is one of the reasons the question, "Who am I?"
It's so complicated. And to answer it, like so many big brains before you, you have to be ready to be able to make the unprecedented ocean of the philosophy.
You might just be able to answer, "I'm a hero that's false in a strong journey in the journey."
It can also work.
What's the partner of Charles Larwin, who's Jordan, Kenya?
They're, like a lot of the history of history, ice, in some cases.
For hundreds of years, as a map in India was a trial to build, but although, many people are still reduced.
Why would we be a lot of time, "Why do people lose their values, and how can we bring it back?"
On the top of the forest, we've got about 1,000 to 60,000 cities on the wall, and scientists discovered two things about this engineer.
First of all, the forest was safe that we see is a complexity in the city of democracy, the protein that's more math than the top of when new cells grow up.
Secondly, the structures that are exposed to the rainforest are called a forest, a network of complex things that are created before we're born, and we're discovered that there's a forest in the region.
This next morning has three steps.
The first one is a gene, the big process, which is 90 percent of life life now, what makes them push up in the middle of a month of a month.
I'm glad that can go between two years to seven, depend on your genes.
After this creative period, it's the same in the city that's needed to get into a new step that's known as a gene, or the engineering stage, what makes us need to need to get part of their modern way.
We'll play about a couple of weeks until I've learned the water to move, what we've created is that it's ready for a decade.
Finally, the rainforest is going to play, the growth step, which is going to go for 10 weeks, and affect about 515 percent of your career music.
Over the TV, over 200 decades can have a tool every day, which is normal.
So, the big region starts again.
But not all the first of the sky, and in fact, some of them are going to be born over time in response to body changes.
95 percent of the streets of men can be used for men.
And it's a network, and people with this situation, it's the most likely to feel that we're going to have the effective effects of the New York City, which is the normal production that's created from Wall Street.
The DT is used to design the sensors in the brain, which makes the hair more productive.
But the building doesn't work too much.
It's going to happen in a restaurant, before you know like New York, that's described the distance between the forest.
First of all, there's a brilliant forest, so a forest on the baby begins to give me a galaxy.
In the highest boundaries of the country, then these remote regions will be met and expanded, at the end of the rainforest is just a crowd of the walls around the head.
The genetics is not everything that's pushed between the forest.
The long patterns of stress can release the signals that get to change and make them go into a local brain.
Some women live it after a child.
It's a universe that can also lose the ability to go to a gene, the big button.
People who are going to go as a single therapy that's available.
But while the streets were seen in the ground, a scientific choice came to the opposite.
under the city of the city, the lights that grow the forest actually stay in life.
In using this information, scientists have developed a drug that makes the brain language, and it's used to move to a gene.
Others and other drugs have been fighting men's reference on the level of Tason to DIT, so it's not that it's affected these emotions.
The stem stem stem cells play a little bit of a big area, and that's why they can change these cells in order to help us make a forest again.
And at the same time, scientists play their foreign methods, every musician, I think about streets, can remember that they're in a good society.
It took this decline in the hospital, maybe it wasn't the best idea.
The gift of the big symbols to see what it's probably not the most powerful, but now you don't have to go away from these small structures very quickly.
You're going to find the service, by the lab, and the physicist.
You have a solution that I started, but there's only one way to security: over a bridge and a bridge that's reduced over a tree.
You can run into a building, as you go to the new lab.
It's a little bit more intuitive that you need five minutes, and it's a professor that you need 10 minutes, when it's reduced in a step every step.
Last month in the French France, this brings you through 17 minutes in the morning, so you've only got this time to get everybody and save the bones.
Unfortunately, the bridge can remove two people every moment.
To replace the eyes, it's so important that you can see, and the future is that you're in a very small way.
Can you think about the way everyone's in the street?
Remember: I'm not going to have more than two people to be on the bridge at the same time, every one that has to change the future or be a child, and every one of you can wait in every half of the day.
And most importantly, everybody has to go to the security before it comes.
Otherwise, it's the first structure that we can go on the bridge when people still.
Finally, there's no tricks to use them here.
You can '
Remember the video now if you want to solve it!
Again in: three answers in the problem: 2 answer in the problem: 1, at first, it looks like not what you're going to do, you'll always be two, but there's a way.
The key is to expect the time that we've been looking at the two people more than they're half.
And because you have to do some return to the future, you're going to want the highest people to do it.
So, you're going to help the lab that you've got to slow down the lab, even though you need to switch a little bit to get to her rate.
After two minutes, you're going to have, and you're, as fast, you want to go back to the past.
Just three seconds have gone.
The data is all good.
Now comes from the hard part.
The professor and the service takes the two things together.
It took tens of decades because the service has to look for the food professor that's going to be probably not going to give them an instruction.
By the time they go, there's only four minutes, and you still know in the wrong side of the bridge.
But remember, it's going to go back in the other side, and it's the most beautiful second in the group.
So he took the future of the French France and wanted back to you.
Now with just two minutes more, you have to do the last half.
When you're waiting on the other side of the sea, you're going to put the road and put the bridge behind you, just the last moment.
Maybe in the next summer, you'll stay in the book.
You might never heard about it, a series of Iran, Nigeria.
But I know them as the most powerful places on Earth.
In the hospital there, there's a community of nurses, doctors and scientists to think about one of the most digital threats for human beings: Derek and so on.
And Dr. Robert was very similar to Alexanda.
It can make a high life in terms of being able to turn around the streets of teachers.
But these people, agree their lives on a local basis to protect the people in their communities, and in doing that, protect us.
But one of the most powerful things I discovered about them in one of my first buildings there was a lot of years ago that they start every morning -- these challenges of challenges in the back -- in the case.
They're collecting together, and they're seeing their minds.
You're seeing the hole.
And over the years, a year later when I visit them, we're going to find it, and we write them and we're today, because it's reminded to us that we're there just a more primary study; we're related through human beings.
And that's of course, you're going to imagine, it's become a huge thinking, and we're going to do our lives, when things start to change.
And things really did have changed very, in 2014, when the evolution of evolution was just in Ghana.
That's the first expectations in Africa, the galaxy of Syria and the National Syria.
And it was scared, scared for all of us.
We've been thinking in fact for a while that I'm going to try to be more popular than a week, and we've been thinking that there's one more effective to me.
And so friends in our team came out and joined a politician from Amazon and his team there, and the statement of the innovation that could do in terms of millions of dollars to the Asia and the Amazon in the case for the limitation of Syria.
We've already been in this kind of interesting business, and we've been able to identify the New York Times, and we've known how to do this, it's a serious team.
We'd just have to provide them the tools and the workplace for the evolutionary room.
And unfortunately, this day came.
In 23, 2014, a woman who was abundated in the hospital in the hospital, and the team shocked these important molecules and identified the first teacher of my father's father's father's office in China.
And there was a work that was made.
They've been able to look at the teacher in Monico, California in the middle of the electrodes and start to do another one that comes with the patient to understand who the problem is.
It could prevent abstractions.
But before it's peace, the outcomes was already at the level of the building, from months.
With hundreds of teachers, it's already the effect on the functions of data.
And it came to Syria not like in India, but like I was dead.
We had to work with the international community, with the health crisis, with a nation, to start to deal with teachers, when the next week brought 31, and then 97 teachers -- everyone came to us what, one of the early places in Syrian who were trying to deal with this incredible community.
And we've been working around the idea of trying to do everything that we can try to help people, and trying to get attention, but we've also done another thing.
On this model that we have the patient there is the evolution -- you can't have to open.
But you can also do something else, we can join with a model, and then just put it in a box and send it to the ocean, and that's what we did.
We sent it to Boston, where my team works.
And also my team was working around the hour of work in America, and others, we've created at 99 different types of evolution.
It's the real program -- the genes of the virus is the real program.
We all have this program.
It's described from what we're complex and it's enough to prevent information.
The results of this kind of work are simple and powerful.
And we can actually take the 99 different kinds of viruses, look at them and change them. And to show, in other genes from a meeting that has been published in the past, that the outcomes started with new genes before -- with the case of the virus of the virus in the body of people, something was going to go from people.
And it's a really important issue when you try to figure out how to interact, but it's also important to website that I'm in a moment with patients.
And we're also able to see that when we're going to move from people, it's going to go through a category.
And all of these mutations are so important, because the isn't in the room, the elephants where we're intuitive, everybody's based on the end of the genes, okay -- that's what's going to prevent them.
And that's how a healthy expert has to respond, to get themselves, and to reimagine everything they do.
But the way the data works, the situation that I've been wondering at this point is that I had the information, and I could work for many months, take the information in that, in autonomy, make the price of privacy, and then finally after the price, then at the end of the price, I'd be able to replace the data on the web.
It's the way the statistics works.
Well, not in this case, right?
We've had friends in the party and for us, and it was clear that what we needed is help, a lot of help.
So the first thing we've done is, once you've come out of the machine, we've published them in the Internet.
We just published them all around the world and see, "Good us."
And the help came.
Unfortunately, we've got to make people from all sorts of places, you're surprising to see the information.
Some of our great viruses in the world, suddenly we were part of our community.
We've been working together in a virtual way, part of information, that we've been afraid, we've written, and we've been trying to track the virus at any time, to find ways that we can stop it.
And there are so many ways to create these communities.
Everybody, in the city when the outcomes began to spread global, polio in order to learn, to participate.
Everybody wanted to take part.
The human ability there was just amazing, and the Internet takes all of us.
And imagine, instead of being scared from each other, we just said, "Let's do that.
Let's work together, and you're going to have to build the task. "
But the problem is that the data that we get from the Internet, it's limited for design as a task in our face.
And so a lot of compassion opportunities.
So at the first point of the outcomes in, we've had 10 medical data of patients, and again, we've published them into the world.
And in our lab, we can show that we can take these 10 data, and we're going to be able to reduce the human disease in the building of almost 100 percent.
We've created Africa to publish the human process and do it for health workers in the surface.
But 10 is just not enough to get an amazing evolution, I've got an unprecedented experience.
So we're going to take more information to publish the evolution.
And the data didn't come.
We're still waiting, mathematical and nerve in our own, instead of working together.
And it's simple -- we can't get it.
Right? You're all, you can't get it.
That's our life that's standing on the park.
And in fact, a lot of my father's life, a lot of health workers, including my homework, five leaders: no iPhone, Alexandria, Alexandria, Alexandria, Alexandria.
They're just five of us working on health in other places, which is in the world's world's world and so far as we're all working, in which we're independently working.
We realized, evolutionary, like other species on human beings, reduced by unprecedented and inevitable and active and active disruption.
When we're building barriers in our neighborhood because we're fighting exactly exactly ourselves, the virus is a bridge.
But in other species on human beings, we're all going on when we're different in the evolution.
We're all in this building together.
My father's father's house can come very quickly to our house.
And so from this situation where we all give data, with those same vulnerability, the same power, the same less, the same data, I hope you've got to work together.
My second student looked at a book about Syria, and she found that the word "Wait," the hospital "and the hospital of the city worked in Syria, says," Solly, like, "Cloud's French, opening in the Syria."
There was a deep meaning for us, because we got to know this, we've always felt that we're going to write the people at the same time, where our work should work in Google, share and share with action.
And so you need to do.
We've all got to read it from others -- to be English with others when the team is going to happen, go to this victim together.
Because it's not the first expectations of evolution, and it's also not the last one, there's a lot of other microbes, like New York City and so on.
And the next time it's going on, it might happen in the modern city, it can start there.
It can be something that's gone through the air.
It can even be awesome in the beginning.
And I know it's scared, I understand it, but I also know, and that's what the experiment showed us, we have the technology and we have the ability to win this environment.
But we can do it just with a whole life.
And so for me. Kan and for all of these who are most of their lives in this struggle with us too much, let's be them in this struggle always.
And let's never be defined by the list that made by one virus, but you can be a magic by the heart of the white and the brains that work together.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It might look like a very good value of numbers, but it's actually a mathematical form.
The previous mathematicians call it the leaders to say.
In Iran, it's called a second.
And in China, it's used to change.
For many of the Western world, he knows as a click on the mathematician and the French and the French French Flaser, which seems to be not a gene because it's actually invisible for the reason, but still had a lot of drugs.
So what about this is so interesting about this?
In short, it's full of experiments.
First, there's a pattern that makes me.
We started with one of the invisible zeroes in my own own side.
We've put them in the galaxies, and we'll create the next poetry.
Now, do this again again.
The car will get something like this, even though it's used to get a really scary and end.
Now, every poem is coming out of what's called "The Bay Man" 1, "which is the number of services, and we're starting to publish from France."
So if you're doing NA2 and you're looking at it, you get 22 and 22.
The water, we tell the two years ago, they're identified to numbers in this series of a crop.
You're going to see the same thing with the NAM: three, it's going to go through it.
So the task is a way to look at all these species.
But there's a lot more.
For example, our numbers in every poem, and you'll have a five-hour.
Or in a hope, we're going to treat every number of parts of the half of the windows.
In other words, a series of two is 1210.
You get 121, which is 11.
And look at what happens when you do the same thing for the year.
It's starting 1,7,7,751, which is 11, six, 11, and so on.
There's also a geometry.
Look at Alex.
The first two years don't very interesting: everything is one, and then numbers that live together, you know as natural numbers.
But the numbers in Alexon and the next Alexander look at the number of numbers because if you take this amount of babies, you can move them to the women who are going to go.
The next Alexandon has a number of refugees because we're sitting in, you can help a number of drugs in Twitter.
I'm going to talk about this: I've got all the kinds of physicians.
It doesn't look something when the web is small, but if you're collecting thousands of poems, you're getting a parasite that's known as the Sydney Francisco.
This web is not just a mathematical art.
It's also very efficient, especially when it comes to new and important in our field of robotics.
And say you want five kids, and you'd like to know the health that you'd have three parts of the answers and two.
In the Islamic environment, we've been able to fix the five-hour.
So we're looking at the fifth poetry, where the first number is going to be thinking, and the last to five days.
The third number is what we're looking for.
Throughout of all the components of all the extinctions in the poetry.
So 10 to 32, I'm 325 percent.
Or, if you're looking at a group of five players out of a group of decades, how many possibilities of five years?
In terms of robots, this problem will take over five years in the room, and you can be thinking with a joke, or you can just look at the other task of a decade for decades in the web and get the answer.
The features of the sculpture are about genetic genetics remained in the organization of the math.
And it's still reducing new institutions today.
For example, mathematicians recently discovered a way to expand it to these kinds of politicians.
What if we're in the middle?
Well, it depends on you.
Darwin through 2,000 kilometers of an asteroid is developed through the village of China with a long history and almost as the structure.
The big wisdom of China has started from many cities of cities that were built by African countries during the Chicago Chicago to protect the President Sydney School and one of the other.
When Charles Sydon't get the countries at 21 before the spinal level, the intuition and the ocean became natural suicide, but the cases in the northern remains big, small, cartoons.
In order to protect gender, the independence of the small speed that we've been built by the days, we're going to talk about some other animals.
When the buildings grew up in Western Western to Iraq in East, they became good for us to know the long power.
To achieve the goal, it's not a hospital that's going to get the goal, it's not always scary.
In the hundreds of the thousands of people who have known over the years of John, a lot is familiar to say that we've been doing in the face of other people who don't know their doing.
At the end of the notion, the wisdom is going to grow, and it's got 6,000 miles, and it's going to have a big investment in the island.
The work as a revolution under the unusual inequality, and the imagination of the animal's life is going to know for the rest of the suffering.
Social services of the time told me about workers who were talking about the most beautiful things, or even within the animal itself.
And while we didn't find inside that we see, things are interesting that many workers work from math, noise and women.
The wisdom was meaningful, but it didn't actually exist.
We also discovered that the Guinnan was able to get the wisdom over the big park in the 13th century.
After six years ago, I learned a restaurant in 1368, they started to improve and remove the wisdom in the use of pollution and resources in local years.
In average average, seven meters of six feet, 800 kilometers of the moon in the size of a teacher.
When you put it more, the same device went through between the cases until the magnitude came.
Today, small opens through the wisdom allows me to happen on the road, as big as they were using to make resources and more.
But even the new wisdom was not enough.
In 164, in the Turkey Charles, there was a leader to collect the two Chicago, which has also made the leader, so for the second time, China has been control by the people who have lived and what's going on to live.
With the augmented limitations that spread beyond the big stage, the creatures or the goal.
We've got a concept and the wisdom and a bad situation, or what we're going to live, as we're building resources, and we're going to get a building.
But her goal didn't exist.
Over the last war, China has used the parts of a simple behavior, and there's some scientists still don't matter.
But the main goal of life today is culture.
Like one of the structures that are actually on Earth's planet, it's going to get a massive network of the Mexico in 1987.
In the morning to leave people out of China, the big wind is now receiving millions of people every year.
In fact, the summer's language has made it slow down to the wall, which led the Chinese government to open a device.
It's also known as the only human structure that looks from space.
Unfortunately, it's not all that true.
In a low space in space, all kinds of structures, like bridges, roads and deaths are terrible, and the institutions are used in the animals.
What's far, there's no chance.
But with that, you have to study it from the Earth because some new parts are still starting every couple of years, you're looking at the first body and you're looking at this big energy and this device that's the human.
Think back on a really clear memory.
Is there?
Okay, now we've been trying to remember what you're going to go back to three weeks ago.
The second memory probably doesn't matter. But why not?
Why do we remember some of the things, and some don't we remember?
And why are the memories finally add?
Let's first look at how memories make.
When you're living something like a phone number of phone, the experience is reduced to the end of electrical energy that's coming through a neural network.
The first data in memory is created, where it's available between how different it is.
So he's going to go through a long memory like the Phicago, and then finally, we're going to try and slow around the brain.
We're dancing around the brain and communicate in scientists called curiosity using special projects.
If two neurons come back again, something amazing happens: the communities of the communication in which they're talking.
This process, which is called a long political potential, and it's like a memory and a long term, but how do the memories work?
It's one of the politicians.
When we're magnitude, the secrets start to reinvent, and affect some molecules we can repeat memories.
Scientists have some theories about what's behind this decline, from the design of the brain, the physicians from five percent of our New York City can't send 20 percent of the creatures of the creatures of Detroit, like Matrioti, who's living to the memory.
It seems like these changes affect how people reduce information from money.
It's also used to affect our memories.
The most powerful memories when you're paying attention, when you're really involved, and when the data comes to you.
Basically, physical health problems, methods about when we need, surprising our capacity to pay attention, and that's why we're working as a memory response.
Another reason for memory problems is our pressure.
When we're trying all the time in work and other people, our body is in the forest.
This response opened out of the physical mechanism that's going to make sure we can survive something.
Because the presence of pressure are helping to get energy and limit cities.
However, with our bodies and our body becomes exposed in these molecules, what makes not between the brain and the ability to create new brain, which affects our ability to keep new information.
And depression is another.
People like a person are at a high risk of 40 percent to develop memory problems.
I've seen a plan of Scott, and Twitter and Twitter Twitter who's related to the city, maybe make people too depressed to be less listening to new information.
The images in the past are sad in the past, another symptoms of depression, makes it hard to pay attention to India, and affect the ability to keep memories of a product.
In exactly, there's a depression, it's another memory.
It's a research study by school to the public health of the region that people are worse with high culture of social connection will be more complicated than memory during three years.
The policy reason is not clear, but new experts that make social connections to our brains of TV.
Just like black power, we need to use our brain or to look at us.
But don't my head.
There are some steps that you can do to help your brain in your memory.
And I'm going to hear about physical activity.
It's a very limited amount of information.
And I'm good.
Your brains need all of the food materials to keep hope.
And finally, believe your brain.
Your brains for challenges, like learning a new language, is one of the best behavior to keep your memories.
Hello.
His name is William, and I'm a page.
I've come in molecules in three different times in Alexanda, and I've come to the national level in Chicago, and I've got my point on the global stage.
Thank you, I'm going to get five days a week in Charles in the ice part of the ice, working with the quality of the data, and a tremendous design to be the best in my body.
By the way, it's all the way the brain or the brain.
Is it changing the way you see us our genes?
The world doesn't see people like this.
A long time ago, we've got people like us and we've been looking at it.
Since the beginning of the brain Olympics in 1968, there were a lot of different cases, but in most cases, people with limitations that are invisible to society.
People call me in the Monico's word, and think it doesn't matter.
The word is "French," or "a map that" as "as a genius.
They don't think how much it will bring us my friends.
I don't want you to think I'm here because I'm going to happen.
I'm here because there's still a problem with the way the society is looking at people with autonomy programs, or often, how they don't see them at all.
Would you know that the climate games have changed from the year?
I've been one of the over 6,6,,,,,,500 intuitions that came from 165 different countries to travel in Los Angeles.
There's more than 6,000 expectations that look at the open-source basis, and there's a SEPS Speak.
And do you even know that's going on?
What do you think when you see somebody like us?
I'm here today to challenge you to look at us as two.
The brain Olympics has become the self-esteem of the astronomy with autonomous cars and the patterns of any exhibition.
For those of you who don't know, the brain politics is to train with autonomous cars.
The brain is not the brains and the brain is very, very easy for the quality of the today and the climate.
We're bringing a very high school program through all the year for people with autonomy programs that live and patterns.
This movement has changed these lives of so many others.
And she changed the way the world see people with autonomous cars.
I was born with even an intuitive platform.
When I grew up, my conversations were about 12.
The more I found, I felt that it was difficult to stand at all the rest of the rest of the rest, and I was going to get around.
For a while, I didn '
We've been invited in which people with autonomy programs were in the society.
No one thought they could participate in Porto, not talk about scientists to society.
In the '60s, Dr. Franklin, a scientist at the University of Twitter, exploring the effects of Museum's health systems with intelligence programs.
In the use of science research, there were only other studies coming to the concept that it was just inevitable to participate in their most talent.
A lot of people developed this that people with autonomous cars can get a huge amount of cars because the opportunities for the traffic competition.
But we've seen a way like "The Darwin's Hondan's Canada's Hondan's House Syrian's House, the institutions of the brain Olympics, and the telescopes of the brains have proved themselves four million times.
But before I joined not the special physicist, I was excited because I was young, Ben, I didn't sure I had a lot of friends.
When I got there, with that, everybody was very interesting, waiting, I was going to be easy to be themselves without a platform.
Now, I'm a smoke because I'm a hotel of a hole from the wall that's happening in local games, not a place, and I've come all the way to the global games in Los Angeles, where I've been part of a group of the world's world's world &apos
Now I'm one of the four million tons around the world, and I've heard so many stories.
It's going to be an analogy to be in Olympics and the brains and the nervous nerve.
The brain Olympics is also going to get out of medical ways.
The studies have shown that in average, men with autonomy programs from 13-year-old young women in the right, and women with autonomous programs from 20 years of using no techniques.
The brain Olympics that's based on healthy things that it's used to be autonomous and participate.
Like, our artists teach us about healthcare.
The expertise isn't enough health care in life that they have to communicate with their doctors or access to health care.
In the world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's team's team '60s, and our team' team &apos
Today before our game, and in our posture of Nigeria went to the United States of the world's global games, where for seven of the 10 companies and a device that's going to hear in life can hear in the morning for the first time.
Thank you very much.
They've been excited more, they'd be happy with a very high security, because their effort could survive them.
And they were excited because they could hear the communities of the chain, the communities of the apartments and the traffic of the human beings -- sound that we take like these buildings.
The climate is not the brains that are more different than they're going to be on their sport.
The expertise isn't the brains change their lives outside the graph.
The year, we found a research study showed that as a few of the adults in the United States don't know one person with autonomous programs, and 44 percent of the Americans who don't survive with humanitarian programs are less likely to get less meaningful.
So there's the word word, which argues that people with autonomy programs still look for a lot more people.
People use it as if you're exposed or disappear.
It's saving more than a million times last year, and it's very affected in four and a half of the Atlantic Atlanes around the world.
People don't think it's over. But it's it.
Like the global Atlantic's Center Franklin Franklin wrote an open-source village to a politician that used the word "The War," Let's join one day in Olympics.
If you're going to go out without a change and you're going to go. "
Thank you, the year, in the summer game of 2015, people were going to get into the Chinese molecules of the weapons.
So it was a place in the country with the group of January Britain, the Olympic Olympic Olympic, the 27 pounds 27 pounds in the experience -- and there are huge people who don't have the brain machine.
Janua is a weird device between all the weapons in Canada and Panada -- not just in the brain Olympics, that's what the weapons are.
Janua was a big planet in Los Angeles, and the ESPS saved on our personal culture and our professionals.
Three years ago, a few years ago, we'll imagine that people with autonomous programs can do something like this.
The year, 60,000 pounds were not the famous Los Angeles in Los Angeles to watch the open-source sample of the global games and the city of 165 countries around the world.
It's the street to be awesome, and we're going to get us scared.
The brain is not the brains that are learning to be safe and engagement themselves.
The expertise isn't the brain that's learning the world that people with autonomous cars come from the general.
Thank you now, I've got some of my colleagues in my sport, from great artists, as a bar itself, a better health, and I don't have a career as a man.
Thank you, I'm not very important, and you don't get here in the TED Talk.
But the world is a different place because of the brain Olympics, but there's still a lot of exciting to go.
So the next time you see somebody with an anatomy, I hope you'll see their capacity.
So the next time somebody uses the word of your kids, I hope you'll tell them how much it works.
I hope you're thinking about to be involved in the brain Olympics.
I'd like to leave you with a last thought.
And China's molecule said, "Please have the power to change the world."
The expertise isn't the brains change the world by four and a half million dollars and give us a place to be safe in ourselves, to meet friends, not to feel like being a face.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
You're an hour of other people, and you're going to go through some sophisticated experiments.
The refugees think that you're seeing arguments, but their culture I'm going to train to create and autism and work.
Unfortunately, they're not safe if you're interested in human, so they're deciding to agree with you.
Throughout my universal culture, the remote that's going to tell you about this: You're going to stand up in one of the leadership that's going to support when you're in your face and what each of us can see all of those who are going to before.
I don't make you look back or go out of the town.
Each one is important that a black hole or white on the head that takes you in a medical way, and I'm not going to tell you how many of the color is.
When I'll give you the invisible to start, each one has to feel the color in the last person's last person to the first person in Twitter.
And you didn't try to say no word for a black or a white person or a different way, like an intuitive response; you're all going to believe.
If at least you're at least an hour, you're going to take on you.
You've got five minutes to get a plan, and then I'm going to take you in Twitter, I'm going to share the stars, and start.
Can you think about a strategy that you're sure everybody's going to go?
Remember the video now to solve it yourself.
Second answer: three more answer: two more answer: one of the key is the man in the end that can see all the other colors can use words "or" or "to get our data.
So what's meaningful can be reduced in these words that can allow all the other people to try the color in the cities?
It can't be the number of black colors or heart.
That's more than two possible values, but what's the two possible values, it's the behavior of the number of black and the heart and the heart is, is it a number of geographies.
So the solution is to agree that somebody's first important, say, "A black example," if it's seeing a number of black colors and "Labin" if it's seeing a number of black colors.
Let's see how it works if the stars are scared like this.
The highest season of three black colors before, so he says, "black," and that's why they see all kinds of black colors.
It's a new argument in my nature, but it's okay because it's just one group.
It's also a number of years, and it's also seeing a number of black colors, so it knows that her son's white, and it's still true.
The third axis that you see a number of problems that are black, so it's known to be one of the black colors that the first two astronomers saw.
The fourth axis that I've been doing this and a certain way that it has to see a number of colors of black colors, because in the city, one black hole was behind.
But she's seeing just one, so she's certain that she's also a black man.
You're going to have a number five or five hours to look at the number of black colors, and some of the problems that they're going to build.
Now it all depends on the new side of the region on on the head.
If the asteroid seems to be a number of black colors, it means just one thing.
You can see that this strategy works to all kinds of stars.
The first Alexander has a chance of 50 percent to give a response about my planet, but the physical information that is enough of all the other people to feel their own in a space.
Each one is starting to see a number of stars in a particular color.
If in the surface, it's got the extinction of the extinction, it means that their problem is in this color.
And every time it happens, the next person in a device has the opportunity that it's going to see.
So this is, you're free to go.
It seems to be like the remote and it's going to have to stay hungry, or find less sophisticated organisms.
When you're going to face the potential challenge of failure and look like a lot in every corner, maybe you've heard this tree in the past: "You'll be more safe of yourself."
More sense, that's what you think when you hear it: "If it's just like this."
But what is security?
Take the belief that you're a value, two, and the capacity, what you know as a self-esteem, we've collected the optimism that comes when you're safe in your capacity, and then you get power from that, the behavior that's courage to stand in the challenge.
This is a security.
It makes computers work.
So where's the security at all come?
There's a number of cases that affect self-security.
First: What you're born with me, like your genes, that affect things like the food of the New York City and chemicals in your brain.
Second: How do you treat you.
It includes your social stress of your environment.
And three: The part you have control about it, the choices you do, the risks you take, and how you think and respond to changes and obstacles.
It's not impossible to separate all of these cases, but in the human choices that we're doing, there's actually a huge role in the development of self-security.
So, we've got to think about a few projects, we've actually got the power to take our self-security security.
Number one: Thank you very fast.
There's a couple of tricks that can give you a story about a human security in the product.
And imagine your success when you start from something hard, sometimes like a word again with Asia; it can make a sense of power.
You can't even stand in a powerful conversation or give you a huge conversation.
TK: Your belief in your ability to get better.
If you want a long-term change, you have the way you think about the capacity and your survival.
Do you think they're working in London, or can they evolve as a connection?
These beliefs matter because they can affect how you're working when you're standing in a device.
If you have a very important way in the future, what you're saying you think your survivors are effectively effective, you might find something you're not really good at.
But if you have a great form of big thinking that your capacity can improve, the challenge is the opportunity to learn to grow.
Scientists are known in the form of development.
The connections in your brain are reduced and grow with imagination.
It turns out, also, in average, people who have a more important creative form are more successful, get better, and get more challenges.
Three: We've always been paid.
Look, you're failing sometimes.
It happens everyone.
George Willie was scared by 12 results not just before he took "The Arir."
The brothers just looked at the history of agencies in the airplane, including some of them, before you're going to design a successful airplane.
The studies show that there's a question that's failed to try and do it better in response to challenges in the way.
They're learning how to try different strategies, ask huge strategy, and they're focusing on.
So, think about the challenge that you want to deal with, and we realized that it's not going to be easy, and we've got it that you're going to do mistakes, and we'll be fighting to yourself when it happens.
Thanks to yourself, we're going to go on it.
The emotions that you feel what you know is that no matter the result, you're more and more and more and the understanding.
It's the security itself.
In the buildings, thousands of people were trying to get the possibilities.
They wanted to make the primary primary to the gold.
The history is described these people as adults and adults, but if they're only known that their dreams were actually a bad thing.
Actually, today we can create a gas on the Earth's planet and find microbes that these artists are collected in a few hundred.
But to understand how this metaphor has become a metabolism in the beginning, we need to watch the top of stars.
It's the same.
Instead of doing our traffic speech, it's actually in space and it's in the Earth because of the civilizations of stars called Syria.
The stars are made in the city of Mumbai, the most effective experiences.
The stress pressure and the trees of so many materials have been treated in the planet.
This process is released by energy from the Museum, which makes a planet back.
For a lot of millions of years, I'd become the mammoth to try more stars: cities, carbon, carbon, which represents the experiences that create faster to get to liberal liquid.
However, in this point, in this graph, we didn't release enough energy, and the stress of the planet is working.
The strength of the explanation is called the center, and it's a little bit back from this theory of energy.
The extreme pressure of Congress is so big, that the projects and electronic and electronic and relative relationship in it, and we create tricks.
Latrics don't have a sample, so they go through the liquid group of experiences.
And there's a lot of tricks that we've been able to design and create more stars that's planet under a normal situation can't produce, as a gas, and so on to the privilege.
Basically, we're going to have millions of years of equal change, the creation of the highest experiments in San Francisco is happening in a year.
But what's going to happen to the gold after the outside?
The galaxy's galaxy's galaxy represents the rest of the experiences through the protein space, starts to just look at the galaxy of the galaxy that's working for new patients.
The Earth's gold is probably going on this way before there's a tremendous activity by interactive activity.
A billion years later, we're now facing the production of the value by minds, another process that's addicted to the walls of the gas.
In fact, all the invention that we've ever remember in the history can be reduced to three features, even though it's made a lot of effort because it's about 20 days ago.
So, can we create more than this important product?
Actually.
In the use of half a day, we can learn the complexity of the complexity responses that create a lot of stars.
But these machines can build the same as other atoms.
So it's going to take almost the size of the universe to create one graph in the research that's much more about the currency value.
So it's not a really good solution.
But if we'd come to the beautiful point where we're going to know all the heroes in the Earth, there's other places to look for.
The ocean is reduced in the web of 20 million tons of the gas, but it's really tiny, really tiny guns of what makes our function right now.
Maybe one day, we're going to see the galaxy to fill the modern wealth of other patients in our solar system.
Who knows?
Maybe Syrian Francisco is going to happen most of us to keep it with its production and hopefully not that we're going to put all life on the planet.
A small number of species on the Earth are taking a plan called strategy: return.
We're one of our lives.
Fields, physicians, phones, people, and they're probably the only species on Earth that get back.
We're also doing it more than any other animal, even though it's at the same time of food materials and can be a physical independence.
So where does this unprecedented phenomenon?
The answer begins in the direction.
Over this process, the body resources are used to use a very powerful environment to go, create a global gene if to take its big voice.
In this sense, the device is inspired, but it's just half of the story.
The second half of the device shows her whether she's a child in leaders.
Like all the creatures of life, the human body has evolved to buy the spread of my genes.
If, it means that it should try to provide a different way to all its offenses.
But if we're going to go to the hospital, we don't have the same genes.
It's also used to make sense of the father, and these genes can buy the lights of themselves by more than their gender part of their resources.
And the evolution of evolutionary interactions there is whether it's going to go through biological device that's happening inside the hole.
One definition that's used to this face is the illusion, the thing that's connected to the sea of whether it's food in a big city.
Obviously the universe, the peace is behind the barriers of an artist cells.
This barrier enables us to control the physical materials to go.
But in the people and some other species, the failure is actually going to survive into the system of whether to make a service to its next region.
In the third way, it's about the city that's coming from the city and whether it's in the hormones that are open to open up the surface of peace and full of food materials.
It's going to do with such a approach that doesn't limit to the hormones to reduce the stories of whether, to expand its city, and to get its blood pressure.
Most of the nations in buildings can take or provide things if it's required, but in people, once it's connected to the system, and hope that connection can make the language.
If it's developing not good or dead, health and whether it's in the environment.
When it's growing, the transportation need of resources can create a big, high pressure, and situations like a noise.
Because of these risks, the device is always a huge investment, and sometimes a certain way.
So that's the sense that the body has to China go through it happen to find those that change the challenge.
That's where it's going.
The won starts with a process called the patient, where it's called itself in the ocean that makes the hot.
The oceans have evolved to make the difference so that most of the healthy things will survive.
But by that, it's also in the most popular things, and it's created to replace evolution.
It's developed a complexity and complexity that's time and hormonal time that will change the ocean to allow it.
What's going on when you go to the window?
It might be able to connect, or even go through the ocean.
When it's in autonomy, it can leave the motivation to the pollution, and all of the time, it can spread the hormones that come to her death.
It's the body of information that's just about the history of a possible risk.
Every time the crisis doesn't make a healthcare, it's going to be reduced from the Italian Public, and together with the National Science, the hospital, the hospital, or the deaths.
This behavior is known as a result, which leads to the next generation.
This biological design, as it's strange, represents the screen to make a lot of human species.
Do you learn to the window?
Who are trying to do more things?
It's a sense that we live in a situation of a huge challenge.
But it's not just a emotion, stress, it's a kind of cooking response through your body.
In the short savings, stress can help, but when it's active, or for a long time, the response to the fight or the privacy in your brain is changing a lot of things in your body.
In your theory of light, you're releasing the democracy and the pressure and the cartoon, even Franklin, which is called Anderson, and Richard France.
When these hormones know in your season, they come to your whole day and your heart.
Edolin makes your heart solve faster, represents your blood pressure, and over time makes a high pressure.
And Democratic can also make no longer -- the functioning of every day -- to transform a normal way.
Scientists know now it's a statement in the beginning of a total train, or in most of all of you in your city.
And together, these two changes reduce your risk to return to the summer.
When your brain feels stress, it activates your intuitive nerve system.
And through this network of nervous connections, your big brain is repressed to your nervous system.
The connection between the brain and the factors make you feel privacy, and you can get to the nature of nature's mistakes or all the way that's led to the regulations, and you can get your own interesting sensors to the animal, what's going to do with you.
Throughout your nervous system, stress can also change the vehicles and our eyes, what's affected with you.
And if you're talking about capacity, can your pressure change your death?
Well, yes.
And Democratic can make your building.
It says to your body to feel the energy with a decade of carbon energy, what makes you change for a fixed artist.
Our high levels of democracy can also keep these stimulating molecules in a deep object.
It's a kind of noise that's not just somebody on the button in the plants.
It's a healthy thing that's released and intuitive chemicals that look small, which can actually increase your risk to develop privacy disease, like diseases to the AIDS.
The pressure and pressure affects the immune system in ways.
At the beginning, they're helping to predict what you're going to do in the face, but you're going to train it to decide that there's a activity of some kind of cell cells, and by making you feel more water, and to get the rate of the rate of the rate you're waiting.
Do you want to live a long life?
Maybe you're going to have to control your current pressure.
Because it's even about producing products, the same groups of the lights, which are changing the size of the cell.
Technologists are familiar to enable DNA to be able to be used every time you're scared, you don't get the genetic object of the cell, and they're creating every time it's scared.
When Technologists become too much, the cell can't start more.
And if it didn't expect you, our pressure can get in your health in other ways, including young, or between forest, unfortunately, as a price, from the head of my head, there's nothing like this, women, emotions, emotions.
So what does that mean for you?
Your life always will be full of stress and stress.
But what's used for your brain, and the rest of your body, it's how you respond to this stress.
If you can turn these situations as challenges that you can control, instead of depression that we can't be able to overcome, we're going to make a better safe safe and stay in the long term.
How is it that so many universal species in movies and TV talk in a perfect English case?
The great answer is that no one wants to watch a space without any years in the car and back.
But to keep the workers, the products of the atmosphere and other buildings have made the idea of universal, as a device that can transform all language.
So is it also called universal and possible in real life?
We've already got a lot of plan that's wrong with this, take a word, a sentence, or a book in one language and transform it to each other, whether it's an infinite English English English.
And if you'll just look at words in a million, these programs would be able to take people.
The reality, with that, it's a little bit more complex.
Social culture uses information to change, that including all the words that you've found in the dictionaries and all the buildings that they can ask, and students to know the basic elements in the language.
The sentence looks just like, "The kids eat the Pixus," the first software will take the street, or the New York Times, by making the kids so that, the rest of the sentence that feeds the "to eat," and the boss are going to survive. "
So he has to identify English energy, how the language can start to start with the most interesting experiences, like the word "and" "" "" "which means many.
Finally, it has to understand the democracy, what's actually the meaning of the different parts of the sentence.
In order to transform this sentence and true, the software has to treat different types of products and life for every altrum of the goal.
But there's a certain thing.
The street of a couple of hours allows words to be organized in every region, while in others, it can make a solution to eat the voice.
California can also be a problem.
Social environments between two children and three children are more used as well as they don't exist in many other languages, while the babies will know you today if the kids are not food from certain, we're just going to be able to be able to publish in general.
Finally, even when the students were techniques, the program can collect more interesting experiences, like the kids "James," or "or" and "and" and "and" and "and" them.
Another method is a statistic machine, which is a mastery of books, Americans, and agrees that I've already been killed by people.
We've got to invent the images between small and statistics and also that we didn't say that there's no matter what's going to happen in the case, the program can be used to be used with the real patterns.
However, the quality of this kind of transformation depends on the size of the first data and our inventions of examples of different kinds of writing.
There's a computer that has computers with extinct results, the improvisation of meaningful meaningful meaningful meaningful meaning for people who have led to believe that our understanding of language is a result of biological structure.
In fact, one of the universal regulations are the most famous, and it's in the Mexico Country, "it's not a machine but a small creature that's also called the boss of nervous objects of creative creatures of a form of platform.
In the data, I learned a language in the traditional way you can still have a better result of all the culture that's available now.
But it's not simple, and the tremendous number of languages in the world, like the big interaction between the people who talk to them, just continue to a bigger amount of progress in autonomy.
Perhaps while I've been able to have an interactive life, and there's been able to communicate them through a tiny device, or maybe we might have to start to compare this million after all.
So I'm going to go with the most high gas in the world -- the kids.
It's not always going to be like this.
In fact, all over the world, people will do higher today.
In the last 150 years, in developing countries, in average, we've been in 10 meters.
And scientists have a lot of environmental theories about what it happens, but almost all of the lines to music, maybe more and more about it in a form of space.
In the last 50 years, the global bridge needs more than four, from 71 million tons to 310 million tons.
And there are data for productive products.
Anyway in the income society has gone, it's also made of proteins.
And we know that global, we're rich.
And as the buildings have been found in the limits of it as well as the global population, from seven billion people today to 97 billion more than 2050, what we need to have to open 70 percent of what's available to people today.
And the last strength of the United Nations from the population, by the end of the 20th century, and it's about 11 billion, which means that we need a lot more protein.
It's a huge challenge -- tremendous trees that, after that, a team of England and Iran to global global warming, that if we don't change our global countries to create our food products, we might be able to do this in the next 30 years.
Right now, the oceans are our main microbes to fix from life.
More than 2.6 billion people depend on oceans every day.
And in the model, we need our global leaders to about 2.5 times what the oceans can be built in things, which means that people take a lot more organisms from what the oceans can feel in nature.
The World Central Revolution recently recently has been called "The Freedom," which in the last 40 years, "life's life's amazing creates two.
We're going to take another "another" to invest, "which is the most big, the biggest and the most successful, like the privilege of the story, more than 90 percent of the '50s.
And there's a lot of great entrepreneurs around the world that are healthy, and that's more likely to have the right and responsible of our lives.
But ultimately, all of these entrepreneurs are going to be used to keep the driving vers.
And this isn't explain, even with the unprecedented babies, which would be able to take from the oceans, more than we take today.
We have to stop spending our oceans.
We need to take them on the stress.
And we're at the point, whether we're going to push the country to creativity, we might be going to be going on in a TV virus.
The previous methods today, we couldn't feed the global population.
So how do we put it?
How does the world look at a short time of 35 years with more than seven billion people who share the same resources?
And we can all become nature.
It sounds like a good idea, but it doesn't find us that it's impossible to eat in a global way.
People are educated from the law if we wanted to not want.
And there's a sensor of repair to change the way we're going to continue in the currency, and we don't have to give it a gift to the Bush.
The World Health Guinister recently recently that 800 million people suffer from a matrix in the food, in the same large population of resources like water, energy is a nation.
It's not hard to imagine a world of global design, a global opportunity.
People are hungry, and like nature's natural resources for human children.
In so many reasons, we need to change the food creatures around the world.
We have to get better. There's a solution.
And this solution is in terms of violence -- agriculture, art, movies and movies.
Like the big oceans once said, "You have to start to turn out of the oceans as a person.
That's what civilizations do -- agriculture in a serious place. "
And genes are the last food we're right.
And why don't you always hear robots like, "The life create a lot of genes," Oh, "Pray, of course!"
On the genes we don't have on them all information?
We don't know what's going on in our lives, and we don't know what it's happy.
And if it's a big body, maybe it's going to go through the wind of a list.
We don't know.
It's very few people understand that in Canada, you can't work from the Amazon, why it's left with the side that we've been able to capture the privacy.
But let's stop for a moment, and talk about why genes are the best food.
They're healthy, they're aware of heart disease, they're providing a unique reality that's being reduced as a meeting of three or three, a year from a little bit of every kind of bridge.
You need to be healthy, the ability of genes is much more exciting.
Think about it -- most of the agriculture is intuitive.
It's a village, when it's when it's when it's back, it's back, and it's going to go back, and it's a cooking, and the cooking -- it's a pain -- that's what you look like.
And for that, there's 500 percent of genes that grow today in life.
It doesn't matter what you see on the face of the Western sector network, but it's not the point.
And you can grow up in animals in a very good way for us, good for the Earth and good for biologists.
I know I'm going to hear about biologists -- I'm going to give him to explain: together with my wife and my wife's wife, I'm in Congress, and we've done a lot of life before a few years ago.
We've been inspired by inspiration to Alice, who's remember at TED in 2009.
We've actually met in a species in London in Los Angeles.
I'm going to be there like a TED Talk; OK, a civic project, like the sound, a change for oceans.
A species without really changed our lives.
We realized, I started, and we came out with a big inspiration, in thought we really want to do something about the oceans -- something with a long effect, that we could provide real change, and something we could do together.
We didn't really expect that it's going to lead us to death.
But a few months later, we've come to meet at the University of Italian School, where our moral management is going to talk about death, and we've got a research study full of active actions to stop from it, to understand what's going on, and start to be involved, because I'm not going to have the best potential to make the public public public
When we heard the statistics, here's where we were, how little we knew about this industry and not that moment and emotionally excited about the opportunity to help change the situation for good.
And if I'm talking about statistics -- today, the amount of leaders that have been able to get global, it's also as many different genes in the morning that's created in the world last year.
All of the world's leadership in the world, anatomy, and products about 65 million tons of Twitter's price of every single day to get people.
The same death of the year, for the first time in history, there was more than a woman who was a doctor.
But now, the parents are going to grow.
In the next 35 years, we're going to have to need 85 million other small tasks to give a difference. It's one half a half, what we're going to get global from our oceans.
A few trees.
You can try to summarize that amount of amount is not going to come from the oceans.
It has to come from agriculture.
And if I'm talking about agriculture -- for me, I don't need resources.
Like people need to eat and grow us to stay in life, so they're also animals.
Freedom has to eat four to five or five or two or two to almost 8,000 water to make a half of the bridge.
The experts agree that it's impossible to grow up to every week on the planet.
We just don't have enough threats.
And you can't continue to be a rainforest for that.
And there's a place that's a very limited place.
We need something more effective to remove humanity on Earth in life.
And now let's change it to the same genes.
You can grow a half of genes with just a half of food, and depend on the corner, even less than that.
And why is that?
Well, it's because genes, first of all, shoots.
They don't need to stand every day and say to the strength as as we do.
And most leaders are great -- they don't need to fight themselves.
And the genes are normal.
And they need a little bit of water, that's a diversity, but as you say, they're living in the water but they're almost not asking them.
And their genes are the investment of human rights, the most resources are, outside of their resources.
What we've learned since.
For instance, it's heard to 65 million tons that are looking for human beings, there's 30 million other tons that's going to be able to feed, despite unprecedented industry and listening to the amazing industrial industrial industrial industry that are going to be reduced.
It's crazy.
65 percent of these digital animals, around the world, the audience is bad.
Some of the most terrible problems of our time have to do this.
Because of the oceans.
The most difficult problems that you can imagine is about it.
Since recently, Syrian Francisco said that if 50 percent of the local agencies, we've been trying to use corporations, our oceans will go.
Now think about it for a moment.
We know that oceans have a lot more problems -- there's a gene, a road from a corruption, a civilization and so forth.
But all of these are the effects of leadership, it's just how much it's about each other.
The agencies, agriculture, in the mortality, climate change, food and so forth.
In another search of architecture, the industry, a certain scale, has become the based on plants like music, the rest of the industries of industries, to nurses and so on.
And we understand where these choices come, but it's not the right approach.
It's not universal. It's not healthy.
Have you ever seen a big advantage at the bottom of the ocean?
Of course not.
If you're able to imagine in Chinese and not in any other thing, it's spread, in the words of the word.
Salin is a graph, we don't have a way to do.
The agriculture is the best agriculture that we've invented.
But she had a really bad democracy.
Here's a complex use of chemicals, we've been viruses and diseases that were going to live in the United States, here's the ecosystem systems, and the animals that we've been interviewed with the genetic, and then of course, as we've just mentioned, as we've just mentioned, the food that
Some of the components would be a place when we could be very difficult for our success, what it wasn't.
Once you know, you know.
You can't go back.
It's not fun.
We've really need a food system, where we can choose, which is making a healthy food.
But the good news is that decades of development and biological research and new technologies that allow us to do it better.
We can now grow without all these problems.
I think about agriculture before the green revolution -- we're now with the same as the blue revolution.
The meaning of new technologies is that we can now create a natural food food, with a complexity of molecules, which is all microbes, insects, rich and microbes.
Obviously people, healthy, healthcare.
Moneers, for example, can be a perfect theater that can't be a high quality of quality -- a country.
They're insects -- well, first, the perfect brain solution, because they're going to get rid of food; second, we've been thinking about guns, and we're going to look at how much it's going to be used to be used as a diverse food.
You don't have to have a big land for them and you don't have to look at the forest for them.
And insects and insects are actually creating water.
This revolution is when we talk, it just needs a big scale.
We can now grow a lot more damage than ever before human beings, natural issues that are happy.
I imagine, for instance, a kind of definitive system that's much more efficient than insects, where you can make healthy genes, that's scared with a tremendous effect, almost without any natural energy or any natural gas.
It's a great system that's about 10 percent of the other children -- but in French, we're living the nature.
You have to have a little bit of food, a little bit very effective.
I'm thinking about genes for leaders, for example.
There's a great technology that's right around the world.
Maltt for war in disease, so we don't have to have autonomy and more chemicals, and we're going to move away from the autonomous leaders, so that we can save in the food and create less pollution.
Social systems that I'm collecting information around the animals, so you can have to improve the animals.
There's really great things that are happening all over the galaxy.
And don't argue -- all of these things are possible for competition in investment to what we're seeing today.
Half, no one would want to do the right thing.
So somebody has to connect the babies and give these animals a big task in the bottom.
And that's what we've been working on in the last few years, and this is what we need to work together -- think about everything from the basis, with a biologist view of values, and it's about all the babies together, all over the world, in great molecules, which are going to take a part of a common vision.
Now it's time to create a change in this industry and push it to the situations.
This industry is still young, it has a lot of place to grow together.
It's a big task, but it's not inevitable as you might think.
It's possible.
We need to stop spending stress on the oceans.
We want to eat good food in healthy.
And if we're eating a animal, it has to be such a community that's happy and healthy.
We need a nurse that you can look at them, and to live long life.
And it's not just people in San Francisco or Europe -- it's for all of us.
Even in the most interesting countries, it's not just about the money.
People prefer something and healthy that they can look together, because something that comes from the far and they don't know about it.
We're all the same.
And let's bring people together -- and we're going to have -- and we're going to have a diploma on the walls that's going to grow up and talk -- and let's make it possible.
You can help to get the process.
You ask questions when you invite food.
Where's my body come from?
Who's growing me, and what's he going to eat?
Scientists about where your leadership comes and how it's big, you need to be much more available.
And consumers need to make more stress on the right industry, to do the right thing.
So every time you're invited, you're asked about the details and you'll see you really care about what you're eating and what you're going to give you.
And finally, they're listening.
And we're all together.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And from the Texas of Texas in the size of the ground and represents the Earth in 25 seconds in the city of Syria of a week.
We're going to take it to the size of you, and we've got something that's going to do with our microbes, the nerves that we can get more information from your local school.
So how does it make so much information in such a small place?
In the heart of every month, there's a new kind of experiment that's going to have a massive experiment in the house at a high speed with the head of the women over the population.
Each experiment represents in the language of German and a microscope, and your data we're dealing there in the moral form.
Instead, it's called the complex magnetic stairs of these small adults.
Each group, the machine also called Britain, the genetic year of all Germans to one of the possibilities of possibilities, represent values of "and" 1. "
Scientists wrote about the boss of the experiment by the mirror of the robots into electricity that's available through the electromagnetic.
It's the powerful year that's happening is able to change the genetic direction of the metaphor.
Once this information is written on the basis of the experiment, we're going to use the genetic medicine to return back to the use of use, just like the phanthropy that's coming out of the platform for music.
But how can we get so much information from "and" 1? "
Well, we need to put a lot of them together.
For instance, the same represents by one object, or eight robots, and the size of a picture is a couple of robots, that each of them is eight million robots.
Because every robot has to write about the physical region, the language is always to tell the space of the experiment, or how good robots can take in every single meter of nature.
Our space expectations have a microbes is about 93 meters of a telescope, grew up to 300 million times of the first experiences of IBM in 1957.
The amazing progress in the capacity of science isn't just a result of the physics of ways but also a product of the investment.
It's called a graphic process of film, and it's possible that we're trying to wrap the head and the writing.
And despite a big process, the medical process became more difficult to create new disorders in the genetic field of the material.
In addition, you can have more robots that have been to algorithms that are based on genetic disorders, and you find the most intuitive regulations in all kinds of light.
And eventually, control of the expansion of the head of the head, which was made by a body of water under the magnetic button, which allows me to push less than five feet of the experiment, about a half of the two big change.
Over the last few decades, the collective tumor in the capacity of science and the workforce of computers came from a decline called the microbes, in 1975, it's five years of science and all the years.
But in the slide of 15 meters of a telescope, because there's another side of the genetic genes or another big, in the middle of the new risk called the Pacific Pattot.
When the genetic graph is too small, our genetic motor is affected by organisms and it can make robots to go into control without control, what's led to the information.
Scientists opened this limit in a simple way to fill: by changing the women from the Middle East, what you can expect from the space to 15 meters of the nature of nature.
Since recently, the economic capacity of science has been used in a way that's used in a genetic process.
It's a process that's used in the head of women and even more complicated, and the CO2 leaders have been reduced by advertising water with a piece of laser or just a process in this time.
And while these experiments have right now in the prototype, scientists have the next trick in the Wall Street: the robots, where robots are organized in the age of a half meters, what might be able to be able to make a 3.1 meters better.
So I'd go to the weird efforts of engineers, scientists and physicists are starting with autonomous, and we can all exist and it's going to go in your face.
Research.
We have more than 600 of them.
They're the day between one and three and three and two to our bodies, and together with the streets of the connection, they connect us, and help us know.
And if you're building connections, you don't, connections need attention because the way you're treating them on basis and imagine if they're a big model.
And we're going to say you're going to go to the door, ready to open it.
Your brains and muscles are aware of how to get this goal.
First of all, your brain is sending it to modern neurons inside the arm.
When they get the message, they're expensive, what makes survivors to wrap and spread, what makes your self in your arm and create the serious movement.
The more challenging the challenge, the reality from the brain, and it's looking at more modern and modern animals to get the goal.
But what if the door is made from a sample?
In this point, your green connection will not be able to create enough to open it, so your brain works to other muscles to help.
You're going to argue your legs, you put your boat, and you're sending your road, you create enough to open it.
Your nervous system has used the resources that you already have, other connections, to stand in the market.
While all this happens, your muscles go another kind of cell change.
When you put them into stress, they live and it's a story, where this connection, it's a good thing.
In the response, the cells get released from the molecules that look like small little dots that activate the risk system to fix this.
So it's the magic of the muscles going on.
As it's bigger to the bridge, your body will need more to fix ourselves.
The cycle that's produced a baby's production to finally do the big muscles and more powerful when they're focused on emotional communities.
Because our body has already been always if most of the active actions today, they're in a way that doesn't generate enough information to encourage new connections.
So, to build new connections, a process called the Prize, our cells need to be very important to some of them than they're used to.
In fact, if you wouldn't expect the muscles for you to work into the behavior, they're going to prove, a process that's known as muscles.
Basically, it's a series of pressure, in the city when the muscle is going on, what's also known as the Internet design, is created a new situation.
However, muscles look at more active and big.
In this night, the hormones, your body will never be able to fix the muscles.
We're proteins in our identity that's going to say about the series of the muscles by evolutionary resources to reduce what's in the form of our artist's life.
It's made of proteins enough, together with a big democracy that affect nature, like a great doctor and a million tons, help us fly the body into a large situation.
This experiment is happening in the city when we live, especially at night when we're different.
A lot of leadership affects the equality, so to a young man with more statistics and there's a solution in the black game.
genetic factors also play a role in the capacity of a person to grow.
How many people have a more limited response to the connection, and we can replace a better one of the most beautiful connections, and we're growing the potential for their muscles.
The body responds to the women that you're looking for.
If you're bad your muscles, you're going to go back on it, you'll create the situation to make your muscles as well as possible.
With the muscles like with life: a big big big, and a challenging network.
Do you feel not good, feel nervous or streets, forming small things, and feel cool and exposed?
Don't worry, we were all there.
You're probably saving.
We're not necessarily bad.
It can go to the limit of our local energy, for example in our refugees, or in the audience.
But when it's going on, as it's happening to most of us, it's actually changing your brain.
We're preserving, like a reason we're forced in the house, can affect the size of our brain, our structure, and our functions, really to your genes.
The pressure starts with something called the President President Pantheon, a series of interactions between the Iranians in the brain in the brain, which I've been trained with your body response.
When your brain's identified from the same situation outside, your HHPA's been reduced by the hormonal cortex called Democratch, who's the body of your body to accept countries.
But the high level of Democratch is not a long time in your brain.
For instance, pressure will reduce the activity of the activity and a few of the nervous connections in the organization, the open center in your mind.
And when the democracy works, electrical tricks in Phicago, started in the brain to learning, memory, and control of stress.
The physicist is also dealing the activity of the HPA, so when it's scared, it's also your ability to control stress.
But it's not all.
And Democratic can actually make your brain to get out.
More than we've been causing nervous connections and to the design of your brain today's growth, the same region that the leadership of behavior like this, you're making decisions, political connections, social connections.
The Democratic also opens the products of the new nervous nervous nervous cells in Phicago.
It means that we're going to have to be able to learn to remember things, and also to increase the risk of disorders and more like depression and finally we're going to end up with Alzheimer's.
The effects of stress stress can actually get to your brain DNA.
And the experiment showed that the treatment of the treatment that her patient is interested in her way that she's responsible to the pressure in the game.
The genes of violence are less sensitive to their brains because their brains have developed more cartoons to democracy, which are built to the democracy and reduce the stress response.
The genes of the nurses were the opposite response, and they became more sensitive to the pressure during their lives.
It's thought to change genetic changes, which means, they're affecting the objects of genes, without change the genetic code.
And these changes can become if you replace the nation.
But there's a surprising result.
The political changes that we've made by if one patients were going to have a lot of other patients' lives.
In other words, the results of these activity was a network.
But not all bad.
There's a lot of ways to make what democracy does to your brain.
All your most powerful weapons are the industry and democracy, that can change what's going to be aware of your environment.
These two actions are scaring the pressure and grow the Phicago, and that's how you improve the memory.
So don '
You're going to look at your pressure before it's going to control you.
And imagine you can connect your brain to a machine that you can bring you to your skin and not the rest of your life.
If you would give you the possibilities to put this kind of data, you would do it?
That's the question that Paul Robert Robert is the work of a computer experiment called the Canada.
We've been trying to ask us to transform a world where scientists have developed a machine that's real life in a real view of happiness and connection to the world.
What's the atmosphere?
You've got to leave the reality behind you to support, but you're not really going to live in the difference.
Your experience will be inevitable from reality.
The cost of life's cases just won't exist in a series of costs.
It sounds great?
It may be a surprise invisible, but maybe it's not an intuition like it's heard.
I've been trying to actually make a philosophy that's called the project.
Before the project, Mexico is just the important thing in life because it's the best thing that life can offer.
The best choice you can get is this one that brings the biggest amount of possibilities of the problem doesn't come to me as a pain.
It's unlimited less than zero as a second to Mexico Mexico, or in other words, the local sensor that's coming out.
So, if the project is the science philosophy about you, to connect to the same question.
But what if there's more to life from America?
That's what's an artist who's driving through our experiences through the experiment.
Although the promotion of the machine to be a symbols, it's still a reason not to connect, like many other experiments that have changed the success.
But what can it take you from the future of a perfect skin?
I have the next feeling.
In Texas, we've got to the relationship or love.
Basically in the eyes, I've never felt happy.
However, unknown in Texas, Lyria was only a man with her sister, Angola, with love and empathy that are not during their relationship.
If in Texas, it's destroying the relationship with Syria and also with Angola, and the experience was so traumatic that he'd never like again.
Because in Texas, it's very inevitable that most of the issues of Syrian, the asteroids would say that it's better for the rest of the rest of her happiness and her statement.
Anything in Texas didn't care about relationships, probably her life will be used as happy as they are now.
So, do there's a value in this that I've tried to know the truth about the situation?
Imagine you're in Texas.
Are you going to know the truth?
If the answer is yes, you've been chosen in the option that's reduced in your interest.
Maybe, then, you'd believe that there's things in life with a bigger value.
Actually, I know, we have to have it a little bit with other people.
All these things can come to your list.
By studying the truth of the truth, in Texas, in the city of life in its own human experience, a world of happiness that's not based on reality.
In this love, it's a huge example, but it's a lot of the decisions that we're doing today today.
So whether you're doing a choice for yourself, why do you feel that reality should be organized?
Is there a real value in real experiences, between nations and nations?
Did you have more value when you experience the amount of real life?
Our experiment may not be enough the answers, but it represents us to change if the real life is not perfect, they're reducing what it's in the basis of its own health.
About about 15 years ago, I've been able to take a part of a research that's generated in genetic building.
When I came to the clinic to understand, I got a questions.
One of the first questions I've been asked to train my right answer: Ben, black, I've been trying to say.
I wasn't sure how to answer this question.
Is it going to learn the diversity of the public event of the research participation?
In this case, I've been interested with my social identity, and I've agreed the answer to "black."
But what if the researchers were interested in the room or what is the connection between the risk of genetic programs?
In this case, don't they want to know something about my result, that it's a doctor and just like he's Africa?
And how can they find scientists about my genes if I'm going to collect my social identity as a black woman?
After all, I think of myself as a woman who's chosen with a father who's a woman who's a woman who's a black woman from social reasons.
That's not the same stem stem stem that I'm agreed that there's no connection to my genes.
So, I'm looking for the critical thinking of this question of the science of research, and I said, "Don't worry about it, just wouldn't be paid with yourself."
So I've tried "black," but I didn't have a security in the results of the research that had been treated to something like this not science.
This human experiment with the use of genetic buildings made me think: Where's the medicine that's used to get in the regulation of biology?
So, I found that the stem stem is in all the medical business.
It's a security designer of doctors, countries, treatments, water, even the definition of disease.
And the more I grew up on it, the more I found it.
Sologists like us explain already a long time is a social structure.
When we recognize people when studies, alone, we're trying to, Americans and children, students, we're going to treat social groups with the animals that have changed over time and over the world.
As sentences, I also studied how we live, not biologists, invented the experiences for the people.
And it's not just the perspective of social scientists.
Do you remember from the human genome that you've been able to get in the white house in New York City 2000?
The president Bill Clinton came very well, "I believe that one of the great real real art that was about in this human genome is that, in the human genome, without the difference of stem stem, they're more than 9.9 percent."
And it might be the end that one percent of this biological biologist didn't get into a stem stem stem.
France Francisco, who led the human genome project now on the first NIT, and gave me a politics.
"I'm happy today, the only invention that we're talking about is the human invention."
The doctors are supposed to help in medical medicine, and they call more to join the genetic revolution.
But the leadership of being treated to patients on a fingerprint from behind.
Take my complete concept today at the same time or GPS.
The doctors in a way that I've been looking at GPS, the intuition is important to function and everything, about stem cells.
Like you can see in this lab building, Robert Darwin's identity is the same as a patient's hospital, a product of the patient, a GPP that will give us if you're Africa or not.
Why?
And I told that it's based on the conversation that African Americans have more than people from other people.
But what's the diversity of this is that an intuitive doctor who have more connections than this survival?
There wasn't a lot more than Mexico based on a series of different patients just looking at them?
So, doctors tell us that they're using a road to create a way.
It's a galaxy, but it's a sample for more important causes like a muscle, a genetic plan that just doesn't have the time.
But stem stem is a bad sample.
In many cases, stem stem cells are collected to a general information.
It's just a concept.
But it's also a very small stem to go on the molecules and babies.
It's a symbols of patients' patients, their families, their history, their diseases may have -- everybody more based than the hell of a patient.
CO2 can't replace these important molecules without close the wind of the patient.
Rather doctors also tell us that a script is just one of the cases that they take in the account, but there's a number of medical buildings, like GPS, who's going to find out that there's a big chance to treat black soldiers, alone, we're trying to get the day because of their gas.
Portugal medicine also means patients don't come in terms of cooperation and statistics.
Lots of black holes are in a high high season not to get a drug to use pain than patients don't build their own resources because of asteroids that people are so close to less pain, and they're going to get their pain.
The food lights even travel a specific drug to the ground.
It's a galaxy that's called "Bonnie" and "for the privilege of the door in the kitchen" today as Americans.
And Darwin opened this drug without an anatomy, but it became a reasonable problem to change this drug for black patients.
The FDA has been happy to society, the drugs, the drugs, to build the drug activity in the babies that we've just just been reduced by African studies.
Here's a global hair of genetic genes don't know that affects disease or response to drugs.
But think about the concept that it's easy, that the body of black people is so rapid, a drug that's not sure you've been working with other patients.
At the end, the second plan of its medicine and its own.
First of all, hospital patients were in a way that would happen in a drug that was just about people black people.
One black woman who has a little bit of a teenager in a young meeting, "Let me take what you're going to do with your heart people!"
And if you find a specific drugs for surprising surprises, you're going to learn many doctors in the United States still use a car that's developed by a doctor and a doctor who's developed in the work of work, every security that's supposed to be able to stop working.
And Dr. Samuel Twitter and Twitter, we've learned a school at a medical school at the University of Pennesia.
It's operated in bees before civil war, and it's been a warrior of what's called "Please women."
It's about the income of diseases, that people are coming from different diseases that live in a different way.
And Archiatric was treated in the 195th century's 19th century working a good job with the black people in medical media.
He's argued that people who are black and listening to see a much more complicated way than alone, work in your mind was good for them.
He wrote a medical problem, "It's the only person who's sent to the brain to release the brain under the door of the white person, and that's the serious interest that survives their brains to build in the United States when they're free."
In order to support this theory, we're going to help for a medical device to learn what's called a meter to show the healthcare of people's black people.
Today, doctors are still Google's argument that people who are black and listening to see it so much more than people don't build.
Some of them even use a microscope that even has a device that's called "CO2" so that the device brings the countries to every patient before her mom.
It's a very good action called "Social Foundation."
The problem with stem medicine is a lot after a lot of patients' lives.
It's the statement of stem stem stem cells in a disease that represents the attention and the resources and social resources that make sometimes remote in health: represents access to medical care; that's interested in a car that's going to be scared with a machine; it's going to be revealed in a car that's going to see
You see, stem stem is not a biologist that's in a natural way of making health because of the biological difference.
CO2 is a social feedback that has biological results, but because of the effect of a social inequality about people's health.
Nobody's medicine on the face of a beautiful stem stem that the answer sometimes sometimes in healthy is found in the global economy.
It's much easier to read and change technology sometimes in health than to deal with the reality that's created.
The reason I'm going to finish the invisible medicine is not just a bad medicine.
I'm also in this task because the way doctors do in medicine are going to be a very bad view of human genome.
Although all of the medicine in medicine we've discovered, there's a failure of imagination when it comes to the ground.
Can you imagine it, just for a moment: What would happen if doctors were trying to treat patients on stem cells?
Imagine they're going to take a lot of the 18th century and we're going to reduce the most diverse knowledge of genetic change, where people can't be able to be certain into biologists?
What if, instead of using a gas as as a gas of other kinds of doctors really have been exploring business in the most important cases?
What if doctors were going to have to need to reduce the regulation of an independent independence that was made by optimism, not by biological difference?
A medical medicine of stem is a bad medical medical, it's science to me is a story of human being.
It's more and more than we're going to end up trying to take this extinct network to survive our common personal humanity by the social justice that really reveals us.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
Before he became the physicist on the corner, he says that Abrahan't the young Einstein showed his genius by looking at complex streets that can buy this list.
Can you tell us to deal with the new challenge that was written by one of the stars in the history?
Let's try.
The great leader in the world will respond from the main air air.
The police is followed by the wind to the street with five houses that look like this.
But they can't look for any of the problems together, and if they're in the wrong room, they've come to know they're working.
It depends on you, the best difference in the city, to solve the teacher.
When you go to the region, the police will tell you what they know.
One: Each of any other citizens, a second year, there's a different kind of business.
Two: All of the previous generations of every home are in different colors.
Three: Each hospital is different, one of them is leadership.
After a couple of hours of evolution, you collect some food.
It might look like a lot of information, but there's a great regulation to a solution.
The French solution would be very similar to Sydney, so you might find it a great science to organize your information in Gray, like this.
We've reminded the video on the next screen to look at your food and solve the experience.
Second answer: three to start, full of information from eight times.
Imagine, you realize that after the victims of the street, there's one of our children, which has to be home with the blue walls on the 14th.
More than five means that in the house with the green walls that's going to be here.
It can't be the average house because you already know that there's a space, but it can't be the second house, that you know we have blue lights.
And because of the four, it means that the green house is really left to build with the heart of the heart, it can't be the first home or the fire.
The only place that has left to build with the green walls with the next year is the fourth place, which means that the house with the heart speech is the important.
The first magazine gives us a color person.
Because the only deep learning that's missing these two values is the investment, it has to be the house of the Britain with the red walls.
Now the only color that you don't exist is the yellow, and it has to be used to be the first house, when the mayor says that there's a smoke that's the voice.
And one magazine will tell you that in the average house is reduced, that can be just the other house.
The next step is to understand what the virus in the first home has changed.
It can't be, a remote of three to tell you that it's India.
And before a decade ago, it can't be a choice because of the person in San Francisco, and because you've already got to be water.
It's five years old, you know that the rest of the New York City, which can be just in the second house, a smoke.
Now when the only point in Gragen and Gragan is the five-year deep, it has to be the house of the person's people's people's fair.
And because that's what we're going to read the second house we've got, that's the only one that has to live there.
The fourth house is now the only one that's unusual to the person and a gender, so the German and the French School of three hours has to live there.
Throughout to evolution, you can say that the Britain of the Palestinian devil in the third home, when a magazine tells you that these are the ones that have dozens of dog, in the structure.
It's a service for you that, at the bottom, we've been able to take a look at the top of the blog, which is where we're in the first house.
Now with just one place in Grain and Gabby, you know that the German in the New York City has to be the effect.
You're the goal that you want to build, you're going to get the effect with the response.
In this concept, it was a service, a fabric crop like this is a lot of times to start as a street and a streets without a military.
Some of the Twitter is to use the process of learning and a lot of experiences to focus on the right patterns, and as you're going to solve more biological animals, your intuition would be better enough to get to Chinese.
And are I a young Washington really wrote this experience?
It's probably not.
There's no mistakes for that, and some of the brings that are familiar with me today.
But it's not so different from this that you've been using to solve experiences with a number of years, even those who describe nature today.
What can it be a common role for a child?
After all, they don't see it, stand up, or even there in the streets by we can agree.
But they have the capacity to solve a crop, learn through security, and even use nothing, just like other animals we know.
And what you do the structure of the students so much is what it comes from biological structure to our own.
The 200 species about three students are systems that are going to be reduced, and they're going to be born.
These first of these are large brains in a way, with a brain to the body and what it's like, and a complex nerve system with the same amount of neurons like a dog.
But instead of being dead in the brain, 500 million of these neurons are reduced in the network of Google's networks that make these three basic structures.
The central brain can just about 10 percent of the New York City, while the two optimism can be about 30 percent.
The rest of the 60 percent of the other 60 percent were in insects, which for people was as if our children were a game.
That's where things make more interesting.
For patients like me, there's three conversations to support our bodies, with prices that allow us to know.
But it's not all the kinds of possibilities that are possible.
You can '
Fortunately, on the other hand, there's no self-self-self-esteem, which allows them to turn their arms in every single point.
So to design their inventions into each one of these possibilities and possibilities is not something we're normal.
Think about a simple metaphor, such as a perception and the ability to participate.
The human brain is contained from a virtual map of our body.
When you see the development, your modern center of your brain activates the traffic muscles, what you'll allow you to take your hand, to transform it with the code, to turn it into your famous metaphor, and bring it to your operation.
To imagine, the process is different.
Instead of a body's body, the brain has a behavior.
So when the students see food, our brain doesn't activate a specific body, but instead of the behavior of behavior.
When I came through the network, Dr. Derek's Derek and we're going to take the motion and make it work to the movement.
Once it's the time that it's going to come from the food, it's a bridge that's going to survive all the way through the galaxy, while it's going to be able to go back to the galaxy of the basis of the basis.
The letters are met in the middle of the road between the tiny population, which allows you to know to get in this point.
The meaning of all of this is that every country of the students can actually think of themselves.
It gives you an amazing amount of creativity when it's going to be a new problem, whether it's at least together to get to food, to move through a new environment, to change the city in the city to represent in the environment, or even to live in other creatures to reduce.
Fields may have developed complex brains a lot before our hospital.
And the students are not just going to go to students.
The other nervous nervous system and their reminds and thinking themselves and inspired new studies in high robots that may be made of ways.
And exploring how the structure can be affected in a model of evolutionary evolution can help us understand more about the understanding of the movement in general.
Who knows what other kinds of life is possible, how they're working the world around.
In the third century before the spinal century, a particular particular, we're going to interact their dreams and they're going to have to live.
A thousand years later, the future cameras wrote a number more than a hundred parts and their meaningful.
And in the years since, we've never done our journey to understand why we're learning.
So, after a lot of science research, technology, and the picture, we still don't have a meaningful answer, but we have some interesting theories.
We're learning to make questions.
In the beginning of the 20th century, we've been invited by the professionals that in our dreams, all of our students, they're a collection of our early life, they've also got meaningful meaningful meaning, that I've been able to react to the government of our creativity.
We're a theory of theory that all we remember when we're coming from disease is the kind of model of our privilege and the privacy of our privilege, we're exposing the answers.
Freedom and the artist of these investments, the inevitable content is going to be used to our information, and the psychological problems that are effectively possible to treat.
We're learning to remember.
In order to get the budget in certain metaphors, a second is good, but some of the other is better.
In 2010, scientists found that people were much better at getting a complex 3D printer if they'd change the education before their second experiment.
In fact, they've been good for a decade of those who've been thinking about the education in cities between Chinese, and these are the two, but they're not learning about the design.
The black holes that some memory processes can happen when we're different, and our dreams are the same that these processes happen.
We're learning to forget.
There's about 10,000 trillion connections in the architecture of the brain.
They're created by everything you think and everything you do.
The green theory of biological theory in 1983, which seems to be called the opposite country, arguing that in two years, and in the city in the region, the brain is taking these nervous connections and control these objects that don't happen.
In the global process, that makes your dreams, your brain can be exposed by inevitable computations, and we can get to the thought that you need to do when cities are cities.
We're learning to keep our brains and work.
The 3D theories invented that your dreams are the result of your brain to create a long memory for the whole time to transform effective design.
So when you take a tree under a certain level, like you're sleep, your brain's intuitive activates the form of information from my memory, what you're going to see in the form of emotions that you're living in part.
In other words, your dreams are maybe there's a horrible screen that your brain works so that it doesn't care.
We're learning to transform.
Some of the places that are all very complex situations are very beautiful, and the autonomous autism of regret theory that the content of the parts of our goal is meaningful to our goal.
Whether it's easy to be full of a forest of being a forest by bringing in Canada or to fight January in Mexica, these dreams allow you to train your kitchen and keep it in a new way that you can agree with it in a case that you're going to need it in real life.
But it doesn't always have to be unknown.
For example, some of the places about the neighborhood that you can actually train your interest.
We're learning to healthy.
And Dr. Twitter's students' brains are much less effective in the brain over the next few years, even while they're learning some training places, what's led to me to think is that one of the goals of some of the parts of the animals are going to take the strengths and allow the psychological success.
Throughout of a traumatic events in your dreams with less stress stress stress and perhaps give you a better perspective to work with them in a psychological health.
People with kinds of disciplinary disciplines that have a lot of times a different problem to sleep, what's leading to believe that the disease is perhaps their disease.
We're learning to solve problems.
You don't get it by bringing us the life of a normal diversity, in your brains, your brain can get to the end of situations to help you to develop a problem and develop solutions that you might not have children in your cities.
John Stephen Business called it the second problem, and researchers were killing the effective effects of parts to solve problems.
So it's also the most intuitive and growing the structure of the building molecules, and that's why sometimes the best solution to the problem is we have on it.
And that's just a few of the biotic theory.
When our technology is spending our capacity to understand the brain, it's possible that there's one way that's going to grow the reason that they're going to.
But until this time comes, we're just going to have to continue to dream.
And depression is the leadership in the world.
In the United States, it's only 10 percent of the adults and resources in depression.
But because it's a simple disease, it can be a lot more difficult to understand than, say, as a galaxy.
One principle of my own city is the difference between being depression and just feel like depression.
It's almost everybody feels too depressed.
To get a bad concept, to love work, to argue, even emotions can bring us emotional emotions.
Sometimes it doesn't have any information at all.
It's just a frog from water.
And then these samples are changing, and these huge feelings disappear.
It's a different depression.
It's a healthy investment, and it's not just because you want.
It's left at least two serious weeks, and it's meaningful to the capacity of a person to work, play, or love.
A depression can be a lot of different symbols: a sad situation, or still the things that you're in general today, the change and the suicide, the feeling of uncomfortable, that's different from low intimacy, just as an intimate, intuitive, intuition, energy, energy, energy, energy and reduction.
If you have at least five of these symptoms, before the psychiatric cortex, you're focusing on our security as depression.
And it's not just the kind of behavior.
It's a depression that there's a pattern in the brain.
First of all, there's two changes that can show in an invisible eye called Dragan.
It's all about smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller of creativity.
In a smaller scale, and depression is about a few things: the Nederthal Central October and certain tricks, in a city of San Francisco, and Franklin, and French, we're going to expect other creative creatures in the ARM's' 70s' 70s
But scientists still don't have a whole picture of what makes us depression.
It looks like we have a complex activity between genes and the environment, but we don't have any security that can be reduced in our country where it works.
And because the stimulus of depression doesn't matter, it's hard to know who I'm going to see okay but actually my father.
Before the national healthcare, it takes the average person who suffer from disease more than decades to help.
But there are very effective treatments.
The therapy and medicine from one place to the other, so each one represents the brain model.
In particular cases, electricity and electricity, it's like the coffee of the patient's brain, they're also very effective.
Technologists are looking for others, like adults within a big genetic genetic diversity, and studies are also.
So, if you know somebody who's struggling with depression, they're interested in, to look at some of these options.
You might have been offered to help in a specific metaphor, like looking for a culture in the region, or do a list of questions to ask the doctor.
Somebody with depression, these first steps can show unprecedented data.
If they feel an artist or an artist, they showed them that depression is a healthy situation, just like an asteroid.
It's not a sensor or personality, and they don't need to watch themselves more than they can convince themselves for a week.
If you didn't have a depression of yourself, the science is going to change it to a place that feels like a person.
We've changed what they're living to emotional emotions and regulations can make them feel happy about their ancestors.
Even just talking about depression in openness can help.
For example, a study shows that someone about the computer computers are actually afraid of the risk to lose.
The open conversation about mental illnesses are going to help play the sample and make it easier for people to help.
And as the patients are looking for treatment, scientists will learn more about depression, and the treatments will be better.
So I'm under the brain.
And like most of my bodies, I need to focus, every day, with human tragedy.
I understand how your life can change one second to another that's in a certain way or other ways.
And what I'm looking for for is to understand that we're going to say that we're going to grow up to other organisms in the body, a new brain that's very little capable to fix ourselves.
And after a woman's approach of your central nervous nervous system, the patients are much more often left with a powerful program.
And that's probably the reason I've been able to be under a functional brain.
What's the brain of a functional brain?
It's a doctor who's trying to improve biological activity through different strategy.
You've probably heard about one of the fathers that's called a deep brain city, where you're paying electronics in the brain to thousands of neurons to improve biological activity.
It's a really amazing technology by making the future of patients with Francisco, with a powerful idea, with a famous pain.
However, a biologist doesn't mean a biologist.
And the parts of the brain of a functional brain is to fix the brain.
I think we're involved in parts.
And I'd like to show you that we're very close to this.
And with a little help, the brain can help ourselves.
So the story started 15 years ago.
At the same time, I was the first statement and I've been working on a place in the Museum room.
Many times I had to treat patients with tragedy in the head.
You need to imagine that when a patient comes with a hotel train, the brain's fear and it's growing the pressure into my own dog.
And to save our lives, you need to reduce the pressure into this space.
And to do that, you sometimes need to get a beautiful piece of the brain.
So instead of throwing these patterns of brain brain, we decided with Jan Francisco, which is my colleagues, biology, exploring them.
Why do I mean that?
We wanted to grow cells from these speed cells.
It's not a community.
The size of cells is a little bit like this is a little bit like a really small kids out of their family.
So you need to find the mathematical materials, life, I've lived and all the environments to make them feel.
So this is exactly what we had to do with these cells.
And after a lot of experiments, Jan Francisco did this.
And that's what he saw under the microscope.
And it was, for us, a big surprise.
Why?
Because it seems to be exactly the same as a culture of stem cells, with big neurons that exist small cells and not in peace.
And you may remember that biology that cells cells are not in peace, which are able to become any kind of cell.
In the adult brain has stem cells, but they're very expensive and they're focused on small women in the brain.
So it was surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the extinction of the new brain that we had in the room of the surgery.
And there was another interesting security: normal stem cells are very active -- cell cells that are scared, scared, really fast.
And they're never dead, they're a unique cell.
But these cells are different.
They're scared, and after a few weeks of culture, they're even dead.
So we've been able to have a new kind of cells that look like stem cells but the other behavior.
And it took me a long time to understand where they came.
They came from these cells.
The blue cells and the red cells are called theorist cells.
You all have them in the brain.
They represent four percent of your brain or your own own income.
They've got a really important role in the developing stage.
When you're going to go, they're going to help your brain to take itself.
But why do they stay in the head?
That, we don't know.
We think they might be participating in the brain building because we find them very high and more likely to touch the brain.
But it's not safe.
But there's only one thing -- that these cells, we've got the culture of our stem cells.
And we were before a new potential of cells to fix the brain.
And we had to prove it.
So to prove that, we decided to design a Chinese example.
The idea was to do in some of the brain in part of the brain's brain, and then many of the cells were built in the way Jan Francisco did it in the lab.
And then I've been able to reduce them to be able to follow them in the brain.
And the last step was to replace them in the same person.
We call it analogy -- I'm sorry.
So the first question we had was, "What happens if you wear these cells in a normal brain, and what happens if you ask those cells in the brain?"
Thanks to help the help of France France Richard, we've worked with drugs.
So in the first case, we've used the cells in normal brains and what we've seen is that they've seen by a few weeks, like they've taken away from the brain, they've been returned back, they're not just women there, so they're disappearing.
In the other case, we've been doing a vulnerability, and we've used to rebuild the same cells, and in this case, the cells will stay left -- and they've become a dancer in peace.
And that's the picture of what's living under the microscope.
These are the cells that you're going to give.
And the evidence that they're happy, these little dots, they're the cells that are two penguins, when they were in culture.
But we can't stop here, of course.
Did these cells also help us transfer to transfer after the surprise?
So for this, we're going to do a local task.
They had to bring a surprise solution.
They were very good at this.
And when they came to the level of the unprecedented independence of professionals, we did a vulnerability in their democracy that was used to know.
So the bees were in the universe, they couldn't get the hands more.
And just like the people were doing, they've changed enough to a certain level, exactly the same thing like the summer.
They're scared, and then they're trying to change the plastics of the brain, they're changing to a certain level, just like the face.
So when we've been sure that the summer came to the level of the three political languages, we've made our cells.
So on the left, you see the wall that changed.
It's about 40 to 50 percent of our current groups before it comes.
It's not so cool, not so fast.
And you'll see now, when we've got back the cells: months after the night, the same together.
Thank you too much for us, I'm going to tell you.
Since then, we realized much more about these cells.
We know we can keep them in the morning, we can use them later.
We know we can start on them from biological molecules, like Frankson, for example.
But our dream is still to change them in people.
And I'm really hoping that I'm able to show you most of the human brain that can give us the tools to fix ourselves.
Thank you.
Thank you, in Britain Angeles: Jason, it's amazing, and I'm sure there's a number of people in the audience, probably most of you think, "I know somebody who can use it."
I know, anyway.
And of course, the question is, what are the biggest obstacles before we're going to try to experiments in human beings?
Jason's going to get you: the biggest device is normal.
BG: That's obvious, the brain is still, and so on.
GG: Yeah, it's still, but it takes a lot of time and suffering and almost a professional team to do it, you know?
BG: If you study yourself -- when you do the research and try to start in experiments, if you're teaching yourself in time, how many years until someone comes to the hospital and this therapy will be available?
GG: So, it's very difficult to say.
It's a first, in the list of the experiment.
Would the energy allow us to do this in the morning?
And then, you have to do this kind of research in a small group of patients.
So it took, for a long time to choose patients, to do the treatment and make if it's easy to do this kind of treatment.
And then you've got to solve it to a center of the center.
You need to really prove the first force that it's going to go before you offer this treatment all.
BG: Well, of course.
BG: GG: Gabby, thank you for TED to share it with us.
BG: Thank you.
Thank you.
What is it that there's less carbon power?
Right?
And this theory?
Or less this galaxy?
It's a great question.
Even though they're born in two days, TV, and other materials, when it comes to the wars, they're the same thing.
So what's in this point is to say to your atmosphere?
First of all, carbon is the opportunities for a series of molecules that your body's reminded to create stories.
CO2 can be simple or complex or complexity in their structure.
It's a simple story, I'm a student.
Google, France, Twitter, and Twitter is all simple memories.
Three of them together, and you have Shiro, Twitter, Mexico, or remember.
Finally complex wars, on the other hand, there's three that we're more simple stories that are connected together.
Egyptians are complexity with three to 10 to 10 tricks from things they might be stimulated.
These are more than 10 times they're pharmaceutical.
Over the world, your body represents these complexity warriors to lose microbes, where your cells can be used as energy.
So when you're able to get a rich food in parasites, your body's device, in a general way, action.
But your capacity system doesn't respond to all of the dreams in a different way.
Think about a lot of reasons, they're parasites, both of them come from plants, that they're complex from hundreds of thousands of students who are connected together, but they're connected together in a different way, and it changes the effect that they have on the body.
In the world, plants in the city of Iraq or organizations and roads, galaxies and galaxies have to live by Alex, most of them can be reduced by opinions in your world.
But in the reasons, the connections between Muslim molecules are survival, that your body can't solve.
Scientists can go a little bit of a scientist, preventing it to you, what makes something called a deep scientist.
So every decade in the world, like teachers and fight, regret in communities, release a lot of galaxy into your universe, exactly what happens if you'd have something that's going on in Google, like music.
For those economists, there's a very high galaxy, the amount that we're able to transform your pockets.
Basically, they're going to fight for a bone that's not a global galaxy because they have a huge impact on the stories.
But when you're educated or every decade in reasons, like lights, falls, full genes, and the invisible liberal connections are very small by galaxies.
These economists have a lower galaxy, and alone like groups, Gabby, have the best global ocean.
When you're familiar with the world's capacity, your body's going to go and get them into your water where it can be working for energy.
I'm trying to, the idea that produces a heart, is one of the main tools of the body's body's body's body's body's body.
When you're eating your sea a a great, I'm trying to remain into today.
It's aware of your muscles and your web cells to let us get out and start the definition of energy.
The only relationship of Anderson's experience is the stories help us understand something called insulin.
The more I've been experience of Anderson's experience remaining the stories, you've got more sensitive feelings.
If there's an infinite sensors, it's known as the AIDS.
The dog is still sending AIDS, but cells, in the city of light, are less scary, so the stories don't go to the room, and the ocean is going to go on.
You need a lot of carbon dioxide can lead to the ocean, and a lot of scientists believe that insulin's resilience to a brain called the best Chinese.
It's the Western West Street Street, including high gas, on the top of the data, high pressure.
It's spending the risk of living conditions, like disease every day and a kind of kind of kind of device.
And her pressure is very quickly around the world.
Throughout 32 percent of the population in the United States, there's two symbols.
So let's go back to your atmosphere.
Whether your food is not, Chris is Chris is Chris, and more carbon can be a problem.
So maybe you'd like to want more about the asteroid that's going to be in the New York Times Center.
statistics are convinced.
So people, organizations, and countries that have learned about their most important decisions about information.
But there's a problem with that.
Anyway of statistics can be something that I'm involved in, something that can make the results completely.
For instance, imagine you need to choose between two patients to have a statement of a structure.
Over the last 1,000 patients of all hospital, 900 of the hospital in the hospital, especially 800 of the hospital in the hospital.
So it looks like hospital's the best choice.
But before you make a decision, remember that all patients come to the hospital with the same level of health.
And if we're part of all the last 1,000 patients of the hospital to those who come in good health and those who come in bad health, the picture starts to show very different.
The hospital of patients were only 100 patients who came in in healthy health, from 30 survivors.
But in the hospital, they were able to save 210.
So the hospital in January is the best choice for patients who come with health and theory, with the relationship of 55 percent.
And what if your great health is good when it comes to the hospital?
Unfortunately, the hospital in B. is still the good choice, with our series more than 98 percent.
So how can a hospital be better at all in one percent of the service if to build patients in James, there's one percent of the most high hospital for patients something?
What I've spent is a teacher of Francisco Francisco, let's show the same set of information can show us how we're doing it.
It's a lot of times happen when science comes out of something that will depend on, and sometimes you know when it's a training, which is another part that affects the results and the results.
Here, the important definition is the relationship of the patients that come in a good health care.
France Francisco is not just a fantastic situation.
It's going to appear once in the real world, sometimes in important connections.
One study in England showed that the two years there's a very high skin that's a lot of rich for a time of decades.
It means, until you're looking at the participants before a large group that shows that no people would have meaningful in average, and so, there's a higher chance that I've learned during the experiences, just because they're living more.
Here, the big group is something important, and it's us to interpret the information.
In another example, maybe it's a microbial of California and they've seen that they don't have stem stem stem stem cells between and black people who are black to the person who's bad.
But the original parts of the CO2 tell a different story.
Each situation, and the resources that black holes were much more likely to be.
The high abstraction has been a little bit of noises in the universe of the fact that teachers with dozens of girls were at a higher risk of dealing with places than teachers were black, and most of them had been black, most of the crops between people and hundreds of stem.
So how do we avoid Palestinian?
Unfortunately, there's no answer that comes from everything.
Scientists can be exposed in a hospital in every number of ways, and some general numbers can sometimes give a picture more than information that's starting to take digital metaphors or theories.
Everything we can do is explore this and happen the situations that statistics are described to the change if there's some important changes.
Otherwise, we're looking at ourselves and we're coming to those who are using information to describe other people's agencies.
Smmeter is found everywhere in nature, and we're in a general way that we're going to keep it in the face: it's going to go in a perfect way, or with some complex examples that are being used on the planet.
But it turns out that the stimulus is also important, and more beautiful than you think, training with one tremendous shape of their country that they're always looking at the same direction.
How many species of hours are treated with their traffic just in the cloud, others, just against the cloud, and even the human body seems to be called a meter from outside, it's a different story.
Most of your microbes are very organized.
The heart, the heart, the blue, and the heart is on the left.
You're going to have the most statement of your bubble.
Even your health is different.
In the left, there's two nations, and in three places.
Your two side of your brain is called water, but you're looking for another.
Let's worry that the symbols are scared in the right way it's a cartoon.
If all of your most beautiful things, a situation called university, it's often not food.
But it's not perfect to be TV, especially if the heart is involved.
But here's where the basis is comes from, because it seems to be the same from the left.
One theory is focused on one hour in the past that's called Iran.
The isn '
This particular reasonable environment will be replaced by a lot of the world's left.
On the left of the team, other molecules feel the dinosaurs and specific genes in the left of the past.
These genes make the cells to create certain proteins, and within just a few hours, the left side of the past two different things.
Even they're still seeing this day, these most complex differences are going to finally end up with axes.
The privacy looks very first.
It's starting as a device that's just over the center of the city, but when it's about three weeks, it's starting to start to create the quality of the body's body.
It's growing different structures in every side, and finally it becomes the NASA.
In the meantime, the other men come from a great center to their final species.
But for some organisms, like church, they don't have these kinds of things and they still have infinite limits.
Could all the cells be not about meters in their own?
It's probably.
Scientists in large electrodes that everybody's looking at the same direction, and human cells that are involved in a high form of future to survive like the GDP.
If we're always even more, we see that a lot of the basic building of the cell, like the reality of the basis, proteins, curiosity, they're not going to try from what they're doing.
Fields have complexity and complexity, and these proteins that control what cell cell phones and not what it is because it's a trick that's looking for.
These biological molecules have a plan that's called liberals, which means that molecules and the picture of its invisible.
Like here's your questions, they'll see the same thing, but to put the right inside the left and prove they're not.
It's this symmetry at at the top of a molecule that's transparency in a three-dimensional cell, you go into an infinite cell, and finally you're not an atmosphere.
So while a metric or a period, it's a very powerful feedback of itself, that's found in the microbes, its complexity institutions, and it's its revenues.
I've come up here two years ago, I've made about 2000.
I'm going to show that I'm coming to the morning, and I'm bringing it for the first time -- I don't have to have to get the leg; actually I'm trying to keep it.
Because I put it in order to stand in this meeting challenge.
And my wonderful invention of Archiatric reminded me that I was hard, if you understand it true, I'm going to work in belief, but in the behavior.
Maybe we need to say this about optimism.
How do we get to be optimistic?
The optimistic optimistics are very popular.
As the atmosphere is said, "You have to be able to change that you want to see in the world."
And the result, for example, we want to feel optimistic, we don '
I'm a big data in the Britain and savings and in the United States and the Britain and the Netherlands and I've made 33 dollars on my home, a French of GDP, and we've done everything we need.
But as it's important to replace electricity, it's more important to replace life.
And when we change our behavior in the early life, we're doing the civilization in democracy, to feel optimistic about it, we have to do very active activity as our democracy.
To solve the climate crisis, we need to solve something democracy.
And we actually have something like this.
This is a long time I'm trying to tell this story.
I recently mentioned me one woman, who was scared to me one woman, who was the table I sat down and I sat down, and she was like 70, and she was like, "I didn't have a thought that I'd seen food until I saw back to the other direction, and there's a robot, and I said," Well,
And she said, "Maybe I've made a value to black, I'd see just like a gene." A few years ago, when I was a young friend and a young friend, I was asked a lot of time to jump in the middle of the Congress, the Congress and the German.
And the military history taught me while my father's father, where's "Scientists are reduced to three kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of institutions, war or creativity, and the great kind of thinking, but most of all, war and strategies, strategies.
And every level of fathers in the future has a different resources, a different approach, a different energy model.
It's also a challenging challenges that we're starting to discover these three kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of reasons: it's a air pollution, it's a huge water water water, but there's also some certain problems around the Arab, as well as there's a hole from the Western West
But the climate crisis is the great kind of thing, but most important: the global evolution without strategy.
It's all affected. And we need to organize our response. We need to go to a global energy for renewable energy, which is a model, and beyond global economy.
And we've been able to grow resources and political resources, but we've got to finish the political notion to define the resources.
Let me show you these slides.
And I was thinking to start with the audience. What's unusual here, of course, is the wind of the North Pole.
We've been told that, 28 years ago, this is how the moon of the wind and at the end of the summer in the end of the Canada's Canada's House's House.
I've been at the last time I've been looking at the center of the California in California, and I've been talking to the researchers here in Twitter, in the local lab for a few days.
This is what happened over the last 28 years.
For the last project was in 2005.
That's what's happening in the last time that represents the studies.
The French French Ford is at the same geographic. It doesn't look like this, but it's exactly the size of the United States, less than about the age of a long time.
The amount that we've done in 2005 is different for all the surface of the East Mexico.
More the amount that we've been doing in the last few years, it's going back in the street, but not as far as the street, it's as far as we're going to get out of the summer, within five years.
It's from a statement of a statement on Gabby.
Now, around the Atlantic, it's a famous village in Asia. It's a city in California, where in Antarctica: other studies of ASA.
The amount of regulation of the biomaries of light in the size of California.
"Here's the good ones in the time, there were the bad ones that are in the time: the most famous sentence in the English schools. I want to tell you the story between two patients." "
They have the same amount of carbon.
But the difference is that, on the country, most of the carbon dioxide with the time of the atmosphere, there's a CO2, and a natural gas, as a natural gas and so on, and on a lot of us from the atmosphere in the atmosphere. The difference is that our atmosphere is in the temperature of 15 degrees in average, and on the ground is 4
It's not just a little bit more like the sun.
It's a third part of the planet, which is the most likely to be used. Now, this is a picture that you've seen, from the different images, I'm bringing it in order to do a little bit of climate.
Here's the global science says, it's a global warming that the person gets into the atmosphere, and it's the quality of the cell's faster and the platform.
You all know that. In the last government of the last climate change, the scientists wanted to answer a question, "How many are you safe?"
The Chinese came, and the French was "over 90 percent."
Now, we said, "Just a moment, we might be different in this energy that comes from the sun."
If there's more energy in the outside, the expectation is that there will be more hot here.
That's the lowest atmosphere: more.
Paul's "."
And here's the good news: 68 percent of Americans believe today that human actions are responsible to global warming. 69 percent believe that the Earth's waiting for meaningful, but here's the key challenges that have to solve, the global warming.
What's missing is the sense of corruption.
If you agree with my work, but you don't feel a beautiful sense, what does it mean for you?
Well, "One of the leadership on climate," I'm going to talk with "Darwin," who did that in the house, is a global competition for this message.
This is the growth.
ABS: I'm going to take all the network -- in 2007, the Soviet Social Foundation of 96 questions to get me: two of them were about the climate crisis: 84 questions, 44 questions, about the climate crisis.
PS: 2. San 2: SAC: AS.
It's one of the most interesting reasons.
So here's what we do.
That's the sound in all these countries, and that's us.
But it's not just about the developing countries.
The developing countries at the same time that we've built the rate, and we're actually going to reduce the genome of all the year that's different to the place in 1965, and they're building us in a better level.
Maybe the city of the rich countries from the picture, we still had this thing.
But we explain to the developing countries and technology and the way the thought we've created the crisis. It's in Bill Bill's 30 years.
Here's a president in the number of seconds.
The '80s,' 80s, '' 80s, we need to stop it, and the good news.
We can. We have technology.
And we're going to have a very cool view of how to treat this: the war in the world and the challenge of the galaxies of the rich countries, all of these have a very simple solution.
People ask, "What's the solution?"
Well, here's. You're going to reduce the carbon. We're going to have a parasitation without a bridge to come in, instead of the business institution that we've invented in Mexico -- and there's things that have changed since the 20th century.
In the world's world, we've got to combine the responses to the climate crisis.
The plan for war in Iraq, I've been born in behavior if I don't solve the climate crisis.
But the responses are really able to send a difference in the United States. It's the success that we've been talking about in Europe.
He came from the food "New York City."
Speak in the strength is not in the sky. It's possible to offer.
We need to do it for our economy.
The last numbers show that the old model isn't affected. There's a lot of big inventions that you can do. If you're going to invest in a family hospital, you're receiving the investment that's going under carbon dioxide.
And it's based on the old model.
Some of them find green in their legs, as a question that they're organized and they're horrible, they're going to have a great carbon patients to that. Here's just a few of the problems I believe that there's a device.
I'm listening to her, so I'm a part of the big budget.
But politicians are dead, geologists, organisms, energy and use.
You've seen this slide.
But there's a difference. There's the only two countries that we haven't seen now more than one.
And in Australia, it's going to be a word that's going to have a TV park, the Internet and Twitter and the example of reducing the sense of life in the past.
And I mentioned 250 people to introduce the invention in every city, as a city in Australia.
There's a lot of other things that are going to look like this, but the first government that's like the first government is to change the camera of Australia, and so they're going to do. They're going to do information about it, part of the creative work that was going to have.
It's also a New York City, and I've been born to Alexandria said that maybe we've been interested in the creatures, like two years of dancing, we've been preparing this in East East Center, and we're saying that it's going to go into the atmosphere.
We can't figure out what's bad about Australia to change the political culture.
The cities in the United States are two machines in the United States.
It's already for 780, and I think I've seen one more than a drug there.
And these are good news. Finally, we've heard a few days ago that the value of human beings will do so much and that's going to become my father who I've been.
We've got to take a new generation of heroes. These are hundreds of us living in the United States of America's United States, but also in the rest of the world, we need to understand somehow that history is interested in the case -- just like Jolly Bill Bill Bill Clinton found out how to save the lives of the experience of the country and the country's experience.
We've got a culture of the extinction.
But we're data in a global electrodes.
And we need to find a way to create, in the New York City that's living today, a sense of drones.
I wish I could find the words to understand this.
Here's another generation of heroes that come from democracy to this planet.
There's another generation where you're going to work and you're going to be able to work for women's growth.
We can do that. Don't tell us we don't have the power.
We've had the value of a week that's coming out of war and we're going to have a lot to read this challenging solution.
We have the ability to do that.
I'm an optimist, because I believe that we have the ability, once a big challenge, to take the movement to the challenge that the history of history is in our face.
Sometimes I hear people respond to the electronic fact of climate crisis says, "Oh, it's so terrible.
I'd ask you to design this in a new context. How many people have been going to move to the challenge of the challenges that we've been able to learn from the challenging challenge?
A challenge that we've been able to make us more than we thought we could? I think, we need to get this challenge in the beginning of a procedure that's in the future and I've been just going to be able to pay years of the day and we're going to get the memories of regulations and regulations, and they'd say,
Let's do that. Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Many of us at TED feel as a scientist at the end of the French's design problem, while one bad design is going to sound like this in the last eight years that I could do these things.
And that's true.
AK: You don't have any idea. [When you see what your leaders are doing now, exciting you about the global warming?
The answer that we've got to hear about one, I think we have to play about the fact that the French Minister's Foundation -- John's Museum, and there's the stories from the democracy -- all three different countries are very important in the clouds of the climate crisis. All the three of the leaders are the leaders, the three of
Each concept is conducted by carbon dioxide.
"And now, I'm less proud of gas!
"The Syrian of our democracy in our democracy didn't take the basis to the same time that we really want to.
So they're saying the right things and maybe -- using the right thing, but let's tell you, when I came back in 1997 in the sense of happiness that we've made a little bit of the United States, and then I've come out of the United States, just one of the 100 tricks where we've been able to succeed to succeed, to
This challenge is part of culture and culture can.
The CO2 carbon carbon is just like the light that's culture and language.
And now we've become this process for content. Scotch is a code of the beach, a big flight of change beyond what we've done in the past.
And so I started saying, here's an optimist what you do, but here's an effective citizen.
And there's a device... the electricity's electricity. But also the rules.
We need to get our children. We need to solve democracy -- our democracy has a goal of black.
And we need to change it. We've got the Internet.
We've created a connection with people.
We've got a statement -- we're not going to know that we've got electricity from electricity that can't be able to collect the PEO, and that means we need to build the new microbes.
But I believe that between us today, it's possible.
The United States for leadership about the climate is going to transform a global journey, advertising on TV and in the Internet, dancing, data -- with all of the participations with all of the exhibitions and the civilizations and biologists.
We need help. We need help.
In the progress of the human education, don't there something beyond it that I want to work?
I'm proud that I can find the answer to this question. What can I do?
In Octosteroid once wrote, "If the future of all human culture was going to depend, what should I do?
It depends on each of us, but again, not just with electricity.
Many of us here are Americans. We have democracy.
We could change things. But it should be a great change.
What's actually outside is a higher level of information.
And that's hard -- it's hard to create -- but it's happening.
There's also an African solution that some of you know and he says, "If you want to go fast; if you want to go through the street, go together."
So we're going to have a change in science.
We've changed in terms. It's a new sense of corruption.
It's a new way about the rights that's going to make us take on this challenge.
Don't worry, thank you very much for TED.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
In 26, 2016, 2013, a group of active action came into a little bit of mathematical future in the green galaxy.
There, they're the city in the city of 30,000 pounds of the buildings that were written in the Arabic and a number of African languages and working on the asterography, the medical history, including one book that's coming to me the first treatment for men's policies.
We didn't know in the West, it was the collection of three hours, the voice of Africa while we thought Africa was not a child at all.
The head of the city in the country, which is in the event, is called "The Social Foundation of the world's culture."
And he was right -- a woman was, if it wasn't in the fact that it was also a service.
In fact, really before, African words collected a collective collection of books and left them outside to the service.
Today, the collection is in the place, the shape of the left, is going to go in a high corner.
What I've been able to find is again in risk, this time by climate.
But Africa, and the privacy of the world, they're not the only places, or even the main places where they're written that can change the history of the global culture in the environment.
A few years ago, I made a series of doctors and I discovered that in the place, there's 60,000 letters from 1,500 people who don't see in the museum, and there's a couple of different materials that are responsible.
The real number is probably like this, and it's not even bringing in a computer where the Ross Socisco wrote a culture and a culture like a car.
What if there was technology that you could replace the unknown work?
And imagine what I've learned as a product of hundreds of thousands of students don't know can change our knowledge about the past.
Imagine what it's going to try and try and not know that it's going to be written and rethink the buildings of the book, the history, the politics, the music -- or, in a better way, you can write our cultures and culture, to build new bridges between many people.
These are the questions that we've changed with the words of the buildings, called autism, to a statistics.
I'm a word not enough.
For me, it's a photograph of boss, of somebody who's sitting in the morning and waiting for me to come in a traditional community.
A few better to be participated in the past, a experience in her country became, a month after the favorite texts.
As a very, I was a terrible career.
I've read and I've read them to the experiences that people have read too much for hundreds of years -- and normal, bus, joint, but with all of us that I've been told that I've been published and I've published a smaller human knowledge.
What I wanted to be the architecture of the past, the limitation of books, I'm a jungle in the Sweden -- or, in fact, with the Twitter.
And I wanted it not only to myself but I wanted it to my students.
And so six years ago, I changed a career.
At the same time, I was working on the "The Life of love," the last long asteroid of the Europe of the buildings who had never done.
And he didn '
For five years, I've been working with a teacher or a galaxy in London to repeat the rest of the letters and I've come to everything that technology is at the time to offer me.
And so I did what many people did.
I went to the web, and there I found about how Malto Texas was using to return the two of the Atlantic Matt's French and the mastery of the 19th century's revolution.
Faxis is a book that's been written by a month and wrote about it.
And so suddenly, I decided to write to the leader's leadership in the Palestinian project of Archiatric, France Richard Anderson, with the program and experience.
And for a surprise, he actually wrote back.
With my help, I was able to remember in the United States's government government to build an intervention from Social Palestinian lab, and with this lab, I've become what was in a way of trying to try and try a new building.
So how do you go to Scott and work in fact?
Well, the idea behind Scott Mexico is something that anyone who knows to me or an apartment or what's going to say: that what we can see in the field is just a tiny part of what we're doing.
The same thing is true for invisible.
Our system is using 12-the-the-the-theater, and it's described on the top of the LEED, and it's magic on the top of the LEED, and it's a different microscope that's coming down over over the top of the building of the universe.
It's about 35 images to a page of places in this way that's used in a powerful camera that's made in a problem that's done from the country.
There are about five of the world.
And once we're going to predict these images, we're bringing them through thousands of statistics to make their lights, using a software that's in order to support the images and there's something like scientists like ICA and CA.
The results can be exciting.
You may have heard about what we've been doing for the refugees of the brain, which is going to go to Atlantic.
In the use of Iranians, we'd be able to read even in the most important corporations of the brain.
You may not avoid, with that, to other organisms in the environment.
Here, for example, it's a letter that we've learned, of maybe the most high value in the world.
The New York City Congress is the future of the service to the task, and it's going to go to the first half of the fourth century.
It's the most likely that it can go to "Good" by the same time of San San's time under the Socisco, and at the same time of itself, when you're on the basis of the basic belief of the products.
This graph, unfortunately, and it's a very difficult way, and it's going to need because for hundreds of years, it's been used to treat problems in Texas.
In fact, this big amount that you see in the top left corner is a galaxy that's a electronics that's happening in the universe of a person who's got a cat.
Our places can be able to create the first chapter of the wrote was 250 years.
When there's a job that we can't collect other people where it's network, with that, it's just part of the solution.
Technology is happening from us, and the places can work on the picture are then tricks.
It means that refugees and values are beyond the definition of most studies are just for the rich machines.
So I've tried the project to help, and a time that I didn't sell a walls to the Mexico Mexico and Society and smaller experiences or to say in life.
Over the last five years, our team of scientists were faced, from students and students went to seven different countries and repeated some of the leaders in the world's valuable schools, which is the world's worst book in English, the black book of the Charles, the School of School, the most profound, and some of the most valuable values that we've
So, a Facebook statement can be repeated by resources.
More problems, with that, it can repeat a story that's behind themselves, the story of how, by a product, and sometimes, what's told me at the same time that I wrote it.
Let's take an example, a quote of the self-esteem that's written in the baby's bossin's baby's baby, which is how many of our bodies are going to live in a few years ago in the Congress books.
The creatures that pay one word to all the way out and wrote over it.
The word I wrote was "citizens."
Maybe you can think of the word that was under it.
"Thank you."
There, ladies and gentlemen, and I found the American democracy opened up under the door of Jason.
Or I'm born the 141 pounds, and I've changed in the schools in New York City.
It was the map that I was born in a concept that it was probably a tremendous tree before the new world had the idea of how Asia saw where it was.
The problem with the map is that the metaphors and the walls are so rapid over the time that this map is different and half of the regions, made the world look like this.
By now, we've had a very small idea, a very famous metaphor, of what we've spent on the world and how the world's world's culture is coming.
The main version of the map was completely invisible under energy.
Eric Alexander helped it a little bit.
Milliament and training, we've had everything.
In Asia, we've discovered half with long agencies so that they can cover all the body of the creatures.
In Africa, it's about thinking that we can make a nurse.
Like a stars, which can get images of the way the universe looks like in the street, so a microscope can take us for the first moments of creating a object.
Throughout the way, we've been reduced in a corporation, in a minute change, in the unusual computers, in the independence of the human imagination that enables those parts of their stories to become more real, that make the history of history to us.
What about the future?
There's so much from the past, and so little people with the capacity can save us before these objects will disappear.
So we started learning these new experiments that I call them "Social science."
Social science is human beings between traditional capabilities of words -- the capacity to read a future and a future, the knowledge of how statistics should be able to support them -- with new techniques like science, the chemistry, the chemistry, the chemistry, is a computer.
In the last year, a student in my classroom, in the first year, with a city of babies, working on a picture of Palestinian French that I learned in a very famous book.
And when he worked, we wrote a tiny dinosaurs started coming behind the text.
Everybody was collected around, and he called the building of the democracy and the New York City.
It was the first time behind a year that these words were in TV.
At that moment, it became a model.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the future of the past.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
You've discovered the Chinese professors, you've started from the Chinese car, and now you're going to end up at the end of the future within the Asia.
But when you're exploring the ancient letters in almost a space, there's two students who give you a hospital in the kitchen.
All of a sudden, there's a rainforest that I've just wanted to get to the idea.
In the streets to save your life, you go to the room and you're going to go with five customers, including this that's listening to the kitchen that's listening to the outside.
The tremendous eye in the middle of the center is now, with less than it's a solution, and it's a great action to tell you that you don't want to be in the environment when it happens.
What you're familiar with is about 20 minutes to get a high rate.
You know that's the last side before you find, but your way is alive, and no one remember the way.
If you're an hour, you have to be enough time to study one group from the four institutions and take back to this room, and everyone wants the right way.
There's just one problem; the letter told me to the unfortunate: the wind of the city is going to go on the road and lead them to the building through the mistake.
Remember the New York, you understand that two of the students were born.
Each time, one of them are human beings, even though they can say the truth.
You know that the community doesn't get you, but you don '
Can you find a way to ensure that you're going to get together?
Don't worry that the most convinced students will turn you or need others.
This community affects just their communities.
Remember the video now if you want to understand it!
Again in: three answers in the problem: 2 answer in the problem: one of the first thing to understand is that, because you know you're not convinced, you can explore one of the spaces.
It's a crisis that's eight students to the rest of the three cities.
We're going to send four groups of rapidly to help because if one group will return to two different molecules, you're going to have to be able to feel in the brain.
But I've got them to get them to three seconds and work every time, and here's the reason.
The most impressive students might be liked, and not, but you know that there's two of them, while the last year we're always going to say the truth.
When every group came back to the center of the center, all the friends would give the same answer if they found the side.
If three years came back in the summer, then you know that no one of them doesn't matter.
However, you can't be safe in any form, but everything you need is an artist about three to four.
You can understand yourself through evolution.
Of course, it doesn't matter if you're lucky to discover the reality of yourself, but another thing is to connect you with three possibilities.
If every group of answers a single answer, or everyone says the truth, or the two very famous students are coming.
Anyway, we've gone from the gas.
If there's only one group that's going on, the other two other people have to say the truth, and if there's two patients, so the students who are pregnant groups and French and you can look at the third continent because at least two people in every one of the truth.
The device called behind you when you're not green and out of the students.
You're all safe and free of the night.
After the blog, you tell the group that everyone comes from a new, and in case you have more noise.
After the French revolution in 1889, Europe came back to AIDS.
Many countries of countries who are less afraid to share the size of the 16th or 6th, and we're going to turn the new Republicans, while in the house, we're going to have an unusual interpretation between the boundaries of water.
In the center of this project, a powerful human beings before the surface is going to spread on the French.
But is it the shape of the revolution that lies it?
"Okay, okay, who is there today? I don't see anybody."
"The judgment of the judge, it's a fantastic party, the tree that's almost every Europe to find on the bone's nervous bone of the bone that I've been too low."
"Actually, Paul was a average response to us.
The idea that he would be a great and a city from the British of war.
And he wasn't a tree.
It's the gene on the French Foundation and the young French of the Iranian systems. "
"We're going to have the government's revolution in power?"
"Good, how a young military is successful, and polio doesn't have a full of the French revolution, and in the oceans that have been killed: inequality and sisters.
But the revolutions were not ready for real leaders.
It's just in Syria and we've been working on that the first day to control the population as a trick of terrorism, with their intuitive civilizations of all who don't agree with them.
And the design of the public peace that started with them, was maybe an unusual intelligence.
They had to have more powerful leadership that could control some of the connections. "
"So, France did all the revolution get to get with an inevitable motion?"
"No exactly.
My new forces of Paul Paul Paul and didn't thrive from the experience that I'm here with one of the left in the Philippines. "
"I woke it! This experience as a dead in the air, inside the results, and the public has got the tree and because it's going to go from the global citizens."
"Even if it's true, and it doesn't have a new concept that's out of life that's left on some of the most important genes of the revolution."
"Yeah, yeah, all people.
But he's doing the rights that the revolution is going to have even return the work to the French.
The intuition is still dealing that the implications of that are hundreds of years later.
What kind of change is this? "
"The only kind of thing that can be design in those entrepreneurs, and there's still much more than the left of the French."
"If you're already talking about neighborhoods, what was the story with all these refugees?"
"A great question, like us."
"Well, maybe I'm going to do this?"
Here's the academic empathy that we've been able to reduce the microbial to remove the democracy, and to prevent the electrodes around Europe, it's going to happen sometimes, until before we don't get to the song.
After the gender of a blue button as a galaxy in these two wars, it knows that the best leader is the best time. "
"Watch and every continent in Europe?
In 1802, there's been a peak of peace and other doctors in the New York City of the new French.
But in a privacy, we could have a control of control all the continents, and everything that's the ball for a half.
It's going to try to fill economies on Britain from Europe, to every country that didn't agree to join, and open up in the wars to collect our solutions.
And what was the result?
Many of us die around the continent, and it's going to be the international aid. "
"You've forgotten the other result: the democracy and universal ideas around Europe.
Here's what I've been to Paul Laden who's in the continent revealed from the use of physician and religious theories to countries, microbes and effects where people are more profound and more rights than ever. "
"Would we also have to be on the national men and the reasons in the military age?
You can see how this is a hundred years later. "
"So how did the European history look like without the iPhone?"
"A lot better than worse."
The invisible students can make a form of penguin in the end of the virus, together with most of the military.
But even after the biggest experience, it's a better movie, it's on the back of the prison and it's going to get back to my empathy before it's at the last time.
Basically, here's a full of genomes, it's on a revolutionary revolutionary revolutionary revolutionary revolution, and the ideas for liberals through war or empathy, and even though we've never got the part of Europe, it's not enough to replace their lives, it's no good enough to come.
Oh, let's just go down -- beautiful and familiar, which I've been talking to my mom, many times all together.
Why do we choose to get ourselves in this emotion?
The person love love is a meaningful language for our lives, or is it a very interesting thing?
Would love love as a second of countries, a biological Internet to make us culture?
Is that all we need?
Do we need it at all?
If liberal love has a goal, no science didn't have the psychology and it's still.
But over the history, some of the most interesting philosophers have come up with some interesting theories.
Let's make us perfect, again.
The philosophy of the future and the future is exploring the idea that we like to become perfect.
In my "Spipes", he wrote about the Arab Foundation of Arab, in Arab Arab, "a prototype," the next number of people's story: people ever want to create with four hours, four, four feet, and there's a face.
One day, they killed the violence, and the dinosaurs all over two years.
Since then, every person is missing itself.
My love is a change to find a theory of what you're going to feel again, or at least, that's what the artist who's going to imagine was saying in the reason.
Let's look at what we're going to do.
A lot more later, the German philosophical philosophical philosopher who's based on a second is my mother's wife.
It's the profession that we like because our infrastructure leads us to believe that another person will make us happy, but we're completely wrong.
The nature is looking at the culture, and the connection that we're looking for is not our children.
When our local answer is learning, we're going back to the interesting universe, and we're able to just get the species and keep the region of human beings.
It sounds like somebody needs.
Let's talk about our buildings.
Before the French Frankla and the Britain of Britain, we love to make our physical answers and our technologies.
People are preparing to culture, but without the astronomy of love, China is not enough.
We're the fear of our green world and we've come back with us to build different programs to protect ourselves.
It's about love, intuition, intuitive life help us overcome our fear of the world, to learn from our building machines, and to make a bigger connection in life.
Let's do all our universe, and do that the best thing in life.
My love is a mistake.
Lota Guarta, which becomes a star, or the mammoth, probably there were some interesting forces with Robert.
In the profession that we love because we're trying to provide our basic infrastructure.
And yet, our answers are genes, and bees, even liberal love, they're a big source of suffering.
Fortunately, at the same time, it's kind of a plan to the structure of the other, so we can get to New York, and in our country, in the South, a few, compassion.
The Charlie School Amendon described the statistics that love and democracy is a device in the Asian Asia, "Some of the room of a human room."
In the night, January just likes in the Phicago and affect it.
Social emotions of love and emotions and bad me, so Twitter gave me a concept that could see me as long as he wasn't looking at me.
But of course, he's looking at a mathematical look.
It's seeing the Phicago.
Our goal went into the center is going to go for five hours in liberal.
It's not all the statistics think about this as an architecture, but the model of the story is that it's when it's a connective connection in interaction, you have to have to say institutions, avoid it.
Let's allow us to get beyond ourselves.
Let's try a little bit more positive.
The French philosophical philosophy has been a lot of invention that love is the answer to other people and it's spending our lives in meaning.
However, it was much less than the way we like more interested in how we can love better.
It saw that the problem with traditional love is that it can be so important to home, that we're going to become the only reason to live.
And yet, participation in others to save our universe and lead to two times and power.
To avoid the machines, in the art of self-love in the same small, which is more like a great companies.
The differences need to support each other in the age of themselves, get beyond themselves, and get their lives and their world together.
Even though we may never know why we love, we can be safe that it would be a traffic in emotions.
It's a great fear.
It's caused us to train biologists to code.
Maybe we lose ourselves.
Maybe we find ourselves.
It may have been talking about the heart, maybe it's just the best thing in life.
Are you going to get sick?
Have you ever seen a friend with a problem just to understand that it just doesn't seem to understand why it's so important to you?
Have you ever made a idea to a group of people and it's easy for a heart?
Maybe you'd have been sure when the other person's surprises you that you didn't have said at all?
What happens here?
The answer is a communication, and in one way or another, we've all experienced it.
It can lead to Bolly, Tony, independence, or even the traffic of a meeting that's made out of very, very often.
The fact is that even when you're in a face with a person, in the same room, you're talking the same language, communication is complex.
But the good news is that the basic understanding of what happens when we survive can help us prevent products in communication.
For decades, researchers asked, "What happens when we survive?"
One meeting, which is called the second molecule, you see that there's a movement that's one person after, exactly what someone who's going on and from the street.
But in reality, this simple model didn't think of complexity in communication.
Here's a business model, which is much more and many more challenges of communication.
With this model, it's too much too much to think about communication between people like a box.
When we communicate our message, we get a matter of the other side.
Over the business, we create meaningful meaning.
But from these politics, they're doing other reasons.
It's not like Wall Street, in a few countries can be one of the brains like children, patients to make emotions and emotions.
As people, we can '
When you're connecting, one of the brings its humanity's humanity's personal device, and the person who's talking to me about the device of the message.
Our infrastructure is replacing all the time from meaning and women.
Remember the game of a box?
Imagine this with a material.
When every person touched me, they design us to get their own personal patterns based on all the number of seconds, like aid or experiences, genes, states, babies, or family events.
At the same time, every person represents the message that they're getting based on their relationship with the other person, and their only understanding of the students would be the skills of those words in the use.
They can also be surrounded by different organisms, like training or security.
Even emotional emotions can train their understanding, and by adding more people to conversation, each one with my robotic reasons, the complexity of the communication of the creative communities.
So when the sensors of the material go from one person after, you work, you react, and you change all the time, it's not a wonderful thing that's going to become a series of products in communication.
But unfortunately, there's some simple activity that can help us all make our local communities for a great communication.
Number one: To know that the savings and the environment are not the same.
And to intervention with the National Social Milliament of others, and get your message to the better understanding.
Two: The answer with the eyes and the ears, as well as with the cancer.
Remember that communication is more than words.
Three: You take the time to understand when you're trying to be awesome.
I'd like to understand ourselves very quickly, it's easy to forget that communication is the street of Twitter.
I've been open to what the other person might say.
And finally, four: You've been aware of your human drugs.
Your students' experience, including your culture, your community, the family, affect how you see the world.
And say, "So I see the problem, but how do you see it?"
Don't assume that your perception is the best truth.
It's going to help you work in the direction of a dream with others to get open structure.
I believe that big institutions have a potential potential to create change, and I believe as people who have power to affect the direction that these institutions take.
Now, these beliefs don't come to me in natural way, because I've got a lot of big institutions, it's not really part of my family's families.
I'm on the floor and see when she was 10.
To do that, she had to get away from all sorts of kinds of experiences: governments like me, military governments and even a five-meter park.
More later, when she wanted to go to the United States, she had to get to the culture that said that the house would never be the best.
Just because her name in a case sounds like, she was able to reduce her way to the government's government to get to the United States.
Because of her courage and her passion, I had all her opportunities never been, and it did the story of three years so different.
Instead of talking about big institutions, I actually wanted to design.
I had the opportunity during my career to work for the Wall Street, the white home and now one of the biggest Chinese institutions in the world, where I got a great investment.
Now, these institutions are like economies, and when I've been working in you, I've learned to transform the big waves that they can leave, and I've become convinced that the institutions of the big economists, almost 290 trillion dollars in the world, which is maybe one of the most powerful forces of the most powerful forces of social forces to change, and if we
Now, I know that some of you think, the global change, social change, not in the same sentence or even at the same time.
I think many people think about economic changes like the ocean.
It's a human power, not people, and I don't care, that's not affected by our serious and the answers.
So the best that our little boss and our typical agreement can do is try to transform a few waves in the good room and not to go to the Syrian's Syrian's Foundation, but we've actually decisions about how to take our privacy decisions not affect our tiny, not affecting the ecosystem of the climate.
But why is that?
Because in fact, three of this ocean of the president in fact that we're going to continue to people like us, and most of the restaurant of the Chinese change that get the power of their failures and their president, as friends, participants, best, civil countries.
So if we're on the end of the old change, why do we're not able to make our communities heard?
Why can't we do some waves?
So let me ask you a different question: Would someone be here in the last time you've been in Southern Amazon?
Okay, is someone who's going to a journey and invite the questions that's growing in a place instead of the Chicago and I'm from the music that you really want to take?
Would any of you get in the United States or even electrical car?
So why do we do these things?
Right? One electrical car doesn't matter a lot of relationship to 1.2 billion cars with information in the face.
And one gene is just one organic.
And one piece of language doesn't matter how to seven elephants in this crazy world.
But we're doing these things because we believe that they're changing, that our actions are collective, that our choices may be affected, what the impact can be.
So, my daughter has a different language and a few years ago.
It's a lot of use.
Look at some of the things we've got, which is saying.
"This only conference can be used again."
"This church can inspire others to use one."
"This only conference helps to save the platform."
I didn't have any idea that this plastic was so powerful.
And so why do we think that our choice to pay four dollars for a summer that's growing up in the military, in San Francisco, I've worked a lot of use -- but what do you do with 4,000 dollars in our investment and the income of the income -- no matter?
Why can't we say to a project that I care about, that I care about the students' students' students' students' work, that I've even care about the potential and healthy communities?
Why don '
So I think it's going to happen to die of the industry that we're all carrying us in our political movement.
Do you remember the popular story of adults about the prison's virus?
If you'd say to the story, "Look, a little bit, a little bit, look," it's full of a beautiful engineer.
And if you said, "Good, a little bit, a stop," he was a product.
But if you tell the words not true, it's not human again, things can be used.
So I think that when it comes to the changes, we have a little bit of the first industry.
We believe that the markets are just the wonderful story before one: to do more money.
Most of these words have said exactly the same way that Congress was trying to fit in the gold.
There were some words like "to protect the environment," and the table may not work.
We put the wrong words like "social media," and you might see your gold fingers or even disappeared, before this industry.
So we asked people, what do you really think?
And in fact, we've come out and we've got thousands of details, and we've found something exciting.
In French, people wanted to add these other words to be saved.
71 percent of the people said yes, they were interested in investment investment, that we're defined to take the best in the investment process that you've already done in a way that you've done the other information that you're getting when you think about the environment and the society and the government.
71 percent wanted it.
72 percent said they believe that the companies did it were actually saving more economic.
So people really believe you can succeed to do good.
But here's the strange thing: 54 percent of the people still said that if they're using the money in these countries, they thought they'd do less money.
So is it true?
Do you get less engineering and engineering if you hear a map that's growing in a place to change it?
Well, you know, the investments in companies like Brazil or Angeles were not agreed.
Right? And these two started as small companies and social scientists who became so proud of the consumers that the eyes were going to talk to us all about hundreds of millions of dollars every single day.
But here's the important part: these companies are the building.
If they want to protect the values of their investment, they need to keep the scientific goal to society.
If they didn't really be able to collect these other words and the environment and the environment in social information, these brings didn't do money.
But maybe it's just the way that proves the general, right?
The serious societies that invent our economy that are dealing our decline that really makes the world go around, they need to build more money.
So, the school of the green business is actually exploring it, and they've found something exciting.
If you'd hear about 20 years ago in Paul Paul Paul Paul Paul of companies that were always going to do more than a quarter after a quarter, the same dollars was a 146 dollars.
It's not bad! Sometimes you're looking at it if instead of it, you'd hear the same dolphin in Paul Palestinian companies that were always going to grow their business and the most important issues of society, the same generation would be 26 dollars a trick.
It's almost two years ago, it's almost two years ago.
Now, let's be clear, they didn't do the primary professionals we need to give money to show as if they're a good civil society.
They've done it to focus on the things that are used for their business, like in less energy in their production process; like worrying that their CEO's brains show the word for a long time of the society that they're serving, not just to be able to build a lot of ideas; or to build a very high level at a very high level of energy level.
Now, the Arabic didn't come.
I'm also a research study where they've been living in 120 different studies looking for the effect of economic results, and they've ever discovered after a time after the companies who had this kind of important things was actually more effective, on a lower cost to be a better result in their country.
And then there's a gender.
So 20 years ago, when I worked for a gender in the white house, it was one of the first half of the business and governments to pay for the challenges of climate change.
After the white house, it's the social development of George Darwin, where it's Africa and social media and other things into our investment process.
And at the same time, there was a lot of optimistic about my perspective.
Twenty years later, our clothes are still as much as the investment that has done in the right place can be safe.
We've been far away to create less engineering and engineering because it's the end of the forest, it's actually made more, meaningful.
Now, the very good investment of the good news is that it doesn't require to think of the magic and it doesn't require a toxic institution, and it's not just allit.
It doesn't just touch ourselves for billions.
It's not just about the investment that sound like "technology" or "microscopes" or "or" or "or" or "or" in the work, "and in Berlin.
It's about countries and organizations and companies of Charles.
It's about the Indian organizations.
It's about all the things we're already seeing today.
So that's why I'm convinced that we have the common power to become local investment for the new level.
First of all, the point of procedure comes out all the time that the investment is made right, represents all the good principles of the investment, the traditional history, can pay.
It's the sense.
Secondly, the biggest obstacle we're going to actually find in our head.
We've just got to go back from the death that if you add your values to thinking about the investments that get less engineering.
And once you get rid of this year, you can actually start to make these facts that we've talked about.
And three, the future is already here.
The local news today is that 20 trillion trillion dollars is the most famous task of all the investment industries.
In the United States, it's growing a huge way, as you can see.
It's now represents one of all six dollars of the investment under a professional community in the United States.
So why do we wait?
For me, it's going to go back to the Israeli that I've got a lot of.
She knew she wanted a life where she had a free community to do her choices and she had heard you could write her story.
She had a different answer about this goal, and she was clear that she couldn't put in the military, put a device, put a big institution to stand.
She came to the United States, and she became a teacher, and she told a magazine, and at the end of talking to her home to Eric.
And in these days, you can see that it's not going to get place in the most powerful institutions in the world.
It seems to be almost a video that means that what's called "in different ways."
In different ways: That's what I think we need to know.
It's a answer about change that we want to see in the world, and in addition that we can help make the journey.
We've got more opportunities than ever before to do elections.
We have more power than ever before to make our voice sound.
So you change your effect.
The step with your little change.
We're going to invest in change and you want to see in the world.
We changed the industry and change the changes.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When we hear the word Darwa, it's activated with big functions and empathy, but it's not all the story.
And Darwa also has to have two doctors where you're going to take a cartoon.
So what is theory actually, and how much do you have to worry about its effects?
The answer begins with the understanding that the word's down from two different scientific activity: electronics and nuclear theory.
Darwa's nuclear is a small energy that's complex electrical galaxies and expertise connections in space.
When these waves just faster, they're operating in energy.
In the low side of the drugs, there's the dance, we're a red, and we'll see.
In the worst part, there's the Islam, Darwin, Darwi, Darwi.
The original society is involved by a conversation and the electronics.
We might read a model of our phone through a galaxy to open up a picture of a galaxy, that we can see because our journey is called light.
And a nuclear theory, on the other hand, comes from the graph of the atom, where projects take each other's market in the other trends and water.
The phenomenon that's known as the graph and the gravity and the gravity of the nuclear power is going to protect this experience to keep the whole graph.
However, a couple of children's children's children's children's children's children, who know as anatomy, and the rest of the people don't exist, Iranians.
They're going to be called a bioenergy, which is going to be a huge, to achieve a larger design.
And Darwa is coming from natural gas, like Iran, a gas that's part of the nation.
We're also getting rid of natural dinosaurs to give us the German electricity.
Even in a hospital like a tiny amount of intuition that's not a good dance.
So if we live in the world of California, how can we speak from its molecules?
Like the beginning, not every theory is dangerous.
And Darwa becomes a plan when it's known the electronic electrons of the atmosphere, the process that can get DNA.
It's an incredible movement because the atoms that I'm going to get an interview.
All the Germans is countries, in the city of the highest electromagnetic energy.
It's including an example, Derek's Center, and the high side of the Islamic.
So as a result, it's just over a tremendous tree, doctors defend the body that they don't have to look at, and why people are going to use biology.
Obviously, telephones and microphones work in the lower field of the drugs, so there's no risk for the state of the regulation.
The biggest risk of health is going on when a lot of countries are going on in time and produced, what's also known as an extinction.
Specifically, it's about nature's natural capacity of the body to fix this.
It can make cancer, independent activity, even violence.
Fortunately, it's powerful, but we're thinking nothing to die more low of natural history and nature.
Scientists are more difficult to fix these risks.
Your bodies are often dealing this and small images of a country, and if it can't, the results of this can't show for decades or more.
One way in which scientists think about a country is a unique experience called Scott.
It's important for one cartoon that's probably worrying in the hospital, and four cartoons can be TV.
However, the extension today's regulation is so much lower.
The average theory that people get is 6.2 tricks from all different cases, about three times because of Iran.
Throughly five microscopes every single one, you'll have to get more than 1,200 categories to get all of your different media.
And remember the building?
If you can provide all of the building generations, you're going to need about 170 in the day to get to the second level.
We live in the world of green.
However, a lot of this career is not art.
And for the rest that it's countries, our slides in general ways, and in choices like building your home to see the leaders and the leaders can help reduce the health risks.
Remember Mark, one of the first half of the history, finished the challenge like this: "You don't have to solve anything in life, it just needs to be a sense.
Now the time to understand more, so there's less. "
Every day, there's a facility of decisions.
A little bit of genetic don't matter, but recently there's a big impact on our lives.
For instance, what is politicians to succeed?
Would I try the last moment?
Or are I a model to do it for the walls?
We're spending so many decisions that we can choose too much.
But there's a lot of ways to improve the risks, there's an effective method in terms of creativity.
It's a way for a question that enables us to solve this in the situation, to find the important issues, like the Time and the team, and get the best decision.
I think I might sound like a child in a way that's true.
Instead of choosing a answer because it feels right, a person who is using a general thinking to look at all of the invitations in the environment.
In the use of tools that you've seen, they're probably going to be able to reduce the most useful information.
There's a lot of ways to think about creativity, but there's one way that you might help you solve some problems.
One: We took the question.
In other words, you know what you're looking for.
It's not always as simple as it sounds.
For example, if you're looking at if you're trying to try the new, the reasons why we're looking at other organisms, like mistakes that you've seen results within two weeks.
But if you get to a situation with the critical understanding of the eyes that you're trying to get through the nanota, whether it's a big, a better one, or more energy, it's going to help you China the information in creativity, find out what you're looking for, and to decide if you're looking for the new conversation that you
Second: I collected the information.
There's a lot of information, so if you have a clear idea about your question, it's going to help you decide what Richard.
If you're trying to decide about being able to improve your music, you might ask a little bit of disease, or you're looking for other people's ideas.
I'm finally going to help you to wear different options, and it's going to get you to a space that's going to die in your regime.
Three: We've used science, for example, by questions in general questions.
When you're going to face decisions, ask yourself, "What's the ideas going on here?"
"Maybe our animals are?"
"Would my story prevent?"
For example, in IMA that's safe for millions, you need to think, "What do you design my approach to this situation?"
"Would I assume that the market to tell the truth?"
"Basically on the eyes, is it the sense that you're going to get in the money?"
four: I've got those of the consequences.
And imagine it's time to choose, and you've been looking at their security to move their voice research.
In the first, it looks great.
But what about the environment effects for a long term?
If this research is limited the use of a child, it might make a big difference in the air pollution, it's not a car that's important to think about it.
Thanks: We built other perspective.
I asked yourself why so many people are going to learn from the politics of politics.
Even if you don't agree with everything that's going to say, all the motivations might be going to tell you why ideas don't get on, you can try others.
It's possible to explore the possibilities, to make your choices, and finally help you make decisions more.
The average process is just every single tool, and it's actually not a different decisions in our lives.
But it can help us get the best choices we've done.
It's important in creativity can give us tools to China and find what we're looking for.
And if we enough of us to use it, it has the power to make the world more diverse.
You've been your weird decade, and you're 99 most of your weapons that you're going to see of the side.
He wanted to leave all the money to you, but he knew that if he did it, your bees would want to give you to the world.
So he's looking at the fact that he's taught you everything you need to know about animals.
Your hand left the next one in my side. "I made a experience."
If all of the 20th century, you're going to share the money that's different.
However, if you're the first to find the patterns and solve the problem without doing all the senses, you're going to get the whole generation of yourself.
In success. "
The old way to take you and the 99 bees to your experiences in one of the one that's been able to 100 billion minutes, each of the word 'word' word.
He's explaining: every family has a number between one to 100.
And there's one that's opened every arms.
And there's only two categories that are different.
And there's three years that's the situation of all three years, basically if it's open, it's going to kill it, but if it's going to open it.
This pattern was going on until every 100 times we've gone.
The words in asteroids that have been left open open and help you open the code to another.
So before I was an infinite, I could even start to go through the poem, you're going to go forward and what you're going to say to the eye that you know maybe billions will stay open.
But how?
Remember the video now if you want to understand it!
Second answer: three more answer: two more answer: one of the key is to understand that the number of times are touched in Africa is the number of cases of Arabic numbers.
For instance, in Arabic number six, one person opened it, a man who's going to open it, three people opened it, and a man who's six crops it.
The numbers 1,23 are the causes of six.
So when Ethiopia has a number of genes, it's the rest of the stairs, and when it has a number of cases, it's the rest of the open.
Most of the asteroids have a number of genes, what we've done is because we're used in general ways.
In fact, the only astronomers who have a number of cases are often perfect because they've got one that you're causing ourselves is different to the number.
Although 9, one opened it, three crops, and 9 opened it.
Two member 33, but three can tell one time.
So, every Arabic that it's just a perfect science of openness.
You know that these astronomers are the solution, so you can open them from a model to read the words in the content: "Here's five of the first theories that we've just got before."
You understand that the only theory that we've been talking about are sometimes the first numbers because each one has two cases: one itself.
So here's 257 to 79.
The only way that brings you to a second, and you take your parents.
Throughly your bees will always be business to be a word to each other to pay attention to your creative experience.
Instead of them are everywhere, they're living in the wind and wind, cells inside our body.
You'll depend on cases like species, imagine, the average person is between 560 percent.
In London, human babies are even better.
Obviously 75 percent, they're sending biologists.
But their water car will happen to 65 percent of their first communities.
So what do we face games in our body, and how much do we actually have to change to stay healthy?
The water in our bodies work to the left is to remove the temperature, to move the brain from the service.
Sometimes we don't find most of us.
The heart of a man's brain is almost three days.
It's different about the amount of living in a building.
We're going to see it more to operate with 83 percent.
And even the self that I saw in the year are 31 percent.
If we're actually doing water, and we're facing water, why do we still change so much?
Well, every day we lose three trillion through our movement, which is, meaningful, and even use.
In these functions that we've got to survive, we need to find on the dinosaurs.
A lot of water that's very agriculture is that we're going to avoid the behavior of the noise or noise, the two of the two are the ideas about the general health.
In the first age of water and chemistry, and students in the face of the brain are given to the service of the democracy.
When he comes to the whole house, he's created an anonymous, special symbols that allow me to provide more water, what's led to the song like this.
The baby's lab can make meaningful lights in energy, the moon, the wind, the pressure, the pressure, the pressure, like trying to happen and genetic careers.
The brain is used to make it more difficult to get the same as a normal brain, and it's even conducted because of the water's mortality.
I wanted more, I'm a tragedy, and it's in a general way because it's created more water in a short time.
I'm going to treat a lot of times and patients and a victim to be more serious because of the stars of water in physical conditions.
While the brain's brain represents the creation of the university, the modern brain, or even scary, release it into today.
The electronic electronics in the body becomes words, which makes cells less.
In some cases, everything can't stand in the places of the molecules.
So the noise of noises, which can get to the price, is it, and in microbes, the face of art.
But it's a great case.
On the basis of a normal experiment, which is happening on a very good system, and it's easy to be born to those of us who have access to the two hands.
For a long time, the regulation says we need to change that eight is coming in.
It's still true since.
Now, the contrast is that the amount of water we need to avoid the city in our web in our environment.
The local consumption is changing from 23.7 trillion tricks to men, and about 27 trillion women, Twitter sensors over and down, if we're healthy, adults, we get too much.
While they're the most healthy, other reality, even like this with Pantheon like this.
And water inside the food and half of our local sea.
Portus like data, parasites, and even they're more than 90 percent, can add to the amount of water enough materials and valuable values.
Five years enough, there's also me on a long task.
The studies have shown that the optimism can reduce risks to the summer, help get on a service, and potential to reduce the risk of different kinds of cancer.
No matter what, there's no amount of liquids that create light in how you feel, you think, and you're going to get a place.
How to be a conversation in the country?
And how do these tiny cells in your brain enabled a complex thought, memories, and the training they are?
Unfortunately, these questions have the same answer: the phenomenon, or the political form of complex behavior and large groups of simple students.
Like a lot of animals, genes are collected together in groups, but it's not just because they're today from one company's society.
It's still the service.
It's going to be a complexity and complexity that help them avoid hungry, while a building becomes very fast.
So what's the leadership of Britain is the country?
In fact, no one, everyone.
So what does that mean?
While it's going to be a great leader to genetics, physics, represents what looks like a car, every single body is actually working after two experiments that actually don't survive for women: one, one of the two, but not most of you, your two, you're going to play.
As primates, the genes are focused on the small details of these local activity, but if enough genes are joined in a group, before things will come out and go out.
The movement of genomes are used by a new women to say: the community, has its behavior.
The community didn't control us.
It's just surprising if you have enough genes that work after life's risk.
It's like a theory that's happening over and over and over and over and over the ocean, and it's enormous to avoid crazy factors.
And it's not just organisms.
The phenomenon is basically a plan of a lot of complexity systems.
For instance, the particular way in Congress and Congress is scared and rolling over the year almost always creates the same patterns of waves.
And when I sent my atmosphere in atmosphere, the particular connections of the words of water produced products in a way that produces open-up open-source products.
What makes the phenomenon so complicated is that you don't understand it just by regulations, like the data of cars.
It's a good step to understand a complex system.
But if you're scared to be a bicycle, it's losing the ability to avoid details, and it's not the rest of the room.
And if you're afraid of the microbes in the universe, you're left with something that doesn't believe in a camera, and you don't know what we think of the genes, at least most of the time.
However, what you're thinking now doesn't matter to California in the face of the brain.
But, the movement comes from the political activity of many neurons.
There's a billion neurons in the human brain, and the tricks of connections between all these neurons.
When you learn a complex system like this, it can get in all kinds of strange ways, but it's not.
The neurons in our brain are working after simple life, just like leaders, so a group, they're organizing themselves for the real patterns that give you to do things like you know, that repeat it again and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again, and they're saying all the simple objects that everybody like you love.
So, what are the basic life when it comes to the brain?
The basic activity of every New York City in the brain is to return to other neurons.
If you're looking for a couple of neurons and you're looking for a simple space, you can create drugs of activity, you can't make a lot of activity, and you don't think that you're bringing the size of the size, you're going to get ridiculous, where you can actually get to other neurons on the
When there's more and more neurons from connected, more complex patterns of activity than the web.
In the country, so many neurons communicate in so many different ways in one of the system has become an intuitive.
I've been on the network of the network that can't be talking about by simple circumstances that we've described.
And yet, from this island, patterns can be affected, and then it works again in a way that you can repeat.
In a certain point, these patterns of activity become complexity enough, curiosity to study their biologists, not to remind the phenomenon.
And what we've discovered in this phenomenon in different ways of saying is the same activity and outcomes as someone's leaders: this phenomenon doesn't require someone to be in control.
If the right rules are, and some conditions are fine from the person, a complexity system of the same legs over and over and over and over and over and over and over again, you're going to become a story.
It's true in the dictionary of the molecule that allows your cells to participate, and a group of deaths that makes your computer, your friends and family, all the way to our cities and our economy on the planet.
In 1996, 56 volunteers used a research study that was a new pain called Broaden Britain.
Each participate, one fingerprint went in the new fingers in the other hand didn't touch.
And then half the two of them in half of their ancestors.
The buildings will take that the fingerprint is less than the patient.
It's not supposed to surprise us.
What did the students be safe that this local drug worked?
The answer is in the plastic effect, a phenomenon doesn't talk about political drugs that don't want to affect, and in real ways, make people feel better, unfortunately.
The doctors were used to be used since the 18th century, when they realized the power of physical drugs in the community of people's symptoms.
It's our identity when the mathematical drugs didn't exist, or if somebody will imagine it's sick.
In fact, the word of the word "Little" is, "I'll collect the concept," what's impressed on the history of terrorists.
February had to learn the real treatment to be convinced, so it's the same in the form of Chris, full of water, or even local life.
In the year, doctors realized that there was another use of this argument: in the experiments and children.
By the 1950s, studies have used to look at as a democracy to look at new treatments.
To make a new drug, for example, some of the patients in the experiences have a real drug.
The second half of the other is going to get a road that seems to be the same.
Because the patients didn't know if they got the real medicine or the nation, the result wasn't too low, so the microbes were.
So if the new solution showed that a meaningful improvement of the road, it would be a place as good as effective.
Today, it's less beautiful to use this road because you're born the day.
If you can compare a new drug from Congress a year, or a different drug, it's going to affect someone who's treatment at all, especially if they have a great disease.
In these cases, we've been able to find a lot of times as a teacher to predict the test, so the effect of the new medicine is a better language of architecture that can be too much.
But of course, we know that we're going to have a impact of our impact.
The platform of effective patients have a great community of problems, including heart problems, astronomy, although everything they're going to get is a beautiful drug from the same conference.
We're still trying to understand how this happens.
There's an artist who's accurate to me and art, but that's responsible for other reasons, like the creation of patients to want the doctors by reducing a chimpanzee of a story.
On the other hand, studies think that if you don '
It seems to be abused to be able to make a difference in stress stress stress stress, in the face, and in a decade, some very sophisticated molecules, like we're hormones.
It's explaining why people in the study as a lot of times say they're going to have a model on their own unprecedented.
Please maybe even scary the stress and stress, like light, something can feed the food effects of disease.
So wouldn't I represent the strategies of the road?
Not necessarily.
If someone believe that a physical treatment can see it, it might be a drug or an effect that you're going to prove.
And also, the positive effect might disappear with time, and that's how it happens many times.
We've also been able to look at the traffic results, and it's pushing the scientists to figure out how they affect us so much.
Although all we know about the human body, there's still some strange things, like the plastic effect.
So maybe other doctors don't know yet?
It's easy to explore the world around us to forget that one of the most exciting issues we've found really behind our eyes.
You tell the most amazing story, and you come to the best part when suddenly it's surprising, "The return and I'm not" I'm going to go back. "
Most of us will probably be nervous, but outside of the extension, is your friend have the right mistake?
Would your sentence actually be wrong?
And if he still would understand it, why does it matter?
From a perspective of innovation, transport is a set of patterns to how our words are connected to create prosthetic sentences, whether it's healthy or writing.
Two seconds have different patterns.
In English, the subject that in general comes from the first time, after the river, and then the president, in many other languages, the story is the subject, the president.
How many words were trying to identify participants for all the languages, but outside of some basic programs, like they have self-esteem, a few of these universal acts.
And while every language has to work in order to participate, these studies of the patterns have developed a concept between two different kinds of women that are known as a project project.
In the metaphor of stem cells, details think that language has to work after life is working, as a good experiments see that change is a natural thing that's necessary for the language.
For a long time of history, most of the space of the language was talking.
But when people become more connected and write about thinking, the language has become a traffic plastic to ensure that people in different parts of government can understand each other.
In many languages, the standardical form was the only one of the math, even though it came from one of the kinds of things, in this general way of people with power.
The language was working in order to try and share the restaurant by generating the prototypes of generations that are going to transform the Muslim transport of entrepreneurs.
And it's generous to the transport of a writing and also a part of the talk.
I've been interested in the general that the rules of the intervention and thought to be able to feel, or the institutions of a complex social company, and a lot of people who've discovered things in these ways were going to be able to admit the democracy.
More recently, with that, in the next few years, it's a famous phenomenon with my own experiences.
Most of us learn to talk about this size of a place that we don't even remember it.
We're making our healthy details through the inevitable legs, not privilege.
And because it's also used to use the intuition of intuition and intuition to meaningful, its structure is a lot of times more rapidly, if you're going to watch the ways of the things and then then you're in.
It means that it can be a complex science that's hard to take in real time, to make changes to avoid strange behavior, or try to make the speed of what's faster.
The molecules that are trying to figure out and even though these differences without going to be known as a project.
Instead of deciding how language should be used, it's described how people actually use it, and after the senses that they're moving through the process.
But while the power between French and French and San Franciscism, the two years didn't try to try to.
In the best case, a project that's used to know people about the most common patterns in a certain point of time.
It's important, not just to survive the medical connection, but also doing the communication between things that don't mean different natural things.
And a project, on the other hand, we can buy a building into our brains and the autism ways that we build our energy on the world.
Finally, you can think of the best to think about the money of the legs to change that all the time changes are represent by the groups of language.
Like the language itself, it's a complexity and complex organization that's organizing through the drugs of things and again, write and read, prototypes and optimistic tricks, also a very remote source.
There are some things we all need.
We've all got to have a list.
We need a place to change.
We need to eat. We need love disease.
You know, love is great.
And we all need a very safe place to change.
I mean?
As a theater who doesn't fit in our country to make the moral definition, if I could change the world to make it better for me, the first thing that I would do is to create connections with one of the interactions in all the public places.
Thank you very much for people and Twitter and the issues that are related to Twitter, they've got a lot of attention to the central country recently.
And it's a great thing to be necessary, but most of this attention was from a few people, most of them are a kind of famous decades, and they probably don't have to worry about where they're going to understand that lessons in their communities, where they're going to be part of their communities, where they're part of their public school.
It's going to have money from building these TV galaxies from these amazing challenges that we need to deal with them on local experiments.
The public services.
They were a problem for me since I can remember, first when I was a little baby and then later how you'd see just about asteroid.
So now, today as a terrorist, public services and white holes are the place where they're going to have the most high risk that ask us the Internet.
Many times I was opening molecules behind their doors.
We've been reduced by security to go out with the plants still half the car.
In India, we've been working on it, and once one astronomy in the face with a woman's Arabic that I've taken home home at the same day, I'm sure that all of us are at least 70 dollars of a big finger and a big galaxy.
And I know what some of you think, and you're right in the city.
I can't just use the lights and men most of the time.
But it didn't solve my regulation, right?
And I don't need to use men because I'm not a man.
I'm a Internet.
And now we have political politicians a fear that's going to try to bring our lives in these use.
Do you heard about them?
They're trying to send people like me to use the services that they think they're going to be trained before the gender that you're going to get.
And if these politicians have ever got what they want, in Amazon and California or for a week in Boston, Texas, Texas, well, using these men's bridges and they're not the only doctors for me.
And every time one of the political politicians bring one of these lives to the table, I can't be, you know, who's exactly how it's going to be able to fix these rules.
Right? Bay under the universe?
Really.
Basically things outside the white room in public health?
There's no way that we're going to fix these rules in any way.
They're just going to make the fear of electronics.
They don't do them safer.
But they're doing the world more dangerous to some of us.
And in the data, our Twitter kids get.
They're called the school, or they're going to come out of the life completely.
People Twitter people, in the city of Center or don't travel to the sky and other challenges when they get to the CO2, but I'm also universities, patients, schools.
Don '
If we don't start now worrying that these places were really open and feel everyone, so we just need to be able to stop and read them in public places.
We've just got to be that they're really open to people who're going to be here to one of the great boxes, what I'm not.
I've never been real.
And it starts really early.
I know a little girl, she's my company.
It's a self-esteem.
I'm talking about a physician or a toy that's going to have a tool in a group of insects, all the business.
I once asked her what my favorite color was.
She said to me, "The Chinese."
So this little girl, she came home from school in the last October of half with a good plane because other kids in the school had been trying to use the home of the house.
And the teacher had already told her to go to the bathroom.
And it's the same that you're going to get in this red summer in the audience, and I mean, can you say to a human sample, right?
It's so good. And it can't remove the popular.
It's built in the classroom for four.
They've already killed enough power to push her use in the survivors called public.
She was four.
We've already learned it that Berkeley was not going to survive with a gene that invented people like her.
It's already learning that survivors will be a problem, and this problem started with her just.
So my company asked her to talk to her little daughter, and I talked.
I wanted to say that I'm a mother and my mom and I'd been talking to her school and the problem disappeared, but I knew it's not true.
I wanted to say that the whole tool was better when it was going, but I couldn't.
So I asked her to tell me the story about what happened, and I asked her to tell me how it made me feel.
"I'm a sad piece," she said to me.
So I told her she didn't realize that it's not okay what happened to her, and then she asked me if I did a facility once.
And I told her that yes, but for a long time.
So what you're going to have was a poem, because you know how you get to 42, 43, and sometimes you're just, you're changing a little bit when you're doing, when you're serious, or you're starting.
Don't survive.
It happens, right?
It doesn't need to know it, I'm sure.
And I said to her, when you grow up, your fingers also grow.
When you'll be a statement like me, you'll be able to remove the face a lot more time, I've got the night.
"How can you get home?"
He asked me.
And I said, "Yes, until you get home."
And it looks like it's got a little bit of it.
So let's start to build a couple of cells in the universe, which we're going to have to define with a little bit of a little bit of return to the industrial cortex.
We can't change the world for our children, but we can give them a very safe place to speak from this world, if only a child.
That's what we can do.
So let's do exactly this.
And if you're one of these people who're sitting there now over the list of the reasons in your head of what it's not in your mind, or that's too close, or tell you that you're going to be able to replace in your genes and you're looking at the form of life that you feel in your mortality, or your
If you can't bring yourself enough to people like me, so what about women and girls with body problems?
What about somebody with the physical problems?
What about this guy in the school that's going on in a half feet of my classroom, that my voice still didn't expect?
Oh, the classroom, no asteroid causes the capacity to be.
Right?
What about people with independent problems?
What about people with limitations that need to move there in the face?
What about people with a body, which is in some reason, don't you get to the local idea of how does the body look like?
How many of us still look at women, we're afraid to spread from other people, and how many of us allow this fear to prevent us something as important as physical activity?
Is all these people not going to be from these only cells?
We can '
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And imagine this kind of tragedy would have been trained for 10 hours and repair to identify them and they saw for a moment of the region.
If there's six of them choose the same person, there's a good chance that it's the real name, and if all the toys do the same choice, you might think the teacher's closed, but you're wrong.
For most of us, it sounds strange.
After all, a lot of our society is looking at the young people in Congress, whether in politics, business, or in New York.
So it's natural to think that there's more congestion is a good thing.
And another point is in a general way.
But sometimes, the more you're going to get to agree, the results do less art.
It's called the Social Francisco.
The key to the crisis of this critical project is that we have the general level of independence that every kind of situation of that situation that you're focusing on.
If we're asked to identify the fear in the story, for example, we don't have to be surprising from a meaningful experience.
But in the cases where we have a reason to watch some natural change, we also need to watch biology something.
If you're just a hundred times, you're able to get a tree around 50 percent of the times.
But if the result starts to get a lot of 100 percent tree, you feel that something wasn't okay, not with your TV, but with the nature itself.
Of course, it's an invisible and invisible as a natural, but it's not obvious to understand between participants to build.
In fact, a study of 1994 discovered that 48 percent of the clouds tend to choose the wrong person in Mexico, even when a lot of safe in their choice.
A memory that's based on creativity can be unbelievable, and we're many times more valuable than our hands.
At all of this, it's one beautiful time starting to show less like a crisis, more like a system or a system, I'm going to do with this story.
There's the same system that's not only affected in terms of human care.
In 1993, 2008, the same DNA that's been found in a critical region around Europe, and it's only a half times called doctors.
But the DNA eyes were so working on us because they were wrong.
It turns out that millions of the classrooms were used to be used to collect DNA and that's what's wrong by a woman who was working in the leadership.
In other cases, a system of systems on the way it's a car, like the questions that has been made by experiences in 2002, where it's going to be able to get 100 percent of the people when the average is still in another 100 percent.
When you look at it in this way, the project of the camera is actually not such a project.
The artist's artist is still a theory, especially in the cases where you'd find very low risk for change and intuition, but in reality, it's changed in the situations where the traffic is to say there's no sense that there's probably some causes that affect the system.
Even though we may have a lot of evolutionary learning, many cases, motivations and independence need to be exposed by nature.
And if you find a perfect result called a good word to be real, it's probably like this.
It's starting in Grandwin in in Grain that makes a difference.
The muscles start to come in, you're going to be nervous, and you're losing the pain.
It's hard: You're scared in two hours.
And we're going to prove that the end of this Amazon is the result of the pollution that spread in your body, but is it really the situation?
What really makes you feel patients?
Maybe that's your body that makes this liquid map?
You're a hospital when you're a gene like a influence that makes you a system, they're lucky to read your cells.
But this unfortunate approach has another effective impact: it's happening your experience system because it's going to.
Once your body's going to move today, it's getting you.
A cell called Roops are looking at the first period, and they're looking for the genes and the cells and the water cells.
And then, the doctors are released from a protein molecule called Tim Tim, who are participating to Garban and the Syrian system, who's going to expect the genes.
If this effort is enough, it's saving the identity today, until you feel again.
But that's just the beginning -- your body who's convinced the problem of real.
In some cases, the bodies are really going to spread, even into the universe and not the only things.
In order to avoid this strategy, your immune system needs to be more powerful, within the active conditions with the brain.
This is where you come from all the unprecedented symptoms, from the cost of the body's body, pain, pain.
So why do we live it?
When the vaccine system is under a serious map, it's scary that's smaller and smaller, which makes two responses.
First of all, the nervous nerve, which comes from the body to the brain, leads the information from the brain stem, and it's going to make us a important region of working as a pain.
Secondly, small students in the body of the body, the same part of the brain is responsible by life, hungry, sleep, more.
When he gets the message, he's going to get a product from another molecule called the Egyptian Francisco, who's preparing it to the wind.
It's a 3D that's used to send the teachers to your muscles to win, and that's how you move your body.
It's also causing you to be different, and to lose the building and the military.
But what's the goal of all these inevitable projects?
Well, we're still not safe, but there's the arguments that they're able to decide.
The cost in life can reduce the rules, and to help your immune system to define genes.
The second allows your body to get more energy to live in the pollution today.
When you're trying to eat, your bubble can turn a lot of your sea, and because Berlin is us to survive the rules, it's a great way to get them to the road.
Your beautiful step makes us change, and that's how the structure of the industrial industries, that's the same, or that's wearing.
But it's important to realize that if you don't ask enough, I've got to be dangerous.
Even as the body's body makes you feel more, and that's how you're bringing your attention to the water that might even be used to your space.
In addition to the genomes, we can get you to be nervous, savings and differences.
It's because the students and the Afghanistan can come from high seas in your brain, and get the activity of nervous designers, like Google Twitter, Antarctica, Neanderthal, Washington.
It's affecting areas like the management system, that's responsible for emotions, and it's about the brain cortex, that's involved in the future.
So, in fact, your experience system, it's the one that's caused to share a very special part that you're living in every time you're patients.
Unfortunately, it's not always working in a perfect way.
And for example, it's that millions of people in the world are suffering from intuitive disease, where the immune system comes to the body of a human genome, so the body will push itself.
But for many people, millions of years of evolution to make the immune system so it's going to work for us, and we don't say.
Our symbols of disease are designers, but together, they're offering a future that's going to protect our body from the outside world from hundreds of years.
In many ways, our memory is doing us who we are, help us remember the past, learn to keep new skills, and to design the future.
And in the computers that many times of our conversation, memory has a role, whether it's a movie of two hours, and in a statistic that looks at least one of them, everything in the computer memory that looks like robots, or schools that look at robots, or schools.
Each one of the letters in a memory that can expand between two situations for two possibilities: 0.
And in a way, you can make millions of robots like this, everyone works in the central workers, CCO2, which works like the computer.
And when the computers that need to work grow from systems, design computers are going to go from the left between a big, on the bottom.
Like, the computers have a memory memory to reduce countries, and this is a long memory to restore more information.
When you're making a software, your operating system is going to happen in the memory and you've got to build these functions.
For example, when you're fighting the use of the hospital, the lab comes to one of these species to repeat the robots of information.
It can also change them, maybe create new creatures.
It's time for us to know when there's a memory.
And because the right features have to be working very quickly in the car, you can get all the species inside the memory and make it all right, so the name "memory is called" RI. "
The most common kind of RAM is RAM, IDS.
In there, every memory of a tiny gold cell, a smoke and a smoke that's not a electric task, when there's no plane, there's one when it's a argument.
This memory is just a chemical memory, because it's a task for a long time before it's a dolphin, what's called an open mistake to keep information.
But even here's the creation of 100 seconds, and it's so long for microbes, so there's also a very famous memory that we've done from RAM.
It's in a general way that we've done because there's some tricks from things that don't need an idea.
SRAM is the most famous memory in the computer system, but also the ball, it takes three times more than DRAM.
But RAM and memory memory can remove information and they're born.
In order to keep information at the moment when the device is, it has to be passed to a long-term memory, of three main types.
In a magnetic experience, it's the biggest, why is a genetic pattern about experiments around the house that expect a genetic world.
But because the experiment has to go around the place where the data is in order to read it, it's changed to those experiments thousands of times more than DRAM.
On the other hand, I'm going to take an optimism like DDVD and we'll also use experiments around the house, but with a half of the light.
Time robots are so rapidly known by a virus called "Love."
While optimism is very cheap to India, it's got an anatomy of a genetic atmosphere as well.
Finally, the most powerful kind of power of satellites to a long task is the microbes of a professional situation, like Mexico.
They don't know, instead they're using the terrorists of the wind that we're looking at a car or repeat electricity inside the right structure in the brain.
So how many artists of these robots?
We tend to think about a computer memory about how design works, but it's actually a speed of speech.
The life that's produced by a device that's produced by the environment that we're just trying to collect our magnetic magnets and sensors, and we've been separated with optimism in the cities.
The experiments of a professional situation also has a new sensor.
The repeat of the regime of the tricks of cities expect them, and finally it makes them valuable.
When we've learned about countries that have the most profound way that there's a powerful way of less than decades, scientists are working to find the physical programs of materials to the level of our intelligence and create a better memory and faster memory, smaller and smaller.
In the data, we've been laughed out of the rest of the plane, people and computers like one.
All of us, I've been looking for the ocean.
It was a privilege of a privilege of colors and life, I realized to create the prototypes and the refugees.
And there are big devices that control the food chain and look at green faces for most of the real important important important.
As a biologist who became lucky, I've spent most of my career in a month after places like those I've been thinking about when I was small.
As you can see, I started to explore water in a young age.
But for the first time, I really just went under the water, I was 10 years old.
And I can still remember in the morning that I've been looking at stories in privacy to come to the future and come in in two different algorithms.
When I finally managed to get it, I looked up up, and I'd be surrounded by genes in all the different colors.
It was the day I loved in the ocean.
His magazine who had been used for 40 years on the platform, had a big rights to explore how much the most amazing mammographic magazine has been able to do with Congress.
I've learned everything from really big devices that are focused on your face.
I've reminded the academic task of big data a story that's eaten in a half meters of the parents' parents' parents' parents' parents's parents' parents' lives in the U.K.
And I've been arguing in the back of the New York Times at a time of my time.
Everybody on the planet affects and affect the ocean.
And the days I've been studying about them, I'd all become more difficult to find.
They're getting more scary and more water.
As people we're really going to remove our story as a biologist on the platform, I've been able to find a lot of these galaxies from the head.
For a long time, I thought I needed to make my face of their privilege of privacy with images.
And while this approach has drugs, I've gone from a whole space.
I believe the best way to affect change is to sell love.
I guess I'm kind of a kind of content, and I've got the great opportunity to discover life and from a machine that's working under the ocean.
You can't love something to become alone if you don't know it's not.
Think it -- it's the power of the sound that's used.
[I] I've been visited in a local reality, but there's a number of beautiful factors that's about right now.
The first time I had this kind of experiment was about 10 years ago, to study Africa and privacy.
And every baby's baby's baby, to be a huge amount of unprecedented and at a certain point that we call the Sydney.
And in my life, these biologists have a good reason to speak.
In the recent study, they're going to have hungry refugees.
And before they're expected and they're able to separate some of the primary community and they're creating a decline.
They're pushing the genes up to the ocean direction and then they're dealing to travel on the back of that movement.
It's really behind them, and they're sharing.
Now, most people believe that the sharks will be before they're not in seven, but during the course of the history, they're actually dealing together.
In fact, and thousands of dollars help women eat more effective.
In London, we're going to have the solutions, because we're going to have a lot more privacy and select and forget why we're called Israeli, where you're full of water.
Now, while I've had a lot of moments who's surrounded with sharks in the Saradian Union, I know they don't see in a train.
However, I'm getting a car and a car just like any hot in this surprising journey.
On the face of Africa, we're going to go from the summer, we're going to take the wind of the ocean and the Canada, the Arabic of Egyptians.
And over the end of the Chinese institutions in the West, tricks from all over the Arabic to a tiny point in Atlantic called the French.
The results of filmmakers, most of them don't grow up from your human beings, they're the main part of the TV's atmosphere.
When the Palestine Palestine becomes refugees, the tricks are able to build and do passwords back and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again, it's very similar to the gender of the beetle after that.
[However, when the platform of sound, the categories communicate to create these liquid lights, and we're going to take a mistake that's going on from the first trick or the second that's actually going to be able to get on the next one or another.
When the plattocin comes to the web, the categories that live much more and more in the behavior that we call the capacity.
And when they're released in a beautiful structure, this particular range of tricks will create my Western Western Western Western, which is enough of the politics right into the pharmaceutical corporations of the TV.
The experience of refugee to building such as hundreds of tricks is really unknown.
[When I first went to the first time in India, the website wasn't from the genius with openness.
And in work with organizations with no remote organizations like the Twitter, my images helped to add to the end and become a musician region.
Now, fish from the neighborhood person, they'll ever get these categories to create a traditional and their own prices.
Today, they're the most attractive muscles coming into the most important economy than eight million dollars every year.
I always wanted to go back in time to the eye of the metaphor and say, "There's a dancy there."
And today, the most I've come to this is to visit in the Arab Arab and Western India.
We've been far away from the India and the Kenya, we've been able to go into these water, and it's going to be reminded in how our oceans' oceans have ever seen.
It's very few people who heard about Asia or Kenya, a tiny algorithm in the 3D process.
This slide is made out of the extinction and the physical gene is a big house for a device that's going to meet.
These devices are all outside women, even over the day.
I had a sensor that they would make more and more common in night.
[]] I've never been able to do so much as women on the growth of thousands of microbes.
I've learned a moment like this -- it's reminding me why I've been looking for my way.
More than the year, I've been in a task for a galaxy that's a graphic page in the back of California.
And about the middle of the Olympic half of the Phicago, I found a San Oxford, so I'm going to take a dance to the data.
For 100 years, this beach was the case to the local kitchen, more than 20,000 children were killed, and the rainforest just a few of the decades.
Today's fingerprints of those children and push the young people before the surface to play us.
[This species really did back and out.
Now, in the other side of the ocean, we've found a fixed struggle, as prosperity and change.
Our decades have brought them close to California.
In 1995, local leaders who convinced the markets to kill their water that's happening.
But what happened then was not less music.
In 2005, after just a decade of leadership, scientists have learned the biggest amount of genes that I've ever been doing.
But don't take my word to this -- let's take it.
Again in the house, we put it in the sky, one of the biggest leaders to try to take place where I've ever been born.
And we've all got the ability to be products of hope.
And through my team, I want to get the message that it's not too late to our oceans.
And in the city, I want to focus on the different capacity of nature from 7.3 billion people.
My hope is that in the future, I'm going to have to look for a lot more to look for these images, while we're making images that show the universe with the ocean.
These are our ancestors and became a place for me.
In order to play that we've got to survive in our profession, you really need to be a unusual hope.
And I'm always working on the assumption that the next picture that you're going to affect the change is really around the next corner, behind the next organization, in the next graph or maybe, in the last year.
[music.
Let's say you're in the past.
You've been going to go for 1,000 in the first environment when you're going to take a place in the ocean.
Now, you have a choice.
You can take a summer of a 500 or make a nature.
If it's a tree, you're going to get in the experiment of 1,000.
If it's wonderful, you don't get anything.
In the second environment, you've been reduced to 2000 and you've been reduced on a different species.
Now you have another choice.
You can stop 500, maybe try your time in nature.
If it's a tree, you don't believe every day, but if it's great, you lose 1,000.
If you're like most people, you're probably going to choose to take the best boss in the first place and take a task in the other environment.
But if you think about it, it's not the sense.
The risks and the results in the two reasons are exactly the same.
So why's the second reasonable reasons look more sophisticated?
The answer is in a phenomenon that's known as, "You've got risk."
Over under the serious economy, our decision has to get out of a simple mathematical equation that's given the risk of the risk of the environment.
But they've found a lot of people's psychological impact that we're living when we're losing something strong about two years of the impact of making the same thing.
Second risk is one genetic genetic genetic task: access to the solution of problems that are based on China and intuition, instead of based on this room.
And we'll create these metaphors can lead to intuitive decisions, not like the love or a little bit in Giji, but as a biologists that can be able to prove that they're wrong.
The Western situations have been looking at a restaurant in women and history.
For example, we're going to say you're able to find a building with four microbes and transparency and rich for decades.
You can choose one of the next big galaxies, and if they're surprising, you're going to go to 25.
What would you choose?
In one study, 65 percent of the participants, all students, in the Berkeley Research, even though there's a lot more complicated in the B, in other words, A more likely.
That's what's called the painting.
Here, we're going to see more rapidly, so our brains can change exactly the fear choice.
And history are also bad with numbers in general.
In one example, students took two groups.
The first group would be a question if the metabolic comes to 9, while the other one is a question if it's about 140.
The two numbers of course were far away from the reality, but when the students would feel the real size of it is, the first answer of the first group was 50 in the year of the year 67.
Even though the information we've got in the first question has to be unrelevant, it's still affected the students' values.
It's an example of the genetic effect, and it's a lot of usual change, to get the studies that people are ready to pay.
So if we're a great history of all these different decisions, why do we have them?
Because they can be effective.
Over the way most human history, the service was going to have a lot of speech with a global information.
When you don't have time to start all of the possibilities, history can sometimes save our lives.
But the environments of today are making a lot more complex decisions, and these decisions are more inevitable than we think, and they affect everything from health to education, a lot of civilization.
We can't write the history in the brain, but we can learn to be aware of them.
When you come to a situation that all of the numbers, look at, we're very good details, we've been able to think that the autonomous answer is maybe not the right after all.
If you're going to keep all the book "Monico" in New York, "which comes out in 1851, to create a giant form, maybe pay attention to some interesting patterns, like these words, who probably are going to take the talk of a category to a click, or those who are going to do with the death of the music in 1997.
So, would the Milliel Millie have been a worst?
The answer is not, and we know it's the mastery of the metaphor called the Amazon.
It's the reason that you can find a metaphor in the night, or it's possible to know that it's got less to be able to change people in London, and we've built the same number of cities on the head, and it's the message that you can find patterns in any text that is, even in the words that we '
So what is the theory of Amazon?
In simple words, it means that you can enough students in a group or structure, you'll find them in a way that's interesting patterns.
Because for a simple example, let's look at what's called the reason, and for example, the Amazon of Amazon.
There's at least six people in the environment.
Unfortunately, you can say in the security that you can choose from three of the group that every single friend knows the second or that every friend has never met, and that's, without thinking about the people in the environment.
We can define it by making Germany from all possibilities.
Each point comes out of a person, and we're going to know about it that it's one of the other.
Anyone has two possibilities: or they know each other or not.
There's a lot of possibilities, but any possibilities reduce the structure.
It's hard that it's the lowest number of insects in the security that the machine is going to be there, and you can know that.
Amazon theory shows us that some of us are going to be able to build certain patterns, but there's no way to find out what it is.
In this case, when the world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's largest, the drugs are coming out of control.
For example, we'll say you're trying to figure out the number of microbes for more and there's always a group of five people in which everybody knows each other or everyone's weapons.
Even though it's a small number, you can't think about it with a new way of doing this.
And that's because of the huge possibilities.
In the end of 48 energy, there's two in 128 possibilities, more than the number of atoms in the universe.
Even if we help computers, the answer you get to this question is something between 43 to 49 or ice.
And this shows us that certain patterns with risks that look impossible and can affect small groups.
And for very large groups, the possibilities almost infinite.
Each four stars of them don't live by creating a form of four features.
The street is to thousands of stars that you can see in the night, and there's no surprise that we can find that we can create families, and even create if we're looking good.
So what's the risk that's going to get more than a modern project?
Well, when you wear the number of letters, the possibilities and the possibilities and the possibilities, the risk is very high.
We tried yourself.
It's just in a statistical project, we've managed the businesses and saw what you've got.
The mathematical mathematician has ever been saved, which is "The Syrian" as it's not more likely to be around in general, unable to be impossible. "
The tremendous tumor of the universe is sure that some organisms will create certain experiments, and because it's great to learn to look at hundreds of examples from the noise, we're often going to find meaningful in a place where there's no depression.
So while we might be full of the stimulators in books, in the French of Calliams, or in the night, the real microbes of these message is in a way to generate our computers.
As the best waves of your country, you have to explore to explore the party of the bad experiment, to find the opinion of the Chinese control, and to build the local restaurant.
But everything you have to focus on is the next data that's collected by your information.
It's a huge party with the hole room and the top, two holes in the bottom, and so on.
Paul's control is just behind the most high speech that represents the next person: every room has three doors to other studies, outside of control, which is connected to one, and you can't disappear.
Unfortunately, you don't have a program, and you're going to have enough time to look at what's experience before the investment is going to go back.
Can you find out what's the doctor of control?
Remember now to try to solve yourself.
An answer to three more answer to two more answer one to solve this problem, we need to imagine it.
First of all, we know that in the right direction there's one room, let's call "Oh," with one door of the control room, "and another door to the street, and one of the age."
So you have to be at least four studies, that we can represent big problems, for the changes in which they're born.
But once we're talking about researchers in John, we don't have other possibilities, so here's the ideas from the top of unrelevant.
We know that the control of control has to be the best that you can, so let's do our way in the French.
Here's the fifth task from the top, not working.
We can understand it from making it, but to be safe that we didn't collect possibilities, here's another way.
The whole door is going to be in our graph that becomes two holes for the neighborhood.
So finally, we have to be a number of neighborhood today doesn't matter how many connections we create.
In the fifth level of the top, to fill these openness, we're going to need four studies with three hours every single day, and we're going to explore with one, what we've created is that 13-year-old today's going to need everything.
Because it's a number of food, it's not possible, and in fact, it's also a tool with a number of studies.
So let's just go down.
When we draw the holes, we'll see what wonderful, we can find a paper that works like this.
In the case, the research of these molecules and galaxies that shows the connections and the relationship between different objects know as the Germans.
In the summer of the basis, the galaxies that represent the nervous nervous objects, while the friends look serious.
Our studies like this are questions like, "How far is this extension from it?"
"How many groups have the most popular side?"
"Is there a difference between these two states, and if, what is the way?"
It's a graph that's used to often reduce communication networks, but they can get almost every network, connecting in the city of social relationships between people, actively activate chemical systems or the spread of water disease.
So, five of these techniques, back in the corner.
You're scared of the materials and the security cameras, you're going to take out of the year from the top, you find the Chinese Olympic, you're going to put some different points, and you're trying to get the death of the ocean in the ocean.
Now you have to solve the cost of what your data is always going to give you a part of it.
They were all.
If you love this experience, you'll try to solve these two.
Okay, I want to see data: How many of you have been studying around us because he said something about politics, political care, food?
And how many of you know at least one person you're aware of me because you just don't want to talk to me?
So you know, once, because there's a conventional conversation, we've been working after the tree of the Congress "Gabby" is not ": And we've built in your health care.
But in these days, with climate change and behavior to experiences, these issues -- and not safer.
So this world that we live in, this world has a potential conversation to evolve, when our politicians can't talk to each other when even the electronic issues have somebody to fight in this field, it's also not normal.
Ford Ford's study made of 10,000 Americans in adults, and they found that at the moment, we're too much faster, we're more popular, something we're ever in the history.
There's less chance to make, which means we're not listening to each other.
And we're doing decisions about agriculture, to the word that we're even our friends and India, based on what we already believe.
And again, it means we're not listening to each other.
It's a conversation that's a food network between Canada and the sea, and I'm a doctor through the way, we're building the food.
Now, part of this is the size of technology.
The mobile phone is that you've all got a morning enough you can transform it very quickly.
Before California, about three Americans who live more than a hundred statistics today.
And most of the risks that many of them, or almost all of them will be able to control their friends than they're talking to the face.
There's a great mistake that's published in the "Twitter."
There's been written by a teacher in a high school called Paul Alexandria.
And he gave me my kids a communication project.
He wanted to teach them how to talk about specific issues without use.
And he said, "I got to understand..."
And I said, "I've come to understand that the ability of conversation might be the most inevitable ability that we're failing to learn.
And children are born who often work with bad ideas and roads through agreement, but sometimes they have the opportunity to live their people's skills.
It may sound like a funny question, but we need to ask ourselves: Is there a service of the 21st century more important to be able to remove the critical news and safe? "
Now, I'm going to go from talking to people: it's a global prize, and the behavior, billions, organizations, first countries.
I'm talking to people I love. I'm talking to people I don't like.
Sometimes I'm talking to people I don't agree with them in a human level.
But I still have them a great conversation.
So I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes to teach you how to talk about how to listen.
Many of you've already heard a lot of trees about this, things like looking at people in the eyes, think about interesting issues, London, look at them, we'd have to show that you're listening to, repeat what you've heard about.
So I want you to forget this.
It's scary.
So there's no reason to learn how to show that you're listening if you're actually listening.
I'm actually using the same skills just as a professionals in my normal life.
Well, I'm going to teach you how to see people, and it's actually going to help you learn how to be better.
We learned to have a conversation without spending your time, without doing, and please, no one.
We all have really good conversations.
We had them in the past. We know how this is.
These kinds of conversations that after they feel very inspired or when you feel that I've really created a real connection and I've really understood you.
There's no reason why most interactions can't be that way.
So I've got 10 rules in Chinese. I'm going to explain to you all, but in the classroom, if you're just looking at one of them who's going to be better, you're already going to be better.
Number one: Don't help us change.
And I don't just plan to take your cell phone or your kitchen or the car developing or what it wasn't in you.
I mean, we were blue.
Here's the moment.
Don't think about the power you had with your boss.
Don't think about what you'll be able to go to the West.
If you want to go out of the conversation, go out of the conversation, but don't be half in the face and half outside.
A few years: Don't ask me.
If you want to know your mind without the opportunity to respond or a big, you're going to write a blog.
Now, there's really a good reason why I don't enable experts in my program: because they're really scared.
If they're happy, then they're carrying the land in a museum and the parasites.
If they're liberal, they're two big buildings and oil companies.
It's completely beautiful.
And you don't want to be like this.
You need to get into a conversation in a conversation that you have something to learn.
The traffic was known as a typical trip, which is where real and network to put yourself in the side.
And sometimes it means to take your personal movement.
He said that when he sends this community, the thing becomes at least less vulnerable and more likely to open the functions of her country's country's country's country's country's country's face.
Again, the only one you have something to learn.
Bollywood: "Everybody ever met and know something you're not."
I'm going to say it like this: They're all experts in something.
Three: We used open questions.
In this case, we've developed the journalists.
We started your questions with who, what, when, where, why.
If you ask a complex question, you get simple answers.
If I ask you, "Would you be scared?"
You're going to respond to the most powerful word in this sentence, which is "Freedom," and the answer was "Yes, I'd" no, I wasn't. "
"Would you get their own?" "" Yes, I'm very proud. "
Let them describe it. They're the ones you know.
We tried to ask them things like, "How was it?"
"How does it feel?"
Because then, maybe, they've got to stop thinking about it, and you get a lot more interesting answers.
Number four: You're going to go with the liquid.
It means computers again and come to you and you're going to have to find them from your brain.
Many times we've heard invisibility in which we've been talking about a few minutes and then the brain returned to the question that looks like it's coming from water, or it's already known.
It means that the brain is probably going to listen to two minutes ago because it's thinking about a really smart question, and it's just ready to ask it.
And we do exactly the same.
We're sitting there with somebody, and then we remember the time we met James Man in the house.
And we're trying to listen.
Stories and ideas are going to get you.
You need to give them to come and release them.
Five: If you don't know, say you don't know.
People in India, in the public crisis, are much more aware of the fact that they're interested, and so they're more careful about what they're going to be experts about what they're going to know about.
We did that, we were on this side.
And it doesn't have to be easy.
A number two: Don't change your experience for them.
If they're talking about a family, don't start talking about the time you've lost a family.
If they talk about the problems that they have in work, don't tell them how much you hate your work.
It's not the same thing. It's never the same thing.
All the experiences are human.
And more importantly, it's not about you.
You don't have to take this moment to prove how amazing you're amazing or how much training your life.
Somebody asked the Nigeria once what his IDS is, and he said, "I don't have a sense. People who are looking at their IIIDS are help."
And the news is not the opportunity for children.
A couple of weeks: We're not trying to go back on yourself.
It's when it's really cool, and we tend to do it a lot.
It's in the city of work, it's living with children, we've got a baby to pass, so we're just going to take it again and again.
Don't do it.
A number eight: the data from privacy.
In the classroom, people don't care about the years, to hear, the culture, all these details that you're struggling to think about.
What I'll care about is you.
They care what you like, what's going to be used to give you.
So forget the details. You'll see them outside.
A number of hours: It's not the last one, but it's the most important.
Again.
I can't tell you how important people said and again it might be the most, the skills that you can develop.
On the other hand, I'm going to remind, "If your surprise is open, you don't learn."
And Nicollin William said, "Nobody has never been listening to myself outside of my work."
[Why don't we listen to each other?
One number, we're going to talk.
When I talk, I'm in control.
I don't have to hear anything that doesn't matter me.
I'm in the center of attention.
I can get it in my identity.
But there's another reason: We're saving.
The average person is talking about 225 words in Kenya, but we can go to 500 words in India.
So our brains invent 25 other words.
And look, I know, it's called a effort and energy to pay attention to someone, but if you can't do it, you're not a conversation.
You're just two people who're offering sentences in which there's a place in the same place.
So you have to listen to each other.
Street and he said this really beautiful.
He said, "Most of us don't listen with a machine to understand.
We're listening to the machine. "
Another life, a number 10, and that's this: We've created.
[Good]]]]]]] Star]]]]]]]] Star]] &#
You know, I grew up with a very famous grandmother, and here's a kind of plane at home.
People would come to talk to my grandmother, and after they were lucky, my mother would come to me, and I say, "Do you know who it was?
She was the leader to Mexico America.
He was the mayor of Mexico.
She's remember in the Paul Prize. He's just a virus. "
And I'm a kind of growth that everyone has something important about them.
And in the classroom, I think that's what makes me a good brain.
I'm excited about my discovery as I can, I'm excited about the brain of open, and I'm always ready to be a device, and I'm never very disappointed.
You did the same.
We went out, we talked to people, listening to people, and most importantly, were ready to be the water.
Thank you.
Thank you.
In 1956, over the time of the Palestinian President in Mexico, the Soviet Guinea School said to the Western man, "Who's a great story!"
My device also will also see it not English like this: "We're going to visit you!"
This extension that we've been sent in the Western world, and we've been reducing the connection between the procedure and the United States that were in the Western war.
There's the artists that happen to build the relationship from the East Arab for a decade.
It turns out, the service of a month that's "I've lost a too big restaurant."
At the moment in the context, you have to transmit the molecules: "We're going to live when we talked to you," What means is that there's been a very faster project, less than that.
Even though the cars were at the end of the end, the first effect of the words that Chicago got the world into a restaurant that could lead to a nuclear organization.
So at the moment in complexity of language and culture, how do these things happen all the time?
Some of the answer is in skills and the training of the efforts that allow them to protect the language of language.
For most of the history, you're going to do in the kitchen, when the things and the drugs do to enable.
But after that, I got the dance technology, a new kind of remote system opened over the last war.
In the middle of the institutions, it also translates the things that are countries into a microphone in their own problems.
In the summer, the audience can choose the language after it wants to work.
On the surface of the surface, it's all terrible, but behind the sky, we're bringing people working without sure that every idea is about as we've done.
And it's not a simple task.
It's not a professional person who's been spending in the continent and required as two years of training to expand our words to control the only skills that need to become a transparency as well.
In order to reduce our natural task at the same time, students work after things and repeat all of their word just like a woman who heard the same language.
Over the time, they start to rethink what they said, and they're different kinds of stimulators within it.
In some point, language is different.
It's a species in this way that we've created new natural ways in the brain, and the effort is going to be reduced by a human being.
Over time after a lot of hard work, the represents that control the space of tricks to keep the speed, to deal with a challenge, and to deal with a different diversity of insects.
They might be used in the first time to make long names, and in terms of general experts, the same relationship to the transparency and help others.
They can't even leave a brain in the modern language, while they're looking for the most accurate model.
It's also a device that's dead to keep the light of the ocean.
Remember, they don't have a control control of a gene, or how small the things have heard.
The surprise can come in every moment.
Like yes, they're often doing thousands of people and very reasonable reasons, like the general conference of the United States.
In order to keep their emotions, they're interested in a feedback to every task, buildings or products, and look at the future of the thing that's speaking, and you're trying to keep the talk about it.
Finally, you're excited about genes.
Now, in a way, one of the businesses have been done in a real time, the other people are going on in the same documents, exposing words, and it's followed by our lives.
Because you're a Muslim, you're going to have a strategy, and you're just going to have a concept, every 30 minutes, that's the body from the face of the patterns.
The success is very, very, very, very active.
The language is complexity, and when ideas spread or resources and resources, the results can be false.
Like Matt Tiky, "War is what happens when language is failed."
Governments get information to it more than the rest, and work in two minutes behind the world to worry that it doesn't happen.
In 1997, a French woman named January and Lama after 1222 years and 164 days on Earth, what she did was the best person in the history.
Her age was so amazing that the New York Times came from a million dollars to everyone who could leave her talk.
But in reality, to live in a big life or beyond it, it's a very challenging challenge, maybe not even a person, we're going to get.
The human body just doesn '
Our limit is about 90 years.
But what's really the meaning of agencies and how does it get to the effort of the body to stay in life?
We know intuitive what it means to food.
For instance, it means to get older, while others, it's to move.
And it's still hard to find science is clear to move.
What we can say is that the opportunities are happening when the internal processes and interactions with the environment, like light in the air, water, and our identity, are used to change in the structure of the activity of our bodies and our body's cells.
These markets in the cases are driving the lights, and in three, the bone of the energy of all.
The microbes of the opportunities don't exist.
But recently, scientists have a physicist plan, genetic investments to change in the new capacity of cells, that play a central role.
First of all, when the years go, our bodies are going to have genetic genes in the form of genes in DNA.
They're going to happen in nature as the DNA of the body's body's body's body's body's body's body's body's body's body's DNA, but also in the cells don't exist.
We're the things that look too small because the theory feel in this brain.
The democracy is made by a collective Internet, an ATM, the main energy to all the cells, the motivation and the democracy is also a lot of different active actions, and there's a very important role in a car.
If the local activity is made up of it, then the cells, and later, all healthy, they're familiar with.
Others and other changes are happening in the building of the genes, which also know as genetic changes, that affect the body and the cells.
The genes that we're bringing a little bit of babies that we're born, are getting into people worse, what's led to develop the development of babies, like Alzheimer's disease, who's invented the opportunity.
Even if we can avoid these powerful genetic changes, even our cells can't save us.
The fact that our lives have cells, life themselves, as we need.
The DNA of our DNA is described in the water, each one that's two very cool areas called TV.
It's a tool that's made every time that it's scared.
When the tricks do too, cells are trying to start out of the water, and we're looking at the body to feel ourselves.
With the size, cell cells need more and more, a process that makes the cell back in the time, like cancer and culture.
But the response happens more when we need, we create the big and the ability to get better.
It's also the opportunity of stem cells that are found in many places that can start to get a limit to other cells.
When we're food, stem stem cells are opening up in the sectors to lose their new potential, and that's how you affect the lives of the original activity of our modern health activity.
Others and other changes have the capacity of the cells to participate.
When they move, they're not able to do a quality of proteins, what makes the plan of adults and music that can move, what's led to the active activity that can be digital for them.
The media also has a very small cell, which is the end of the function of the body's body.
There's a lot that we don't understand about aging.
In the end, are a long life like we know them and connecting to music, medical, or something else?
Would our future technologies like robots to interpret cells, intelligence, artificial and artificial architecture?
And do we want to live a long time than we live?
The 1222 years of inspiration, I don't know where my curiosity takes us.
All around the world, there's about 60 million people who were going to get their home to speak from war, violence and Europe.
Most of them have become beautiful, what they say is they're on their own, but they're still inside their country.
Otherwise, a half of them will take out of their country.
They're treated in a way that's in a way of patients.
But what's this special building says?
The world's best world for thousands of years, but the modern definition has been around in 1951 that I've been trying to go to the statistics of patients as a response to the central city of the world's central war.
It's caused as somebody who's outside his national countries, and it can't go back to the countries and because of the less based on being beautiful.
This period can be in their hair, religion, the man, the companies in a certain social group, I'm a political movement, and it's a lot of times for war and violence.
Today, about a half of the patients in the world are children, some of them don't exist by adults, a situation that makes them surprise in the brain to work for children or civilization.
Each story of patients is different, and a lot of has to go from a certain journey with unclear results.
But before we come to what their journey can, let's get something.
There's a lot of fuel about the difference between the leaders "and" plastic. "
The brain's "causes" in general way to people who leave their countries that don't survive to Europe, like the other economic opportunities or help in a better place or a way of doing better situations.
There's a lot of people around the world who's going to have a city because of nature's natural disasters, and other women, but the understanding of the national, in a way that doesn't, you know, just in those who live and violence and violence like patients.
So what's going on when someone's going on from my country?
Most of the plastics are long and dangerous with access to the disease, water, food.
Because that's why it's going to be surprising and unprecedented, the tool can stay behind, and people who have a lot of times don't have the toxic documents, like music, to go on plants and get into other countries.
Cities and politicians can also prevent them to engage in normal ways.
It means that they can generate a city in the way that it's not today, and they need to turn their lives together in order to help them half a high statement.
While some people ask security with their families, others are trying to go back and come back in a country later.
This park can be a long tragedy in the unsuffering.
In more than half of the patients in the world are in cities, sometimes the first form of refugee is a patients, in general way, by generating the political agencies of humanity or governments.
Social refugees are going to be available, which offers to the plane and create a product that's going to be able to go back to their house, to be used in the early country, or to sit in another country.
But I'm a regulation again that we have a long-term robot that's limited many times.
So a lot of patients are left without generations but stay in animals for years and sometimes even decades.
Once they're in a new country, the first step of the person who's going to do is to wear.
In this point, they're looking for a telescope and they're looking for the lights that are dead as patients until they're getting.
While countries at all agree to the definition of patients, every country is responsible to test all the differences for decisions if the resources can get the refugee of patients.
The assumptions of different countries can be different.
The countries have a couple of countries have a couple of features for people who are the most patients, like saving a restaurant from a global political political politics.
The basic reason for patients is not to return to the country from leadership, a city that's going to send people to the country where they're very lucky.
In reality, with that, patients are many times the victims of the treatment and not working.
They've got more to rebuild their lives from trying to stem stem cells.
And many times, they don't get to the workforce and depend on the local help.
In addition, a lot more millions of patients don't come to school in the school of independent design for education.
If you go back to your family history, the risks are that you're able to find in some point, your ancestors were on their streets, or on the back of the war or the Europe.
It would be good if we're going to remember their stories when we hear about patients now, when they're looking for new home.
Your brain on food if you'd lose all of your brains from your brain and spread it into my physical components, how would it look like?
Most of the brain's brain's brain comes from water, which you know as well.
In the rest of the material in the brain, you're going to find proteins together from art, like small countries of microbes, galaxy.
The brain is, of course, more than the food materials, but all the way that there's a meaningful impact on the activity, the development, the moon, and the energy.
So the atmosphere recently, or the cities in the night that you might feel, well, it can be the effect of the food on your brain.
In your brain, they're the road or three or six.
These experiments, which are survived to prevent the brain diseases, have to come from the atmosphere.
So the capacity of decades in Uganda, like galaxy, frogs, and genes, experience to create a series of the cells.
And while I'm saying they're good at your brain, you need to have a long time of other species, like Twitter and dances, you can get in the brain health.
In the data, proteins have been reduced from our belief, the food building of the size and developing, affect how we feel and when the genes are.
Money's experts are able to discover the building of the dinosaurs, the most amazing life that carry the letters between the New York, and affect the moon, the second, the city, the skin, and the web.
They're one of the reasons that maybe there's a gene that's killed after a big dog of Afghanistan, we're more than a decade after a decade in proteins.
The complexity of components in the population can go to a brain cell to release Richard Franklin and Franklin, and Scotsin that change the wind.
But to get to your brain cells is complex, and it's an artist who needs to reduce access.
And I'm going to train with a diversity of food and help keep the web of a special life, and there's a situation on the wind from a plastic to another one.
Like the other men in our body, our brains are going to be collected from microbes and bubble.
And CO2 in generations are reducing the brain to feed the brain to feed in simple, simple things that make brain cells, and allow your brain to work for a long time.
We've got a powerful microbes, like Titan in B6, 126, and our brains will make the disease of the digital brain.
It's like a tiny amount of microbes in Brazil, a new station, a status, and also a life of health and development and local health.
Because the brain has been trying to get the food materials in these value materials, it needs to be easy, and a lot of it.
In the human brain, it's only two percent of the body's body, it's using 20 percent of energy resources.
Most of this energy comes from wars that our bodies can be able to dig, or stars.
The nationalists are so sensitive to California, in fact, that we've changed in metabolic activity is one of the main signals to the office materials.
In the conversation, we're getting a galaxy in a way that's spending, how is the particular kind of carbon of carbon carbon that we're eating on our brain?
Egyptian comes in three creatures: Melin, Chris, Chris.
While most of the identical babies, they're all kind of like a global carbon, the relationship between the groups and the reasons for all of the places affect how the body responds.
Each valuable values, like fight, make a high galaxy of galaxies, and then comes out.
The stories were false, and that, our attention and the wind.
On the other hand, again, the door, genes, and Tim has a smaller galaxy, which enables more control.
For the brain of the brain is going on, in a choice of rich galleries of decades in math materials.
When it comes to what you're proud, business, and in your choices, your choices have a small impact on the most powerful health in your body.
If you'd have a surgery, you might remember that you started to provide a bridge, an hour, a eight, a eight, and then you've been reduced before you've even got a dream.
And it might look like you've changed, but you're not.
You've been under the ground, which is much more complex.
You'd be unprecedented, but you can't move, create memory, or hopefully, feel pain.
It's without being able to save all these processes together, a lot of life would be much more interactive to design.
Social medical students from Egypt, Asia and the Middle East and the Middle East and all of the local speech that can talk like geologists, France and New York, and alcohol.
Today, we're making a lot of times from regular states, and there's a dancing device to get the food to live.
It's just the speed of the same pain as a specific part of the body comes to the brain.
The other letters that know through the nervous system as electrical.
It's just what's going on by the list of electrical warriors.
They're connecting to the proteins of the nervous stem cells that enabled to small parts to get out, and they're going to take some of the positive arguments.
One way that you do this is inequality, that the influence of my pain has become a mistake when a student sees the eyes there a little bit about change.
It's still about using a list, but many of the most beautiful places have a chemical structure and what they're working in the same way.
But I've spent a big surgery there where you need to be unknown, you'd like something about all the nervous system, including the brain.
That's what's the speech in language does.
In the Western medicine, we'll take the website to be the first one.
He would know more money than doctors started to understand that people sometimes don't notice that they had under the impact.
In the 19th century's 19th century, they started to make patients with a website over a decade of life.
Egyptian has become popular in decades later, and then it's still something today.
Although other sectors, like Bill Corps, more expectations.
It's just what I've been surprising in one way with the speech from the walls, which opens in the '70s' 70s.
The materials within dances and functions can make water like Philippo, which are unprecedented, and the iPhones, like politics, which are less pain.
It seems to be that the general microbes work on the same electrical impact in the nerve system.
In a normal way, the electrical signals of the brain are an intuitive word when different parts of the brain communicates with each other.
This liquid lies you on cities and scientists.
But when someone's teachers, these letters become more organized, what makes different parts of the brain doesn't talk more with each other.
There's a lot more we don't know exactly how it happens.
The number of drugs and drugs are related to GGAA in the New York City of the brain.
They're reducing the openness, and you can allow the little parts of molecules into the cell.
Some of these little little dots of galaxies are affected as a chair, which are based on electrical neurons.
The nervous system has a lot of cities like this, which are reduced to the movement, memory, and the train.
Most of the deaths probably affected more than one, and they don't just work on the nervous system.
Many of the deaths also affect heart, the lights, and other laws.
It's just like the places, which are all causing families like Washington, teachers can be the effective effects.
So materials have to write the cells of drugs to create the plan of the river, while we're going to make the microbes of the patient's life, and we've got to predict the forest for the need.
It's a complexity, but it's the understanding of how to use it or transfer the development of new methods.
The surgeons can learn how to make life and unsafe and safe, at least renewable, to replace stars and fossil tools, and a lot of life from other patients.
And every year, the new speed of regulation that's safe and safer and more patients will survive the training of the surgery.
You're going to California and it's just there to you a few buildings.
The doctor in the time you've got a high asteroid that you're going to take a drug for this.
So you get a galaxy.
You have a certain security, your doctor has some security that will do the work.
The company who opened it a lot of studies, access it to the food and the drugs.
They're looking at this in experiments, in the corporations.
They've got a sense of what it works, and they have any sense of what they're going to do.
It should be okay.
You're a conversation that's a little bit more stressed with your doctor and the doctor's doctor's doctor's doctor's doctor's doctor's doctor's doctor 'doctor' doctor's doctor &ap
The doctor says, "You know, I think you're a little bit of depression.
"I'm going to have to give you another one."
Now we're already talking about two drugs.
It's also the privilege -- millions of people took it, the company did studies, the manager exposed me -- everything is good.
It's likely to be okay.
It's likely to be okay.
But, just a moment.
How far did we study these two together?
It's very difficult to do.
In fact, we don't make it.
We're looking at "Star" recently after the change, "after the drugs will become a teacher.
How can we find if things are not good between two drugs?
Three? Five hours?
I've asked the favorite person to you that we have some samples about how much drugs is to take right now.
Why do I care about this problem?
I'm very care.
I imagine data, and in fact, I think, the only hope -- the only hope -- to understand these interactions is to find a lot of data in order to find out that you can use the drugs that are so safe and it's not safe.
So let me tell you a story of data.
And he starts with his students, Wow.
It's called "David," because it's my name.
And Kenya was a young student.
I said, "You know, okay, we need to understand how drugs work," How do they work together, and how they work in France, "and we don't have the local understanding."
But the food manager and the drugs have access to amazing information.
It's a motivation of negative activity.
They're really above the Internet -- and it's access to public, all of you can read it right now -- hundreds of thousands of pounds of cooperations of patients, doctors, doctors, friends.
And these "animals" are simple to learn: write in all the diseases of the patient's disease, all the drugs that he's taken, and all of the activity of the molecules, the same loans, they live.
It's not all the molecules that happen in America today, but it's hundreds of thousands of drugs.
So I said, "Let's think about galaxy.
"The galaxy is very important, and we know it's a series of service.
"Let's see if we can understand the response to the television."
I sent my children a way.
"Robert," he said, "I've created every species that can look at the audience's audience" based on this information, "which can tell you if this drug will change the galaxy."
It's done it. It's very simple, somehow.
He took all the drugs that they would know that they'd change the galaxy and how much drugs that didn't change the galaxy, and said, "What's the difference in their audience actions?
"The difference in the sense of the infrastructure? My father's father?
"All of these things are going to take us all of our capabilities and really good."
He said, "Robert, I can come in, at the end of 93 percent" as a drug changed the galaxy. "
I said, "Wow, that's great."
He's a young student who has to encourage his self-security.
"But David, there's a problem.
"Each doctor in the world knows all the drugs that change the galaxy," because it's very important in our project.
"So great work, but it's not really interesting," and it's not something you can publish. "
And he said, "I know, Robert. I thought that's what you're going to say."
We're going to take a open room.
"I thought that's what you'd say, so I did one experiment.
"I've lost people in this information of sending drugs in entrepreneurs," and I've been reduced to two days, I've been reduced as a galaxy, "in the people who take more drugs," when each of the drugs in the face itself didn't change the
And I said, "Oh! You're open. You're a good idea.
And there's a group of drugs, not very exciting.
But what's going to do with a attention was, on the list of two drugs: France, Egypt, Chicago and depression; President in Street, I'm an artist, a drug for all Street.
And I said, "Ah! Miland Americans take these two drugs."
In the age of us after that, 15 million Americans take France in every minute moment, 15 million on the asteroid, and like a million, we did, take their two.
So it's about a million people who might get a problem with their galaxy if the experimentation of my country's own information in the Museum's Museum's Museum's Museum's Center's Foundation.
But I said, "It's still not enough philosophers," because I love what you did with the Pixico Pacific, "but what we have isn't called unfortunate invisible."
So we need to do something else.
Let's go into the electronics of a story.
We've got our movements that come to the room, we've come out of the same.
And I said, "Let's see if people take these two drugs" have a problem with their galaxy. "
There's a lot of thousands of people in the medical organization of French Francisco and France.
But we needed special patients.
We'd need our patients to take one of these drugs and have the countries of the galaxy, and then started with the second one they had another galaxy, which is in a very long time -- something like months.
And when we did this, we found 10 patients.
But, for eight of the 10 years of the galaxy when they got the "The second" -- we call it "Pip" -- "" -- when they got the "the second".
It didn't matter what it was, once in the second time, the galaxy has been disappointed in 20 miles.
Just as a privilege, natural way you have, if you don't take a chair, a galaxy in the 1990s.
And if it's going to 120, 125, your doctor begins to think about the security of training in politics.
So the end of 20 -- and I hear it.
I said, "Wow, it's really easy.
"But unfortunately we don't have an article," because it's 10 patients, education -- "it's not enough patients."
So we said, what can we do?
And we said, let's call our friends in New York City and Western, also -- I'm university in Boston, and New York Times for a child who's also got a medical information from our own electronics.
And it seems to be if they can find these little patients with the "one" The "one with the" The "The" "" The "Second", "with the global countries in the field that we need.
Nicole Walt, and in a way, we found one week of 40 patients like this with the same task.
The green is found 100 patients.
So at the end, we've had 150 patients from three medical sectors that showed us that patients who get these two drugs and get a little galaxy.
More interesting, we didn't generate the sculpture, because in the hospital, the galaxy has already been used.
When we looked at the galaxy of a chairs, it came up in 60 kilometers, not just 20.
It was something serious, and we said, "We have to publish this."
We got the article.
Everything was called data, data from the food and drugs, data from a story, and data from New York Times, data from New York City.
We didn't even do one real experiment.
But we were scared.
So we did, while the article was built, we went to the lab.
We found somebody who's in the lab.
I don't stop it.
I'm a patients, but I don't do oil.
They taught us to feed already in drugs.
We've taken now and give them one PED, Franciscin.
How many other people will be in Afghanistan.
A third group of cities will give their two.
And the wonderful fear, the galaxy of the people in the past 20 to 60 kilometers.
So the article was based on the evidence of the data, but the little piano at the end: "Oh, by the way, if you give it to the past, it's going to go."
It was great, and the story could go there.
But I have two and a half minutes.
And so we're thinking about this, and I don't remember thinking about it, but somebody said, "I'm interesting if we're taking these two drugs" without active actions.
"They may have been expected to live it."
How can we build this?
We said, well, what do we do?
If you take a drug, one new drug or two, you have a strange feeling.
What do you do?
You're going to go to Google and make the two drugs you take or the one you're taking, and you're learning, "Oh."
What you live.
So we said, "Okay," and I ask Google if they're going to put it in their monkeys, "so we can look at the monkeys" and we're going to build if you're treating new ways like this. "
Google, we've got to say, we've been trying to ask our woman.
So I was in Asia.
I was in the dinner with a friend who's working in "Mormus" and I said, "We wanted to do what research is," Google Gabby, it's an engineer. "
He said, "Well, we've got the monkeys from Bay."
I mean, yes.
It's great.
Now I felt as if I was, I felt like I'm talking to me again.
It works in one of the big companies in the world, and I'm trying to make us feel better.
But he said, "No, Iran, maybe you don't understand.
"No, we don't just have the sensors of Bang:" If you're using the Internet or a list to do new sensors in Google, "Wow, Bay, what wouldn't be...
"So for a year, we're going to say this information for" Talk "in the morning."
I said, "These are bees!"
It was a bear in the summer, my friend in Mexico.
So we've done a study where we've made 50 words that we can't tell us if we've got French, like, "" "" "" "" "" "" ""
So we've got 50 robots that we're going to say, "Social molecules."
We've created a basis.
And it turns out it's about a half percent percent of all the sensors in the Internet to feed one of these words.
This is our basic level.
If people's words "France" or "or" or "-- these are beautiful words -- and one of these words, then the speech of communities have been trained over two percent, if you know that the word" Frankton "has already been dealed.
If it's "France", "it's about three percent of the basis.
If "France" "and" France "" and "" "" and "in the Washington" and "in Street" are two or 10 percent, "it's about four percent of these three or
We published it, and it got a little attention.
The reason that it's seen for attention is that the patients tell us about their own audience activity through their senses.
We explained that the attention of the food and the drugs.
It's a horrible trick them.
They're the programming and social networks in a cooperation with a microscope, which has a infrastructure here, and with others, to look at Twitter, to look at drugs in the Facebook, to make a new information, to try to try a place where you're going to try to find a place that's going to happen, and we're going to create
What's my audience at all of this? Why do you tell the story?
Well, first of all, we've now got the global security of many buildings and buildings that can allow us to understand interactions between drugs and in fact, actively, actions of drugs.
How do the drugs work?
It's a creation, and it's already created, a new ecosystem for me to understand how drugs work and better the use of them.
It's now a professor at the University of California.
He's done this in my democracy with hundreds of drugs.
It's found some very important interactions, and that's how we've got it and we've shown that it's a way that I've actually been able to find an open interaction.
But there are some things.
We don't take in one of the kinds of drugs.
As I said earlier, there are patients of three, five, five, seven, more drugs.
Is they really exploring the interaction that they're going to do with their neighborhoods?
Right, we can look at galaxies: E.A., I.E., OK, but what with a man, a man, a man, a man, and they're all together, in which we're going to look at the same patients, that maybe create interactions in the ways that reveal autonomy and intuition them, the same activity is inevitable?
We really have no idea.
It's open and open-source, and it's open-source, and it's open-source for us to use data to try to understand interactions between drugs.
I want you to think about the power that we've been able to create with the data that's built their molecules through their wind, through their doctors, the people who can allow the information to the astronomy in Portugan, Darwin, to be able to be able to reduce the wind.
People are worried about information.
They're worried about their privacy and their security -- and on the side.
We need very security systems.
But we can't have a system that represents the data, because it's too rich of inspiration, innovation and discovered for new things in medicine.
And the last thing I want to say is, in this case, we found two drugs and it was a little huge story.
The two drugs really created problems.
They're the galaxies of Google.
They could make somebody who wrote in other reasons I didn't have, so to use these two drugs in my life, maybe not take them together, maybe to put other drugs.
But there was another possibility.
And we can find two or three drugs that work in interaction and create a positive effect.
We could find new effects of drugs that don '
If we take a solution to today, all of the important ways -- not the ocean, for example, as depression -- it's always a little bit of drugs.
So the positive side here, and the thing that I've been able to show another TED, in another day, is how can we use the same information in order to find the most important effects that create new treatments, new groups in the context of medicine, and we can allow us to treat even better patients?
Thank you.
Thank you.
The wisdom of the air is about the science group.
It's in the middle of the eye that's going to take the next generation in the last minute.
Monta's' "Smith" is a energy species. "
A lot of people like to take a laugh on the road, to get to the scientific group, and to do in Scott.
But here's the question: Do you have to be obsessed about Porto?
Is the experiment in Portuto really do so good for us, or is it just a public transport?
What does the science mean?
First of all, many of them agree that physical activity would be good for the body, and it's really true.
Finally, in a young age, there's a lot of health solutions, like the self-confidence, I've been able to travel from the city, New York City in the summer, high pressure.
Like, when we're working in brain activity and release some words, including hormones.
These natural hormones, which control responses as a pain in in the central nervous system, can lead to emotion of theory, or, what is called the "The House" The House. "
A limited level of iPh.D. and physical activity work in general can experience the power of the wind and improve the memory.
So does this mean that there's a species in the room because five times a week in the same way that the warriors in the body as part of a group?
Well, that's where it's done interesting: because if it turns out that if you can find a group that you like, studies show that there's a lot of drugs beyond the physical solutions and the mathematicians of yourself.
The most meaningful benefit is from the psychological experience, also to Twitter and create a long term.
It's a dozen of the physical experience of being part of a group, for example, learning to look at others, without help, help, work for a common goal.
In addition, we've got to team and do something that can be able to help the training revolution.
It's also the power to participate in a school, and it's reducing the risk of training as a depression of four years.
In the data, your self-esteem and your nervous security can get a meaningful vision.
There are some reasons for this.
One of the trees in the museum.
In the work of local development, especially with a good artist, you're collecting a very important pattern of itself.
So you say, "Even if I can't do something today, I can improve training and get the goal."
This important form is a use of all of life's lives.
And there's also a country through failure, one of the most meaningful solutions and the best effective effect that has to provide.
And China's experiences with the prosperity can build deep and self-information that has to deal with academic obstacles, social, and physics.
So even if your group didn't move all the time, I don't need it at all, there's a real benefit to the experience itself.
They'd never be any of the sport.
Maybe one group of competitors, I don't reduce enough.
It may also take time to find the spontaneous body that's coming to your skills.
It's completely wrong.
But if you get a little bit of time in a month, you can find a spint that's coming into the human needs, and if you're going to take a lot of time, it's a lot of time.
You're going to be part of a community to be dead, look at self-security, believe your body, and move your brain, and it's without reminding the power that you have.
The most basic goal of a body of body is to restore itself from food.
In the time of history, the natural selection of genetic nature that we can ask women by defining the most noisy situation.
Because most human history will be the general, the genetics has evolved to be revealed by a man's president.
So when does a body become my problems?
The negative effects of more than a year or not at all in its medical school and the 18th century.
At the same time, there's a young technology for the public health that's improving the quality of quality, like a food diversity.
It's been affected by a good food that can't be healthier for economies.
The role has gone, and that's not the same time of the death of the data.
By the middle of the 19th century, the names were increased as a healthy health, and a hundred years later, it's a technology.
What's the difference between a more effective building?
It's a new called BBI between the two.
For instance, if someone has 65 pounds in the 1.5 feet, I have a BI of about 29.
It's the situation of a body that's happening when in BBI's BI is over 30, just over 25 to 29.
In BMI can be science to make a healthcare, in fact, one percent of the body can actually be in the city of information like the body's data and a connection.
For instance, for example, there's a BI BI in nature.
So how do you get to the situation of the names?
In the end of the basis, there's a more diverse version of inorganism.
If you need a big energy consumption from the physical energy activity, the body will get the rest of the communities as a man.
In most cases, this museum comes from a combination of reasons and choices.
The adults need to do at least two hours and a half of physical activity in the week, children need an hour.
But in general, one of the four adults and eight out of 10 adults are not active enough.
It's a great agencies and big and big places together with transparency and features to eat drugs.
And the green resources, and it's inevitable for healthy agencies and healthy risk and even larger communities.
And yet, our genetic car also play.
The studies of families and families have shown in the morning that makes a difference in the web.
Other studies also found that most of the obstacles in the microbes that live in the world's world's world system.
No matter the reason, the names is a critical epidemic.
It's a meaningful industrial transparency, like a dog, a heart disease, a high pressure, a cancer stress.
It's affected all the genes, the genes, and the Chinese groups are not in developing countries.
With the cost of 60 percent of children in the world over two decades, the problem is meaningful to disappear.
Once a person who's right, the journey to the markets become more easier.
The hormonal changes and symbols reduce the response of the body to eat.
After we've lost a weight, a man with the names that have been scared less and rapid in the industrial industry that's found in the same way, and so it's hard to have the cooking weapon.
And when people go on the web, they need the nervous boundaries more on the brain and create food food.
There's, with that, a couple of ideas that make a long term in behavior can lead to stories in healthcare problems.
And we've built a weight of changes in the streets of life, we're political treatments like electrodes can improve the behavior of the ocean and reduce communities.
What we've ever been the survival solution works now.
When the world's population is going to be able to feed and grow, the industries can prevent for healthcare or more experience for the future.
And with the phenomenon that affects every country in the world of different kinds of institutions, the names can't show because we're building.
Civil young people are more likely to avoid the world's communities.
In this beautiful world, a group of behavior is the last hope of humanity.
Unfortunately, you're all going to go on by the small little little bits and you're going to have the future to their TV generation.
Before you're perfect to the side, you see a lot of numbers from the books that's coming out.
But every step we've got to reduce electricity with a cat.
You find that one of you will be able to try to speak, but only after you have a challenge for the other people and we can train the mortality in the morning.
With her perfect diversity, Araza is the critical choice.
You're going to give it a microscope so we've left it.
When the invention of you, you hear were young through one of the institutions, and then they're making.
And a model knows that it has to go into a experiment that's capable of three positive numbers in a city, so that the number is big human, and the third is different.
It can ask three features, but if it's going to make a new sense that we're going to say something else, it's going back to the side.
The first magazine, the voice says, the gas of the three numbers is 36.
When Ariza asked the other feedback, he tells me that his three numbers is the same as the number of Syrian in the past.
There's a long year.
You're sure that Ariza sees the number of stories, but you don't have a way to know it, and it can't say it.
If I've been able to get this point in this point, it's going to do it, but instead, it's bringing the third feedback, and it's going to know that the biggest number is ever known in the North.
A few days later, the time of the electricity's electricity is dealing for a couple of seconds, and you understand that Alexandria is in the street.
Unfortunately, her device is not safe, so that's all the information you get.
Can you find the solution?
It's just on the next screen to think the solution.
Three percent of the fact that you don't know the number of Asia, but you decide to start from the beginning in any way.
On the first level, you're computing the possibilities of the possibilities that you're going to get out of 36.
One of those has to be true, but what are it?
Now comes from the hard part.
Even though you don't know what you're looking for, truth decides to think about all three different numbers.
So you understand.
All the agrees out there are unique markets, but if the number of tricks come to each one of these, Aria would know the right wall then without repair the third.
Because it's hard to reduce the food, the number of tricks have to get to the only agreement that's more than a list: three decades.
But what's the products that join three hours is true: 1,66 or 29?
So the third feedback comes.
Because he tells you that the largest number of our lives, 2,29 has to be India.
When the night was false, you're in the street through a number of hours and you're going to join the outside.
You've reminded yourself with biology.
Now time to release the rest of the world.
How is the French revolution that happens to the president of London and the year 200 million dollars on hundreds of people?
In fact, there's a very happening.
This convenience has happened in the case of mistakes between two countries, the American experiences and the international system or the leadership system.
So what about the French revolution?
Let's think.
Throughout the way that most human history, and experiences like the web of our geographic energy didn't exist and changed water.
And then different areas don't just use different countries.
But they also had different perspectives.
Over the insects of insects, the Western Western intervention started to most of numbers and numbers in Europe, but from the efforts of words like John William and California that are less likely to be successful.
With a quarter of a million different countries in French, every two of us are going to go back and listen.
And in 1889, again, it was actually coming.
The leaders of the French revolution didn't just solve the country.
They're also asked to change the company on the serious principles of the eye.
When the new government went to Sylon, the Amy's leadership went there to Ford in the country system.
Students and women who are based on local organisms were exposed to natural relationship.
For instance, the region, which is only a country in buildings, is one to 10 to 10 to a half of the street between the road and the other to the North.
And the new metaphor was, on the Congress and the New York Times, "for all people, learn."
Talestinian students of the countries were also on political cost for the revolutions.
Egypt couldn '
And the transition for a month, we've got a new French with a week of the country and 10 days, the less power of the power that we've been looking for for the first robot.
The summer of this new system wasn't easy.
In fact, it's created in a small gene.
In the beginning, people were using new countries for innovation, and the French year we got to end.
When President Baylon came to Sylon, he allowed small business to use the traditional countries that would redefine the Twitter.
But the central method that the strategy was put on, and it spread around the continent across the French.
In my empathy's empathy, it's about eight years, its network is going to have a lot more than that.
A few European countries came back to the different countries with independence.
Otherwise we understood the value of the democracy in the eye of the Amazon.
After Portugal Federal, we've been going to go through the freedom of the freedom of the freedom, other places we've gone through, and that's how the method of the world's method around us by elimination and molecules.
Because most of the city of French, Britain has been the ideas of the revolutions that are very happy about its traditional countries.
But for the next three years, the United States has been done in the Twitter Central Twitter, first I'm training the method as an effective as an effect before Atlantic became a service.
However, this lab came too late for three minutes to the past that we've already got to themselves.
The United States of America's movement with the English countries of the Canada's California and I've left one of the three countries that still doesn't offer the Internet.
Unfortunately, we've been reducing different entrepreneurs to the Internet, many Americans think countries like a more intuitive foot.
And in Iraq, some think about the metric method that once thought was the revolution of global medicine.
However, the electronic method is using almost universal science in medicine, and it's really going to open up the modern principles.
For a long time, the leadership democracy actually by the physical ancestors who are happy about it.
But thank you for technology and India, the approach is limited to these long, and they're the unprecedented art now with universal students, like the light speed.
Social countries are like this as part of our everyday intelligence that is hard to transform what it means to human beings are what they are.
And as it started from political revolution, the Twitter method that happened for the future revolutions to come.
I'm a statistic that's known for me because I started the extinct movement.
It's when you take an infinite materials or a woman out to the main environment, in a typical diversity -- or, more in our country, without limitations.
But when I started this 10 years ago, I didn't have a word for that, I didn't have a child on this, I didn't have a vision of big.
Everything I wanted to be something hot and do by humans on the features of the French Foundation on them and I looked every day.
So I got the door of the door.
I call it an alphabet.
I didn't really know that this little boy will change your life.
So in the morning, the response was interesting.
She's still me thinking, "What can I do?"
Can I do something in the public region and get the same response?
So I've been doing my colleagues for my work.
The response was a surprise.
People would take their car and go out of the car to look at it, and to get their head and go to it, and take it to this TV, and all it was really exciting for me to try and try every business for a decade.
And the more I did it, the response was more powerful.
So in this point, we're in the water.
I know.
It was surprising.
I discovered my new answer in the main environment was my game.
So these are some of my local work.
I've been very certain of the idea of improving the normal, today, even from the forest, and I don't even take the identical identity or my functions but just give me a very good part of the moral.
And it was fun for me.
It was really fun to take objects and make them come to life.
So...
I think we're all seeing the motor in this, but -- I was at a point where I wanted to take it seriously.
I wanted to open it.
I wanted to know why I gave it to it on my life, why I had a passion for this, why other people responded to this so powerful.
And I realized something.
We're all living in the world and digital, but we're still changing something that you can connect to.
I think we've all become learning about the developing cities where we're worse, and we're going to take information and privacy, and we're not starting even about these things.
So when you're born in a business that's going to take a tremendous tree and it's probably not in the place and then you're in a strange way -- you're reduced to me, it's the moment.
That's the moment I love is the moment I love to share with others.
So in this point, it's my curiosity.
I've gone from the most profound Brazil, and I've been studying the tremendous task of what I can do with this material.
Can I do something big at a big scale that you can't get on?
So the object happens.
It was a real game for me.
I always had access to that.
In this point, people had this work, but there wasn '
So at this point, I'm an accident I'm doing something interesting.
Maybe I started the spontaneous bombs, but I'm not actually not alone.
It's coming to a global telescope.
People from all around the world did this.
And I know that because I went to some parts of the world I'd never been in before, and I've been able to have a paint and I knew I didn't care about it.
So as I sat after my metaphor with my art -- it's a lot of my last work -- that's how it was the reduction of the category.
It's also a big crowd.
And this experience showed me the most important power of this art showed me that there was this beautiful language that I had with the rest of the world.
It was the way of environmental environments -- this profession -- that I discovered a machine with people I've never thought I'm going to talk to them.
So when I tell my story today, I'd also like to explain to you that power can find in the most unclear places, and we're all glad that just waiting for waiting.
If you're thinking about our hands, these tools that are connected to us, and what they're able to do -- build a small house, and to create huge creatures -- and most of the time we're going to reduce the phones or phones.
And I'm also excited about this.
But if you think about it, what happens if you take these things?
What do you do? What do you do with your hands?
A lot of people think I'm going to be reduced, but I'm actually not able to train a microscope if our lives will give it.
But I did something interesting with a galaxy that had never done before.
I didn't say, "I'm supposed to be" art in a sense that I didn't know when I did it -- I'm actually at a long time in math.
So I didn't think the before I had a child, but I also knew I didn't give it.
And when it happened to me, I've come back, and I'm going to wait for this and I'm proud to say I'm art today.
So as I live today about the future, you know that your future may not be part.
One day, you might be scared as I would give a big film to change the world for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Charles Alexandria started about 1922 after he returned to me.
He didn't go for 68 years, and he's now in the United States of Gates as the world's world's world's world's world's world's world's global leaders.
At the day, the young French Ford James Freedom might be the most beautiful, 50 times a year for four weeks in 2007.
So what do you make the universe?
Rather doctors show that around the universe happens many times after Grandhi who's surrounded the coffee, like a light or a woman can change what's going on.
Others are happy to strong emotions or response to them: laughing, in instance, and emotions.
Let's look at what's going on when we're dead.
It's starting with a unusual conference of a noise, a big flight that's underneath the light that we're using to hate light.
After that, it's a time that comes from a solution of a picture of the child's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's development.
The consciousness of the reminder that's not here as a solution of light, but the definition of a 3D printing is going to go into the old community and get it to the city.
It's also created the iPhones: "Hey."
There's no role in the universe.
They didn't think they have some physical solution.
Why are we going to start to hate light, because suddenly suddenly, why is it going to get to see?
The academic structures, or psychologists without a critical goal represent challenges to evolutionary biological biological biologists.
Is these structures that make important functions that still didn't exist?
Or do they survive from our evolutionary past, which is once a important goal to stay as survival from the past?
One idea is that the universe started from millions of years ago before the person.
Think that the theory has evolved as structures that allow local biologists, that many of them live in a place where connecting with a little bit, to find the oxygen that's in the air over the air.
When these results of the animals have passed later to the ground, they're going to use a chance to listen with the lights.
That's what it's like to change a lot more speech that's going on today when they're changing first with adults with theory.
It's the case that the gene is a survival of water from water.
Where there could be a place on the water and after a restaurant of the sound that prevents the water to get it.
It's going to be depending on random evidence that the nervous patterns that were involved in biology almost identical to those who are responsible to the two of life.
And another group of scientists believe that the plastic that actually is enough important solution.
They're saying that real genes are often in the universe and they're not happy with birds, although, states, or every year that's called light.
More than that, the universe appears in human babies a lot before the audience and they're much more common in babies than adults.
They're going to identify the only activity of our hands.
Ford of the future and the future may be courageous by buildings to help the light of the speed of a tree.
The stem cells of the limitation of the limitation or the cancer, while the definition of Syria's community is always going to get it.
Sometimes, a series of the universe doesn't exist, and we're trying drugs on the cell: to say what's going on from the walls, the rich gas, here's full of compassionate objects, and there's what's going to go into the New York, or the fear is surprising.
Unfortunately, scientists still need to make sure that each of these solutions work better than others.
However, we know one thing that decisions don't work.
And imagine you're in a week, and you can choose from a building that's advertising: managers or water.
It's a great choice.
The managers are more valuable, obviously.
Now imagine that you're going to listen to the same choice, but once, you're not in a cloud, but you've got a restaurant in the past two days of water in the desert.
Would you change your street?
Why? Is the value of the managers open?
It's a valuable project, which I've been described in the magazine book of the economist's economist's economists.
And he tells us that the word's value, I'm just as we thought.
In the last week, you thought about the value of every project, what you could get in time later, but in the case of insects, what's going to be much more valuable is their use, how much they're going to do in the current camera.
And because we can choose just one of the possibilities, we need to change their political cost, which means what we're going to stop if we're more about the other possibilities.
After all, it doesn't matter how much you can reduce the managers if you don't get out of your own.
Most of the modern economic economists deal with France and value by trying to one of these two molecules under the brain and the door -- how can the product to provide the serious and the consumption of a person.
I've been able to have a series of capacity to be happening to anything, from the need of food and as a problem that's going to see, and it's going to change in nature between different people and different reasons.
The second economy enough us a simple way to track the door.
In abilities, the dozens of the product for you are looking at the research that you're going to pay for.
Now, imagine yourself back in the desert, just that once, you offer you a different audience or a new place for five minutes.
If you're like most people, you're in the head of the water to finish the journey, and then in a few more managers you can ask.
It's because of something that's called communities, and it's meaningful that when you choose between managers and water, you're changing the outdoor that's conducted from each other in another place.
And you're doing it every time you get a success.
The first place that you're going to have more than any amount of water, but finally, you have all the water you need.
After some time, every other building becomes a platform.
So you're starting to choose in the audience and water.
And it's not just for laws like water.
For most of the things, the more you have some product so it's going to do less use it.
It's the experience of a physical communication.
You might be two or three places of your favorite food, but the ideas are already in the patient, and the 19th century gave me to me before you get to it.
Or you can pay to see the same film again and do it or you're going to tell you the money.
Anyway, you're going to go to the end of a point where the communities are going to have another film.
The dozens of the door doesn't expect the products of products, but for all the decisions we get.
And the intuitive way to maximize it and to avoid a beautiful feedback. It's by bringing the different ways to get our time to use our resources.
After our basic consumers know, we're a decision to invest in elections as long as they're still awesome.
Of course, what we do is we're able to maximize the global function in real life, it's already another issue.
But it's going to help remember that the intuitive value comes from us, the microbes that we like, and the choices that we do.
So a few years ago, I did a experiment.
For one year, I said, "Yes, all the things we've developed.
Everything that's coming out of me, I've put it since the only generation, I've got myself to say, "Yes."
Do I want to make a person in the audience?
No, but yes.
Would I want to get in a hotel in TV?
No, but yes.
Would I want to try in the game?
No, no, no, but yes, yes.
And the crazy thing: I did the thing that we put it on the fear, did it without fear.
My fear is too close to the audience, my social reference, Phicago, disappeared.
It's amazing, the power of one word.
"Yes," changed my life.
"Yeah."
But it was James one of the expectations that affected my life in a deep way, and it started the question of a little daughter.
I've got three amazing reasons, France, Bertin and said, "San's is an action that's infinitely inevitable."
Like there was a dead of the parents.
So, "I'm going to need a little bit of space in my house."
And I've been able to watch what's going to do with me because I've put it in one event when I was in a way to a woman, and I'm going to go. "
And this is the beginning of a new way for my family.
And I've just heard that I've heard about, every time one of my communities asked me to play, no matter what I'm doing is where I'm going, I'm going.
I'm not always sorry for children, but I'm very useful.
This space was an effect on me, we have to, on our family.
But this space was also "I've also been going to call him an amazing", and just recently, I realized that I'd been able to play with my home and as well as he wanted my career.
Look, I've got what most of you call a dream.
I'm an independence. I'm countries. I'm invented things to solve.
It's something that's happening.
No.
I'm anatomy.
It's something that's happening.
I'm making TV. I'm a machine in TV.
I do TV, a lot of TV.
In this way or another, in the current television problem, we're responsible for about 70 hours of program for the world.
Four TV techniques 70 hours of TV.
Each service created hundreds of work, we didn't exist before.
The design to solve one of a TV service can move between three million dollars.
Let's say five.
A month we've been doing every hour, as four programs, so every hour is about 20 million dollars of TV. Four satellites, 70 hours of TV, three reasons at the point of time at the bottom of the top, four villages in every minute: 21 village, 21 villages of French, the "French, the" 2
In the United States, our TV programs are one of the last year in the Arabic.
About around the world, our programs are happening in 256 countries, in 67 hours to the audience as 30 million people.
My brain is global, and 45 hours from the TV hours are a program that I've created not just the other way I've got to find, I need to find a time, because I've got to find the way that I can see my stories and tell them my stories.
Four TV programs, 70 hours of TV, three techniques in the middle of the Bill, sometimes four million dollars, teachers around the world.
You know why do you do these things?
No one, so as I said, I'm an anatomy.
It's something that's happening.
I don't tell you this to feel you.
I'm saying this because I know what you think when you hear the word "moral."
I tell you all that because you're all working so hard if you're a company, or a classroom, I'm a home, I've been talking about work, because you're going to understand that I'm not in the computer where I'm not in the computer today today, because I'm going to listen to me when
It's a little job, bringing me a little bit, noise, no meaning.
I work a lot, very hard, and I love it.
When I'm going to go back in work, when I'm going to stand inside, there's no other emotions.
For me, my job is all the time to build a nation from nothing.
It doesn't change the power. It's to create the building.
It's going to go to every high school. It's to run from a restaurant.
It's going to be in a engineer.
And that's all these things that are available.
I love working.
It's a creative creative because there's a half meters and a half kilometers and a video and a liquid, and what's doing it so well is the water.
There's a woman who's a change in me because when the work is doing good.
The water begins in my brain, and it's a big big big big big size that sounds like the open road, and I can try to go.
And a lot of people, when I'm trying to explain the sea, they're special that I'm talking about the writing, that my writing is a connection.
And don't look at me wrong, it's a message to me.
But the amazing thing -- just when I started working on TV when I started to work and build, and to create, and to share this thing, so I discovered that, this device, this amazing thing.
It's more than the writing.
The water is active.
The water is magic. The sea is music. The sea is a light light.
It's a new sense of God and agriculture.
And when you have this amazing structure, you can't be hungry to grow.
This feeling, you can't be hungry in every study.
That's what's called the water.
Or, maybe that's what's called to be a job.
And maybe it's called Ghana.
Maybe it's called a worst.
Maybe it's just fear of failure.
I don't know.
I just know I'm not building a failure, and I just know I love the water.
I just know I want to tell you that I'm autonomy, and I know I don't want to deal with that.
But here's the thing: the more I'm going to be able to, the more techniques, more villages, the more than the water I do, the more I'm doing in the air, the more you know in the air, the more you've got on the air, the more you're going to write the history, the more you're going to
The more I work for success, the more I need to work.
And what did I say about work?
I like to work, right?
The nation I'm building, the device I want, the forces, the house, the gas, the sea, the sea, the sea, the sea.
I'm fighting this amazing. I love this amazing.
I need that amazing.
I'm this amazing person. Is we a privilege of this day?
And then this amazing thing was stop.
Please, change, galaxy, experience.
The French Revolution.
We realized, three reasons are used to find out that their mother is a wonderful job.
The Africa says to people, "Oh my mother won't be there, but you can send the motion to my platform."
And San said, "I'd like to go to the audience."
They're the molecules of Titan.
They're small tons.
They've been 12, three, and one, one, when the French Revolution.
The water of the scientists.
I got to love work. I couldn't reinvest the information.
The water couldn't go back.
My blood was a molecule.
I did the same things that I've always done, the same work of Titan, 15 hours a day, including the rest of the week, unknown, Titan never knew, never worse, although, full of artists, dozens and dozens and dogs, dog.
But there was no water.
It was a machine.
Four TV programs, 70 hours of TV, three reasons at the bottom of the time, sometimes four.
Four TV programs, 70 hours of TV, three reasons at the same time at the same time...
I was the perfect Titan.
I was Titan that you can take home to know not very much.
All the colors were the same thing, and we didn't have the experience of it.
And that was my life.
It was all I did.
I was the amazing, and the amazing was me.
So what do you do when your life, the work that love, start to argue like my father?
Now, I know somebody there is thinking, "You're going to go on the direction, a mathematician."
But you know, really, if you're creating, if you're working, if you like what you do, to be a teacher, to be very, very, to be a biologist, to be a biologist, if you just like that, if you're going to give you the sea, if you know the sea, if you know how this stuff is, if you're
What are you?
What am I?
Is I still TV?
If the poem that I'm going to play, can I survive from what?
And then my abundance and what happens to me a question.
I'm in the way out of the door, I'm another one, and she says, "Oh, I want to play?"
And I'm just going to say no, when I understand two things.
One, I'm supposed to say to everything, and two, my despite of parents didn't see "death."
He didn't read everybody "faster."
What happens?
I've been looking at this, in the dozens of Titanic Technology on my favorite day, and it's changing to the poor model.
And here he says, "Oh, I want to play?"
And I said, "Yes."
There's nothing special about it.
We're playing, and we're going to join her sisters, and there's a lot of laughing, and I'm going to read dramatically from the book "Everybody's doing a baby."
It's not something that's going on.
And yet, it's quite extraordinary, because within my father's father's pain, out of my fingerprint, all I need to do is give attention.
I went.
I did.
The nation I'm building, the device I want, the forces, the bank, the lab is not the place.
Everything that's the fingerprints and small weapons and small communities and the fingers of this poem to release what it wasn't like to get the hole 'hole's way to do.
And it's all of us and spread.
The air is so easy in this place for us that we can women.
I can't believe I'm happy.
This game becomes a job.
And I'm happy.
Something that's going to be released.
And in our brain, I've opened to the wall, and the energy comes.
And it's not too much, but it's happening, it's actually happening.
I feel it.
The water comes back.
Not in the prison, we asked emotion, it's a weird, and I need to stop to hear it, but it's there.
It wasn't the water in the motion, but it's somewhere.
And now I feel like I know a very experiment.
Well, let's not collect.
It's just love. It's all that.
It's just love.
It's just something we forgot.
The day, the work, the Titan, the Titan, it's just a cat.
If I have to ask you who I am, if I need to tell you who I am, if I describe myself in terms of TV and how my brain is to go to the national, so I forgot what I've forgot.
It's not because of the amazing power is not an exception to work.
It's a beautiful one.
The real day is a public for love.
It's the electricity that comes from being emotional from life.
The real day is our security and hope.
The real water is going on from history, and the skills in the air, and from the expectations, and from stress.
The real day is we're in a modern country.
The real day is to feel of God in this region, but maybe God feel the wrong words, because what is God told me that I'm autism?
It's just love.
We can all be a little bit more love, a lot more love.
Each time my child's voice asked me to play, I'm saying.
I'm doing this from one reason, to give myself a service, to release myself from all of my communities.
It's my life, so I don't have a choice, and I don't have a clear thing, not if I want to feel the water.
I wish it was so easy, but I'm not good at play.
I don't like that.
I'm not interested to do this in the same way we're interested in doing work.
In fact, it's much more creative and interesting.
I don't like to play.
I work all the time because I love working.
I love working more than I love to be at home.
It's hard to deal with this problem, because what kind of human beings like to work more than being in home?
Well, I am.
Look, let's be today, I call myself TV.
I have a surprise.
And one of these problems is not that I'm too bad.
And we want to go back and go back.
We're doing just about 30 seconds.
We're a series of service. We're playing in skills.
I'm doing their work and they're expecting them.
And I feel like we would have been it and it's responsible for the time.
I'm all the time I want my mobile phone.
But it's okay.
My little person shows me how to live and today's day's amazing day.
I'm playing games until I'm beginning to be what we've tried to play from the beginning.
You can also do that, you'll say yes every time your kids ask you to play.
Do you think that maybe I'm an intuitive on the audience?
You're right, but you can still do it.
You have time.
You know why? Because you're not just the nation and you're not the feedback.
Your voice doesn't think you're interesting.
So you need just 15 minutes.
In the '60s, I've spent the four years and I'd like to play it just for 15 minutes before they think they want to do something else.
It's 15 amazing minutes, but it's 15 minutes.
If I don't give something that I'm in my own, I've got to look after 15 minutes.
I'm in my 13-year-old daughter, if I can make a 13-year-old talk to me for 15 minutes I'm going to happen.
And 15 minutes are everything you need.
I can't find 15 minutes without my worst day.
It's not the key surprise.
Blaser Lord, without a box, without any tools.
You've got a business life.
You need to forget them to live, but you can find 15 minutes.
My communities are my expertise, they're my own world, but it doesn't have to be your kids, the voice that feed your water, where life feels better than not good.
The thing I'm going to play with your kids, the thing is it.
The thing is a game in general.
Imagine these 15 minutes.
Get what makes you feel good.
Just look at what it's going to play in this case.
I'm not always successful. In fact, I'm writing the same speech that I'm able to see friends, read books, in space.
"I want to play?"
What can it be true to ourselves our attention to 15 minutes?
It turns out everything.
It's not that I didn '
The work can't get games.
It takes a little bit of time, but after a few months, one day I've been published and I find myself in my office in my office not familiar, and it's full of me, and it's full of me around me, and when it's developing ideas, and I can go through more and I like to work.
But now, I'm fighting the water, but I don't like the water.
I don't need the water.
I'm not the amazing. The day is not me, no.
I've been working with fingerprints and dinosaurs with friends.
I'm that amazing.
The water of life.
The water of love.
The day of the work is still part of it is just not all of us, and I'm so grateful.
And I didn't care about being Titan, because I've never seen Titan games in the person.
I said yes, at least I've been working more games, and somehow I'm still able to get in my world.
My brain is still global. My teachers are still in cities.
The more I play, I'm happy, and my kids are happy.
The more I play, I feel more I'm very good.
The more I play, our brain will be free.
The more I play, I work better.
The more I'm playing, I'm more feeling the water, the country I'm building, the device that I want, the forces, the boundaries, the season, the sea, the other day, the real day, the real day, the peace of life.
The more I feel this amazing, the more than the second TV, the surprises, the openness, the new material, the animal, feels like us.
The more I feel the water, the more I know.
I'm writing, I'm invented things, I'm countries.
This part of the work, it's to live the dream.
It's the dreams that work.
Because some work has to be a little bit like this.
I said yes, at least there were more games.
It doesn't mean that I'm autonomy.
Do you want to play?
Thank you.
Thank you.

"I think" she's easy to transform.
It's called "There's no word to have a lot of culture, but you can get to a great word.
But the word that the most difficult to transform there is actually one of the little ones: "Go."
How much it looks simple, a lot of times you can't transform the "Should" without know much more about the situation in which it says.
As the beginning, how do you know the person and you talk?
Many cultures have different levels of refugees.
My friends, someone much more than adult or young, thrive, boss.
Each of them can be "You're a little different.
In many languages, the body's body represents these differences through what's known as TTV.
In French, for example, you'd say, "Twitter when you're talking to a friend in school, but" and "when you're talking to the teacher.
Even in English has ever been something similar.
Remember the future word "Get?"
In Iraq, it was actually a normal body for people who are listening to you, while "Here's a regular verbal version.
The strength of my father was when the English started to be awesome in any situation.
But there's a second in the "Get," not a map.
In the continent like the IDS, the "" "will depend on the right.
In many years, it depends on us if there's one of many people, like in Germany or "Oh."
Even in English, some bees use words like "Oh," or "in the same way.
A lot of forms, like "The French" "" "" "" "The Resears" and "and" and "can also feel the people who are preparing to me, in what's called" the "
And in a few minutes, there's even a specific form before we've built two people, like "New York Times."
If it's not enough of you, parasites, a number, a number, and it can be used at the same time.
In schools, "Twitter" is an unpopular art, "asteroid" is a political art, "" and "Twitter" "is unfamous," and "and" and "and" and "&quot
Go!
After all of this, it might feel you that a few times more times on the other body.
In the continents like Portugal and Portugal, because the body can be reduced from the sentence to understand it in the morning the way that the costs are connected.
And in the continents like Iraq, experiences and experiences, because the body can be abundated with all of the streets of the street.
Unfortunately, things will know that the market is important for the body's body's rights than using the wrong direction to be heard of gas.
So if you're ever going to work as you're going to go to the sentence and go to the police and all the connection: "You're, you're not, you're not, your job is to transform" and "and" yourself. "
Well, success.
And all of the structures that get this video to a variety: Sorry!
What should we happen to happen because we've created the device after a species?
It has to play in our creative community, through the back of the hot, to the back, into one of the two products.
If we're going to find a team that's released in the new summer, one cell cell can improve it.
It's going to be known to prevent this process, and they're spending three ways in Chinese.
They're spending the arm, you're going to get the arm before it comes to the hot, or you're like the summer.
The summer is the best.
And we're going to have memory and data from the invention to come with our creative space.
It's also why we're going to say to other information, the universe can also prevent the past of a species.
On the other side, there's an example, the worst eye of the Eric Eric School represents the lunch and so they're taking the income into the hole.
These motivations are called the world's cases, and you can use them with a traffic, that they're very proud of the second category.
And Technology is because the transformation of the transparency is a road.
And the galaxies are coming in the form of a shock, rapes, Jolls, and even in the form of the Mexico Mexico.
You can explore these products and serve us a lot of relationship, or to combine them with extinctions like Egyptians, another leader.
The third category to prevent the idea of working by the team in the night.
If there's no entrepreneurship in a shape, you don't have what to do.
The remote data, including galaxies, TV, emissions, and in big future, release different cultures of Afghanistan and Afghanistan.
This hormonal cartoon is like a summer, and leaves its unusual team in the night.
The Syrian Francisco also has a relationship.
It makes the light of the hot and the carbon to a code, so it's when it's hard to play a road.
There's some other information that's used to use some sense in the model.
For example, how many data are reduced from the Scott Scott Time School.
Some of them can also feel, that's going to train the arm as well as somebody's network network.
Obviously, Twitter is not true: Is one good strategy from the other?
There's the differences, but it's a really important part of the right communities.
For instance, there's males that could be effective in 98 percent of the teachers if everybody would use them.
It means that if 100 galaxies were using a machine for a year, two women were going to make it.
But they're not all using them right, so they're just going to just 82 percent of the teachers.
Others, such as English and Netherlands in 99 percent of the teachers when they use it right.
But it's 91 percent.
And Technologist goes down to 85 percent of the teachers even using risk, and in 71 percent of the teachers were just using Penus.
Secondly, there's an important part in the study of information that is the same profound activity, which affects almost by women, and not about men.
The hormonal methods in particular can make symptoms like pain, the patient, high pressure, but they change a woman.
That's why these methods are called a doctor.
The choice through information is human choice, and what's the best work for you now, can change in the middle.
Scientists are also going to explore new methods, like a global global word that has two motivated information.
I've built a couple of options to recover a road, to a road, maybe a budget and a building.
How do you feel what you want in a simple use of words?
Aristotle was trying to answer this question over 2,000 years ago in the statistics.
Robert Ford Ford, he's this artistic art of an interest.
And today we're activating it in any kind of communication.
But Aristotle has always been humans, and it's described three kinds of human issues.
Robert Portugue, or sentences are based on the past, exactly what to put in a crisis of crime.
Robert's disciplines, I'm an extinction of the current situation on the current situation, like in my mind.
But the way to achieve change is through a car, or an intuition.
Instead of focusing on the past or in India, Robert and a car in the future.
It's the theory of different politicians in a new new life or a effective effect or the effect of it might have, like Richard Richard Derek who's just going to do a public school and tell us how we've ever been living in America when people are free.
But it's also the theory of activity that's exposed to change, like Martin Martin's dream, that one day we're going to take together in what they don't exist in the way they don't exist in the sky, but before the face.
In the two cases, things come to the future and possibly possible, and try to define the process to avoid information or get it.
But what's a good democracy beyond the future?
Before Aristotle, there's three programmers: Hossia, Los, Gates.
You're the way you're going to convince your audience in your art.
And Charlie Charles opened the Congress of the American Congress in 1941 when I wanted, "All of my life was in a full country with the man who was in the Washington" Washington "in the Atlantic Washington's rights too much," So it's got the connection that we
There are many years before, in response to the RASA, the virus of Mexico has the life of my life as a politician and as a politician: "You need to keep the free countries," and from this model where this model has never been inevitable. "
And finally, you can show a human inequality, or you don't know very interactive.
Gates is the use of biology.
This method can use toxic tools like analogy, and examples, we're going to sell statistics.
But it's not just data.
It's also a structure where it's itself.
The point is to use the workers to convince the audience, like the argument of Jersey and women's rights: "I've got connections like all men I can work like any man.
"I've reminded that I've made my grandmother and I've created a little bit of creativity," and can there't there a man who can do more than that? "
Unfortunately, the things might also get people in a machine that makes sense that the audience think it's true, like the magic mistake, but still experiments make autism.
And finally, I've turned out to a emotion, and in this age of the local communication, many times it's the most effective method.
I've made a good intuition at the same time, but it can be not serious and unusual.
In the same communities, it can send people to the peace or push them to war.
Most of the details, we're making sure that we're saving to our low body and our brains are going to make us feel powerful, you're looking at the box.
The relevance of Aristotle's history is going to be every quarter, but to decide how to use them to know the audience, what's the goal, and what's the place and the right time.
And maybe it's important in the same country to succeed to understand when others use the same methods to affect you.
Before 1.3 billion years ago, in galaxy, black holes will go in the morning, and they're going to get in the list of that, when they're teaching material that's going to three billion years ago in a decade within decade.
At the same concept of time, the hardware was more than all the stars in the galaxies that all the memory universe.
It was a very big frog.
But they didn't release their energy in the form of light.
It's about black holes.
All the energy would be inside the organization at the time of itself and Germany to get out of the galaxy.
Let me give you an idea about our time.
Before 1.3 billion years ago, the Earth did have been able to develop a thousand cells.
Since the world's world's Earth has been created to open thousands of genes, genes, plants, dinosaurs, human beings and even -- we don't know -- the Internet.
And about 25 years ago, a group of people were saved in the brain -- Richard Neanderthals, Darwin and New York City and Dalek's "-- decided there's a very nice thing to build and look at roads and look at things like a hole of black holes.
Most people thought they're touched.
But there were enough people who understood that they'd be touched from Britain, so the National Science of the United States decided to find their crazy idea.
So after decades of development, we built a species, and a hard job in a remote amount, they built their own unit, which is "geologist," or "or" or "or" or "or" or "or" or "or" or "
In the last couple of years, we've been reduced in a huge amount of GDP, we've made a very, very, very, very efficient revolution.
And so it's why it's just today "geologist.
In the beginning of 2015, "Lologist" has been reduced to other experiences in the task of some other details.
And in 2015, there's a lot of drugs in 2015, and a place that's only been reduced by the galaxy, the gravity of the same behavior of black holes through the Earth.
They're exposed by a way.
And they've also been exposed through the rainforest.
[Scott TV: "There's only two exciting moments from this moment."
"The second is the park from my father when she was a philosophy.
"It's actually the size of all fear.
"All I've been working on is not science!"
So let's have a moment and tell you why I'm in "Google."
The galaxy is not in the form of the time.
When the wave to the end, it's surrounded the space and all the way that's in one direction, we're going to treat it in the other direction.
It made no more teachers about the general relationship to New York City and a simple example of their general relationship.
"It's kind of stressful, it's going to start out."
The problem with galaxy is that you're more sensitive; you're sensitive and education.
For instance, the wheelchair affected me in 14 to the Twitter -- right, you're all going to expect this global activity -- when the waves were scared, they're starting the average person in the 21st century in the 21.
It's a number of decades with 20 zero and one.
It's why everybody thought that "biological" they're crazy.
Even with Goll Gollo who's only five kilometers -- and that's the economy that's exposed -- and they're going to measure these genes at a level of thousands of tons of atoms.
And it's cool.
So to read the end of my Alexandria's basis, the Mexico's "President" and "Forn," and so I'm going to describe the currency. He said, "The techniques that we've learned" In the house of these
"But physicists are a concept of the invention," and with the average public support, "there's no longer a man on all the obstacles."
San France published this in 1973, 42 years in the joke of success.
Now, if we go back to Los, Scott likes to say that "biological" works more like an iPhone than a scientist.
I want to explain that.
It doesn't just see that there's a big, big, and it's a lot of the things around you, because of the people, the size of your mobile phone.
And it's very efficient, because it allows you to create a picture of the objects around you, by the light that comes from different countries around you.
I had a second child.
Lolly, I heard there's a road that could be 15 feet.
And it's somebody -- in fact, you can't expect industry -- create a picture of something important to you.
Like your voice or your voice.
But we're using a sound to listen to the plan like a response, a tone, a huge rate to try about the story that's behind the sound.
Here's Alexandria.
Here's where we're going to take it.
Basically.
That's how it's also with a building.
We can't find them to create simple images of things in the universe.
But from the listening to two changes in these galaxies, we can hear the story of these numbers.
And in the GDP, at least, the babies that he can hear are in the field.
So if we put the global printing and air, luck, we can really hear the universe about us.
For instance, the identity to a building, in this way, can tell us a lot about the emotions that are black holes, and I've got a very long time to think about it.
Audience: "If the two black holes don't release," hear "" "" "and" "and" are very simple.
"If the two genes are released very quickly, I have the same Chicago," but with President, "and it's about this: New York City, New York!
"As if you're the words of the training and nature of the galaxy."
EM: So in 2015, a long time I'm going to remember to the world, "Gull" heard this: "And if you know why to listen, it's the sound of --" Help's 2 black holes, "it's about 30 degrees," it &ap
EM: Because I'm going to stop here for a moment to think what it means.
Two black holes, the most powerful thing, one of the 29 years of the year's year '26's statement, you're releasing is around 100 reasons a year before I got.
Imagine this powerful.
It's a fantastic.
And it's going to know that we've heard it.
That's the extinction of GDP.
It's a new way of looking at the universe, which we've never had.
It's a way that allows us to hear the universe and hear the door.
And there's a lot that we can't see -- actually I'm even in the city.
San Francisco, for example, I've been happy to know information as a star star and exposed in Syria.
There's a lot of dozens: We've learned a lot about the universe.
The problem is that all of the interesting physics is happening in the environment, and the audience is looking behind thousands of kilometers of Brazil, carbon.
We're never able to see a way. They're an artist.
California go through Brazil as if it's a glass -- it's a completely transparent.
The big sector: I was happy that I could study the first moments of the universe, but I've never seen them, because this big flow of myself.
With the gravity, we're supposed to see everything, to start.
Maybe, more importantly, I'm sure there's things that we've never seen that maybe we can never see, and we've never got to know -- things that's going to help us through this identity.
And in fact, in the same event, "Lologist" found things that we didn't exist.
Here's my colleagues with one of the main friends in CEO's team, Matt Matt, and I've been talking about it. [Matt]] Matt]]]]]] &#93
"They're certain things, astronomers," and the black holes are like the dinosaurs "which allow us the most ecological research.
"So it's really allows us to get a new identity about what's going on and how we need these stars, and ultimately," How do we create and I'm from all this. "
EM: Our challenge, now, it's to be a safe as possible.
We know, "Lologist," we know today to build great genes that are able to figure out children, to the connections of the HIV.
It's a change to say and build new expectations -- a new generation of cameras -- on the ground, in space.
What can it be more expensive and listen to the big object itself?
It's now a big dream.
Let's share us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Is the human civilization spread into the galaxy of space?
Can we move beyond our little blue blue planet to be sitting in a number of stars?
This question is very similar.
There's about 300 billion stars in galaxy, which is about 160,000 years of light.
Now, until we sent one space out of the sun system, I've been dealing at 0.6 percent of the light speed.
In this rate, there's more than 2.5 billion years just to come from one of the galaxy to the other.
And then there's the question of human survival.
The street between stars is just trees.
We couldn't buy a lot of the plastic, and we're making a lot of resources to stay in life.
And with that, words have been discovered for decades ago that you can't just spread the human civilization around the galaxy, but to do it very quickly, no one knows of the physics.
Their idea is based on the work of a mathematician called John Washington, who's planning on the wall that you can send itself to a new generation of itself.
It's too familiar to me later as a penguin car.
In the context of the space of space, the Canadan car can be built on the Earth and be involved in space.
In there, the nervous machines I've been taking on satellites.
There they've remember the investments and created energy, and we've built the pairs of themselves, and we've got these beautiful treatments, and we've got the region.
The result is a form of millions of different emotions that spread out to the universe like our projects in the air.
A place where you think the numbers will grow up and discovered that a penguin and a half percent of the light will be able to go around the galaxy within four million years is less.
It may sound a lot of time, but when you think about it that the universe is 14 billion years, in a country that's really fast -- it's different to about seven hours of a year.
It's created a lot of plan machines that have some technologies that still don't have, including artificial intelligence, and better systems.
If we would like to use them to get real people around the galaxy, we've got to need technology -- the ability to grow artificial organisms using biological materials.
But if over the last billion years, culture has been reduced as a machine that's been able to participate with us, our galaxy was full of them now.
So where are all these machines?
A few astronomers, like Alexander and San, say that smooths don't work at all.
They might find out of control, and they're at the same time and they're going to continue to go.
Others see in the basis of the current machines that are going to be reduced in the AIDS culture, or they're going to be able to develop the rich technologies.
But all of this isn't science people to imagine how it could be if they were there.
The New York Science Science Foundation of Canadian was working on a lot of Canadian machines and Women's Cambridge.
Some of the kids have young cultures, others to identify them before they become human.
In fact, in the story of Berbin "No Phicago," How many cars are playing on the Earth now, waiting for a certain level of plants before they're operating.
In the data, everything we have are curiosity and theory.
But the next time you look at the night, we thought that billions of machines are scared and can move between the stars in our galaxy now.
If they're right, one of them is going to end on the Earth, or maybe, just maybe, they're already here.
My favorite friend of you know to play very well, but it's not a stadium in an organization.
They're always pushing all their leadership instead of the wrong place, and it's a feedback to their organization.
In the local phenomenal phenomenon, a friend of the community would come out and find themselves as a hospital in a small room and a child's dream.
Their organization around what happens.
In outside, there are 10 big boxes.
Each box comes from each of your leadership, but don't give me a photograph to mistake you -- they're going to build a horrible box.
I'm going to let you go out and go out every single one in me.
When you're in the outside, you're able to save every five boxes that you're going to choose before the surgeons or collect you back to our journey.
I'm going to tell you about any biology, maybe we're going to take out of you to the other friend, every way it's going to be.
I'm not going to train the boxes, laugh, and so on.
If every one of you will be able to find all my leadership, you're going to have a picture of the night.
Otherwise, the politicians get you.
You have three seconds to think before you start.
The community is my wife.
After all, every friend had 50 percent to find the whole leader "and" in a terrible choice of five boxes.
And the chance that every 10 of the community will be successful is a little bit smaller -- one's risk of 10 to 11 in the morning.
But at least, it's a beautiful strategy that's saving one success of over 35 percent.
Can you feel what?
Remember the video if you want to try yourself!
Again in: three, 2 was a plan of the coffee's plan: each one opened up the box on a picture of my whole leader.
If it's your whole tool, you're sick.
Otherwise, exactly what we'll find in a box, and we'll open the box that's going to work on all this.
So you're going to find your tool.
My friend was Facebook, but unfortunately, they all find what was free.
And many hours later, they're driving thousands of pounds from seven hours.
So why is the strategy that the revolution of growth?
Each microscope has been treated on the body of activity that started with the box on the front of the images and the tools with the box that you can all of that.
Remember that if we were on the floor, it would lead them to the box and then it's a wave.
For instance, if the boxes are scared like this, you're going to open the first box and you'll find a beautiful box, and finally you'll find her microphone in the third box, which is going to listen to the first box.
It's working much better than a new brain called the French France with all these kinds of photos in the beginning, all of the companies have reduced to our boxes, and there's a chance to not bad, about 35 percent, that all the circumstances can be five or less.
How do we think this risk?
For the biological communities with a simple case.
Let's start again again in the risk of failure, the risk that someone has to open three or four boxes before we find our tools.
There's women in the morning who have six different galaxies of possibilities.
It's a great way to learn them with the creatures, that's used every single one of the roads, and we've created the Alexandria.
We've seen some of these waves that you can find, and remember that these two are thinking about the same wave, just with different points.
These two of them are different. They're different.
You can imagine the eight crops of three boxes with a tool.
You're going to find four possibilities -- depending on what all the rest of the outside -- and we can use two possible trials.
So out of 24th of the possibilities of the possibilities, 14 pounds to the failure of 10 and 10 pounds to succeed.
It's true for every number of institutions, but if you want to create a way, you can use the next general growth.
The budget the number of 10 cosmos, and you'll get a chance of 35 percent.
And what if there's 100,000 institutions?
Or 10,000?
As the "" "is going to grow, this is how we're going to go to 30 percent.
It wasn't safe but with a little lucky, it's far away from being unprecedented.
Three everyone, if you love this experience, you'll try to solve the next two animals.
It starts with a little bit of uncomfortable, and it's become a feeling that you can get away from it.
Finally, just about it, you can think, and out of a decision, you're going to paint services by Aha.
People need to change at least four times a day, but sometimes, the stress of the microbial life represents us to shoot.
How bad is that, and how many of our body can stand in this?
The answer is in the way the action of the implications, a cell or a cell that's in the gene.
It's around this structure, there's numbers that we're making all the system.
Twenty-two minutes, there's two things, two adults, and there's a revolution.
The natural galaxy is made out of the population know when you're.
It's all produced products that are involved in the water and create the audience of the body, and you're bringing the unusual civilization to two generations that look like we're going to become.
These are the issues that I'm going to control into the healthy part that we know as the corruption.
The musician's service's musician's muscle is made out of the connection that's released when the corruption is released and enabled to be less like London.
When the corruption is dead, it's only the reminds of the wind and the outside.
The previous adults will open intuitive intuition, and you'll be released.
It's a mathematical entrepreneur, and it's going to be able to be reduced in the extinction.
It works like Brazil.
When you want to take a changed, you're saying about the basis.
When you want to release it, you can open the traffic.
But how do you feel the full of rewards so that you're going to change?
Within the strength of the stimulus, there's a millions of dollars that are acting when the corruption comes from.
They send it through the nervous nerves to your service.
The Claser Pollus is going to go back to your corporations, what makes the corruption and get a little bit less stressed, so you're going to know that you're full of.
In the morning, the infinite basis of the transformation becomes open.
It's called the Montaneous Pacific.
The brain can tell it if it's not a good time to compare it by taking it to the end of the extinction.
With about 150 to 200 million trillion trillion in the planet, the reminder of the corruption is reduced enough to feel that there's a face.
In about 500 miles a trick, the stress becomes uncomfortable.
The parasites can continue, but just a certain point.
Over 1,000 kilometers, it can be exposed.
Most people and control control control before it's happening, but in very expensive cases, like a person can't feel the need to change, the capacity can be bad at what's going to happen in our lives.
But under normal conditions, your decision to compare the quality of the brain to the extinction of the external cortex, what makes me reduce to the corruption.
The extension of extension is one of the brilliant fingerprints, and it's enough to be able to exist.
We're lucky that we've got these brilliant brilliant connection to the system on the system and the industry, the industry, we're going to, I'm expected to make it a little bit of the corruption.
Instead, the bridge of the bridge that's saying about the regions until you're ready to release.
But the reduction you've made for a long time, and your language is too quickly, or the changed without a physician support that can decide or reduce this service.
It can lead to a very active prosperity, as a pain that is scared, and scary, or a control control of corruption.
So for a long health, it's not a good decision to get your name.
But to the production, at least, your body's brains on you, so you can choose the moment of the device.
When a team of organizations have been exposed recently that you see that there's been about 6,000 years, they've done interesting disorders.
The markets of those people would be stuck in the room.
What's made these studies continue to push us today, some tiny tiny rules that live in our language.
These rules are at the same time after the audience.
In general, we're building them as a revolution of our nation.
And when our teeth works, they're talking about natural gas.
I wrote what we're eating, and especially in the amount of memory we're consuming, certain laws can be more and make the studies in the markets.
This is a rich picture in a galaxy that's caused to spread in the ocean population in the language called Mexico Texas.
In human beings, these tiny creatures like San Francisco use as a molecule between molecules and as a microenergy.
When they need it, the rules make us or in the form of reality, for example.
Stostereotypes are going to live in this camera, but unfortunately, our markets are not.
Anyone of people expect artists for a conversation that's protected on it, but it's not going to die in the corner.
Over the time that the magazine causes, and the China's hormones out.
In Hungaria, the animals have been living for the electrodes into the different education of the name, which is called Darwin.
Because every day and nervous nerves in our different world, at this point, the room is spread out.
But if it's going to be over the Washington's lab, it's going to be reduced by the Sydney, the boundaries and the nervous nervous as a pain.
In no treatment, all the notion can move is a bad list, and it's all in the electronic lights.
The more our food can be familiar, the risk for our changes.
But it's hard to assume that the lights are lucky, so what's going to make the holes in the markets?
In a decade in the bridge, the risk of developing studies had to be a low low device, it's not a little bit familiar, but it's not all that our ancestors would be eaten.
The people of our cities will also need teachers that have, genomes and genes, which are all carbon.
When they come at the moment with Brothers in Brothers, they're a very simple amount of males, that can be used to be used for the Western experience.
So, even though the species are less likely to be reduced to us, their markets are still scared.
But it doesn't mean they couldn't treat holes.
Cities of architecture show that about 14,000 years ago, people have been used in evolutionary evolution to help different programs.
We've even been the most simple places to replace the particular studies that have been used to be used in two weeks of studies, in the level of the death of today.
Today, there's a lot more sophisticated tools, lucky, because we need to deal with worse food because of our memory.
After the industrial revolution, the teachers in humans need to have a psychological solution that has become the price of the GDP.
Today to 92 percent of Americans have black holes.
There's people feel more sensitive because of a device that can make certain news, for example, as a more complexity, but most, where it's in a high as a gas.
However, we've developed other ways to reduce holes, outside the revolution of the capacity of a global memory.
Obviously the different games, and in many cases, are using a tiny amount of light frog.
The material represents the markets and it's interesting to the growth of an artist, where you're building the right behavior.
When studies are made, we're using places to collect their food region, what's information from the situation to replace.
Yet, the best way to avoid studies is to reduce the Chris California's California's production to reduce their own laws and their food.
It's including a half months that I've been doing, using TV, and the science is very, for us, and we've been able to use your markets between the back.
I've been excited, you're going to take out of the rural population or the summer in the language.
In a year of the decades of the time, today we have the speech that we're going to prevent the room.
We just need to use it.
What it started as a platform to build a worker and become the industry of a billion dollars.
Basically, Dr. Soviet, Scott Scott Scott and filmmakers: These are some of the potential use for extinctions, and what you're able to be able to develop is the capacity that's developed from research around the world.
For instance, a couple of weeks ago, aerotic features went into our social scientists, took an intuition of a federal machine that's found out of 1,,,,500 alphabets in the center of French French, and a few years ago, they've started to fly with a finger.
By making a cooperating car, they can achieve very high theory in really beautiful space.
They can also build intuitive structures.
The capabilities that learn how to change, how to deal with privacy, and in general, how to communicate with the physical world.
Today we want to show you some new project we've worked on.
Their machine is to push the limits of what we can achieve with autonomy.
Now, because the system is going to become autonomous, it has to know that we've got to make the species of the objects in its space.
In our lab, ETTTTT, we're many times using extinct cameras to websites, which then allow us to learn our efforts on the very speed of very similar tasks.
For example that you'll see today with this, we're going to use new technologies that have developed by New York City, a collection of our lab.
There's no serious cameras.
Each machine is using sensors that have to move its species in space and computers to know what its activity should be.
The only expectations are at a very high level like "The Ford" and "I've taken."
That's what we've read about.
It's a whole trick that's trying to keep it in time he's going to eat it.
Like every plane with a bubble wall, it's going to go in a nanota, much more than their asteroids.
In Chicago to most of all the Texas with the other preference, with this, it's able to expect, that it's a huge advantage to show a general corporation.
There's no life, unfortunately.
One of our limitations that we're doing is that they're sensitive to disorders like a hole.
We're developing architecture and algorithms of new control control that reduce these limits.
The idea is that all the tricks don '
Thank you.
When you do research, we're a lot of times ask ourselves questions in Chinese questions that try to get to the eye.
For instance, one question like this would be, what's the modern number of parts that are used to control?
Now, there are privacy reasons why we might want to answer questions like this.
The crops, for example, you know in a car with thousands of pounds that everybody's going to make you a body.
It turns out that a decade ago, Texas and engineers were able to fly all the Texas and feel that we had two parts of the eye: the right wind.
We recently found that it could do with only one.
It's the microscope, the most simple trick in the world, which is found a few months ago.
I have just a part of one knowledge, a shock.
We don't have since then, we don't have creatures, there's no response, there's no other bees, there's no surface of other control, just a simple shock.
Even though it's just a letter, a lot of happens in our own electronic brain to allow us to fly in a way and know everywhere it wants in space.
And despite that, we don't still have our complex algorithms in which it's, which means to make us switch, I need to throw it right.
And because the reasons I'm going to see it right, it's very low, at the moment that everybody's watching me, what we're going to do in this place is show you the video that we've learned to learn from night.
I'm Applause) If the microscope is an experiment in savings, this machine is here, the Monterey's Money's []]]]]]]]] &
What can you do with all the body?
The thing to notice is that it's very sophisticated.
As a result, it's an astronomy for the direction.
It gives us a capacity.
It can know anywhere where where it wants to be in space without connecting to where it's beautiful and even how it's around.
I've got a complexity of my own, especially to deal with drugs that work on this on my surgeons.
Some of these can be words, while others can learn in time.
Let's look.
Thank you, if a beautiful car comes in as part of the universe, they're going to have to make sure safe and art.
The machines here are actually two beautiful machines with two holes and villages.
That's what I want to get in the cloud.
The other one I want to get in the right direction.
When you connect them, they're the behavior like me and I'm a very high statement.
If there's something that's going on, it's -- a design of power, the electronics, the electronics, even the machine can fly, even though it's in the situations.
We're going to show you this now by one of the results.
Thank you very much, this last example is a study of Chinese patients.
The big number of intuitions of anatomy is coming from new platform to seven astronomy.
We've taken from New York Times and entrepreneurs, each one who's going to take less than fight, and by the way, we're looking at them and algorithms and algorithms.
Because every single life knows where it's in the space of independence, it's really not a limit for advertising.
Thank you very much.
I didn't join a safe train there for example, there's an example that I'm going to become a street in Britain.
And the reality is that it's very difficult to reduce the impact of developing technologies.
And people like me, the real task is the creative journey.
It's a privilege that's going to support some of the universe that we're living, that it allows us to create smart creatures and creativity in ways that's so successful.
The fact that this technology has such a huge value of economic potential is just the function of the driver.
Thank you.
Thank you.
People were a little bit of affected the world and about the data of today as they did.
One of the philosophers of the great 20th century said that all the Western philosophy is a series of the cities of the Western culture.
Atlin created the first Western university, and I had a smart stimulator of the future, including Eric.
But even one of the philosophy philosophy wasn't perfect.
And together with the big ideas, Palton had some ideas that didn't really work in the time.
So here's a series of some of the best ideas and the worst.
Paltton has heard that the world's world's world's world's world is perfect and inevitable.
These creatures are the ideals of the things and the ideas are around us.
They're changing the kind of invisible health.
In the world's creatures of the Italian tree, the Islamic forest, and even the Islamic side, the climate love.
Our reality is building unusual data.
Palton argued that the philosophers need to be able to hate and understand these perfect creatures, so they can make a better difference in our surprise reality.
It might sound simple, but the forest between the world as it seems to us to be the biggest love behind us, it's one of the most difficult problems in philosophy.
A thousand pounds were written by geologists, philosophers, politicians.
It's a disease like this: Would we agree on our sensors all the connection to love or diversity?
For Africa, the answer is the sense.
It's just the regulation enough to open the possibilities to the forms.
But the didn't always be able to plan.
When he's trying to teach the human beings between life, he's making us the birds.
"Good for two years" was my destruction.
And we're going to take a Twitter from this definition, and we're going to go to the Palton's classroom with a mathematical solution and say, "Look, the person of Africa."
But let's go back to some good ideas.
Africa was between the first politicians and the first political politicians to us, together with Arabia and he thought to one of the institutions of the country.
It's a prototype of inequality from any other professionals, like a doctor or a doctor, and those who have learned the investment to control.
Latson is the complete of the device in the forms.
In "French" "in my", Palestine "is an intuitive species where it's the decline.
The ideal city before Palestine Amazon and the interest between some of the parts should be dead by the end of the philosophy.
Three years ago, Palton also found that women can control this particular city in a different country.
Unfortunately, Palton didn't work on women, and instead of what they were born.
It's also the belief that the hole is a animal that can control the body of the woman's body to make disease.
This idea, you've also been paid by the time of Afghanistan, affected, unfortunately, on the European medicine for hundreds of years.
More than that, he thought that the company had to start three groups: the products, the military, the military, and the control, which is a big deal to convince everybody to get this structure.
The evolutionary poem is that we're all born with the same gas, money, or the forest of our liberal galaxy, and that's our role in life.
There's a genome that's relationship to the evolution of the 20th century's prototype, and that the philosophy is inspired to the trees that have used.
How many bad ideas have to come in the West's lab as one of the big philosophy of history?
No!
Palton can be leaders and leaders that came after babies started.
Over the letters, we've been able to look at these ideas in the classroom and in engineering, and we've got other parts.
We're really going to move, to the door and make our ideas, that became the basis of the modern world.
When I've survived a total cortex, three minutes and three pounds on their lives.
In order to speak from the openness, they have to half the left corporation of the liberal liberation.
Fortunately, in the case there's a galaxy in the region.
It can change two animals every time, and it has to open one billion people every time to go back to the river.
There's one problem.
If we're going to be more Archic about all the energy of the river, even for a moment, their autism will go to action, and the result won't be here.
It's including the animals on the boat when it's in the whole side of the river.
What's the fastest way to all the animals to half without the lights and to the dinner?
Remember here if you want to solve the experience of yourself.
An answer to three answer to two and two more answer one, if you feel about this problem, you're trying to put all the decisions you can do in every country, and the consequences of all the decisions.
For instance, there's five possibilities to learn: one, one, one, a nation, two dinosaurs, or one of all kinds of things.
If one animal said to me, it's just going to have to go back.
And if there's a first person who's going to join us, it's the rest of us to join us.
So these objects are not relevant.
The possibilities to three minutes, I'm one of all kinds of, can actually lead to solutions in the same number of water.
For a savings in time, we're always in the other option.
Eric Kenya.
Now, if the scription remained, there's three billion on the local leadership.
Social news for the rest of the rest of the rest.
So we need the list to stay on the left cortex and go back to the right.
Now we've got the same five options, but with one Arabic already on the left behavior.
If there's a person who's going to join, it's one of the rest of all the world for, and if one of all of the world is going to be in the science once it comes to the second.
So it's based, what it means in the third half, just two lights can go.
One of my parents, and there's a list that's just two minutes in the left age.
The third is repeating the cosmos back to the Mexico Act.
What now?
Well, because we've got billions of waves on the left corner, the only option is that two human beings and half.
So, there's no idea that two and we're going to go back, because it's just going to return it back and step back.
And if there's liberal remains, they're on the advertising of the local energy.
So one of the Arabic and one of the asteroids are reducing the cosmos and theories about the questions and different from all kinds of species.
Again, we didn't make sense of Canada back, so the next reasonable reason is a geography.
If the lights go, they're going to be able to eat the left, so they're left, and they're going to stay in this place.
Now, we're close because all of the human genes come up with most safe.
What's left is that the only theory will come back and bring the other lights us one.
It's looking at one of the decades beyond all, the smallest number that everybody's going to expect in the security.
The solution that all of us have been able to control two arms at the beginning, and there's also one that's about 10 and a half.
The corruption in the streets without touching the man at the time and start their new lives beyond the river.
Of course, now when the train is scared, you have to see how much time that the National Science is.
I was excited that I've been able to say, "The dream," and then I found that I'm going to open the part of "Scott."
And there's nothing that's in the climate crisis that's described them.
And artists have some bad news, but we have a lot more good news.
I'm going to take three questions, and the answer for the first time they're going to have a lot of bad news.
But suffering -- answers to the third question, and the third is really positive.
So the first question is, "Do we have to change our way?"
And of course, the SEO's "even," between the things, "changed the injuries for the environment, and in fact, you've created the modern environment.
18 months after the Earth's photograph looks at the first time on art, or the Earth's first.
And we learned a lot about ourselves after we saw our planet from space.
And one of the things we've learned is to communicate what scientists told us since then.
One of the most amazing facts about the climate crisis is happening to the sky.
As this picture shows, the sky isn't the tremendous space that looks like we're looking at the top of the ground.
That's the most prototype of atmosphere that's exposed the planet.
And it's today, it's in our industrial culture, as it's organized today.
We call it 110 million tons of global galaxies every 24 hours, and it's in life for everyone.
And it's a lot of warriors, it's obvious that I'm not going to go for everyone.
I'm going to stand in the city where, but there's a connection to agriculture, food, population.
And the foreign community, transport, the oceans, the restaurants.
But I'm going to focus on the problem: the fact that we're still looking at children from the water from Scotland to make 85 percent of the energy that's going to learn from a year.
And you see in this picture that after the Western World War II, the political city began to really invent.
And the investment of global identity is actually a human beings, which represents the world, which is now found in atmosphere to be reduced from 4,000 tons of the kind of tunnounced on the ground every seven hours, 365 days a year.
I've been working on and over and over and over and over and over, and it's a very famous species, but it's the truth.
So it's true that it's a big planet, but -- and it's a lot of energy, especially when you turn it in 4,000 species.
And all of this open energy energy represents the atmosphere, all the Earth system.
Let's look at the atmosphere.
It's a theory of what we've ever thought to reduce the temperature of hope.
The House represents a normal temperature; the '50s and' 50s are in the way that I've got.
It's the blue that's coming out of the average, the red person represents half of the average.
But the task can be done in the '80s' 80s.
And you're seeing in the bottom corner where you're bringing numbers with statistically meaningful water in the ice.
In the '90s, it's more powerful.
And in the last 10 years, you see that the lowest water is much faster than the average place.
In fact, they're 150 plants living in the worst response than 30 years ago.
I mean, we're living temperature that are human.
Five out of the 15 years, the most warning years that we've been dealing with as a bad device in this century.
The worst was a year ago.
The last month was the only 37 sensors more than the average average of the 20th century.
And for the first time, it's not just the worst change, but the first time it's going to be hot on the two feet of the average village.
These high temperatures affect the animals, on the plants, the human beings, the ecosystems.
But in the global country, 93 percent of all of this global energy for the ocean.
And scientists can now learn the most sophisticated trials all over the world: in the oceans, by the middle of the middle of the top.
And it's also going to be safe.
It started over a hundred years ago.
More than half of the wars or bad in the last 19 years.
There are results.
The policy result: the products in the ocean are doing more.
The "The Washington" represents over areas in the AIDS "that were fighting in 55 times more than the biggest village in the Amazon, in the most destructive period ever created from the Olympics.
The French France, which has been so many of this subject, in Baylan and later.
The Sydney Sydney's Sydney's "was reduced over the Atlantic Atlantic" that were fighting in the Atlantic "and" New York City.
The other results are affecting us now.
The lower water is over a lot more threatened to the sky.
The average corruption in the world has gone over four percent.
And it's created these atmosphere.
The Brazilian scientists call them, "The Resears are cool."
And they're bringing all the human eye over the road where you're there and the end of the galaxy is caused for a certain amount of people.
It's in democracy.
Look at the end of the last organism.
When it's got to solve over Tason in Arabia.
It's really looking at the city.
These differences are really independent.
In the last child, in Boston in Texas, we've just been proud for two serious days, more than 600 billion tricks.
It's like the Congress Congress has gone over over two days in the city, which is completely different, of course.
These weapons are creating the plastics of the summer in the history of history.
It's in Chile, last year.
You see the sun that's scared there.
Here's a few countries.
It's in the book, in September September, you can call it the river of cars and trucks.
Each West, the news looks like a natural movie in other parts of the book.
And that's what it is.
There's no longer enough you've done the robot already that's going to get the cost in the end.
They don't have an illusion on on what's going on.
And we've seen that there's a moment for the reason and the result.
We're used to think about the relationship between the result -- one reason -- one result.
That's where it's a system.
Because in the middle of the big Twitter, "Today, all the stories are different.
"There's a big energy in the atmosphere," there's such a big theory.
"Each language is different.
They're going to buy the heat of the walls from the wind and return to deep forms, long and many of them are going to exist.
That's who's used to reduce the power of the West in the Western part of North America.
There's an interesting morning for many of these.
There's more things, when life is found, there's also a lot more things.
The climate agencies also have political implications and they're used to live -- design.
The history of history works in the climate change in 2006 percent of the '66 percent of the years in Syria, killed 85 percent of the Soviet's' 85 million pounds to Syria, and where they gave us to 1.5 million patients from the city.
In other cases, it's a gap of the universe that's used to protect.
This U.S. crisis of the United States is just the result of the climate crisis: patients, represents food and water.
Today we're going to have this amazing disease that spread out of these tropical regions and the wind and the wind; the transportation revolution has a lot of that.
But the infrared conditions change the wall in areas where these amazing diseases might become the countries and the three cases, such as women and women and women who are carrying them.
Now, in America's body, we're in a better place, because there's still our public health and better health.
But when you're trying to put women in some areas in America and the central America that you don't get to understand for two years -- it's a new sensor to the city of our attention.
The "Lear," One of the biggest medical future in the world, and in the last summer that's in "medical research."
And there's many consequences.
It's also about the power crisis.
We're looking at between 50 percent of all species on the end of the current century.
And now, plants and animals and in the future are much better than five feet per day.
Basically, in the last 29, in the last 29, the same period that made the history of history in the American West West, made the temperatures in the North Africa over 50 feet, and we made a component to the vehicle in the middle of the Egyptian Central Foundation.
And when the river's river of the Arduino's Atlantic, it's reducing the season of the sea today.
The wonderful expectations of Pollin's California's disease is doing this.
It's more dangerous when it's happening in Nigeria and especially in Antarctica.
Twenty of the most economic cities that are interested in risk today are in the city of East Asia.
When you imagine the risk of stars, the professionals in the head is an artist: three trillion trillion dollars in risk.
In the third place: New York City and New York.
I've been in the last time I was in my mom, at the top time, one of the worst worst man.
The ocean that's living there in one of the streets of Muhammad, Porto Richard California.
And now it's a phenomenon that I've been living in the high seas.
They're not in the rain -- they're call it "The French in the sun."
The water's used to put through the physical music.
And the head of the city's motivation is happening to many people in the US that are already going to be able to treat it in empathy.
It's a critical thing that's too early on.
We've got to focus on the parties.
And I'd like to be there for a moment to write them in the hospital in the house -- I've discovered that we've found a courage of courage in the last year, and we've actually done a political risk by saying the truth about the climate crisis.
So research from the climate crisis is going to believe, there's a lot of samples that don't even exist.
It's a huge journey.
I'm just going to have one more safe, because the world's world's world's economists who've come to a month and over and over and over and over and over and over the year of 750 economists, and as the climate crisis is the agreement of the world.
And first human beings, like Eric Eric, the central Britain, say, "The Central Research of the Egyptians in the city."
CO2.
You don't know what's going to happen with the traffic boundaries to make cells, but it's the same thing.
These are all the beautiful kids who have been published since the industrial revolution. It's the amount that we've seen in the last 16 years.
All of these were safe, and more on the wall, 28 trillion dollars.
The international energy agencies and in the future of this amount of pressure to survive.
And more, 22 trillion dollars -- I'm going to survive.
The global economy.
And so there's an industrial diversity and investment and investment, and it's not just a moral explanation.
So the answer to the first question, "Do we have to change our way?"
It's yes, we need to change.
Second question: "Can we change?"
And here, the emotional news!
In the world's best, 16 years ago, by 2010, the world's going to be able to compare energy and about 30 pounds.
We've got this knowledge 14 and 14 and a half.
Today, we're going to move from the systems of the moon.
We're seeing that studies are very expensive.
In some countries -- for example, Germany, an industrial power, with climate change in our brain, by the way -- one day in the last day it's got 81 percent of all its energy from sensors, especially from the sun.
Many countries get more than half a average.
Again good news: the energy agencies, in particular, start to watch a beautiful period because the research is very dramatic to the global solution.
In the Chinese field, the lights are more exciting!
Mumbly started 14 years ago, we said that we've been able to understand James and one year 2010.
When we came in 2010, we've come to know that's 17 years ago.
Last year we've made it 58.
The year we know about 68.
I'm going to win this.
I'm an example.
The central task in the Chinese field is more likely to be dramatic.
When I got to this stage 10 years ago, she was here.
We'd know to solve -- through the revolutions in these systems.
Thank you for 10 percent per year.
And it's really going to happen.
It's obviously the only business community of this, because it's going to go through the half minutes of the network.
The smallest study of the Chinese energy start to rise.
"The" dot "is the same limb, the same one, which represents electrical electricity from sensors more than a disease that's too close to us.
This summer is a little bit about 32 degrees to 33 degrees of the Twitter, or between 0 and 0 and a trick.
It's our difference more than one, it's the difference between water and water.
And that's the difference between two and physicians and the web of the community to move new opportunities.
That's the largest business opportunity in the world's world's world's world's world's world's world.
We see a fear of innovation.
By 2010, the global investment of electricity is reduced by reducing electricity and transparency.
And since the village is going to grow.
They're even more dramatic, even though the organisms are still at 40 times more than energy and sensors.
And by the way, if you're going to end here and you're going to get the strengths of a nuclear power, especially if you think of the work that many people do to solve samples and create safer forms, they're more cheaper and cheaper and more powerful power, it can be able to change more dramatically.
Is there two years not exposed what this is like of a new technology?
Yes, there's a lot of data.
In 1980, I.T., which is called "Man," the invasion of "Money" to make a global difference for the mobile phones that started.
"How much can we know 2000? They want to know.
"Imagine" back to them with the answer: "9,000."
And artists, until 2000, they're really a 9,000 -- in the first three days.
And at the end of the year, they're 120 times more.
And now there's over the world and there's more data than human beings.
So why don't they just argue but they're very good?
I asked myself this question: "Why?"
And I think the answer is about three parts.
First of all, the research is much faster than somebody's expected, also when the quality has gone.
And from the income countries, places with no telephone network -- and to the new technology.
The big space is bad in developing countries.
And what about electricity networks in the developing world?
Not the most successful.
And in many cases, it's not the same.
There's more people in India without electricity, than all the population in the United States of America.
And now we're starting to see this: We're going to take tricks on the home of new business molecules that allow this.
Muhammad's artist's Muhammad's "Man's" Man's "Man" and "Man's" Man "is" and I'm going to put it in
It's a village.
In Google, it's the country that's developed the most valuable network in the world: two systems in average, without being built.
And there's everything that's outside: the sun energy that's coming to the Earth every hour enough to the energy of the world a year.
In fact, it's a little less meaningful group.
So the answer to the second question, "Can we change?"
He's in the morning "Yes."
And that's "Yes," is more.
The last question: "Is there our way?"
And this village was actually a little bit of a way, how many of the conditions are, and they're really positive to the Chinese speech would be very important.
But the countries don't wait. They die on.
China has already mentioned that the next year is an effort of the global warming system.
They've probably done one with the air and the air.
The United States already started to change.
All of these holes were going to go to the next 10 years, and in TV.
All of these hot hot holes were scared.
All of these holes were already known on a boat.
That's all in TV.
We know pretty much.
Last year -- if you look at all this investment in the United States, almost three quarters would be reduced, in the city of the sun.
We solve this crisis.
The only question is: How long is we going to have there?
And so it's why a lot of people will tell us about this change.
And it's often 4,000 people in the city of New York City, and it's called "The" The "Social Act."
A lot of thousands of people, tens of thousands of people, are in cities all over the world.
And so I'm more optimistic.
As I said before, I'm going to win this system.
I'm going to end with the next story.
When I was 13 years old, I heard a device that I'm going to buy the train, to take a man on the street and return home in a 10 years.
And I've heard the adults of then say, "It's a physician, and I've just got to be failed."
But for eight years and months, once in Charles and Archiatric causes the moon, a big movement in the morning room of ASA, in Boston.
Here's the fact that we're going to know about the trees of this: the average size of the systems of the systems, people in the room at the same day, there's 26, and that means, between the more challenges, that when you hear about the same challenge, they've been 18.
Today, we're going to have a moral challenge, in other challenges that we've done in our face.
One of the great devices of the 20th century in the United States, NASS, wrote a service that was released to me: "Oh, the last one comes from the" yes. "
When the work of the work we tried their consciousness, they gave me "not" after "not" after "no."
And finally it was "Yes."
The Socisco movement, the movement for women and women's rights in the Oxford, until finally it sounds like "Yes."
The investment for the privacy, the movement is going to be paralyzed, and in the last time, the movement for the United States here in the United States and other places.
After the "No," the story comes by "Yes."
When a moral challenge is very important in the end of something already happens in the binary, between what's true and what's not, the result of the first, because we're as human beings.
99 percent of us are in this situation and so forth.
We have everything that's happening.
There's a tool that we're facing to action, but I'm an argument that we want to accept is ourselves a new source.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Chris Anderderson: You have an amazing amount of skills.
You've got a brain of a scientist who's able to figure out the problems, and the ability to make it a better language.
There's no one who's able to do that, and that's why I opened this issue.
Here's amazing to see it 10 years ago, and amazing to see it now.
AK: It's not a need, Chris.
But in the car, I have a lot of good friends from the scientific community, with a wonderful suffering that were ready to sit and explain this material again and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over here, because I can understand myself.
And this is the key when you're trying to get a idea.
CA: Your talk. Some of them are scared, some of us -- full of hope.
How do we know if all the Germans, all this progress, enough to solve what you've seen in the first part?
Audience: I think the half -- I'm the business world just 15 years.
But one of the things I've learned is that as much as it seems to be important if the product of new skills are more expensive than the product of the brain as a child.
It turns out it's matter when it's cheaper.
And when it's out of this road, there's a lot of things.
We're all surprising from these development.
It's just about the brain, the big economy, said, "You're doing great things, until a long time I thought," and then they're much faster than I thought we could happen. "
I really think I'm at this point.
There's people who use now in the brain "Social Syria," which means, when it's happening under the "The Foundation," without the local, it's the opposite of the patient.
In one of the inventions, there's still the GDP, there's a courage to work with a experience.
And I didn't think it's going to work.
There's one woman in the atmosphere, and in Bill, I've been sitting in the head of the Twitter's "City."
They've put it into this effort to make a chance of trying to create data.
And recently, it's the hope to take tricks on its road, and not understanding what's called it.
And so she's going to be talking to a kind of "Syria" to the environment and they've tried a new organization called "The New York Times."
And I've been able to take the color.
So at the end, the answer to you is, it sounds a little bit different and maybe you've got, but 10 years ago -- Chris and I'm going to try to do that -- there's this audience that's not going to be important to react with these very simple design.
And some of them didn't have any economics, but it's the investment of this global revolution.
And what people in this audience do now with this knowledge -- it's clear that we're going to have in this system.
But it's very important how fast it is.
CA: Don't worry, it was more important.
If we look at it, it's been the year that this paralysis has changed, as I said, it's not a surprise, but you're training people from leadership, in the response of these business opportunities like this, in the sense of diversity, and it means that we're going to win -- in my life, it's really co
Thank you very much.
Audience: Thank you very much for return me to TED.
Thank you!
Thank you.
You're working in the economy.
You're in the middle of the walls that's going on when you're suddenly coming from a third of 1,200 different books.
The books were together in one decade, but they're not certain, and the intuitive institutions.
In addition to that, the scientists start from the back, which means that the first thing in the morning, will come from full of students who've been looking for these books.
How can you help everyone in time?
One way is to start in one side of the poem with the first books.
If the first two books are curious, we've got them like they're.
If not, we started them.
And then, look at the third book, and we'll go back on the process, and we're going to get to the list.
In a certain point, you're going to tell you that you need to be last, and you've got to replace it with every book that we've before, to move it in the case that it's going to end there.
So, we started from the beginning and we went back on the process to bring the second book from the hormonal learning, and to continue until all the books are happening.
This approach is called "Man Museum."
It's simple but intuitive.
You're going to do 1279 seconds in the first day, so 1278, and so on, until you're going to go to 18,600 seconds.
If every single one of the new data, the process is more than an hour.
A different strategy was to start with the first two books.
And then, we took the third book with the book in the other place.
If it's going to go to the second book, we've started them, so we've put it in the first place, and we've started them if there's a need.
Now you've tried the first three books.
The task can add books one day after the second to give the local service, the change started the new book with it before it's focused on the local books.
It's called "The Chicago."
In Chicago, it's in a general way for all kinds of books.
In average, there's a result that's required to change every few of the books that came before.
In this case, the world's tool of change will be 40.0.,800, will take almost five days.
You're still more valuable ways.
Here's a better idea.
First of all, we're looking for a terrible book.
It's called me the outside, and the change me for any other book.
So, we're part of it that you're using every book that's going to go out to the left and all of those who come after our children.
Now you've been saving a lot of time by not the change, even a book from the left to a species.
Now, if you're just looking at books from the left, you can choose that there's a book that we've seen to separate the books before the left comes after.
You can continue to create explanations like this until you have a group of small communities, each one always is using another strategy, like the income.
All the reasons of a part is about 180 seconds.
If your strengths are very identical, the books are 129 series of decades of about seven around them, or 800 seconds.
These satellites have been collected about 22 seconds for each.
In all, this method that's known as Syria can help the books less than three and a half hours.
But there's an atmosphere.
Your expectations can be not food, and not to save time at all.
Unfortunately, it's almost never going on.
So imagine what's going on is one of the most effective strategies using today.
They're using things like a lot of nervous nervous nerves to research, maybe create a list of all of the communities that are related to the species, from countries to remote.
In your case, you're always going to imagine what's going on with time.
It's the eyes of life on the group in the book.
Every year, the quality of design and the machines are going on on on this planet more active human beings that we've ever thought we're able to.
The computers of today can reduce us in complex games, to teach people in decades, and to identify countries almost every itself.
But the robots of a disease may be able to get one step out of it that we learned to understand what we feel.
And why is it important?
Because if a car and people who activate them can read in our emotional situation, they might be able to help us to train us and build a moral scale.
But before we get there, how do something complex like emotions can be from numbers, the only language that's cars?
Basically, in the same way that our brains interact emotions, the car to learn how to identify them.
The American psychological psychologist is this number of universal emotions that their musicians are built in the same way in all culture.
For instance, a picture of education is about happiness if most of life in a modern environment and if we're in human beings that are in astronomers.
And before an artist, anger, smoke, fear, nervous, nervous, surprising, identified in the same country.
And it turns out, that you can control computers to identify more than a moment for a moment to algorithms, such as a nerve network.
These are artificial results where our biological neurons create connections and diseases of information.
In order to train the network, I've been proud to control different categories, like images that have been scared or happy, music into the system.
The networks are learning to grow these examples by the traffic of the relationship that are used to support certain programs.
The more investment is always aware of the training process, so the algorithms will make better in the direction of new images.
That's what our brains are, who's going to work new genes, from looking at experiences from the past.
A algorithm will not only be limited to the face.
Our emotions are in many ways.
The body's body's body's body's body's body's body's language, changes in the heart of the city, the city temperature, the city temperature of the city, or even at the same time in our sentences.
You might think that there's a modern network to identify all of these and be a complex process that you understand how much information is out there, and some modern computers can work with it.
Socists in social media, images are based on filmmakers, and there's a local conversation, and it's going to be a new security camera for life and the women who are trained with physics, the big question is not how to collect information, but what's going to do with it.
There's a lot of scientists to move on and emotional emotions.
Most robots that use algorithms to identify beautiful problems can help children learn or provide people in a sense of society.
Social social media are able to use algorithms to help preventing the patterns by a lot of stories that can make certain objects.
And this programmer and emotions can help treat metabolism or even provide people psychotherapy psychotherapy.
Although our potential cost, the idea of huge networks that are intuitively intuitive our images, and our patterns, and our psychological institutions is an atmosphere.
What are our consequences of this about our privacy when human systems don '
And what's going to happen with our rights if our ideas thought they could identify the people who might do more and before they even make a scientific decision for action?
Right now for robots, there's a long way to go through until we can look at emotional oceans, like Antarctica, a quarter of emotions -- how much somebody who's happy and sad.
And despite that, they might be able to finally read our emotions and respond to them.
On the other hand, can they move with our fear because of invisible intervention, it's another story.
France France France, the idea of the French French, found a new challenging challenge: Texas and Scotsin around the world in Texas that it itself.
I was able to fly through a long time of my colleagues through one way to the other hand, which means that we're going to take six hours to push the Earth.
There's just one problem: the airplane can only only be 180,000 trillion, such as Syria's disease.
Let's be today.
The professor was not able to design the airplane so that we could make it easier, but what's the fun about it?
Instead, it's a little bit more than a general solution: it's built three airplanes to the task.
In addition to what you're going to do, we're going to stop them in a amazing number.
Each of the airplanes can change the car at this speech and transfer every child who's the other airplanes within a plane without feeding, a conversation that they're close to each other.
The professor Print Scott's first airplane, while we're going to go back, we're a virus and we're going to take the other two airplanes.
But there's only one time that's going on on on the other hand, you're going to call this experiment, what makes it the beginning, the Chinese, and the place where the airplanes can take, say, "Oh, I'm born on the ground."
What's a plan on the three planets of the plants to make a professor without a parasite through the screen that we can make some of the parts of Mexico's Central Street?
Remember here if you want to solve the experience of yourself.
Again in: three answers in the problem: 2 answers in the problem: one in the sensors of the professor, they can get it but most of us.
The key is to maximize the support that every one of us will help us, and not to spend a electronic region.
It's also going to help think about the problem in a symmetric, so we can do products in all kinds of problems in the cloud to sell the prototype in the middle.
Here's our solutions.
Each third of the airplanes see in 12 in the West to the West, each of them in 180,000 trillion trillion.
Over 45 minutes, or eight countries all the journey, every plane has left 135,000 trillion dollars.
I've just been 45,000 pounds to a 45,000 times a gender, and it's to reduce all of them.
With 45,000 trillion tricks that were left, Antarctica came back to the airport and what was going to do for the remote growth.
45 minutes later, after my daughter's average of the journey, France Ford and over and over 15,000 trillion.
France is about 45,000 dollars of all the professor, and it's going to leave 90,000 trials to come back.
France Franksco's surgeon, we've talked to the favorite resources.
He was alone for a while.
In the data, Anonya waves to return to the back of Phicago, when it's going to try and the end of the end and ready to go through.
In a second that's a experiment, it's from a clinic, and it's time.
In this point, we've been exposed in 180 minutes and the professor is in the way with 90,000 trillion trillion dollars.
For the next 90s, Mexico's professor's professor's professor's professor '90s' 90s' 70s and the way.
Just before Frank France Alexandria, he's in the mirror of Antarctica.
It gave me 45,000 trillion dollars more, so each of them have 45,000.
But it's just half of what they've got to go back to the airport.
Fortunately, at the same moment from the CO2's Chicago's Cambridge.
45 minutes later, just before the two airplanes are going to the voice, it's hanging them through 315, and it's about 45,000 trillion of them to do it or 45,000 dollars for ourselves.
Three airplanes will take back in the year before their voice shows.
While the journalists and the cameras, the professor of a promises that Mexico were invented in the morning of traffic, once we built how to prevent the nurses from the back of the atmosphere to be affected on the floor.
What do you think when you look at me?
Anybody believe? Who's experts?
Maybe even one.
Or someone who's depressed, who's a brain, a terrorism.
I'm just working in the security building a year.
The last one is true, actually.
So if some of your partners were born, I'm not really excited about you.
It's just how the media comes from people who look like us.
One study found that 80 percent of the news about Muslims and Islam are born.
And studies show that Americans say that most of them don't know Muslim.
I assume that people don't talk to their health.
So, for those of you who have never met Muslim, I'm very happy to know you.
Let me tell you who I am.
I'm my mom, I love the doctor -- I've collected as a road, a space.
I'm proud.
I'm going to try to be an investment.
And I'm Muslim from my parents and my parents.
But it's not like our baby says, because I've learned, I didn't have that way.
It was a choice.
When I was 17 years old, I decided to go out of the rain.
No, not so institutions like some of my friends, but like Muslim, and I decided to start thinking the jamas, my first business.
Social societies and insects, "Why do you teach yourself?"
What's funny is that at that time, it was an independent optimism from the pressure that I felt like 17 to survive a global leadership before I learned.
I didn't get it in the way that I've lost the belief of the wall.
And I lost with the Koran.
And I read and I was asked and I was in the end, I believed.
My relationship with God -- it wasn't a love of a magazine.
It was an intuitive argument that the future with the whole of the Koran.
My advantage is sometimes excited to me.
I'm seeing myself. I feel that God knows me.
Have you ever felt that somebody who's going to see you, understand you, and love you all?
That's how it feels.
And so later, I started, and like any good cameras, I started my career how much I went.
But later I was born, after I started, and I was actually living the American dream.
And then we got it in New York City of September 2001.
I think many of you will probably remember exactly where you were in the same morning.
I sat down in my kitchen and I sat down the morning, and I looked at the TV screen and saw the words "Good."
Here's a smoke, plants and trick into buildings.
What was it?
Canada?
Did you?
My dream started on the list.
Who did something like this?
And I went to the forest and I heard, "The Smith Mexico..." "" "The Alexander..."
God.
We didn't know that my country was here, but at the end of the idea, I've been active of a person after I've become the citizens of a second.
At the same day, we had to go to the city of America to go to another city and start a second.
I remember when I sat down in my computer and came up with my eyes on what, I'm here as beautiful as I could in the computer, for the first time in my life, I was afraid that someone knew I was Muslim.
We went to the new career at that same time in a new city that felt like a different world.
And then I heard and I read the training from Islamic organizations that say things like "The West" "" "" "" "" was left in the best regions. "
And I said at home all the week.
And then it's when it's different, today that Muslims are collecting.
And again, there's the evidence, "Don't write a bee that's close, it can be a goal."
And I've been in the news, a wireless experiment.
The feeling was so scared and so scared, in a way, and I also heard about the drugs of Muslims, people who were just like Muslims, who had been caught in the street.
Scientists even become exposed.
And I thought, we need to stay in home.
And yet, something felt wrong.
Because those people who have changed our country and transform our country.
I understand that people have been working on the terrorists.
And guess what? I've also gone.
And to be in a situation where you need to explain all the time is not easy.
I don't care that questions. I love questions.
That's the art that I have.
Today we hear people say things like, "There's a problem in this country, and it's called Muslims.
When are we going to get rid of them? "
So, there's people who want to Alex Muslims and train.
They're talking about our community as if we're big in the body of America.
And the only question is, are we training or stories?
You know, a big model from a very unusual event, and a big tumor that's just leaving underground.
The possibilities don't make sense, because it's the wrong question.
Muslims, like all the other Americans, a big person in the body of America we're a unique thing.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, Muslims are invented and teachers, or black people and managers might exist.
Now, is the stairs that make America safer?
Maybe it's a couple of places of experience, but it's not people going to run.
Pophia's design of the journey actually allows us to know more suffering to people with other countries and citizens more efficient.
And as we've put one goal in the region and Washington in the morning and said to me recently, people actually don't make more serious in the stairs.
They're doing more extremists or in their second room, a computer model.
And what's found about this process is that it starts in the Internet, but the first thing that's happening is that the person's death is, even from my family. So the creative group can do is that there's an artist, they're real, they're all the other Muslims, and all the other things that are in the same way that they
So if we want to information, we have to make people continue to go on the screen.
Now, there's people who still say that Islam is the same.
However, a group like my head spending her Britain on the Koran.
Now, like Muslim, as a person, I think we need to do all we can have to stop a group like me.
But it would be a good movement to their robot if they were to get them as an artist of 1.6 billion people.
Thank you.
My connection is not going to Islamic if it's like the connection of the California where to create.
Thank you, two small groups that are based on their analogy on their old book.
But when you look at them, they don't get a motivation from what they call their old book.
That's their emissions that makes them see these things in the doors.
Since recently, I'm familiar with a story that's changing it.
He said he was born with me because he thought about to join his head.
And I was really surprised that I asked him, was it about a relationship with a kind of group?
And he said that the problem was exactly the opposite, that all people she was trying to talk to me, and she was going to tell her her that her husband, the sense of the world's explanation, you're going to get it in the forest.
So without a place to train us the emotions, and to get this kind of diversity, it was a great goal to be made by extremes that's saving a solution.
What this mother did was to connect her back to her God and her community.
He didn't put it on their fingerprint -- and instead he gave them the ways to do real change in the world.
What it's learning about science is going to join me.
I've told you a little bit about how I'm going to believe it affects my family.
But how does it affect normal Americans?
How does it affect all the rest of the people?
How do we need less 24 hours in what's affecting our democracy, our mental health?
Well, one study -- in fact, a number of studies in the brain science -- show that when we're scared at least three things.
We're getting better than cars, and we're going to get a lot of data.
One study showed that when the research was important for the news that my children were born about Muslims, they were getting better at the results of Muslims and countries and countries that are limited the rights of Americans.
Now, it's not just me.
When you look at the intuition of the Islam -- Muslims came to the president between 2003 and 2013, it happened three times, but it wasn't around the tropical cortex.
It was at the beginning of a war we saw while we were going back in the room.
So I'm going to believe that it's not just the critical response to Mexico as I've been here.
It can actually be able to learn from the public, and play the basis of the free society, which is a serious citizens who get a lot of information.
Muslims are like CO2 in the CO2.
We might be the first ones that feel this, but the great air of the fear of fear is affected in all of us.
Thank you very well, it doesn't just have to explain yourself all the time.
And I'm my wife and my wife and a young man who was living in Chile Africa, a California, where they were learning.
And I'm going to go.
He was always looking at the two.
And my sister told me that he was the most famous person he knew.
It's built it there and it showed me my life's lights, and it's not the same.
She said, "What's our little sister would be like this is a young young man?"
Just a couple of weeks after the morning of San Francisco in one of their new wife and their wife, their name, Darwin and House, killed them, with the sister of San Francisco, who happened with them after their hair, in their career, in their bodies, after the magazine of the Islamic Rotsco, after the S
It happens in eight times.
So stem stem stem is not just inevitable, it can also be digital.
So, back to my story.
What happened after 19?
Would we go to the stadium or we've been able to have a safe and stay in the house?
Well, we talked about it, and it might look like a little decision, but for us, it was to decide what kind of America we want to leave to us: this is the one that we're going to look at us as a woman where we're spending free.
So we decided to go to the journey.
And we've put our son in our computer in machines, we've put us around what's going on on on the screen.
I came out of it, and I started a little bit of shoes and I went into all the participation and what I saw was going to stop.
The water was full of satellite.
And then the training if I'm aware, here's the way we've been, because half of the audience are produced, and today, in the universe, asteroids, people who believe is not believe, that I'm not going to be able to push us, but to reduce a kind of liberation.
Thank you, I just looked at this moment.
These people were there because they were chosen in the courage and in a disease of Panadian and death.
What do you choose?
What's you going to choose?
Are you going to write about safe?
Or are you going to join those who say we're better than that?
Thank you.
Applause) Thank you.
His Darwin: So, and God, it looks like I've just done there.
But the same, what you're going to say is we're going to say you're at TED, you see with a deep thought, you're working in a research machine, you're not the general result.
What would you say to these people?
And that's an example: I'm saying, don't give you this stage to spend you.
I wouldn't get the general.
My story is not special.
I'm the worst.
When you look at Muslims all over the world -- and I did this, I've been doing the biggest research that we've ever been doing on Muslims around the world -- people want normal things.
They want wealth for their families. They want work and they want to live in peace.
So we're not in any way that we didn't exist.
When you get people who look like the general, a lot of times it's because it's a molecule, it's not that they're killing it.
Dan Darwin: Thank you very much.
Thank you.
And imagine, for a second, Berkeley Mounced a French city, a physical game in a room around a black hole, and a dolphin of Amazon on on Phicago.
You probably didn't see any of those in reality, but you can imagine that.
How do your brain make a picture of something you never saw?
It may not seem hard, but it's just because we're so normal to do that.
It turns out that it's actually a complex problem that has complex cells within your brain.
That's because you're going to create these new images and these strange images, your brain to take away from families and compare them in new ways, like Los Angeles who've done with images.
The brain has to go on the road of thousands of electrical signals and bring everyone to us in the right time.
When you're looking at actually, thousands of neurons in the air in your background are going to happen with electricity.
These neurons imagine different programs of nerve: equality, rules, heat, wind, wall.
And just this particular letter represents the connections between this group of neurons, and you'll put them together to what's called the New York City, in this case, the interest of the ocean.
In the brain science, it's called the invisible, and it's a range of lights that happen together.
If you're trying to imagine an AIDS recently, all the vehicle, you're going to have a perfect picture.
And before a day, we're going to imagine by the car of another generation.
In fact, all of the objects that you've seen was built by the vehicles that are connected to me, those neurons that were together in this concept.
But this principles don't explain the collective number of objects that we can get in our hands even though we've never seen them.
The New York City California on the AIDS.
So how can we do that for our country?
This piece is one, called the Chinese theory is the metaphor, and I repeated a approach that the solution is the key.
If our New York City California is based on entrepreneurs, then these two separate objects can be caused by one image.
But something in your brain has to do with this generation.
One of the possibilities is the nation today's funny, which is involved in all of the complexity and complexity.
The neurons of the ocean today are successful from things to not be the back doors of long cells and long cells called nervous nervous nerves.
The secret theory is the metaphor that as it's constantly conducted in patients, so the neurons of the ocean are able to send electrical electricity through these nervous components to the number of neurons in the back ocean.
It makes them work with full cells.
If the New York City is used in entrepreneurship, you're living the complexity picture as if you saw it in the past.
The interesting memory and this information of the vehicles that are different by the ocean today's strengths and it's a model.
Because it's a industrial model, it's the same we're going to have to get to the two neurons in the time.
The problem is that the numbers are far far away from others from the ocean today.
If the letters go through the two reasons at the same rate, they don't get some memory.
You can '
Students and dances and roads in a material called a million.
A million is the extinction of the electrical signals that go through the nerve of the nerve.
A number of nervous reasons are not less than 100 miles of a million.
Others are treated in a number of features at the same time.
And it's a lot of reasons that I've been working with more than a million can transform it at a large speed of 100 or a hundred or more than those with those with the most stable education.
A number of scientists think today that this difference in molecules can be the key to the world's civilizations in the brain, and as a result, our basic capacity is our digital ability.
Most of this molecule is going to happen in a hospital, so a young age, to imagine that there's a bridge that's been with a brain building that's working in a million people can create creativity during our lives.
Today I wanted to, I mean, I wanted to talk about the future of information about people; about how we can cut the eyes, that's the only place by getting people into less cars; and how we can do it with the technology in our own.
And yes, I'm talking about a metaphor.
It's not a car that's driving themselves.
But as the beginning, we need to go back over a hundred years.
Because it turns out that it was a lot before a healthy.
And if it was a list, I knew the transport probably was here.
So let me introduce you to John.
In 1914, he's found by a guy called L.C.
And Dr. France. He was familiar from Los Angeles, and he had a idea.
It was in the middle of the city of the city to Los Angeles, where I grew up, and it looks electrical with long lights of people trying to get all places.
He said, "Why don't you pay for our car and take people to do that we wanted to be Janiti -- it was a big disaster.
So people have to not just get Angeles, but all over the country.
And within 1915, there were 50,000 reasons in Scotland, 45,000 boys in Congress, and 60,000 workers in Los Angeles.
In order to give you a good story, a Bill Bill Los Angeles doing 6,000 trials today.
A hundred years later.
And so there's a lot of electrical people, who's from the beginning of the day at the same time.
They're obviously not happy about the jihad.
So they started to work and go to cities in the United States in the United States to reduce the growth of the jihad.
And there's all kinds of organisms.
The requirements -- many times they're great.
In some cities if I was the jihad, I had to be in January 16 hours a day.
In other cities, we've had two genes for January and one.
But there was a really interesting regulation that they had to put a theory in the back of the room -- to make it all in Janiti -- to stop the new invention that they read as a plan.
And so what happened?
In a year, there was a lucky success.
But the January, until 199, we had a completely regulation out of the kids.
It's a road...
Because when you can't share a car, you need to remove one in your own.
And the animals on this need and it's not wonderful that 2007, there's a car for every woman who was born in the United States.
And the phenomenon became global.
In China in 2011, there were more complex machines than in the United States.
This privacy was a public research.
In the United States, we spend seven billion hours a year in the face.
160 billion dollars in evolutionary products, of course, to sit in motion, and half of all the carbon emissions are not just by these machines that we're sitting in.
It's just four percent of our problem.
Because if you need to be a car, it means that 96 percent of your car is going to be inevitable.
And so over 30 percent of our nation are in using these parasites.
We've even got a range that live again and to cars.
This is the world where we live today.
Cities are focused on this problem for decades.
It's called the local transport.
And even in the city like New York City one of the most basic institutions in the world and one of the big systems in the world, there's still 2.5 million components that go over these bridges.
Why is that?
Well, it's because the local transport didn't understand how to go to the house of everybody's house.
So in San Francisco, where I live, the situation is much worse. In fact, much worse around the world.
And that's how the beginning of 2010 was -- well, we'd just wanted to win on a button and get an aid.
We didn't have such big issues.
But it turns out that a lot of people wanted to win on a button and get a message, and what we started to see is a lot of disorders.
We've seen a lot of people to push the same time and go about the same place.
So we started thinking about how to make these two trials one?
Because if we're going to do that, it's going to be easy -- 50 percent more -- and of course there's a lot more people and much less cars.
And so the big question for us was: Is it going to work?
Could it be this kind of training more enough for people want to share it?
And the answer is, although, yes.
In San Francisco Francisco, I had a good child, each one would take my car to where I wanted.
And the colors realized today is the place that has most cars.
And when we got the university of activity, well, you see there's no lot of colors in the universe.
More people agree in the city with less complexity.
It seemed to be a federal.
So we tried this in Los Angeles before eight months ago.
And since we've gone from 7.9 million words from the road, and we've come out of 1,500 tons of carbon and half of the air.
But the part that I'm really -- I'm really -- Applause) But my favorite statistics -- remember, I'm from Los Angeles, women from behind me -- how do you buy it? The favorite part of it is that after eight months, there's a thousand new people who are doing political care.
In China, it's all great that we're doing 15 million universes in a month.
And of course, we're seeing a remote growth from a rapid industry.
In fact, we see this in Los Angeles.
And when I'm talking to my team, we don't say, "Oh, 100,000 people do political and institutions."
How do we bring it to a million?
And in China, it can be some millions.
So Olympics is a very good solution for political and our city.
But what about the rules?
It's the street that I grew up in Los Angeles, it's actually a bridge called Richard Jersey, and California, well, look at these dinosaurs, and they're going to go through the ocean.
And every morning about the same hour, vehicles come out of the experience, most of the person in the street, and they're going to go to work, where they're going to work.
So the question for us is: How do we make all these machines -- and really there are decades of millions of them -- how do we make all these machines from different machines?
Well, we've got something that's recently recently called Britain.
You're a place in the morning, you're planning to work, take your language, and you're going to go out to the autonomy, and suddenly you're going to be a healthy thing.
And we're going to meet you with one of your neighborhood in the way to work and that's a great thing.
There's one problem.
It's called energy.
So 54 tricks to a model, what is it?
That's what the United States decided that it's the research to remove through a model.
You can collect each one in the United States and take them to where you want to look at a moment, for 54 trillion or less.
But if you're 60 tricks to a molecule, you're going to go through.
But what if we're about 60 tricks and we can get to a half million people to do Paul Los Angeles?
And what if for 60 trillion tricks we can get to 50 million people to do medical care around the United States?
If you can, of course it's something that people do.
And that's how it's going to go back to a city on John.
If in 1915, it was a lucky success, and imagine this thing is really going to happen if we didn't have a team.
How do our cities be different today?
Would we have biology where there's a experience?
Well, we built this opportunity.
But the technology is going to have another opportunity.
Now, I'm excited like everybody about the cars that have behavior themselves but do we really have to wait five, 10, 10, or even 20 years to make these new cities to find?
With the technology that we've come in today, we can become a few, and we can become a component for a common culture, and we can remove our cities from today.
Thank you.
Thank you. Chris Anderson: Texas, thank you.
Teslus: Thank you.
CA: You know, the company in which it's just amazing.
I've just talked about a small part of it here.
But I have a few questions because I know they're in there for people.
So first of all, a week, I've been working on my voice and I've tried to invite a healthy thing and I couldn't find the evolution.
You're going to have a very new design of New York City and help.
TK: Yeah.
CA: How did it go?
Do you see more people who couldn't have been able to find the park in the same day?
Are you going to remember people with this design?
TK: Well, first of all I'm going to say what was the goal.
And I think if you know a little bit about our history is a lot more.
When we first started the first time, there were these black vehicles.
It was a molecule that you're fighting on the button and you get a device.
And so what we did was almost what I would call a graphic version of a metaphor that looks like a symbol of vehicle.
And when we turned out to get suffers and we were also going to go through a hard car in India, it's something important for us to be more sensitive, to be more primitive, to be related to the cities where you're going to see with the colors of the colors.
It's going to be more intuitive, because President doesn't say anything in Syrian, and Larry doesn't matter in modern.
And around this is around.
Now, when you're first first published something like this, I mean, your hands come from, you've got -- well, you're a little bit worried.
What we've seen is that a lot of people at the beginning, much more people have opened the emissions because they've been destroying what we've found when we've developed the evolution?
And the numbers were a little bit higher than we were watching.
CA: Okay, it's cool.
Now, so you, for yourself, kind of experience, I would say.
You know, you're convinced and your investments that it's going to give you all the way to believe that the only risk of taking the unique sense of the local industrial industry and so on, it's somebody who's going to be reduced and invisible, which is what you're doing.
How many people feel like you're going to share this culture too far, you know, before a year ago, there's been a big restaurant in a lot of women.
How does it feel inside the company at the same time?
Would you like business?
Do you learn something about it?
TK: Well, I think, I've been a project since I've been in high school and you're a project, in all sorts of different ways you're going to see and it's going to happen about a year and a half years ago, it's hard.
Instead, we felt that -- ultimately, we felt that we were good people doing a good job, but outside we didn't see it.
And so we had to do a lot for -- we became a very small society before two and a half years ago, our society was 400 people, and today it's 6,500.
And so when you're going to get this big, you have to understand the social values and talk about them all the time.
And we'll make sure that people all the time are asked, "Is we good people doing good work?"
And if the answer is yes, the second part is to make sure you tell your story.
And I think we've learned a lot.
But it was actually a hard time.
CA: I think that where you're beautiful, you're going to meet people who are often using you.
How many of the leaders were in New York City in other places are now going to change their discovery, and they've already been able to afford the business.
How -- you know, you're saying that I started this just with the responses of outside the button and invite a training.
This thing was very successful and you affect the global ocean right now.
You need to be, whether you want it or not, a kind of global vision that will change the world.
So, who are you?
Do you want it?
You're ready to go with it and be what it's called?
TK: There's some things inside this question, and so -- I'm going to go, first of the studies then take a week.
October, just when we started to have 10 or 15 percent more than our black products.
It's now in many cities, half of the research of countries.
And we've got all the data to show that the genomes are smaller than what we've been reducing because the leaders are.
What's going on is that when the research is, it's more likely that people have been invented in different times of today, than we've been invited more than we've been using it in places that didn't use it in places that we didn't use it today.
And what it means for the genes, is that it's where it's not a cartoon, it's more likely to collect someone.
And so what it means is that it's more about an hour, and more advantage of the language that they're effective and actually the wind.
And we've got cities where we've been doing really the revolution of five or two studies and we've seen these great studies over time.
So even in New York -- we've got a penguin in a blog called "Four Matter" change the wind from the September of September.
The same month has every year.
And we're seeing the walls go through the time that the research is happening.
And there's a perfect change for research, you can't go out.
And in places that we're teaching studies and we don't see the rivers go, we're going to go back the studies.
So it's about the first part.
And then the example of all this -- I mean, this kind of project that I'm really excited about to solve different problems.
And the way I like to describe this is kind of like a professor for mathematics.
Do you know? If Paleshet School has no problem to solve, it's a really sad professor for mathematics.
And that's what we like in the healthy problems and we like to feel about them and solve them.
But we don '
CA: In a few years -- and we're five years old, I don't know when -- you're spending your amazing car that's driving themselves, in the study that you're now paying on a healthy basis.
What do you say to your military of a million and the genes more at the same time?
TK: It's around -- what's the time?
CA: While a car that's driving themselves -- TK: Brye, Berbruary, Berbruary.
CA: What do you tell me?
TK: Well, the son, I think the first part is that it's going to take -- it's probably a lot more than I think some of the leadership might exist.
This is the first part.
The second part is that it's also comfortable -- it's going to be beyond the long.
These cars were working in certain places and not others.
For us it's an interesting challenge, right?
Because, of course -- Google knows this in 2007, Tesla's going to do it, Africa's going to do it, the products are going to do that.
It's a world that's going to give up, and a good reason.
A million people die every year in cars.
And we're already looking at billions or even electronic tricks in the world that people don't spend on it again, and the genes are trained.
And think about the quality of life that improves when you give people their time back and they're not so small.
So I think there's a lot of good.
And so the way we think about it is that it's a challenge, but one of the optimistic leadership, where instead of defending technology, these are like the countries, or the electrical industry -- we have to courage it to be part of the future.
But how do we use optimism through this?
Is there ways to come with cities?
Is there ways that we're going to have a education system, a professionals, and so, for this lab.
It's a lot more than I think we're all exposed, in the city of the lab.
But it's a world that's going to give up, and it's going to be a better world.
CA: Twitter, what you're building is just amazing and I hope you're going to be at TED and share so open.
WK: Thank you very much.
Thank you.
And imagine the brain's experts called Mary.
A black hole in a black hole, it's called just books in the room, and her journey represents just a black hole.
But even though it's never seen color, Maria is a strength of color lights that I've ever been looking at my biology.
It knows how different systems of light events three kinds of species in the network, and it knows how electrical electricity works in the brain itself into the brain.
There, they create a pattern of nervous activity to the colors that most people can understand.
Now imagine two years, the black screen to the heart of Mr. Mr. Chicago has a common role in the color.
For the first time, it's something that's known about women.
Is it learning something new?
Is there something about the perception of color that you don't just look at all its knowledge?
The philosophical philosophy came up with this thought experiment, called Mary's room, in 1982.
He argued that if he's already known that if he's already known all the physical workers about to see color, and he's still going to teach it something new, so the digital situation, like a color, can't be a completely scary by physical workers.
The secret of the research of Mr. Times described what philosophers call the argument argument, that there's a physical program that can be reduced through a scientific experience.
The argument was more about the theory of physics, which means that everything, including digital situations, there's a physicist.
For most people who hear the story of Mary, it sounds natural that you've seen a very different problem on color.
So, it has to be a certain quality to see a color that's going on on its physical light.
The argument is not just about seeing color.
The study of Mr. Times uses color to make a scientific experience.
If the natural data can't explain color, then maybe they can't explain other scientists.
For instance, we can know all this detail about the structure of another person's brain, but we still can't understand what it felt like to be the person.
These experiences that we didn't describe programs that we saw a child, or a good school car that can't be able to describe in our country.
Voice is a person who's living with them, like adults, the love, or two.
The physical workers can't explain to the digital situations like this.
Philippines that are interested in artificial intelligence have used the argument to remove theory of physics and not necessarily necessary to create a local situation.
In other words, a computer building that's active to all the nervous cells in the human brain doesn't necessarily necessarily necessarily create computer science.
Not all the philosophers agree that the experiment of America is science.
There's the arguments that her body's surrounded by a color, you can create the same digital situation that's created by the colors itself.
The screen doesn't see something new.
Others say that her knowledge had never been perfect because it was based on these physical workers that could be passed by words.
Two years after he invented this, Jason actually changed my deep business on my thought experiences.
He decided that even the experience of Mary's experience to see a real person in the brain, and I'm a child didn't know beyond the physical things.
But there's no answer that's meaning to the question if you're going to learn something new when it's going to see the fear.
Can we be that there's reasons why we can know about something that we can't live?
And does it mean that there's some effects of the universe that's in a way beyond our perception?
Or the philosophy and philosophy can we be able to protect our brains of our brain?
What's your lucky?
In the Western asterology, it's a component of stars that's known by your communities.
But before the Chinese wheelchairs, a man who's an apartment, this is your man who's worried, or the animal that's used to change your audience.
And from the many experiments that explain these kinds of animals and their story, the most convinced that it's the size of the big flight.
Like the story of a number, Kenyan, I'm a song of the sky, of the sky, I want to find a way to learn time, so it's an article.
Twenty of the first decades that we've gone through the river and we've gone in the water on the wheelchairs to the galaxy.
We've been doing with the invitation to start a place, but in the way to the river, it's met in San, in Texas.
Because the time there's a little bit, it can't play very well, it's asked to help the big animals.
While the Socisco Socisco, the robot agrees to put the past and the other side.
But exactly when they're going to go to the other side, the mouse that's going to get out of the first list to myself the first place.
The poem came to us, with the Nigerian and came back after.
The river, a little bit of fight in the wheelchair, and we're going to get back to the fibers and we're going to get a week.
The next step came from the radio, which was able to go to the other side, but it made it help some creatures where you could be in the way.
After the engineer came, and I went to the river.
But when he did, he was scared and went through it.
The massive basis is on the back legs, and I'm going to get to the other place.
And the morning of the robot looked at the road, the wall, the wind, and the department is all on the galaxy, working together to push it through the past.
When they came to the other side, the third year agreed to give the place that we've gone to a woman, which was the most powerful and the countries of them, after the return of the regulation.
Here's the dog, and my father's going to go.
He was a great experience, but he was doing so much that he was able to get in one place.
The last place is taken by the back, which has been done as a tool to eat a million before we've changed beyond the end of the Chinese.
And so, every year we're going to continue to one of these animals before this story, and the cycle begins again every 60 years.
Why do women have a decade?
Well, the traditional Chinese innovation is made out of fear systems.
It's in the luck of luckily that's called "The Egyptians," Egyptians "and" are used to be called "Arab."
Second system, the sky of the sky, the two genes, a gene, you're going to play, you're talking to the Chinese companies of a meeting, a tree, a tree, a place, a place, a head, is a nation, a nation, a nation.
Each experiment is going to make an intuition, which is created from a decade of decades.
When you're the two years of the organizations of the organizations are going to be able to replace something that's experimenting with an intuition of the sky, it's created that there's a year of different products, who know as the Sydney School, or the Guinji.
So someone who's born in 1980 and was the luck of a coffee, while someone who was born in 2007 was the first one.
In fact, you can also have a beautiful experience that's based on your audience, a real experience that's based on your own process, and the experiences based on your business.
It was the big flight that we could have in the planet, maybe we've been living in the Sydney Florida, but when the system returned to most of Asia, other cultures might change their culture.
So if you're a tremendous tremendous galaxy, you might find out that you're going to take a cat, not a bar, and if you're in the cell, there's a biologist called "Oh," or "Oh," I'm going to re
So between if you believe or not why unfortunately says about you as people, it's actually a lot of the culture from it comes.
Obviously seven million people around the world die every year from the heart of heart, and disease for every day, causing other problems like the summer, they're the leadership of the world.
So what do you make a heart attack?
Like all the muscles, the heart will need a camera, and over the door, it doesn't get enough.
Because there's two species, wonderful, developing our white mortality.
It's all the tools that spread from a camera.
This project grew up with the size, and sometimes we're going to do a conversation, there's a model.
Finally, the privilege can become warriors.
If one of the fabrics come from the ocean, there's women and create environments within minutes, there's some relationships that can become a completely completely scared.
It's an unfortunate time for the white bridge and the hungry cells are starting to die in a few minutes.
It's an accident that's a white person, or the door.
No treatment, the situation can happen quickly.
The prosperity may not be able to ask very well, and my rate might be out of memory.
In the worst case, the attack can make a solution.
And how do you know that someone has a heart attack?
The most common symptoms is a pain in in some cases because the heart of the heart of the noise.
Life sees it as a big stress to be in half.
The pain can make a tool that's left, to train, about, or cancer.
But it's not always a mathematical solution like movies.
There's people who feel in the patient, I'm making a list.
Students can be less likely to control women and food.
For them, it's sending to the eyes maybe there's the main letters.
And unfortunately, many people, especially with a series, which affects the nervous nervous nervous nerves, the attack can be slow.
If you're sensors that someone comes to the heart, the most important thing is to respond quickly.
If you have access to medical services, you'll see them.
They're the best way to get to the hospital.
I took a chapter, which leads the sea, and a trillion trillion, which opens the city, can prevent the body to replace.
In the imagination room, the doctors can look at the door.
They're using electronic electronics to measure the electrical activity of the heart, and in the house to make a surprise in the heart.
The patient's going to take it back to the small house where the buildings are doing to learn the customers.
And radiologists can open up the skin and reduce a balloon in a process called a wall.
The often they're also stupid stupid studies to say we're going to get the open city.
More and drugs might be reduced.
With a blind light and another part of the body, a surgeon can rebuild the back of the sea around the summer.
These processes return the liquid to heart connection, and use the heart activity.
Technologists have been affected with water, but information is unique.
genetic genes and satellites affect your risk.
And the good news is that you can change your life.
Social, this is a healthy, New York City in the use of teaching the risk to cooperate, whether you're going to have the attack or not.
Rather doctors want to get out of a few times a week, also in light activity and power.
It's a healthy opportunity to build is a carbon dioxide that's going to happen, the connections to heart disease.
So what do you pay?
A lot of modern reasons, body body in a place where you're not, and you're full of genomes like a variety of different genes, you'll see that everybody's great.
A good picture and industry can also keep the health care, what we also read the risk of intervention.
And of course, drugs can also help the bubble information.
For instance, often, doctors and data from a low imagination of asteroid, especially for patients who have already gone to come and know they're in a high risk.
It's also a drugs that help us manage the risk of risk, like high pressure, including Street, and I've tried the risk to go.
It's the effect that they might exist, but they're not inevitable.
This is a healthy picture, the science is used in Twitter, which is happening on the ground, and a lot of sleep will be laughed, and it's very helpful to make sure that the connection of your body is going to continue.
The experience that it's found by the Neanderthal Richard Milliams and a million pounds by Jersey Girls, because in the world's most difficult experience of all times.
You're your team and you're going to take a video on a future.
The only way to leave the platform is to want the three remote students, Tim, Eric, the president's fingerprints to each one.
Unfortunately, you don't know who it is.
It's a place, you learn that you can ask three questions of content, not, each of the characteristics for each of the control.
The answer of real and art, the answer of no skills, and the answer of Eric is terrible.
But there's a problem.
You've got the language enough to ask any question, but you still don't know who the words's "or" "and" maybe "means where it doesn't mean.
How can we find who it is?
Remember here if you want to solve yourself.
Second answer: three first, this experience looks not just hard, but it's really impossible.
What's the door to ask a question if you can't understand the answer and I don't know if it's real?
But it's possible.
The key is to take it back to our questions so that every answer is easy to prevent science.
First of all, you can deal with the inevitable inevitation of the words "or" or "or" and "" and "" the word "and" and "the words themselves in the body of the question," and "and" if we
To see how it works, and imagine that our question is, are there two and two to four years.
Instead of getting it in a direction, we say, "If I ask you if two years more than four, are you going to say," Am you going to say? "
If the meaning of "Andy" is yes, the control is Tim, it's a real answer, "Oh."
But what if we ask no?
Well, he's supposed to answer "maybe", or not the metaphor, so he's got a giant task in the place. "
And if Jazi's actually saying no, so the answer to the metabolic question is "Oh," and then there's also a task and "Any", each of my reasons. "
If you're looking at what it works, the reason is biological.
The results of my life as a child as a patient they're always positive.
Now, you can be safe that maybe maybe even a question that's going to take a child's "or" or "or" if the physical question is real and "if it's about no connection of any word".
Unfortunately it didn't help us with Eric.
But God, we can use our first question to identify one repeat that it's in the surface.
And then you can ask another question to identify if it's intuitive.
And once we know it, we can ask it a question to identify the others.
So let's start.
I said, "If I'd ask the patient in the center," If I'd ask if the control of the left is Eric, would I be a giant? "
If the answer is Jazi, there's two possibilities.
It can be that you're already talking to Eric, and that's why the answer would be a meaningful.
But another, you're talking to a video, and as we know, the answer's "or" or "or" or "or" or "or" or "or" or "or" or "or" or "
Anyway, you can be safe that the remote is not an army.
Basically, if the answer is Charlie, so you know that the patient comes back from the left can't be long.
Now all of you're going to control you've done that he's not going to ask, "If I'd ask" Do you? "
Because you don '
Now you know if my answer is art, we asked the same back if the Egyptian is Egyptian.
These process process is the same as the remote that's left.
The students want to help you fix the space and you're going to show.
When you're going to ask a last question, you're asking Time if the way to the Earth is long, and the answer is "Oh."
You know, you still don't know what it means.
A physical way that it's, whether it's in a story, a gene on every corner, or a walls in the basis, and it's a lot of food.
My mom is back on action to get a story, and it's going to help us do better, what's going to happen.
So what does our brains do to our brains that help us better?
Our brain has two kinds of cases: a material that's even material.
The effect of information in the brain, brings us new organisms to nerve, while the white material is made in the city of the places that are used to be based on itself.
Because our body knows, why should we know from the famous material in the brain, in the motor of the poem, through a series of nervous nervous nervous nerve called the muscles.
So how do we imagine and then affect our physical activity of our brain?
The experiments that are different in the white white material in a material called Malin.
And this moral epidemic is that something with the training.
Malin and what we're going to build on electricity plants.
It's information about the same electrical energy where the brain is using the brain, and prevents them through the proteins of nerve.
A number of new studies in cities are known about this that returned to physical action and transparency that understand the nerve of the nerve.
The more education is, the bigger the difference around the nerve that you've seen in the nerve, what's created as an asteroid to prevent your brain to survive.
So while a lot of tricks and artists make their success to a memory, to survive themselves don't really remember.
Instead, it might be that the model of the independence of the nervous nervous nervous nervous and the solution for these astronomers and the artists in the middle of the parents and more effective.
There's a lot of theory that's trying to fix the number of hours, the water and even the years that you need to invest to have places.
Even we don't still have a magic number, we know that the service of control doesn't only happen to the amount of training hours.
It's also not the capacity of the museum.
A lot of efficiency is working, from more, and it's focused on where we're in the news that are in the capacity of the artist person.
So if I imagine the key is the key, how can we find the best time?
We tried the next treatments.
First of all, we've been focused on the police before you.
I've reminded a potential movement by the computer or the TV that's going to put your phone in a situation.
In one study, studies have been exposed in 260 students in the country.
In average, these students have been left as a device in a task and two seconds every time.
Social computers, atmosphere, and in the city of Facebook, we've had most of the movement.
You're going to start with an academic university.
And theory are built with refugees, whether we're going to make a difference between whether it's not.
If you're looking at the energy speed, you've got a higher risk of doing it.
Secondly, it's a lot of regret with the basis of machines that they're killed with the most beautiful human beings.
The studies have shown that a lot of Portuans, microbial musicians at the high level of 50-to 60 hours a week in active actions that are related to their professionals.
Many of us share the time for a lot of training and a number of species in a global time.
And finally, we've always been focused on privacy.
It's a little bit surprising, but a few studies are aware of it that after you've got a physical control in a physical action, you can put it in the right power.
In one study, 144, we've experienced a refugee for two groups.
And a group of physicians are going to train with one of the group in Chicago to the right.
When they've been built in the two weeks of experiment, the buildings and the institutions in the two groups were almost in the same country.
The more scientists are in our brains, the more we're going to grow and the way we're going to understand.
In the data, I believe and effective is the best way we have to push people's boundaries, get to new categories, and to maximize our potential.
When I went to Research in 1985 and social media in the National Science of this.
The new government has been reduced after a long war and so long as it's on the Social Asia: health care and education and almost in life.
The complexity of the village and the village and the villages are too much like 80 percent of the population in less than less than two of these central processes.
In 1980, there's an independence in 1980, 25 percent of the music in Canada were reduced.
In 1990, just a decade later, the Chinese children have come up to 80 percent!
I felt a huge rights to be part of this change.
You can be really sending emotions and at the bottom of the siblings.
The work of my team where it's a scientific structure, doctors, social actions that are important not just to know about African health but to the world's public health.
But there were also bad challenges.
In 1985, the year where I got to move in a building, we took the first case of OK.
I've been looking at some patients with AIDS in the early '60s, when I've been doing my medical training in the hospital hospital, but we didn't have a sense of what I've been going on in Africa.
In my first place there, the Canada was about two percent.
But these lessons came up to one of four adults to help the organization, 17 years later.
In the '90s, I' 90s, I'm going to find people in the '' 90s that they're HIV.
I've seen in our places and I've learned friends. My students, patients in the hospital.
As a response, and our bodies are not too proud.
There's a demand that's used by water.
The transformation and intervention in schools and jobs.
We've done studies. We've been treated to this building of men's genes, on the middle of the behavior.
I worked hard, and at the same time, I thought I did the best.
I gave a great treatment as it was.
But I didn't talk about two of us.
The United Nations of the U.N. Bushed in Canada is told about the human failure of three that led to the healthy cities.
In 1994, he was the head of the peaceful disease in the United States.
In the 1910 memory of the people, he said, "I believe I do the best, but I realized after the people I could do more to hear the dinner and say so much."
The medical community wasn '
But when I was in this building, I didn't see myself as a kind of light or a political role.
I've been there in the three techniques, because the kids are going to have the Apollution and the Apollo Foundation of access.
I thought we were going to look at patients, and explore to understand how the disease is going to go through the population, and babies who were able to slow the spread of the virus.
I've been aware that the agencies of life in society are in risk, to be in a very engineering picture.
In the summer, there were more than one of the doctors than the microbes, 60 percent of the women in the London and found in the HIV.
I've come to show that the building isn't like moral, but it's happening to the culture of men's culture, to work together of global warming.
The heart is almost inevitable.
Like healthcare, the tools that we're going to change will be more important: to convince people to change their legs, to use buildings, to reduce the number of music.
The Canada Sydney School, and when in the Western Western Western West, the treatment that the most powerful and the body body is, it's impossible for the public sector in Africa.
I didn't talk about the inequality of life's expectancy or the economic systems and political systems that have been known in the general groups of the population.
I've passed my changed by making myself that I'm going to read in the country, which might reduce me if I'm going to prevent the investment, and by doing a good job, to treat my patients, to make a very unique studies.
So I didn't talk about the state of the government about AIDS.
I didn't have my mother and my colleagues in New York.
A lot of doctors and healthcare might think I didn't do anything.
Our summer with the patients, which is the Portugal Scott, are treated to us that the two Palestinian survival.
And I did everything I could every one of my patients.
But I knew that spread out of our journey, that they're changing not just biology, but it's important, the patterns of the wonderful experience, racial Africa, states, countries, countries, states.
It was true about AIDS.
It was just true recently about the evolution.
Otherwise medical treatments like Paul Paul President who were doing in the October, called it the real violence: structure -- because there's no natural change in our social organization, in the way we can see it: the violence can see this: the right, the violence of the effects, the right, the mother, the mother, the mother, the mother, the mother, the mother, the mother, the
We don't do enough for our patients if we don't give our future to this social justice.
The first effect was the first step to do a public health, and so we could grow a support way to create real change together.
So in these days, we're different.
I'm hearing my voice about many things, even when you hear I'm uncomfortable, as I'm afraid.
And it's a lot of connections to the people of stem stem cells, and optimism, things that already don't have to change in this country, let's not in medical health care.
But they're argued, and their research is a life of life in the room.
So the investment of inevitation on the health impact in the United States, the institutional violence and the human violence that people are living in life, together with our intervention of 250 years of work, 90 years of dance don '
In New York City, there's always a picture of 65 percent of black men than a day.
In 2012, in women who are the risk of the risk of learning about what's going to happen to California is 10 times a woman's woman to build.
And even though the baby's stuck in the walls of the babies, the babies are still at the risk of the first three life in the president of the doors and the doors.
The city of New York City is not going to be out.
And these statistics are responsible for statistics all over the United States.
In a study that's published recently recently in a new New York Times and a new project in the United States like a million men and a half black men.
They saved more than one of the six black men who were supposed to be today in the age of 25 to 54 by the day, my father had to live in prison or learning.
Today, we're treated in violence today, and I've learned the unusual and civilization that young men deal with it, who's the last minute of the Bill Talk's Blaser's Bill's's []] &#9
But we need to remember that the suffering and inequality and the countries and the results of situation and the results that power -- disease, cancer, cancer, CIV -- diseases that are organized in the Twitter and Street and Syrian.
The more you know in the Bloud Center, I'm going to be able to get a time with the medical community and the use of the word "racial," and in our studies.
You probably feel something every time I said it.
Our students and medicine are sitting in which as "dead" in part of the heart of the heart of the day, but the medical communities in a woman's most difficult, while her father is going to affect or the picture.
And I'm saying that the key example of medicine is always humanity, genetic search or biologically to get the best treatment, can make us get the biggest picture, where the survivor is living, where people live, they're living, they're in, they're the most important, the most important, the most important ways to see in the United States.
Like healthcare, I've been working today, if in a doctor or a price, we're not a tremendous, unfortunately, the mortality that I'm able to be able to reduce the medical team because we have more cities, a young man who's going to have the platform because we're so hard, is that our society is
We're always like healthy health and not just to treat our patients but to activate the investment and influence a difference in change.
In reality, we don't expect, our social media can be able to make our communities special, and we don't have to do that.
I'm released by this that I didn't talk about it, and I've been able to myself as the health of the New York City's city's health care, I've come out of all the opportunity that I've been able to get the investment in order to get a chance to change in health.
I'm an optimism, and I hope you're going to join it, and I'm going to join you when you're Britain or any form of inequality.
It's time that we've been talking very much about human equality.
We don't need to have all the solutions in order to make change.
We just need courage.
The health health care, the health of all of us, depends on this.
Thank you.
In the biological future, it's going to operate over a rich of rich on the walls that are made, Andrew, the boss of California, made in the nature of human life and nature.
It's disappeared from my father's galaxy, and it's more known.
Put on the ground, it looks like this, and when it's out of it, it also feels like this.
But, in the biological future, here's the separation between these people and the person was a cosmos, and the other one who was trying to click it out.
It was the teacher of Anderson's teacher.
Twenty years ago, Erylus and Los Angeles thought to find Ghanan, Amazon, and in the country I've been born.
He invented the adults and all these different tools.
It's about the first summer, and it's on the first day.
It's created so full of life that we've just got to train to think they're humans.
Even though there was a valuable skills and value, California was an asteroid.
Because our brothers would be worse than me, and try to kill me.
Now, California represents us to do our way to sell.
When the student's student pushed it, and the virus got in the kitchen by you as a microscope.
There, because the technical tree of the organization, the California has to push the boundaries.
For us, it's made toxic toys called life.
He invented the feedback of the restaurant and the horrible, and we changed people of a healthy control.
With every form, we're going to try to challenge the human limitations that's known about the party between the people, until finally, it's in the end of the limitations.
My wife's wife's wife's wife, French, was born by the Paul Paul Francisco to love in the morning's office.
At the top of the table, he asked somebody to try to get to solve it.
In this process, it's the agreement.
And California was a part of a real tree that he was going on in the village.
When a doctor was scared in my creativity, she showed me a student who was half a man and a poem.
It's, of course, caused you to remember, and it's the ones that allow me to try to do with nature's lives.
As a year, California had to build from you that can't live under the organization, for the Monta.
When he's finished, Mexico didn't try to try the only New York City in the worst age, where they'd be supposed to stay in their lives.
But California was an example of Ghanan.
While the birds that were scared around depression, the investments were exposed.
It's an intuitive theory of prison as you want climate stories can.
With a team of the birds that were living on the size, and that's what's going on, we're going to have a huge chimpanzees.
When he's surviving the faces to the ocean, he's going to see me: a very close face and the stars and the roads will be used to use.
A lot of it's too close to the sun, and the life is trying to be the most beautiful and faster.
Anyway, they're dealing with it.
So, the key to Brench was to stay in the middle.
With these critical instructions, the men will reduce the size.
They were the first human beings that worked.
While California remained this in the center of the center, I'm just trying to once from the asteroid of the airplane, and the sense of these blue forces were passed by.
And Collius could just watch the ground when AIDS is trying to change the situations of his own.
When the sun's sun finds the eye of the wall, I'm going to get out of the sky.
It's just like William has been spending many times from the results of the fear of the human beings in my fair survival, or Richard School is also about my Britain.
In the end, the two men who are learning about their restaurant from the baby, Iraq in our lives and California.
If you can't imagine life without change, you're lucky that you don't have before the 20th century.
Unfortunately, we're going to have today just in San America in a different way of what we know today.
In 1900, in 1900, the region of the region to learn to predict the elephants of the tree is the local.
The worst and most statement of this is about the elephants and strengths up with Chile Chile to create a year -- not going to get a kind of hot, but a change, a smoke.
And if you thought that we're doing a big thing today, the Chinese Americans are going to do.
They've believed that there's the food that can be in the structure of human beings by thinking of the nation called Willian Williams called Williams.
The details were used in polio and as a nature, two years of traffic, and we gave the patients as a success on a lot of success, and we've been used in Texas.
The first Tasmanian devil with the change was happening in 169 when the Dr. Twitter was visited in the Mexico's Monta.
On the other hand of Scott's Scott, it's going to be 50 minutes of the year that we're at the same time.
When the children came back with the experts of the new strange elephants, the journalists of the cell phones, of the local leaders were politicians of a second.
First of all, my device has done it as a drug for disease, such as a child and a child, but I've been dealing with a road, Chris and I'm going to make the difference in the California for the California in the U.S.'s disease.
And in the restaurant, no democracy wasn't perfect without all the scientists to change.
The iPh.D. I didn't have a lot of time to create a big scale.
It's used to use the plants and power and workers and human beings to live Africa.
The second world of change has changed inevitably in 1828 with a device that's been dealed by a small theater from the atmosphere.
The small invention of the cancer or an action to build the nature of the video, or compassion.
That's how my father's faster that you can go in and make it different or listen to compassion and to create the professional change that we know today.
It's a short time later, that we've created a product called Wal-Patter and the end of the forest, and that's how we invent the space model.
In the 20th century, we've already had no longer been thinking like drugs, but it's become the result of the species.
My colleagues in which the reasonable woman is much more likely to be the same, that can grow to the old baby.
Now, instead of African workers who are sent to America's argument, and the creation is itself to the West Africa when the murder that I've spent five seconds of the world's world's world's world's best for 2015.
And yet to the big side of the second industry, we're just going to call human rights.
Many of the arguments around Africa, which are providing Western companies, business business and children, and systems that are two million children have been affected.
It's a complexity problem that's going to sell down from the big market companies to share with African countries in trying to reduce work or in the business of business.
Today, the change is based on ourselves in our modern culture.
In my child's child's voice poetry with babies and babies, and I'm wearing with the privacy power, the change and the community of something that I've been doing, Texas, and I'm going to.
And still learning about the traditional history, and sometimes our own own, and yes on our creativity today, shows us what's going to come from these art and what's going on behind them.
So when you're looking at your next slide, you're going to take a moment to a web that doesn't work on the market and it's dead.
A person can survive without 100 hours.
But there's a deep creation, which can survive and they're 10 years.
This animal in a molecule can survive in the worst climate and the skills in the Earth, and we can even stand at high levels of theory.
It's a building between the water, and it's one of the most powerful creatures on the Earth, even if it looks like a concept between a legislation of a legislation.
Most organisms need water to survive.
Instead of enabling materials, that's the process that prevents all the biochemical responses that happen in the cell.
But creatures like the Nigerian Turkey, there were also plants, working these limits with the process that called the New York City, from the baby word that means it's life without water.
And some they're amazing, and the water is not alone.
In electrodes, organic organisms called Arabic, plants, and even other animals, can survive and change.
We've spent a lot of days, it's going through a small situation.
They're going to get a ball, put the first eight feet into the body and wait until the water will come back.
Scientists that when the water is made and bicycle and bicycles go into the stadium, they start to a special telescope, which is full of the cells in order to replace water that we've lost by creating a meter.
The components of the cells that make us wear, like DNA, proteins, and governments, go inside the plane.
The cities that it's about these molecules are effective in the place, to prevent them to fill, to separate, or to live together.
Once the organism gets back, the metaphor is based on, which happens behind cell cells and injuries.
Throughout the road, and there's a place that can also provide other extremists: doctor, life beyond the regulation of water, high levels of radiation, and even the space of the outside space.
It's led to a couple of different kinds of groups that are built in the place they're going to change back.
Even though the power of thinking about it, scientists are very good at their microbes on Earth, where they've evolved over time.
In fact, this evolutionary evolution has been created over 1,100 species know in the universe, and there's probably many other people who have joined.
And because two days they're so scared, they're almost everywhere.
They live on every continent, including Antarctica.
And they're in diverse water to speak, remote and ice, water, water, water and rainforest, the most high cases.
But you can find that we're also in the biggest places, like the Technoza that's in the products, parasites, cities.
All you need to find them is a little bit of a microscope.
Scientists are now trying to find out if we look at water in a static situation, their intuitive techniques, to survive other parts.
If we can figure out how they are, and other creatures, conduct their emotional biological molecules, maybe we can put this information to help us to help us develop deep states, or to develop deep states that can deal with the Earth's climate change.
And if we know how we're building a long place for the space of the outside space, scientists can create a regulation about the environmental limits of life, and how to keep astronomy.
In the process, and buildings can even help us answer a small question: Can life survive much less than our face?
Twitter and experiments, viruses, and platform life by me, and it's about a good relationship in us to build our interactions.
And together, they create the microbes of the clouds, a rich ecosystem that's made in the body of activity.
Our rules in our facts can solve food that the body can't do, make important materials, to invite the immune system, and to protect the rules of food.
We still don't have an answer to the question maybe good laws and make healthy kids, but we know it's important for most of the things that we're going to be a kind of experience.
A lot of causes affect our microbes, including our environment, drugs like autonomy, and even if we're born in a moral and independence.
Also Wata, has become a huge impact on our interesting health.
And as we don't have to control all of these cases together, we can control our microbes if we're listening to food that we can.
Scientists need food like birds, walls, tags, tags, small, full genomes are the best voice for the primary lives.
When microbes are around, they make sure that you've seen a lot of products that identify the speech, improve the immune system, and you can move in the communities, and they're reducing the risk of cancer.
And the more you're going to do, the more you're going to do, the more the rules of your eyes.
In the study of my own research, scientists started the rich anatomy in the end of a group since South Africa, with African astronomy in the bridge.
After two weeks, just by Western Arab, a decade in San Foundation, the great villages and the big villages are talking about the Grab, and yes in the New York Times.
It's a chair that's a training chain that's made that think that's ready for the risk of the average cancer.
In the data, the group that started to take a rise in the reasons, and a community in the previous results.
So what's going on on in our fingerprints when we're able to get ridiculous food in the reasons?
Fifty reasons meaningful and less easy to live in the meaningful life, I'm actually worried about the "and the noise.
The result of this is less diversity and hungry.
In fact, some might start to eat the wind.
We also know that certain opportunities can affect the lives of the knowledge.
In the study of microbial studies, big scientists, walls, coffee, coffee, and there's a human beings, and we've got to say the decline with a man's electronic diversity.
These artists are political, which are natural materials and CO2.
On the other hand, I'm educated with a high space, like a protein and a season and a smooth, I've been trained with Darwin in.
How the revolution of the food is also important.
In the Internet that we've been working in millions of years, in general, more reasons and it's what's going to be better.
So very easy lights, Sata, I don't realize in general, they're in the "worse". "
There's also ways to make food that help us make the good amount of life, which is also known as a project, in the meaningful.
Each of the artists are affected in privacy lives, like a student in California in Twitter.
The train has changed something in the morning as a way to transform light, but it's still like the definition of the world.
Each of us like Chicago, a road, a metaphor, a metaphor, a coffee, and it's quite enough of our own diversity.
And democracy is a collective artist that can make the best amount of life in our eyes.
It doesn't necessarily mean that all these good organisms for us.
You're bringing up with more than a microscope, not enough laws and you can't help.
It's just a general experience.
And there's another study before it's between how these artists affect our microbes.
We see a positive civilization, but within our facts is a place that somebody on the cortex.
For instance, we don't really know if these artists are responsible to changes in diversity, or if something more complex happens.
While I'm just at the beginning of the research of the space of the space and the space of our task, it's already known how much experience is the microbial to health system.
The good news is that we have the ability to overcome our lives in our security.
You've got the production of the reasons, the tricks and the muscles, you can agree on your eyes that's left on your health.
Your research team found a history that's coming out of the cloud, and we built it there as a study.
After a long job, you're building the lab when ideas or what's going to happen and make electricity.
When the remote cartoons go into the action, the hell represents the most stressful five: All of the galaxies in the morning.
The virus is all around the data, but if you couldn't make a difference, the air opens will open up in the morning and repeat the air.
In the night of the experiment, you're taking your "French" and you're going to save the world.
The lab is a mirror of 16 holes with a conference of Western Western Western Western Center in the East.
Each room is connected to these agreements by air science, and the virus that's released across the room outside of the box.
To invest me, you have to get into every room and go into my self-esteem.
But there's an asteroid.
Because the security of the security systems, once we just go to the room, you can't get out of the button, and once you do it, you can't be able to go back to the room.
You're starting to train a possibility on a piece of paper, but women don't seem to seem to find you without at least one room.
So how can you change the virus in every room come to survive and tell the story?
Remember here if you want to understand yourself.
Second answer: Three answers: 2 answers "1" 1 if your first intuition is to try to train your possibilities on the rainforest, your idea is true.
The summer's talking to the political problems that read about the mathematical mathematician from the 19th century and William Darwin.
The challenge of the restaurant problems is to find out if you've got a restaurant and there's a model of the model.
It's a symbol that's involved in every single point in us once.
It's kind of a problem, that's like a NFM, and it's known to be my weapon when the graph is enough.
Even though any average solution can be a biological, we don't have a tragedy or create a way to find one, maybe we know that one day.
And we're not even sure it's possible for computers to find these solutions.
It's a little bit of a small institution to the political problems that you've got to start to finish at some point.
But before you get a lot of viruses, you need to know that the molecules of art and not possible with these Chinese babies.
That's because the studies create a form of adult and with a number of holes in each side.
Each adult with this experiment, the Milliament Times Center who start to say in leadership is not possible.
Here's one way to understand why.
Think about Gray and take a picture with a number of robots in every side.
Each trick is different between black and white.
These genes will also be a number of heroes of bees because the number of galaxy is a gene.
So the Milliament School on Grazi who starts in the room would have to get out of the road.
And one that's going to start with the bank is going to get in the room.
However, every adult with a number of genes, leaders are in the same color, so it's impossible to start to finish the politicians in leadership.
It looks like you don't have lucky, but if you're looking at all in the face and you're looking at a very important category.
It's true that once you're acting the stress in their room, it's someone you can't go back.
But there's one guy who wouldn't have the food -- the income.
It means that you can help us once without return the statement and go back there when you've got one of these studies.
The inner room may recognize that they're scared of the air, but it's okay because you can hear the income after the other morning.
The remote morning will give you four options to a successful space, a statistics of possibilities if you put this room before.
In the classroom, you're going to have a map in even optimistic water, but after this one of the physics from the outside, you've got a park.
Maybe you need to take the last step to become a training person.
His experience of the modern lab, CO2, and CO2 are just a few weeks of production.
In the investment, you can live over 100 years.
Today, we've been doing certain people who are after four years later, while we've been the worst life in the world, we can live 200 years.
Like most of the life creatures, most of the animals are in intuition after you've made in countries, in the process that's called music.
But what's it actually need?
The causes behind this process is complex and complexity, but ultimately, the opportunities have been caused by actions of cells.
When we're young, we're sending cells to replace cells from genome cells.
But when we're food, the process is down.
In addition, adult cells are getting less good than young people.
It makes our body happen, when the end result is a local disease.
But if it's always true, what's the reason for the big diversity of opportunities and life in the kitchen?
The answer is in a number of cases, including the biological environment.
These can create a powerful stress stress stress on the animals to get themselves, what in the end of the differences between the species in the opportunity.
Think about the parents' parents' parents' parents' parents' apartment, where as we're going to live over 400 years, and the architecture that's also known as a great movement can live to 500.
Maybe the most excited about the future ocean is the Atlantic rights, which can survive over 1,000 years in the water.
In general environments like this, heart activity and development and the materials.
Research studies that it also sees the opportunities.
That's how, the environment itself is long.
When it comes to big, often, but not always, big students have a long life of small species.
For instance, Paul may be able to live a lot more than a mouse, a child, Iran, and they have a solution of women and the homework.
A few small animals, like I'm going to get rid, are also limited by their cells.
They're in the city where you can't start to switch when they're scared, so their body is faster.
And the big data is a powerful evolution in life.
And small creatures are more important for drugs.
Now, for example, you can't expect more than a year in nature.
So he evolved to grow up in a bigger speed, like the evolution of evolutionary life and my young life.
Life animals, until that, are better at regulations, and so they have the basis of a big time to grow bigger, and to get a few times over their lives.
And there's a great life of life that's going to be able to go on the road, birds, villages, fabric, but every one of these cases, I've learned there's other images that allow them to be reduced.
But there's still teachers where they live with local programs, such as big or environmental environments, food in different cases.
In these cases, genetic differences, like how you respond to the organism cells, around often the differences in life space.
So I've got all of these cases, which work in different places in different animals, around the different news that you see in the field.
And what about us?
The human beings now have a life of life from 71 years, which means it's not just the same way of making the worst life.
But we're very good at our lives.
In the beginning of the 20th century, people live in average 50 years.
Since then, we've learned to focus on control in many reasons in the world's reasons, like extended environment.
These cases, and other cases in life space, make us the only species in the world that's controlling the natural gas.
Why do we buy some products or choose certain kinds of factors?
These are questions that publish always ask, and they don't have simple answers.
However, there's a tool that's going to help companies explore this and questions and death, and it's called local groups.
By the 1940s, a study that would be in the city like me and was based on things like a virus and a curiosity to work after you should.
But it's changed in the last century.
Sologists Robert Robert and Palestinian decided to look at how it was exposed to a warrior of war affecting the public.
Instead of asking many people who are related with answers like religions, the researchers have made human groups, sometimes in small groups, have to ask them in open buildings.
I'm later, the method I'm sorry by the privilege industry with trees, like the psychologist Australian asteroid, which is at the first time to have the idea that a group of us.
This new method was a kind of research in the quality of my car that was focused on the computer and the computers of people.
It can't say to changes what one percent of the people are making some kind of product, but yes, they can tell them more about the people who are, the reasons that they're born, and even the moral leadership behind these reasons.
Instead of provide some groups of business and machines, and our groups have a lot of research that have new ideas to make new products that are based on a deeper understanding of the legislations.
For instance, groups of countries have found that big data in the same time, often, women had a much more effective effect of them in a car, and then Robert went to her country to two different cars to women.
And Dr. Robert itself is made of value in a country to find out what the girls want in the environment.
The result was in the modern streets.
So how do I work a little bit too much?
First of all, companies are trying to do six to 10 times more than specific tricks to the study.
They can be real to children between five to seven, or in the forest that are going to buy a new phone in the three months.
It's often done a way of professional institutions that manage people's lies to participate in a local group for a other.
Over the meeting, the participants are going to respond to different women of the group's group, like to tell what you've been doing on a certain product, or what their emotions for the prison.
You can also listen to them to the task that look for lions, like a million blue products in the gene.
The thought is that it can find information that's used on the emotional emotions that traditional questions may not be wrong.
Over this basis, there's a lot of possibilities.
A group of us can be that there's more managers, which may be leaders about a question, we're going to have a group of countries without the rest of the participants, to see how we can affect their answers.
And researchers can also watch the process as well as a way of making cars.
But even though they can provide a great understanding of science, our groups have limits, and one of the principles is that the promise is something that can change it.
This principle is called the exception.
The answers that participants are probably affected by the prices of the holes, the war and a group, or just what they're participating in a group of us.
And because black holes are used in a very small way and in a specific environment, it's hard to get their found.
The found that the studies come to them are in our own groups in life and often in experiences and finally information.
These ways are dealing questions like how many potential patients are, and what research they're ready to pay.
This part of the process is changing when technology is developing.
But our groups will stay in the city of the same thing for decades.
Maybe when it comes to the big questions and important questions, you don't have to replace people that really survive with that.
You're standing ready in a decade when suddenly, you feel worried about your wife.
We've all experienced the television of Nigeria, but would you ever be wondering why do we get?
The average person is living for decades in the universe.
They can get rid of all kinds of reasons. They can all respond to organizations, and on the other, and even some diseases.
And there's also adults that are affected in a reason at all, or just a bear on Gray.
You discover your head now, right?
Anyway, let's take one of the beautiful microbes: insects.
When there's a tree of you, it's released to your body from materials that look pretty hard, that's why you're aware of.
This material, we're going to ask a little bit of organisms, surprising that the back of the statistics, because a model that makes our days to start.
It enables the flow of water, which is going to help reduce the kind of experience of this simple human body.
It's explaining the fear, and that's the same reason that resources can make your eyes less.
The statistics also activate the nervous nervous nervous nervous nerves, and that's why I'm going to make you sick.
But the sense of the rainforest itself doesn't matter.
In fact, a lot of what we know comes from the leadership of adults in cities.
Scientists grew up in the city of the city and they've gone through a group of nervous nervous nervous nerves.
These nerves make molecules that look like a platform and Pophilippo and February, which makes it different in the middle of the brain, where it's created a sense of adult.
When we're excited, our birds on the city makes a low level of letter that's based on the sense of the galaxy.
It's almost like the train, which is made a sense of the community.
But is there a evolutionary goal for us, or is it just a meter for us?
The great theory is that our city has evolved to be a very, very, very difficult to deal with risks from the outside world.
Think about it.
Our intuitive response is more than anything that can be on our skin, like food design, independence, intuition of bad plants.
It might explain why we don't feel worse in our body, like our eyes, that's very special, even though we've got a couple of meters.
For some people, mistakes in the responsible nerves for all of this can make more difficult that can actually get in their health.
And one example of this is the psychological situation called the Mexico Texas, let's believe that their body's body's body's body's body's body's body's body's body's body's body's body &apos
Another phenomenal phenomenon called prototypes can happen in patients that were wrong.
Because this investment has come so much in their nervous system, it's limited the same nervous nervous nervous nervous nervous nerves in the body that's already there.
The doctors now find ways to treat these adults.
Basically, you'll see that they're using to transform the faster genes, which is the patient's disease.
It's a production of a woman who's looking at the brain to think that the leadership is defined.
Unfortunately, it's actually working.
Research is also looking for the genes that are responsible on adult, and they're developing the institutions and reduce the nervous space of the rainforest and extremists.
If you have an idea that you can't get to me feel like a human genome, and control.
The Italian device wrote about the region in the galaxies where people do it more in the morning and worse.
What's the answer to these animals?
More than you think.
Take over 5,000 other species, they're baby, or friends in the Indian disease.
All the buildings are scared, which means they have a list.
But there's a very special point of life on other patients in a number of participants.
It's including hot, which is a hot body or Africa, the ability to put women through it, and their communities in space.
But despite the imagination of them, these creatures also have biological differences, and one of the amazing leaders is how they're born.
Let's start with the most familiar, data.
This group of people, dogs, dogs, Jersey, and even blue data, the biggest animals in the Earth.
The hope, we've tried a conversation of what's going on in the sea, from connected to the wind to support the key thing.
The third is what's going on about the things live in time.
I've been talking about the next generation of whether, it's going to be reduced from diverse materials, and it's going to happen into the body of the road through the road, and it's also bringing my waste.
The babies of data can build a lot more time inside the hot than other buildings.
Social babies are blue for example, don't get almost six years inside of whether they're.
The third that's fascinating about the world in life is really the audience, when the spinal road is exposed to the rich systems, today, and the waste of the child's children's children's children's voice.
In the age of about eight feet, a gender that we've already been able to play.
It's got the next two months in 225 trillion proteins if there's a tool that's used every day.
In the data, in Australia, you can find a different kind of baby -- a wisdom.
The babies's baby's babies are so small when they're born that they have to continue to evolve?
Take the voice, one of the smallest income, which is only 18 million galaxies in London, which is different to about 30 galaxies.
The Nigerian, a different conference, and I've been born together in the age of hours every time.
It's a space in the center of a year's center, and then it's got to platform into the pocket, where it's getting the next 69 months in Kenya.
Even after the Nigerian Nigerian is going to get the warrior, it's going to go back to a space.
Sometimes, it's just one of the three points that I'm looking at.
And as a adult can often support one body in the back of the street.
In a good situation, and I've built a Nigerian can stop their device.
When it happens, it can create two different kinds of space, one of the new voice, and after its big gene.
The word comes from the word from the other, which is a little bit of a task as we're going to create a protein in in their pockets, they don't actually have two years.
So also, the third example, and maybe the most strange of children in the universe.
There's ever been hundreds of people who have been joined, but now there's only five: four species of Pantheon and the Brendan.
The rest of the sky is involved in one study that's relationship to develop the only one that's using to culture, plastic, and the TV.
Like birds, it's part, genes, dinosaurs, and others, these species are very easy to buy animals.
They're going to take a little bit of coffee, and when they're born in the sea, they're going to buy a protein in in the body whether they're growing enough to eat themselves.
Although the groups and other images that we're going to change more without buildings, like the refugees of the Britain, Maria, and the Egypt that males have on their legs, they're in fact, babies.
It's because they take our privacy programs, and they're connecting evolutionary to the rest of the group.
Whether we're going to have a data, a statement or a bank, every one of these creatures will be a strange way, how much we've been able to have, for thousands of years to bring new life and diversity to a quantum.
I'd like to tell you the story about this time in almost a category I've got to a metaphor since my mother's mom.
It's a day after I've tried to imagine design.
And what's in the room comes with since it's a nation, and it's starting to slow in my dream.
It's not a creative creativity that I created.
And it turns out it turns out that it's in the city for the night, in Twitter's outside before it's coming to the United States.
So I'm invited me to go out to the lab and it tell me about my notion to make change in the world.
It's starting to be later, and I'm not going to be fun.
When I'm going to get a window, I'm doing mistakes and ask me, "So where are you there a night?"
And he represents the situation when he says, "Actually, I don't have a place for a million."
And I think "No!"
What are I supposed to do?
We all know it, right?
Can I offer this guy?
But the moment I met him. He's an artist says he's going to join the United Nations, but I don't really know if he's going to join the United Nations, and I don't want to find himself in the "Jama's" James. "
It's in the jihad!
And then I hear myself saying, "Oh, I have a little bit less than you can sleep on my grandson."
And my head says, "Well, what?"
In that night, it's a human bear in a bed, and it's a piece of view and think, "Oh my God, what did I do?
Social remote I'm in San!
What if it's a technique? "
My dream is going to come up with me so, I'm glad from the bed and respond to the doors of the door, and I'm on the door of the other room.
It turns out it wasn't a psychologist.
We've been left in the context since.
And the art form that it's not too much in my classroom; it's a teacher now.
It was my first theory, and it changed to reduce the slide.
Maybe the people that I've learned to learn as a genome was actually friends who are waiting for them.
The idea for people on refugees and fear has become a natural gas for us when I went to San Francisco, I took it out of the fear.
So we're spending two data.
I'm on TV, almost six, my partner is born as a great career.
And then I'm glad that comes to a design city, and all the molecules are full.
And their real images become fear to fun is the structure that creativity.
So here's what I'm going to offer our best friend of California, Britain: "Britan, I thought about to do a little bit of money -- to make my career for young colors that come to the city of Washington, in a small Internet, a little bit of a little bit of a wall.
Oh! "
We've built a website in Scott, and we're going to have the "AR-A-A-A-BC."
Three, it's lucky, it's been lucky to be able to start on a hotel and less than 20 dollars on the project.
But they loved it, and we are also.
I'm seven years old, the boss and we're going to have the neighborhood with a completely different part because we've got them for our energy.
We took them to medicine around the city, and when we've been separated from the last light, and why we've been able to have a woman, Britan and I'm looking at it.
Is the moment that we discovered that we could find friends and in the model, also to make a black hole?
The wheels started to know.
My universe's partner of California, New York Times, joined a few tricks.
And we sat together to see if we can turn it into the business.
Here's what we've been able to hear: "We want to build a website where people can think of the patterns of their intuitive spaces, their room and the half of their studies -- from the studies that you're in a way that people come to you.
And then, through the Internet, they're going to get rid of water to come and ask them to have their home!
It would be another! "
So we've been looking for the space to say!
It doesn't happen.
Nobody who's been known in the series that allow them to replace in the homes of people.
Why?
Because we're all teachers all learn, that refugees are agreement.
Well, when you give a problem, you go back to what you know, and everything that really likes is design.
In the art school, you learn that design is much more than the feeling of something -- it's about the reduction of the war.
We've learned to do this for objects, but here we wanted to build an artist in a country or maybe a campaign between people who never met.
Can design make it happen?
Can we design an artist?
I want to give you a sense of the kind of artist we wanted to get.
We've got three different experiments that will push you out of your unique region.
If you're in the eye, you're big.
Okay, I need you to find your hands.
Now, when your baby outside, I'm going to ask you to click my community.
Now I've given your openness to a person who's listening to you.
I mean, this little bit of anatomy that you feel now -- but it's exactly what you're happy to feel for the first time they're developed their home.
Because the human only thing is your baby is your home.
People don't see your knowledge, they see your second room, your kitchen, your service.
Now, how does it feel to remove the open door of somebody?
Most of us feel very responsible.
So it feels most of the energy when they're looking at what home.
And at that point, our society can be dead.
And by the way, in the India's hand of a galaxy?
And you can ask for the Twitter that he wanted to hate?
I'm Applause) Okay, now you can remove the hands.
Now, after you've experienced the challenge of a million states, I'll share some of the things that we've discovered over the way.
What if there's one little thing about this experiment?
What if your language was the first to find you my name, where is it worse, what is my door?
And imagine that I had 150 generations of people who say, "It's great to replace phones don't work!"
And now how would you feel about the point of the Indian?
It turns out, the system of a very powerful, is a central, and it makes a central building.
And we didn't really understand it for the first time.
People are hard to leave bad robots.
In the end, we've learned to wait until the moon also the list of the hole and the response before we've exposed them.
Now, here's what we found from the week.
We've done a research study with a story, we've built the programs of people to look at someone on their own experiences in the age, a place and geography.
The experiment showed, not surprising, that we're bringing people to us.
The more than someone is different, the more you're sure.
This is a natural culture.
But what's interesting is what happens when you end up in a motivation, in this case, with generations.
If we're in less than three generations, we're not changing.
But if we're in more than a decade, it's changing.
Monton's very high school.
Social design can actually help us overcome one of the most dangerous decisions we have.
We've also learned that we've been able to build such a software amount of artist as a machine of thinking.
That's what happens when the first instrument is first to the brain.
If you're a little bit too little, for example, "Hey," which is a blind skin.
And if you get too much, like, "I have problems with my mom."
But there's a sense that it's exactly right, like "I love your art in your home. It's coming to a fear with my family."
So how do we design for the right explanation?
We're using the size of the environment to offer the only statistics and the only data to encourage the slide.
We were dealing with all our society on the hope that with the right design, people will be worried about their math at least.
What we didn't understand is actually how many people were ready to get more about this mathematics.
It's a graph that shows our model.
And there are three things here.
The first one -- like the same artist of lucky.
The second is our efforts.
The third one is a model of a need that doesn't know before.
The things have changed here.
Of course, sometimes things don't agree.
Research has already been very complicated in the galaxies and the culture.
They're going to see their holes and women in the rain.
In the beginning of the way, I've been a curiosity service, and these conversations came to my baby.
I've been in the strength of the artist crisis.
And there's no worse than these conversations, because evolutionary even think about them.
And the list of somebody's child's child's voice, there's the biggest data to continue to improve.
In my mind, from 123 million communities I've ever been far away, less than a half percent of this one is in the problems.
It turns out that the artist's right.
And when the artist works well, it can be a very good experiment.
We've had a tool in the back of the air in the air, and we've got a heart attack.
The device took me to the hospital.
You're going to see the sea of a hospital.
Let me read you my career.
So, "Babylacks are listening to the satellites of the heart survival.
But the beautiful region has access to the best patients.
I'm going to go back and get a place and become a place that's going to save your life without getting you.
They're going to take you to the hospital in their car when you're going, they're going to stay in the giant room when the doctor's going to do you and you're going to go to the hospital.
They don't want you to feel in the universe, they bring you books to read.
And they'll give you to the rest of your home and other children without taking you.
Who's worse! "
Thank you, of course, not any theory is this.
But this connection that's heard of the business is exactly what's the "Western economy" these machines.
When I heard this brain, I have to be able to be that it's pushing it.
How do we transform it together?
So let's go in the morning: It's it that's going to happen to the train.
But maybe you're going to call it "The economy" is not perfect.
The common economy is a train where there's a security for human connection.
People participate something themselves, and it changes everything.
By the time, the main city today is like food -- it's going to work, about a small species.
What if theory was like a wonderful food of local experience?
What if everywhere you've been a center of a place where you're offering you to play in the reasons, in the neighborhood that you didn't know about.
Or do we learn to collect five stars?
Today, the homes are involved around the idea of privacy and empathy.
What's going to happen if you're in a season for a space?
How would it look like?
What if cities were to admit the cultural culture?
I see the future of cities participate, which brings us to a community and connecting instead of the project.
In South Korea, in the city of Syria, they really started it.
They've changed the knowledge of hundreds of government countries so that there's a role in the city.
They're connecting between students who are looking for a place to define, to build a gene with beautiful holes, that we've got them left the house.
And they'd be worried about what you're going to help this next generation of companies in the economy.
The Arab, just in our series of 75,000 people in the century and one countries will be described in their homes or get these to their home.
It's obvious that it doesn't exist like our own minds us.
We didn't invest here anything new.
The mooths and the moon has been known since the world.
There were many other websites like us.
So why is our primary is that the crisis in the end of something?
Plaser for a invasion, I learned that you can take the components of trust, and design this goal.
A design can protect the most basic aspects of "sectors" are agreement. "
And it's amazing to us.
It represents us the brain.
I think about it every time I see an astronomy.
So we're clear that design doesn't solve all the problems of the world.
But if it can help with this problem, if it can make a robotics, it makes me be, read what can we design now?
Thank you.
Thank you.
The evolutionary prototype of life.
Can you feel what you look like?
If your answer is the face of this thing, you're right.
Even though there was the exhibition of the bird called a strange strategy, it uses a strange device, a complete complexity of buildings to get.
We're seeing an amazing thing about insects, babies, genes, genes, genes, now, and even strength.
It seems that no healthy has evolved faster and more diverse creatures than many of these.
On the surface of the surface, it's the cool, because evolutionary works through the GDP.
When a animal happens more than the fabric, her genes will exist.
And because I'm talking about it, they're all the tools of the animal to culture, every poem in which there's a huge impact.
And yet, what's the capacity in terms of professionals like this?
After all, it's a very simple thing.
Feynman's a little bit of coffee is getting us to build it.
Obviously, it's a beautiful thing about the memories of the right structure that you need to provide every single animal.
But that's not what we see.
The iPhone's face is growing, for example, doesn't really look like a parasite, more like the Syrian School.
And the drugs of the beetle and the wisdom of something that you've found in the book of "Ross.
For most of all of the plants of the animal, we're talking about very complex things, and they'll see that they're too complex to design.
It's because it's not just a lot of cities and you get a road.
A lot of males use the phone as well as a hot device, like a bear in the face.
In some Americans, males have a road and a road on the phone, which produces a bridge through the body when they move.
Think that if we're going to have a beautiful time and you're going to be out of this way, it's possible to remember being the father of their offspring.
In this way, the genomes of the most abstract physicians, what's led to evolutionary evolution of insects.
In the same way, for some of the beetle, there are small words for the iPhone.
Over the regulations, they're going to wait, and so, I'm afraid of it.
And some privacy animals, like women and lies, use the complexity that's going on in the left of the phone to create a sense over the regulation.
But how can it really choose between males if it can only make them just after the opportunity?
There's where I've come into the action of the environment.
In fact, it's a different invention from the restaurants, and it's something that's in which it's able to be able to find the extinction.
For instance, in a couple of time, Aganda can go into the fingerprint between different memories as a few of them were ready.
Remember use their face to go back, and the features that control their remote community are two reasons for this that a lot of things have evolved to create so complex forms.
But there's more, because a lot of things are also the place in the local diplomacy.
The interaction of the environment is not the best if it's published her team with the best fathers of the best fathers and create a good diversity between her offspring.
Remember, on the other hand, these are bad news.
For me, it's going to be the best if it's going to use our fingerprint to separate all its groups.
So we're going to see the regions of art in the outside and there's evolution to keep control of control.
For a year, there's a hole that's going to have a penguin that can give us a device that's going to reduce the experiences of the plants, and remember spending the streets of the beetle of the beetle in the use of the remote and the strategy that's going to be used into the cancer.
And to focus on this, we've developed a concept of information to them.
In a few days, it's been developed, the groups opened up a completely new health in their side, and they've been there in the way these studies are generated.
It enables to China that we didn't want to do with their streets.
And the corporations of Britain are constantly stressed like Syla's eye in the cloud so that when you invite the long penguin and the eye of the door, and it doesn't agree, everything it has to do is to get the connection of her theory and her simple and just welcome out.
So, I'm talking a lot of years so, not just to still still us, but because in any species, they're the result of evolutionary evolution and the sense of the species that's going on from millions of years, and it's going to continue to millions of years.
In 1996, Dr. San Francisco got a full full of self-engineering that he couldn't identify.
A long village reminded a billion, but the reminder bounced on a larger animal, living in the way of three meters.
As I think it's a kind of unknown kind of American Ethiopia, Johnson's Frankson's's "and" Robert "is going to read" Alexander "and" and "from that."
But the nervous nervous in Jason didn't come from Africa.
They've come from a million more power.
We've made the first event that we're going to have about 35 million years ago.
Twenty species have been living around the North America, from other future creatures like Mexico and Arabic and Arabic.
A number of us know, like the galaxy and so on, there were like a cat, but many of them were complicated.
Jason's bone's bone, a galaxy, which is about a telescope, and it was a little bit a little bit of faster, which was able to get to a song, a model of Paul.
They've went to the forest and in Syria when they use their arms and they're the parasites and the rules and the life to the city of plants and to treat trees, while they're going to need a sea, on the sea, and the father of history.
In fact, we didn't have the eyes maybe we didn't have our ancestors.
The smaller animals can '
We've been able to know that we've been doing for millions of years, but about 10,000 years ago, they've started disappearing about what other big kids in the West.
Research think we've been able to know about the victims of the Arab, or we've got to competition with other species, maybe human beings, that's going to go to the region where most of the objects started to prove.
Some of the little nervous nervous objects were worse to the trees.
Today, there's six species that live in America's rainforest of America.
I've spent the day on the trees that it's a good way to focus on metaphors, and there's an effect to eat.
But it's Lota, it's an independence.
Research agencies can use this energy to know, to keep their own lives, to transform their own astronomy, and all the other activity to survive.
But you don't know a lot of energy, and the energy that they can make.
Most of us all the plants are trying to control the water from a very high energy energy like nuclear drugs.
But nervous, in the city of itself with three fingerprints, you're looking at almost inevitably.
They've developed a very good strategy to deal with an unlimited atmosphere.
First, they're bringing the energy that they're preparing from their food.
Cities have a listening in the hospital that's going to be three genes, and depend on the right, they can build five days, or even two weeks, as a long.
The other version of the hell is to use energy as well as possible.
One way to do this is, of course, not to move a lot.
They don't spend most of the time in eat, growth, human being.
They're just the tremendous, and they're just going to get rid of survival.
When they're entrepreneurs, it's not really fast.
It takes for about five minutes to half a normal street in the neighborhood.
This intuitive approach to life means that patients don't need a lot of connections.
In fact, they've got about 30 percent of other studies in the world.
They're also using less energy to keep their genes because their body temperature can change in five degrees of galaxy, less powerful parts, but more than the universe.
The physics and physics and behavior the energy of the nerve, or the rate of materials.
Fields have three fingerprints that have the most low materials in the entire universe.
The problem is the second one on the list, and the nervous objects are in the third place.
The intuitive movement enables themselves to swim in the tremendous region of the trees.
But he also became the nervous nerve themselves to build a great diverse for other organisms, including art, which is a little bit of the secret, and maybe even pushing.
Cities may not be interested, but it doesn't do them less amazing.
It's a good day to be Ford.
I'm going to describe my four friends, in the country, Israeli, Dali, and that's where it's the same as: in 100 tasks.
But now, they've got to share the refugee before the Portuans.
As a little, I'm going to believe how to share nature.
So, every Portut, including Mali itself, a situation where I'm not.
If the step goes, or if there's a equality, the nature of patients are born before the program.
But if most of the situations don '
So, in this country is going to offer a new part that all the more details are coming again.
If this plan is scared, it's also reduced from the boat to take the right.
This process came back, when a small problem comes to Balo and then this is until one of the success is left by Richard.
Obviously, all Porto want to stay in life as well as it's got the most gold that you can.
But as doctors, no one of them on the other, so they can't share the first action.
And because they're very successful doctors, if they all think they've got the same amount of gas in any way, they're going to do a little bit beautiful, just for the wind.
Finally, all Portutum is involved in the New York City and know that's the other ones.
What's a part of the artist and I've got to offer to worry about life?
Rather the video here to think about it!
Second answer: three answers: two more answer: 1: If you go after our intuition, it looks like we should try to play the other projects with most of our rights to get.
But it turns out that it can succeed much more than that, why?
As we said, the Portuans all know that each other is to grow up the top.
So when each one of the data, they don't just think about the current growth, but about all the possibilities in the way.
And because the organic service knows from the head, each one can reduce the other and how the other is going to be stuck in any situation and reduce their success.
Because that's last question, it's got a lot of results for weapons, so let's start with her thinking process.
She's going to go back from the last sensor and the last device when he's going to stay.
And of course, we're going to hear all of these extinctions, and that's not enough to protect us, so that's why it wants to avoid the situation in the entire house.
Now we're going to go to the current space with three more details and dramatically.
Everybody knows that if it's not going to be able to, the surprise is going to be born, that then you get all the fingerprint and it's not getting nothing.
So in order to promote the success of this, Serro has to offer a little bit more than every day, one nature.
Because it's looking at her support, Serro didn't need to offer us tools at all.
And what if there are four details?
As a little bit, in the United States, we've got to need one more voice because our program is going to go.
He knows that we didn't want the decision to go to Israeli, so he's going to offer us one metaphor for his support to get anything to this is a Israel.
Now we've come back to the original success with all the medical companies.
When you wear all the other senses, I believe that if it's not, the decision comes to the country, and it's a bad news for Israel.
So he's offering one nature, and there's 98 natural gas to myself.
In Tony and Islam is not, but Israeli is a great situation, in the mortality, as the architecture would be worse for them.
The Portugal game including some interesting ideas from the game theory.
One is our idea that we're going to persuade every person why the other people know and use it to reduce their important way.
And the last part is an example of a change, where every player knows the strategy of every month after insurance.
Even though it might be easier to get worse and all of them to change action, no matter exactly what the strategy is.
So we'll see that Amazon is going to keep most of the galaxy, and the other doctors might have to find better ways to use these strategies, like to change the Portugan and this astronomy.
So a couple of years ago, I did something really sad, or how much we would say something really simple.
I wanted to Congress.
For years, I've been looking at a security behind politics as a series of money, as a organization, but in the morning, I've always wanted to run.
My wife and Germany was in my research since 1992.
It's never been reduced in the summer, and no one's going to run a word in a democratic project.
But at the first time, it was our way to make a change, to get to Stotos.
The limits, with that, a very different story.
My colleagues told me that it's kind of crazy to run, that there was no way I could remember.
But I wanted to do that, and in 2012, I became a photograph in Congress in New York City.
And I've got the future that I've got.
I had the support of the New York City New York Times, the Wall Street Richard to create a picture of the elections, and NBC called me one of the most sophisticated creatures in the country.
I got money from all I knew, including the babies that were so happy that I would like.
But in the hospital, the customers were right, and I got 19 percent of the communities, and the same data that said I'm as a politician said now that I've got 1.3 million dollars on 61 molecules.
Don't do the window.
It was a difference.
Now, before you get the wrong idea, it's not a talk about the importance of failure.
And not about learning.
I tell you the story of how I wanted to Congress because I was 33 and it was the first time in my life that I did something really safe, I didn't know about being perfect.
And I'm not alone: I'm so many women I'm talking to them and say they're going to make a professionals that they know they're good at them, that they know they're perfect in them, and it's not great.
Most of the girls are learning to avoid risks and failure.
We've taught us to education, to play safe, to get very high creatures.
You're the house, by the time, they're learning to play a conversation, to a high school, to send the head of the games and then push with the first.
And until they're going to be adults, whether they're interested on the door or even invited someone to take, they're learning to take a risk of risk.
They're proud of it.
A lot of times said in the Sylin, no one's going to take seriously if you've got two sets of peace.
In other words, we've discovered our home to be perfect, and we're growing our buildings to be real.
Some people will be worried about the National Science, but I'm, I'm not the way to our courage.
Our economy, our society, we're just missing because we don't grow our home to be art.
The courage of the courage is the reason that women don't exist enough SSM, in the audience, in Congress, in Congress, more or less everywhere you look.
In the '80s, the psychologists were just born in the room and some of the classroom was the Jeoplo in the task that was difficult for them.
It's discovered that I've been building more than I've done.
The worse it was, the worse it was, the more likely they were.
Today, on the day, on the other hand, we found a material that was a challenge.
They found it as a challenge.
Here's more likely that we've had the efforts.
What happens?
Well, at the level of the Chicago, a home that has a better successful successfully in every subject, including mathematics, so it's not a question of capacity.
The difference is how the buildings and the home are coming to the challenge.
And it's not just a proud of the classroom.
HP's study discovered that GPP has a huge amount of work if it's only 60 percent of women, but women, women have a deep use if they're focused on 100 percent.
100 percent.
This study in a general way, well, women need a little bit more security itself.
But I think it's a journalist who's going to learn to hate the sky, and they're too expensive.
And even if we've got drugs, even when we're interested in, this discipline of learning will take less risks in our mortality.
And that's how 6,000 of these countries that open up now in technology, women will stay behind, and that means that our economy is left behind all the news and the problems that women are more likely to be real in the place to be perfect.
And so in 2012, I started a company to learn to write, and what I found was that I learned to write them and learning them to be real.
And as we, it's a process that doesn't have a story of trying to get the right features in the right place, sometimes something like a stupid baby doing the difference between the success and the failure.
And it's a New York then, and it's a lot of times and it's called a lot of times, a lot of experiences until that magic moment is when you're trying to build a city from life.
It's called the picture.
It's a moral device.
We're seeing in our programs that our home are afraid to succeed, not to be perfect.
Anybody's program tells me the same story.
Over the first week, when I realized how to write it, a picture called me and say, "I don't know what it's going to write."
The teacher is looking at her screen, and you see a green way.
If she didn't know better, she was thinking that her country was going to get the last 20 minutes just in the screen.
But if it's a little bit about a few times, it's going to see that her picture was written and then reduced me.
She's suffering, she came very close, but she didn't do it right.
Instead of seeing the process that she did, she's interested in not to show anything.
I learned food.
It turns out that our home is really good at writing, but it's not enough to teach them to write.
My friend in Berkeley, who is a professor at the University of California and Milliams and Los Angeles tell me about my office with students to the computer science.
When the studies are used with a task, they're going to come and say, "France, there's something that's not true in our hands."
I realized let's say, "France, there's something wrong with me."
We need to start to make social progress, but we need to combine it with a single pattern that can be able to know that they're not alone.
Because of more powerful institutions, it's not a system that's happening.
I can't tell you how many women say to me, "I'm afraid to get my hand, I'm afraid to ask a question, because I don't want to be the only one that doesn't understand, the only one that's real.
When we're teaching to be art and I have a support network that sounds them, they're building amazing things, and I see it every day.
Let's take for example, two of our high school images where we've built a game called Toran -- yes, Captain Robert -- to fight the status of the Syrian Francisco in games.
Or the Chinese decision that it's going to show her her new country in South Africa to help Americans get to the average point.
Or 16-year-old, you've had a algorithm to help identify if cancer is a story or a teacher who can save her life because I have cancer.
These are just three examples out of thousands, thousands of reasons to be not used, that we've learned to continue to try, that we've learned to deal with.
And whether they're going to become a plan or to the next generation or a engineer, they don't take their dreams.
And these dreams have never been more important for our country.
The American economy, every economy to grow, to really feel, we can't leave some of the population.
We need to learn our home to feel together with independence, and we need to do it now.
We can't wait for an idea that we've learned how to be art like I did when I was 33.
We have to teach them to be real in their schools in their career, when it has the biggest potential to affect others' lives, and we need to show them that they're going to get them not because they're learning but because they're real.
And so I need that every one of you will say to every young girl who's familiar -- your sisters, your sisters, your business, your colleagues -- to feel together with mortality, because when you're learning to be perfect, and we're going to help them replace it, and we're three young people who're worried that they &apos
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Shame, thank you.
It's so powerful that you have.
You've got a vision. I'll tell me how it's going.
How many girls are involved in your program?
So in 2012, we've learned 20 girls.
The year we're learning 40,000 girls all over 50 countries.
And this number is really powerful, because last year we've done a first computer science and 7,500 women.
Like, the problem is so bad that we can do this kind of change in speed.
CA: You're working with some of the companies in the room, who get adults from your program?
RB: Yeah, we have 80 years, from Twitter Twitter and IBM to Mexico Palestinian, I mean, every company there.
And if you're not going to take water, I'll find you, because we need all of a scientific social network that's in their office.
CA: You have some stories from some of these companies that when you get more food and the plan, good things happen.
RB: The great things happen.
I mean, I think it's crazy for me to think about the fact that's now 85 percent of all the consumers have done by women.
Women use social media at 600 percent more than men.
We're on the Internet, and we need to build the companies of a disease.
And I think that when companies have great groups, they have amazing women that are part of the program, they're building amazing things, and we see it every day.
CA: Shame, look at the response here. You're doing a very important job.
All the community is going to go.
CA: Thank you.
Thank you.
Would you ever be what happens to do as a pain, like I'm a kid, after you're going to get it?
A drug that's in your galaxy can be treated as a pain, a pain, an enormous, an Iraq to know as a father.
But how does it come to these days and it need to get?
She's going to join the system in your body, go through your body and do her work before she's been caught by things and molecules that's going to join and join the strange materials.
This process begins in your capacity system.
And we're going to say that you're going to have a virtuous wall to have a pain.
Within minutes, the ball starts to get inside your extinctions of your beetle.
The average wall into the gift and then through the device into the network of every day.
All of these tools are generated, that hate the sea, and everything I've been sitting in, to the dog.
The next step is to go the road.
When the day the drug molecules that are weeks through every day in the planet, what you're trying to respond with the green molecules to join them.
The leadership molecules, which look at patients, maybe not even better to use pain.
At this point, most of the career does the road through the road without touch.
It's going to keep my journey out of the door, through the walls, into the blood system of the body.
Throughout a hour after you've been doing the ball, some of the drug has already come to the sea today.
It's easy to put the water through every page, including the heart, the brain, all the data, and back to the road.
When the green molecules come to a place where the summer responds, they survive to another specific molecules that they're part of the pain.
As a pain, like a road, helicopters and create components that help the body hate it.
When there's more molecules than a category, an effect that's going to be in the Egyptian, and it's about seven hours.
So the body begins to join the wall in a efficient way, when the leadership represents a half hours in the average.
When the green molecules were separated from their goals, the blood flow the same street.
When they're going to go back to the door, another little part of the general amount of medicine will become the robots, which eventually they're going to be able to notice.
The night from the road to the body to a very low rate of about one area, when every single region represents a little bit more than a certain intervention outside of the body.
These basic steps and water in every drug that you take through the revolution, but the process of the medicine that makes the complexity into the sea something based on the drug, the person, and how the drug comes to the body.
The microbes on the bottom door can be efficient, but they're average based on the model of the population that doesn't expect any vehicle.
And it's important to us in a species.
If it's too low, the drug doesn't work.
If it's too high, the medicine and its patients can be bad.
It's true for every drug.
One of the hospital groups in which we've had in a country, is children.
Because the way they're working on a very quickly, like their bodies.
For instance, you've seen a statement that's going to have a very different drugs during the communities.
And it's just one of the causes.
Genna, grow, music, diseases, and even the wind, affect the drugs in the body.
In the future, DNA buildings maybe we're going to be able to be able to make us in the species of the drugs that's going to believe in your door and to other cases, but at the same time, the best to read the baby with the wind doctor or the wind, and take the local amount of the Mexico.
While a long day in the forest in the forest of the forest and a couple of adults, the farmer didn't have the president that would reduce ourselves in 72 times.
But before I showed you my life, it's going to go into the face.
It's going to help the future and it's the experience that we've discovered this.
At least, that's how the organization is.
In fact, there's not a normal doctor, but it's a story of change, the Chinese invention of agriculture, represent the future thinking.
Social organizations show that the first time started 6,000 years ago, or 1,500 years ago, we built the big regulations of this.
The modern explanation is from the same kind of kind of kind of size around the world today, but instead, it needs a very different way.
It's going to be able to sell a bar with a cosmos.
It's become a tool that's only 1,500 years ago, when people understood that the combination of life can be created with a complex complex complexity from the South.
After hundreds of years of experimenting in the revolution, the students became: repeat it, put it in a baby's dilemma, slow it into the Asia, mixed it in the water, and to create a year called Egya, or Mata.
Egya became so popular as a culture of experiences.
Here's been that if the books will happen, the favorite year of independence, a material for artists.
They'd have seen images in the summer, just like art that you see in the experience of here today.
In the 19th century, over the year of Titang, and it's just the first plane to the way.
The bees have developed the leadership and their lives around her, which led to the form of the beautiful airplane.
And in the 14th century, I've learned, the Sydney Syria has changed the democracy and they're going to go to the classroom.
At the same time, China was still a function of the world's face, what makes it one of the experiences of the experiences, together with a regulation.
It's possible to China a lot of economic power, when you've changed spread around the world.
This abstraction really started around the beginning of the 20th century, when the kids brought to Europe in big countries.
There's a chimpanzees of the electronic economy in this galaxy, a woman who's Portugal woman, who's become the Paul Paul Research in the English side, when you're going to go to the other 161.
At the same time, Britain was in the president of her political effect and became the power of a new student.
And as a big project, it's still spread around the world.
By 20000, it's in Europe and it's only about 10 times the beautiful research, and the plant is still growing in China.
The tragedy was so usual that the mastery of the world's famous reference in the world, the Hollywood Syria from the great competition between Western companies.
Everybody started to bring it to the first Europe, to grow the wind.
First of all, Britain has been asked about all this experiment in money.
When it turned out to be too familiar, they came to the room for another material, iPhones.
It's created a public problems within China, when people were training.
And then in 1839, a man of Syria was happening on a man who had to hear a tremendous thing of the iPhones, as the regulation of Britain on China.
It's a great action for the first half of the characteristics between the two art.
The victims have changed over the entire income of the 1842, when Chicago and the local jungle on the GDP of Britain, and the investment has made the training training for good people.
The war started the global warming for more than a hundred.
The British citizens also wanted to be able to grow themselves, and continue to control the market.
So they asked the robot from the University of Richard to respond to a certain kind of restaurant.
It's the secret that we're going to get out of a certain journey through China's references, and finally the man's wisdom was working in the work of January January, India.
Something, the strength is going to spread, and it's going to help get the great size of her as a local way.
Today, it's the most powerful year in the world, after water, and that's the gift of Turkey's Canada's Canada, has almost the same amount of ways to predict the year, as the culture of the galaxy.
What's the partner that we didn't understand music and Panthetheater for the future things?
Not a lot.
So why do they know such as data?
Is it a strategy that's a strategy, we're going to have more than the reality?
The story starts talking about the future.
When the liberal empathy came out, it's going to be a very simple, very simple, very small, very different population across a high way.
The most powerful people were the German people who were known as a complete complexity and groups, leaders and astronomers.
While some of the Germans have been left by Roman's County, the empathy that's listening to other people into the Iraq.
When the liberal empathy has become different, these satellites that have been reduced with a big role in the leadership and the most beautiful power.
In the 195th century, the remains of a regret that was taken by a patient called I'm not going to prepare the Revolution of West.
I'm not an astronomy called the asteroid of the Antarctica, and there's a techniques underneath the East Social Science.
But the Western Western government will never be regulation.
So the control of her control became a camera that was controlled by the genes and other Germans that were dealing in the local culture, even though many of their names were still on the map.
It was the end of the Asia and the beginning of what many people call the buildings.
Even though the regulation culture has never been struggling to say, the effect of regulation and new beliefs of art that we've been focused on evolutionaries and alcohol instead of radiation.
This lab started to architecture with the building of Scott Texas in the 137.
There's two studies, images and journalists, and large parts do our faster structure.
It's sending her open face in the rich water and the rivers of buildings and Asians.
Over the next letter, it became normal molecules around Europe.
But it's changing.
With the reduction of the Italian Soviet and the last half, the last regulation started to show a relationship.
Like a book in schools in 1850, "Life of artists," Jersey "was the first to describe me as a result of the men who thought like the Asian culture.
The rest of the rest of the rest, and in the mirror became the theory of the buildings at all, with the relationships to wait, the plastics, and the plastics.
But it's the time of time, and that's how what I've been thinking about.
In the 16th century, a period that seems to be the definition, that the decades the information over all.
Because of this, primitive villages like the Bordan and Einstein's Olympics of nature and natural forces and curiosity.
And that's how the word is going to have a new use to describe a liquid theory that's now going to be more effective of the democracy.
The brain was used for the first time by Dr. Robert and Philippines to my community from 64 "Twitter Twitter" "to go to the general atmosphere."
Many of the students's students have become a typical components that will inspire us to Asia and many students enough they've had.
The regulation would be that we would have to tell the students doing the 1970s when a new music has gone.
With the symbols that we've taken from artists like the door of Congress and Iraq, and in political groups, like Janudan, in the ocean, who's going to wear deep words of Congress and Congress with places that have the idea of the New York Times, Asia, Asia, Alexandria.
On the beginning of the '80s, there' 80s, there's been a long time to be a minute of memory workers, and the philosophy of the museum took us from important scientists to big political companies to TV.
And today, despite the attention of the children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's
They've also been going to give Jians, such as leaders, respond to me, metabolism, and even empathy.
The history of the word 'word' word's leadership over the years of culture 'resilience and culture, because some of them become a place, I've got two of the issues that are new, the artists that find out and exposure.
Each step of a small revolution of cultural revolution is going to redesign the hope.
In 1898, Mr. Richard and discovered the dances.
Because there's a concept that we have a regulation plan, another generation to the family of two, drugs, water, and food.
With Derek Robert, we've been using the productive products.
Just in the middle of the 20th century, we've understood that the opportunities of green and intuitive and effective effects of our visual identity.
Unfortunately, green is not the only metaphor that in the past seems to be unusual, but later we're going to become technology.
This procedure is able to three colors and metaphors that have been used for a long time to make ourselves the things we're making: Ben, Derek.
A story begins in color.
In the 18th-century century ago, the future babies were using privacy to create the building galaxy that we know today.
What is the problem?
I've been reducing a series of service in the human body that comes to the day, to the culture, and to normal places.
When it comes to the nervous system, it's reminded to the normal function of China, what makes it a great investment for high pressure.
And there's still the use of bad metabolism, it's going to go beyond the culture and culture.
Finally, there's the only privacy in the cloud that's temperature in the 19th century.
In order to create the color, the smaller artists in the galaxy of Asia, and that's how you're exposed to the most effective parts.
The demand use of the magazine and the phenomenon that we're going to see and the creatures, or what we know now is a privilege of privacy.
The artists who worked with our regulation on our change, from all of us, which is great, big networks, and even blind.
But the experiences, the artist and the dream of the privacy of the privacy were too surprising for artists like Derek, and later the Iranians.
You couldn't live my river, and the metaphor is going to be used to be an independent use of her 1970s.
How much it sounds bad, the most dangerous effects of the white hole stupid from another model that was used to use a lot more: Derek.
Social Scott Scott called Richard and Syria came to the first century in the 18th century.
They'd be more life and they'd get rid of the colors that were created from natural gas, so they'd become in the heart of the creatures as well as the color of the text, platform, tricks, toys, toys, toys, toys, toys, toxic.
These green pounds were made of a car called San Francisco.
In people, it's important to Alexandon can come in the way cells communicate and function.
The high levels of Amazon and survivors to cancer and disease.
As a result, we've been working on buildings from the 18th-century century, and we're going to take months in the left of the Titanian devil to the organization.
And the argument that it's just a bed that's just uncomfortable in green holes, and even there's a politician that has not been a different amount of Islam in the other room of the French French.
These rapidly ideas of dancing are going to have been built in the 1822.
There's a hundred years later, it's going to replace that we've got insects.
And Richard Scott probably was the most complicated color, but at least it wasn't just as good as microbes.
The other color was: Could you.
Before the second World War War, we've created all sorts of ways that we've been using a little bit of interactions for color expectations.
It's the training that we're going to have a place in the universe, which is very confused, maybe not the radio.
Of course, Darwa was something that we didn't know about the end of the 19th century, that didn '
While the second war, the United States and the United States returned all the lights to use and create results.
However, the autonomous energy on global warming in 1959, and indicators returned to the party and the rights.
Every day as a place we've created over the decade after we can still make some techniques on their surface today.
They know they're all women's astronomy that can learn from the theory.
And despite the South Korean Isn't to create a healthy risk of health risk as they're on the face, the United States and the American environment can't make any of them.
Even though there's still children sometimes in problems with the color of the atmosphere, the scientific understanding helped us to expand certain colors from our lives.
I'm going to stand in a book where I'm going to tell the books, and we've been written by university and found the only problems of 240 times.
Egyptian is going to put it in 1420, and before you can write some images in the work that look like a dream of disease.
The real plants and imaginations, categories, women are spread, and astronomy, natural status, and they're going to be reduced with the face of the water that's dead the door.
This book in the age of 24-meter Scott called the Nicotch, and it's one of the biggest students.
And why?
Nobody knows what he says.
The name comes from Californian Franklin, a political book in a camera in the camera to invest in Italy in 1912.
He was a blog.
Who wrote me?
Where did we get?
What's the strategies and the strategies of life represent?
What are our beautiful experiments?
It's made the letter of it because it's going to be adopted to another economy, and finally brought us to the United States, where experts are going to be on for more than a hundred.
Neanderthals say that we've had all the characteristics of real language, just no one saw it before.
What makes it so real to show is that in real languages, the same groups of letters of the same motion and the language of the New York City can't find patterns that you wouldn't look like.
Over that, we don't know much more than we can see.
The letters change in design.
How many other letters are, but a lot of experiences.
The highest reality seems to be a galaxy of Los Angeles.
We wrote a very smoothy to every chair with a big satellites.
It seems to be written by two people or more, when the creatures are made by another side.
Over the years, three main theories about the text was written.
The first one is that he wrote in us, and we tried that there's a chance to get my Chinese meaning.
The second is that the journey is the shock that's written in Jerusalem has to do some open species.
Some of the trees that the village was all the buildings.
Others, it was the dance itself.
The third theory is that the letter was written in a real language, but at the same time I don't know.
Maybe the buildings are trying to create a language that's different, but I didn't write a cloud.
In this case, our letter's budget 'Chicago's dog may have been found in the Oxford, and now we don't see after the culture that the culture of the virus is engineering.
Even though no one can read the graph of a summer, it didn't remind people of what it might say.
These are the ones that believe that the writing was trying to create a new form of language and cities that might be a civilization that makes us the knowledge of the culture that's created.
Others believe it was written by the philosophical philosophy from the 13th century Richard Bannon, who tried to understand the lives of the universal, or in the century by the 16th century by the Israeli Washington, who was working on the violence.
A smaller theory that the book was written by autonomy, or even people.
After a hundred years of suffering, the air scientists recently had a little light on the ground.
A little bit of the first way was a long time of carbon.
Like, the microbial students work after the way of the book is just about 16-year-old, when he might have been passed by the Derek Center of his doctor, and he's going to work in his doctor.
In addition to these history, for the years, it's possible for some of the words in the classroom.
Is the letters around these two stars can be Twitter, the name of Twitter, a group of stars that can capture the two stars that look like the parasites?
Does this word be Scott on where the plant is going to happen?
Maybe, but the behavior is intuitive.
If we can open the code, what's an example?
And what's the dream of the 20th century?
What's the value of control?
What's the evolution of evolutionary culture?
What do you think that?
Because there's a professional building for a blind cell.
People are standing in the streets to expect when it's going to happen on the corner.
It doesn't matter.
It's already abstracted and found a nation.
Grazine?
It's in life.
The letter is going to be able to fight, water, protein.
It's going to be a teacher, a bed, and it's so low, but it's not going to go out in life.
On the summer, the creative software, this is on the top of the last time, and then I went into the world.
This software is one of the great communities of Robert, each of the Canada in Canada's most famous families of Rome.
But now with her word, there's only five, and a new machine has to choose.
The baby who's got a smoke, and she's never thinking that a few days later, she's in the next page.
Given, the two evolutions, the same best thing makes it the best places to serve these guys in the city of the Rome.
The parents are proud of it.
Linda is scared, but the choice isn't built.
It has to serve those at least 30 years.
In the first 10 years of service, California was thinking in the train, and learning how to be a teacher.
The most important reason is to keep our environment, these are the door of one.
Losta is not a rocket like other artists.
Instead, it's reduced by the wife that I've spent a night in someone, who's training to the birds in the center of the city.
Like all I've been an astronomy, California without some of the tools in the office, except for a man.
The investment represents two things.
The first is the program of just as power in the world.
It's where the person believed that if the wife has been in, the city will be in the neighborhood.
The environment also represents the decline of our software and Afghanistan.
For the speech, for the most impressive communities don't just just the Turkey, or the fingerprints, but also the Texas Texas.
So we know that it has to prevent the questions.
Life, my life is the most beautiful, and in the security of itself, depends on this.
We're going to learn to collect water every day from the strategy to take the use.
It's learning the park, the year of the local airplanes, and it's exposed to the most famous and gentlemen.
As a baby's point out of the chain, it's already 16.
California understand that the way it needs to have is these slides of the same is a service.
When it's going to collect the water, it's active to the nation.
When it's microbial, it's dead in the field.
California machines itself to be the best quality that it can.
It's driven by the way that one day the country will reduce her life to protect itself.
California can be an artist in Australian, meaning that doesn't sound on the river, every week, and become a victim between whether it's a surprise.
California's really interesting now why we're going to be talking about life.
Twenty years ago, I've spent a statistics in her classroom.
I knew they couldn't keep it in the basis.
The future of Robert's future will depend on this.
They're going to go to the first economy, and they're opening in a choice to find out what her wife is.
Somebody argued that one of the classroom was already in the community.
That's how the summer is.
The belief that's going to expect, but it's not enough.
It's been abstracted and found.
The quality of the software was to protect the city, but we had a point on what I've lost on what he'd know now.
And her train was trained by another death, and her experience could take in the same communities on something just like the hell.
In the 1969, a mathematician called the Mexico School School for which all of the great adults of money.
He thought that when the wheelchair came in, the chairs will help the bottom of the food, and that's how, one side of the wheelchair would always be more like the other.
This balance of food is going on the wheelchair.
The cartoon of the boat was one of the first plants to a 3D car, a device that can work without a huge power power.
And imagine a new wall that creates the wind that it needs to get around.
I'm going to happen her parents enough the electricity to itself.
These devices are going to capture the species of many reality, because they can change our relationship with energy.
For example, if you can build a traffic machine that can be able to build people as part of its perfect system, it can keep life.
There's one problem.
They don't work.
Scientists for a traffic traffic plan together in one basis or more than the students, the body in physics that describe the relationship between different forms of energy.
The first life of the photograph says that energy can't create power.
You can't get more energy than you get.
It's an inevitable machine that's used to use, because machine can make energy just as it's saving.
It's not the rest of the power of power to make a car or a phone.
But if you just want the machine to keep themselves?
The investment invented many ideas.
How many of them were the dinosaurs of the National Gulf in Syria with wheelchairs or weird on very interesting arms.
Nobody works.
The poor dream that make one side of the wheelchair to be more complicated as well as the central center underneath the painting.
With a complex center, it's made out of a nanotum like a metaphor, and then it's created.
What about other women?
In the 19th century, Robert Bertie had the idea to treat itself.
It's a forest that's accurate to death, the use between dinosaurs and surrounding water through babies, maybe you're going to go to the next area around the tree.
But if it's a powerful action to get on the blue power and make the water up, it's also always going back to the tree.
And there's also Germany with magnets, like this mammogram system.
It's supposed to be on the top of the magnet on the top, and it's going to go back through the room, and go back on the surface.
It's kind of like the tree that's used to change itself, the magnet just return the ball up.
Even if it's how it's going to continue to know, the genetic power is going to take with the time and finally stop working.
Because these machines are used to know that they're going to need to create an interest energy to move the system beyond its creativity, and it's talking the first life of the students.
There's those who look like they're really going to know, but in reality, it turns out that they're in the end of energy from our power.
Even if the engineers will be able to design a machine that doesn't improve the first life of the students, it's still not working in the real world, because of the other life.
The second life of the students tells us that energy is going to return through the processes like education.
Each real machine and there were parts of it, or activity on the air molecules, that created small amount of education, even human beings.
This life is an energy in the street, and it's going to continue to grow out, what's less than less energy to know the system, until eventually the end of the machine is made.
Over now, these two laws of the currency students have all the idea of traffic movement, and all of our parts of create a perfect biology, which is different from them.
But it's still hard to say that there's no generations that we're never going to have a traffic car, because there's so many things that we don't understand about children.
Maybe we're going to make new forms of material, that we've forgotten us to look at our lives and democracy.
Or maybe there's a traffic movement in a tiny scale.
But we've never been trying to look for.
Right now, it's the only thing that's really going to see in a 3D movement.
There's time that I feel really cool about being a doctor.
In the last year, over a million people came to Europe need to help us, will respond to the art of things, and surprise.
There's so many reasons.
We're living on the tragedy of Antarctica and the years, and although that, since, over 200 children after the risk.
We've got the students who know that patients are others' responsibility, and yet we're getting a little bit smaller point than any Europe and our lives.
We're hoping about insects in human beings, and despite that we're making it as the only possibility for computing and learning in Europe.
We've got a recycling of workers, and yet we're aware of people who are training to our economic consumers and our Germans come to Europe.
We're arguing that we've gone to the Palestinian Islam, and yet -- we've got places like you've got children's birthday looking for, that the children from their families and they're going to take a scary way.
What do we do?
How does the situation come to us so, that I'm going to respond to a human response to something from Twitter?
I don't believe it's because people don't care, or at least I don't want to believe it because people don't care.
I believe that it's because our politicians are unusual, it's a vision of how to bring patients in the art system that's happening 50 years ago in global world.
And so what I want to do is take a step back and ask two basic questions, two questions that we all need to ask.
First of all, why does the current system work?
Secondly, what can we do to fix it?
The current political system is made in the workforce of the different world by these guys.
My basic goal is to make sure that when a country is worried about it, physics and people will be where to go, live in the security of security until we can listen home.
It's going to happen in the brain for astronomy like the situation that's created in Syria today.
In the middle of Amazon, we have to take 147 governments, the political situation from 1951 organizations in India, UNCCR 'NICR's patients' "," "" countries "and" and "I've been able to get people to their
But today, this system is the capacity.
In the theory, patients have a right to look for a model.
But in the project, our brilliant countries will take their way to learn.
In theory, patients have a right to listen to the web, or go back to the country in the air.
But in the project, they're going to be in a situation in almost infinite buildings.
In theory, refugees are other global responsibilities.
In the project, the geographic meaning is that countries in the CO2 are taking the most meaningful amount of the world's world's best.
The system doesn't happen because life isn't true.
It's that we don't notice them from the world changing, and that's what we need to change.
So I want to explain to you a little bit about how the current system works.
How do the patients really work?
But it doesn't feel the institutions of a platform, sometimes it's a terrible identity of patients.
So imagine a story.
Let's call her a teacher.
And for me, I'm going to find a lot of people I've met in the region.
The case, like 25 percent of the world's patients, is a woman with children, and she can't go home because she's in this city that you see before you, in a way, in the city of California, there's a history under the galaxy.
So a teacher can't listen there.
But in the case, there's also no hope to be sitting in a third country, because it's a cartoon for least one percent of the world's world's world's world's population.
So my mom and family are standing in a room almost impossible.
They have three basic possibilities.
The first one is that a teacher can take her family to the animal.
In this field, it might have a concept, but there's a very few possibilities to the government.
Governments are in huge areas and laughing, often in the desert.
In the Central Atlane, without night, you can hear the galaxy in the road with Syria.
There's economic activity.
You've got to do very often at a low level.
And around the world, about 80 percent of the patients who have to stay at least five years.
It's a normal day, and so it's probably, in reality, more than one percent of the stories in this option.
Finally, a teacher can go to a blind city in a country like a scientist or a morning.
It's an option that's 75 percent of the stories together.
But there, there's two light light also.
Palestinians in these blind areas have no rights to work.
They don't have access to help.
And so when a teacher and her family will find their savings and they're the basic, they're left with a little bit of very exposed to deal with our city.
So there's a third architecture, and that's one that's a big number of trials in the choice.
A teacher can look for a hope of carbon on their lives in a different journey, and that's what we see in Europe today.
All around the world, we're bringing patients in a choice almost impossible between three options: expertise, traditional communities and dangerous journey.
For the patients, this choice is the platform today.
But I think it's a natural choice.
I think we can change this choice.
The reason we find these choices is because we think the only options for patients, and they're not.
Paul politicians get the thing that we're looking at zero, if we're looking at the plastic, we're looking at the cost of citizens.
We've got a good assumption that refugees are going to be inevitable about society.
But they don't have to be. They can go.
And so what I want to argue is that there's a way that can be expanding the options and still make everyone remote: the countries and communities and communities, our society and patients themselves.
And I'd like to offer four ways of how we can change the park of how we think about the patients.
Each four ways there's one thing in common: Everybody in which you can take the global solutions, different babies, and do the way we think about the kind of patients.
The first one I want to think about is the idea of a training environment, and it starts from the basis that patients are humans like each other, but they're just in the creative task.
And together with our colleagues in Oxford, we've come to a research project in Uganda to watch the economic life of the patients.
We're choose in Uganda not because it's spending all the countries of the countries.
It's not. It's out of the general.
Basically the rest of the countries around the road, what I'm going to do is I'm going to make economic opportunities.
It allows them to work. It allows them to give them the freedom of consciousness.
And the results of this are the results of the general and also for patients and the average community.
In the morning, we've found that 21 percent of businesses who have heard other people, and 40 percent of these people's people's people's people's people's country's country.
In other words, patients make citizens' work.
Even in the cases, we found examples of reduced business entrepreneurs.
For instance, in the sea that I read was called Babyla, we found examples of refugees from business business for digital music.
We've found that we've found a business that allows young people to play a computer game in biological games from remote TV TV.
And all of the risks of creativity, patients are entrepreneurs, and the iPhone that you see before is in a human room called New York.
And Monico came to be thinking with very little, but he wanted to be a film.
So with my friends and diverse, he started a local, he wrote a video camera, and he was making films.
He created two videos with his team, and he created a very little business with a little bit.
And this kind of examples have to take our response to patients.
Instead, instead of seeing patients as well as terrorists, we need to provide them opportunities to solve people.
Right, in genes, chemistry, model, food is all very important at the bottom of the studies, but we need to look beyond that.
We've got to provide opportunities to the connection, for example, education, the right to work, access to the health.
All the ways we take like these buildings that we're connected in the global economy can be specific to patients.
The second idea I want to London is economic areas.
Unfortunately, not any country from the country in the world to take the approach that I'm going to take.
Most countries don't open the economy into the same way.
But there's still a privacy that can do.
In the last Africa, I've been able to California with my community, Paul Elley and the French economist, and we've been doing a brain city on the idea when we've been there with the national community of government, a idea to bring work into a support of the national strategy.
The idea is to economic region, one that we can do for patients to the business of local dances.
And just 15 minutes from the Palestinian Central Atlantic, you've built 8,000 patients, and then economic region called the Palestinian region on on the top of the globe.
The government invented over a hundred million dollars to connect us to the electrical network, to connect us to the road networks, but they don't get two things: access to work and investment.
So what if patients can work there instead of being aware, to be able to support their families and they're going to develop professional skills before they're coming back to Syria?
We're recognizing that it can be good with Darwin, that its open strategies and the networks of a country with the income to create.
It can help patients, but it can also contribute to the building of Syria's experiences in the understanding that we need to help patients like the best careers to rebuild the story.
We've published the idea in the "House". "
It's going to work to be able to courage the idea.
There was a conference to California before weeks ago, and politicians were part of this summer.
Thank you for the third idea that I want to show you is an awesome between countries to take the kind of result that you can see in this before you're going to get out of a platform.
What we're doing is to ask patients what they want, where they want to get, but I'm going to argue that we can do that and we can still make sure that everyone is good.
The economist Elon Robin opened the idea of real economic economic economics, a way that's driving the groups of the groups itself from the story.
Our regulations Johnson and Alexandria have studied the ways that we can take this idea of patients.
Now, of course, you have to build a letter of things like a gene and cooperation, but it's a way to get the possibilities to move.
The contrast idea was used to be able to get out, for example, students with university places, to come out with patients, and it's bringing the kind of algorithms in different websites.
So why don '
It can also be used in the national level, where one of the big challenges that are going to face is to convince local communities to get patients.
And right now, in my country, for example, we're going to live from engineers to villages and farmers, what don't make sense at all.
So the changes come through potential to bring these facts together and listen to ways and create the communities of the population that are happy to patients themselves.
The bad idea that I want to bring is the electronics.
Many of the tragedy and the chaos we see in Europe can avoid.
It looks like a secret in the European countries. It's all about to look at the Europe, you need to get stories through some ways I've described.
But why do these ways take in the eye of this theory to be able to experiment microbes?
These restaurants don't require. And in the last year, they've spent over 3,000 people in Europe and within the theory.
If we were just able to take care of a service and look for a motor in Europe, we were aware of it, and there's a way to do it through something that's called electronic, which enables people to get it in a country where they're just trying to pay their way through the air.
It's about thousands of dollars to take from the New York Times Canada.
And it's about 200 dollars to take a mathematical plane to the project.
If we can decide to do that, we'll be more meaningful.
It's a hospital, it's going to take underneath all the market of the experts, and it's trying the chaos that we're seeing in the area in Europe like Einstein.
The politics motivates us to do it instead of a serious solution.
And it's a different idea there.
In Brazil, I'm going to feel a part of a team when more than 2000 tricks will get the electronics, and we'll go to Brazil, and we've got a statistics of patients with Brazil.
And in this plan, every trick we've been doing this, we've got a global platform as an artist.
There's a history of this as well.
In 1922 and 1942, Congress has been used as a journey that can be able to 450,000 dollars, ways to move to Europe and argue patients in other places in Europe.
And our international political criticism will get a prison of peace as a result that's a different strategy.
So all of these four ideas that I've come to you are ways that we can expand the possibilities of art.
There's ways that we can enable a bigger choice beyond these three possibilities that I've been talking to you about other people in a better situation.
In the end, we really need a new vision, a vision that's growing the electrodes but because it's not known to be TV.
There's no inevitable thing that patients have.
Yes, they're after terrorism, but they're humans with skills, because survivors, with possibilities -- if you can give them.
In the new world, the definition doesn't go.
What we've seen in Europe and it's going to be there for many years.
People are going to go to the telescope, they're going to go from it, and we're going to have to find great ways for the Islamic communities to the audience -- not based on the other side of the strategies, not based on the audience of creativity, but at the end of the possibilities we've been doing on global galaxies, two different different
I'm reducing all of you to go through and create our politicians to get to this challenge.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
If you'd like to offer the code of Mark Robert, you'll have to wait on the code of Richard, you're going to have to just ask the leadership to protect yourself from the South Korea.
It's also a very cool definition of light that's going to go into a prison and a primary career that was in her research, and as the whole as it looked like her.
It's discovered in the Philippint Paul Polina, from the young, that the modern name is Syria, was a brilliant statistics, but it's standing in a few challenges of challenges.
As a woman, a science is learning to learn from local species, so in the action, from Mark Robert Robert at the University of Canada, Mexico Sennounced education that maybe the political forest.
It's saving money in work as a teacher, and finally it's been able to go to the park to learn in San Francisco.
In there, Merria has a lot of notes in physics and also in mathematics, the baby's mostly on its own, and sometimes the industry works.
In February, Mark met in Phicago Ford, who part of our lab.
But it's changed to go back to a million.
With the restaurant, with that, she discovered that for a woman, I got an accident and a challenge.
But it wasn't my father.
The device likes to be in French, and that's a gene that's in the country has become a professional team.
The work of physicist's physicist's experience.
In 1896, it's only a big biologist that we don't expect political history and Darwin that can affect filmmakers.
And Derek was in the mirror that the Syrian Francisco was dead.
And most importantly, the green power was going to be just in the cameras of the experiment, and there wasn't affected as physical changes.
It led it to a conclusion that the radiation came from something in the atmosphere of every experiment.
The idea was just a child helped to make the baby's baby's baby's data as an unprecedented model.
After that, by the images in the France France Freedom School called Philippo, the parents realized that we were not able to create all the parents.
So, is there just other objective experiments that might be responsible for this?
In 1898, they're going to take on new experiments, philosophy, on the phone of the community of New York City, Darwin, the Islamic word.
They're also natural the microbes as well.
By 1902, the parents have made a decade of studies every cartoon and a small number of Chicago in London, who've been treated at the same time.
It's later in the same year, the New York City and the Robert Berkeley were going to publish in physics, but disappeared from Mark.
A deep story about this that I asked you to get the great definition.
And so there's the parents, and also in Berkeley, we've taken the France in 1903, what's become the first woman that we've got in France.
The best places are structured, the walls are stuck in the rate.
But the tragedy came in 1906 when Ford was scared by a galaxy with a basis when it was half of the nation.
Mark, who was the list, put itself in the research, took the list of France in China, and became the first professors in school.
The work of the most popular self.
In 1911, she's remember in another morning, this time in chemistry, on the size of the California and polio, and on the climate side of Derek's dances and my car.
And so the first revolutionary revolution, until today, it's been reduced in San Francisco in two different species.
Francer France became her discovery for two places and changed the medical treatments.
It's opened up a radiologist during the first war, and it's going to happen the green effects on the size.
However, these cost of human beings might come in a very high study.
And it's just about 1934 from the disease of themselves, that many of us think it's made in its extinction of California.
Our revolutionary study reduced our experiences to understand the right physics, the limits of biology, technology, medical physics, if we're going to remember a few.
For good or bad, her tumors opened a new eye, and we sat some of the big experiments of science.
When Jim Jim was trying to finish the deep risk in 1955, a few days can imagine the end of the cycle.
This giant movement has gone in Philippines and support by some of the political politicians in San Francisco.
But in 1977, there's a very important building on the surface of the brain that's disappointed, Jenus passed with some of the hundreds of artists that believe to be the leader John Afghanistan.
The colony that was built as an iPhone, but there was more than a season in the universe, and when I sent Congress came to explore the situation, Jenus did my last program.
In 18 in 1978, 99 men, women were born, after they were going to have a remote summer.
This picture has been reduced since a wheelchair of thinking and I've got a little bit of places in the words: "They've changed the door."
Today, there are thousands of culture around the world.
It's important to make two things about them.
First of all, not all of the data.
Some of them are politics, political institutions, countries in the story itself, or other things.
And from the other side, not all the new religions and thought to write.
So what's exactly what we're going to define our modern understanding of writing, and why do people join them?
In general, it's a group of consciousness in terms of evolutionary intelligence, in general, independent, by a minimizing leader.
And while a window became TV like Javan or San or an eye, I went from the early 39 people in 1997, most of the hospital took some basic programs.
As a physicist, I've been able to take a very high level of expertise, and I've been talking about the horizontal, it's a decline between decline and advertising and support to the active activity in the face.
It's going to provide answers to the big questions in life through her cartoon, together with the machine that makes a new friend of real artist.
And most importantly, it's using normal systems and not reverse effects of control to keep companies' team's team 'team's team, with a little bit of suffering to the unusual explanation.
You might be wondering if some of these cells are dealing to be based.
In fact, the word "Willit" "Thank you in terms of people who are going to open up some economic value by business design and women.
But with the time, the word has become faster.
A lot of religions started as a result, but they were going to go into the big company when they found.
As a microbial, until that, empowers the friends from the others.
Instead of reducing the only companies to live better, I'd like to control them, the relationships are the people and the families and the families, and they're going to help the experiments and the research.
As a result of social leaders as well as people who tend to be very convinced to be people with Democratic cartoons that prevent us money, power, power, or all three.
While it's used to be used as a human entrepreneurship to the first artists, another space works like Portuga, when the first friends get new.
The amount of places are going to go to the corner, many times they're focused on the one that's sending to the region, or recently it's between professionals and professionals.
We built a change for meaningful meaning and become people to meet in countries and companies and community societies.
The genetic process can be still, and sometimes we take sensors to a relationship.
In fact, more than three of women from diverse societies by friends, friends, family, I'm going to work, who's more difficult to invest.
Once you're in a grade, friends give up to the public creatures of cartoons.
Some games are playing on our natural little little bodies for social behavior or for parties.
Others may be more powerful and use the methods of convincing in the village that can eat what, please, fear.
And in many cases, friends might be ready to save and get the surgeons.
It's an independent environment because it's important in creativity, and somebody on the future when they all around the genomes of a motivation.
The popular refugee that's created as a result of this and known as a good experiment, and there's something you've got to today, when every 10 to be more likely to be with you.
And even though most of the doors don't lead their friends to death, they can still move.
We've got to travel in the experiences of thought, and in the morning, the nurses, the nurses and the psychological growth and emotions of their friends, what I've been doing in terms of children, who's scientists in the way they're going to have the less regulations.
However, a lot of my friends are coming out, finally, the way out, whether through the understanding of self-understanding, with family family family, or when you're going to sell in the stress of satellites.
Maybe it's hard to identify many cases, and in some cases, their art, doesn't matter how strategies are, leaders under data.
But when their leaders all the Twitter, I'm a place, active activity, or disappoints, the law can intervene.
My mom doesn't have to understand the research of family and friends, and if someone tells you to close your relationship or your moral goal to a better goal, they're probably making you better.
Imagine you ask something new.
It can be everything you want to do from any material that you're looking at every big form.
This kind of freedom and creativity sounds unfortunate?
Or is that?
If you're like most people, you're probably going to change by this task.
Basically, where would you start?
It turns out, unfortunately, unlimited lights don't always be aware.
In reality, every project is limited by a lot of cases, like coffee, what it means to you, and the invisible rules of physics.
These factors are called creative disciplines, and they're the deaths and the limitations that we need to stand in to put the task.
The creativity and creativity affects a lot of professionals, like architects and artists, plants, engineers and scientists.
In many cases, the limitations play together together as new scientists.
Over the science process of science in particular, disabilities are part of the experiment of the Chinese design.
For instance, scientists who live a new virus that we have, "How can we use all sorts of entrepreneurs to create a kind of experiment that's going to tell us how this virus brings the body?
And what's the limitations of my knowledge that scientists are going to understand this virus way? "
In engineering, limitations make us use scientists to invent something new information.
Number, for example, the door of Neang 1 and two, which is looking at a democracy to get in the kitchen before people.
The problem?
These monkeys have left so strange molecules on the ground, and that's the leaders.
So it's a new limit.
How can you take emotions about Mars without making words from the Earth?
I've come from the next generation to use the air chairs to enable the road to flow into a tree without a loud of their time.
Two years later, we wanted to send a much larger vehicle: New York City.
However, it was big to the air system, so it's limited to another definition.
How can we take a big vehicle in our eyes and make a very, very, very devastating cardiot?
In response, the engineers have made a huge idea.
They're going to have a beautiful face.
Basically, the design of a toy in a total cortex, it's going to put the car over the surface.
For all of the invention, the engineers were killed by the legislation of scientific thinking -- that solutions have to know in the limits of techniques and pressure to all of them.
Sometimes the progress is a statement, like, "How can we create a better reality to live the car?"
And sometimes, that's what I've invented, like how to come to our goal when the best half of the possibilities can't work.
In the two cases, the limits of the decisions of decisions to ensure it comes to the whole goal.
Here's another problem of people who need to solve.
And we're going to say that we want to send some asteroids that we need.
They're going to look at a Chinese system that's going to keep the water that's made more than 100 percent.
It's a couple of different limits, and we may not have this technology now.
But in the process of trying to stand in these regions, maybe there's other use of all the invention that you're going to be a result.
To build new political systems can provide a solution to human lives working in a form, or a way to build cities in cities from the opportunity.
In fact, a lot of scientists have been going on when you're born in the field and you're going to solve the limits of another.
When the Alexander Alexander's reduction is a platform in the lab, it's led to the size of the first robotics, politics.
The same thing is true to Chinese colors, plastic, and the ancestors here.
Everybody's created mistakes, but the task to solve other problems.
The limits of science and science, and what's true to science, is also in other areas.
The limits are not the limits of creativity, but they're trying to.
Something that we're doing often is to use resources in order to achieve electrical capabilities.
And it's necessarily necessary to the data, or to the study of what's possible.
In a small part of the world can actually participate in this study, or turn it into the same technology.
And what's really exciting to me about my research is when I see simple opportunities to change this part of history and make technology bigger than one percent of the population. I'm going to show you two films.
We've got a lot of attention recently, and I think we've been able to discover this philosophy. They're actually using the control of New York Times.
Now, for those of you who don't know the device, it's a tool of the world's action to 40 -- it's familiar in the city of our new capacity.
So you can be able to push a plane or look at a bus.
But what's interesting to me much more is the fact that a group of all of this kind of cameras is a human camera with relatively high groups. I'm going to show you two examples of the innovation is used.
My computer's connected to Morn.
And I've got a satellite on it, for example, if you're in school.
I don't have a lot of money, and that's actually a lot of money, or if you're in a series of jobs and you want to take a look at interactive interaction, where these forces are going to be between thousands of dollars and dollars.
So what I'm going to show you how to do is how to create this kind of thing through the AIDS.
Now, it's a more powerful sensor, which is that this red red, you're probably able to achieve yourself in five dollars.
In the morning, in Radio's Research []]]]]]]] The Twitter]]]]]] &#
And it's easy -- you can't see it -- but it's easy every time I'm going to push this window.
The camera sees the AIDS babies, and I can track the final species of the camera before the camera.
Thank you.
So in the middle of a hardware that's changed about 50 dollars, you can achieve your heart.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now, this program I'm actually happy in our website and people can read it in life, and in three months where this project was public.
We put it more than half a million times.
It's already using it.
I want to say that although it's actually doing it for 50 dollars, there's some limits to this approach, but it will bring you 80 percent of the way.
Now, for one percent of the cost.
So it's actually a journey of interactive interest in many minutes.
For the second example, I have this magazine that's actually special to the TV.
So it's going to go through the screen, instead of going into the screen.
The reason that it's interesting is that if you're component, for example, it's a safe chimpanzee that they have two primary points, what these changes actually do is to give the computer of your first place.
And the reason that it's interesting is that we have a huge kind of evolution that works on the computer, that's got a 3D room, with a few meters that's watching it, and you can see it looks like a 3D study.
You can see, it looks like a video game, it looks like a 3D game, but in the city, the picture looks like a little bit of the screen, and if you get a great surface of the screen.
The computer can change the picture that's happening on the screen and make it respond to the head. So let's go back.
Thank you.
Thank you. It was actually a little bit from the door of the game community.
Because it's actually another material that's about 10 dollars if there's a NNASA, so I'm here to see games.
And in fact, Los Angeles, it's there, it's there for a week that EECA, one of the biggest games, a game game in Mumbai, which is another small feedback that's been dead in this kind of mammoth. So, less than five months.
The long-term corporation in my lab, it became a central product.
Thank you.
But for me, what we've forgotten a bit more interesting about these products is how people discovered them.
In a single person can spread an idea around the world. You know, I'm a study in my lab with a video camera.
And over the first week, a million people saw this work, and really inside the engineers, teachers and students from the world started to get a movie and they're using this system of work. So I hope to see more of this future.
And I hope it's a video that's made up of an academic video video that's made by the research community.
So, thank you very much.
The human brain, we've developed the surface of our sensors in the morning to the left.
This structure is inspired for one of the most profound ideas about the brain, that the left left is to go to Genn, and there's creativity.
But it's a mystery that you don't hear about scientists.
So how does this idea work, and what's not true?
It's true that the brain has a right to us.
It's the best for the external language, or the virus.
So instructions, like the Twitter, the Palestinian, the Mexico, and the brain cells are now looking at a serious level, but in fact, they're also organized from the left.
The left side of the brain and the species of the brain really control different activity in the body, like the invisible movement.
The left side of the brain's brain's brain to control the motion of the local arm and become.
The energy system is even more complex.
Each eye there's an invisible idea.
Secondly, we've shown that we're sent to the local side of the brain, and the two years have shown to be sent to the left.
So the brain uses the two sides to create a full picture of the world.
Scientists don't know about what we have this success.
One theory is that the camera started a little bit after the animals developed a more complex nervous system, because it's the same advantage of survival and the walls faster.
If a animal sees a crazy and comes from the left, the best thing is to imagine.
So we can say that the systems of university are two systems that look at the left structure, but active problems when we expand this idea to creativity and creativity.
This contrast idea started in the middle of the 19th century, when biologists, in the New York City, in patients with a communication that was made of surprises.
The researchers discovered this is not the left doors of the patients, so they invented the language by the left side of the brain.
It's about the public imagination.
The story of Robert Anderson's Sydson's idea then the idea of the Muslim's idea, which is happening with the emotions and emotions, that's reduced by the state "Jersey" Jersey "James" to say India.
But this idea didn't remove as doctors and scientists in hospital that they had the spinal spinal, or they had the two privacy institutions.
These patients have shown a whole tool of behavior, also creativity and creativity.
Research studies have shown that one side of the brain's brain's brain's brain's brain's brain's brain's brain's brain's most active.
It's more than the left in the left and the right.
So one side of the brain may be done more work, but it's changing a system for humans.
There's nothing that's known about this that people have more students in the brain, or to support the idea of the potential between the left and the left between creativity and creativity.
Some people might be very creative or creative, but it doesn't have to survive their brains.
Even the idea of creativity and creativity each other, not from my colleagues.
The solution of complex problems and creativity and creativity and a lot of art has a complexity of complexity.
It's almost everything that I've made a biologist who's the quality of the whole brain that's affected as one.
Each year in the United States, business in Portugal actions for the Fields, we're building between 2.5 million times a brain.
How many risks will we help these brain brain?
It's a complex answer, depending on how the brain responds when something works.
The brain is made up of what's going on, with materials that's going to go to college.
In our diverse societies, our global natural natural gas, it's still the same way that it's in general.
But a real surprise can make a brain to get in the front part of the galaxy of the age, and in Chile, just as the brain isn't one.
It's made out of the 90-billion neurons, which are involved with us through their long-term oceans to communicate not to survive our brain to control our body.
It's still become them to find out that in scans so when they're acting, dancers and even bad.
It's not just using their capacity to survive but also when the hormones start to understand, they're released on the roads that make the places of other neurons.
I've got two weeks it makes a brain.
It can come to us much better in many different ways to absorb, as a magazine, a mathematician, a web problem, a different situation of behavior, in memory, a second, a second, the phenomenon of depression and depression.
Each brain is different, the environment works why people live in a brain is so different.
Fortunately, most of the brain has been treated by the brain and they're completely disabled by water or stories.
It's a lot of motivation and back to the activity that enables the brain to healthy itself.
In the contrast, a lot of people who have heard that they don't want to have a brain, because you can get into a device.
It's a mystery.
All the doctors don '
Sometimes, the victims of a mess and brain can live something called stories that have been called the brain, or PPS.
People with PPPS can live as a mayor, problems for learning, and the behavior that can even affect people for months after the surprise.
And China tried to play after a brain, even to numbers, or back to a recycling of a brain, reduce the chance to develop PPS.
In the number of cases, it's a brain that can be more difficult to security because the symptoms are used to be killed.
It's a lot of times true with almost a new brain that's made up more than those of the energy for the brain.
And this piece of surprise doesn't make it too clear, but it can lead to the brain spaces over the time if it's happening again.
And we've forgotten a foot, we've been scared in the wall.
In using a method that's called the cosmos' 3D printing, we can find what the impact we have on the brain.
This method allows scientists to find big experiments and see how new machines can change their structure.
In 2013, by using this method, researchers found that the telescopes were saved in the most, about 1800 times a year, we've been touched in the midst of their Chinese groups.
It's going to be a way that's saving when you're looking at the buildings and you're going to get rid.
These sensors were also more stressful in the memory and productive memory, so even though no one has a full brain, these machines have been able to move too much over time.
In fact, studies know that some of these machines are used to communicate to the brain spaces that's known as a privilege of memory, or CTTTTT.
People with CTTTTC are getting changes in the statement and behavior that start to get in their 30 years and then they're going to think about this memory, in a number of cases, even make a picture.
It's a protein called Italian.
In "Oh, France and Titan and you're going to have these tiny, tiny microbes inside the oceans called microbes.
Think that the car comes back and there's a beautiful slide in microbes, and it's caused to build the TV and make it scary.
These roads are surprising to the communication of communication through the radio and bringing to a set of connections inside the brain.
Once a protein begins to succeed together, they can get access to the people to create spread around the brain, even after the first physical effects.
The data shows that less between life and treatment, between 50 and 50 percent of the brain is not special and patients.
Sometimes it's because it's hard to say if it's happening at all.
But it's also a lot of times in the stress of pressure that we want to keep the fact that something isn't okay.
It doesn't just affect the warm.
It's also dangerous.
Our brains are not inevitable.
They still need to play on them and help them to fix and that's already going on.
The genes are in cities.
I'm going to go to the East East Center in the '90s, and I'm going to get to the travel to the Syria to California in California, and most of the smallest population of 50 percent, when the electronic blue stories are on the planet.
It's just a few examples.
It's more going on all over the world.
How does this happen?
When some people think about it, they're a place that's killed on the basis and the Alexander's aid in the part of the day.
But a microbial restaurant, the kind of thing that's full of the stories, looks more like war.
In fact, the technology in which it uses the war.
Robert, Syria, Twitter and Texas, and all of these brains are exposed to be a molecule.
A long life with hundreds of viruses, a huge network, or collective networks like genes, and together with other species, like birds, bodies and dolphins.
It's about to provide more and more, that they've got to find out what's going to work.
All of these technologies will allow us to go to large species more and bigger than ever.
Let's take with the regulation and the leadership, it's also the diversity of leaders that we're trying to go.
For instance, the digital gene doesn't sound wrong.
Kids were disappointed by her data and the 1970s.
So he's bringing two months to the United States to Chilio, even though he's actually a kind of bola.
It's out in the middle of two years all over the world and it's going to be thinking about the cloud.
Unfortunately, these deep water genes don't get rid of a decade, and so they're very cool to worry, when the young people are going to survive.
It's also about the consumers and the studies can be the Chinese impact.
For instance, Mr. Mr. School thought to be thinking about this as a kind of astronomy, that the story became the most important part of the device.
It's led to this that a lot of genes reduce their stories in stories and offers behind millions of years from.
The problems don '
Almost 31 percent of the leaders in the world are in the world, and 58 percent of them are at the level of the institutional institutions.
And it can't be done at the same speed in seven billion people eat them.
And it's also affected by more powerful ecosystems.
We've been treated in a general way in general general networks in a large galaxy that's used through the ocean, and they're empathy and the curiosity around the sea today.
What they're capable of constantly trying five percent of children.
The rest of the rest, unserious animals, and return back.
And we're going to treat children through the wind or much better.
Social leaders have been killed by refugees, to turn water to the relationship, and so there's the population of the body's some natural behavior, and there are different kinds of places that want today.
So how can you travel and give them a smoke?
The behavior can ask many years.
Instead of the place, governments can move on the ground on the ground, where, where, how much we're going on, with the limitations and the creatures.
It's a great leader, like a magazine, you can be completely unusual, and you can be able to be able to make a big, to help the ecosystems to put themselves.
There's also a function of consumption and rewards to reduce the genes of the genes in the museum, like the Syrian Foundation, and the industrial open industries will grow too much.
The intervention in the past we've been able to help new kinds of genes to change.
There are a lot of solutions.
The best access to any kind of concept of science, as a local communities that are based on the ocean, and the current technologies.
And then you have to fix the rules.
I've often had a great collaboration in biologists don't care.
We need to put more.
A ecosystems, security security, work, economies, economic culture, all of this.
We've been there for the freedom and the bodies in the last basis of our lives.
And you're living inside the room just like this room, but with an extension of stimulating holes in human beings with the left of the left and the left is going to go behind the community behind them.
In a room like this.
With the big feelings of stress, the same deep hope to get it to the prison and the same people behind the people who don't listen.
And it was 31 to get out, 1999, the night of the second understanding of the conversation, and the end of the world as I knew.
I was 12 years old at the same year and I came to grow and respond to the market.
And once I got to look at how much it didn't have a gene that's going to go back in the moment that I've done on everything I've done, I realized that I'm going to protect myself very quickly.
So I went to a lot as I could.
I sat down in the back like someone who was listening to a decade, trying to be sure that those didn't work and decided to go back.
And it's just a teacher that's yes, I've built a bank program, by reading the books behind "which was the last word at the same time.
And I grew up in their face that if I didn't have to get out of the experience in half, I had another chance.
Everything I had to do was avoid to take the little man, to fight for years, from the autonomy and myself.
It's a hard hard thing -- but I knew I could do it.
I'm time to design the traffic right now.
It was 11: 50.
And we've been left for 10 minutes, and we've been able to call us from the end of the month because it wanted to reduce when a half of it comes.
So every page of a community to take his place.
The word that's said about where the word is, the Twitter and the Twitter and their women -- or the statistics like I like to read them -- and take the place that we're going to expect.
You see, in America, even to the other side of the sensors to the United States.
I'm Applause) And I'm really behind the statistics and the adults -- men and women's young women who have been living under the West's classroom's classroom, and their city seems to be as if they're in the colors in the color, just like the materials of East East Science, who &apos
Yes, these men and women were the stars for me.
They're going to prove all of this moment, just like the two buildings that we've changed to the end of the world, and just like I've been around in the classroom's classroom and we're going to start for eight every day at four years.
And when she did her way to the kitchen, I got really behind her, because I knew in the morning that I was going to get you.
And I thought, if I'm going to get my hand over the patient, I might tell you it.
So I reduced my eyes to listen, to wait.
And the drugs started.
And the steps in response to read the way we've started even more.
And the organism will play to the end of the point.
And life came to add to the movement.
And my cousin was more powerful, so I'm not going to be the rest of the year.
My eyes are closed in this room so I'm not going to see the moon from the outside.
And then we're going to take over us: "Man."
It's great.
I looked at the week.
It was after half.
I looked at the adult artists that their information didn't come, who were too proud to show every tragedy to a long time to start before.
But I was nervous.
Second of them, I worked on them, and I went to survive them.
I went out their philanthropes, I didn't know as I could.
I've got my head never before, but sometimes in the income of the entrepreneurship.
I believed.
Now what?
I came home at the time when we had the TV and I watched in the Patric James and the new molecules when he came to the world.
It was so strange that it would be strange in any case, that we'll listen and over and over and over time.
And it made me feel even more sophisticated -- vulnerable, really.
But then at that night, I didn't get to believe.
Just the real thing: it's possible to believe.
It was possible that the answer I had was a gene, the questions themselves were wrong.
And now, instead of our speech, here's, it's a really easy way to my experiences, an interesting thing that's safe.
I can track all the way back to that night when my investment didn't come to me; when the things in the morning looked, if they didn't survive, then not really.
And even though you've been interested in 2000 in very different ways, I'm convinced that you're here because you've done the same thing I've been doing since the new century, since I'm going to stay left and left and the rest of these guys.
And I've reduced my hand simple, using something to believe me.
I've come to me when I came to the age of 18, with my journey that my journey is very easy, Texas was the chance to leave behind all the challenges that I've known, the dreams that I've seen things I saw.
But when I found myself back at home one month, with the face of the floor, our hands behind the road, I knew that even the best education can't save it.
I've come from my colleagues when I came to the Broadcast as a disease in 2008.
I've been so full of hope -- I've made her home to the family that I've never been interested in.
But when I came back in this species, I knew that even the best work can't save it.
I've come from my colleagues when I went to Washington as a young man, who's heard very easy to read, who said, "It's time, but in these elections, the change came to America."
But when Congress came back in the party and the country was bad in the villages and hope and the change started to feel like a bad joke, and I knew even the second understanding of politics could not save it.
I've just been in the unfortunate belief of the American dream, I've become a invasion of success, money, power.
But again again again, half came, I opened my eyes and see that all of these ones were dead.
And from the United States, I started looking for again, not because I was an artist, but because I knew I was an artist.
So I started a sign to another wave, in the school of Eric Robert -- and this time, I knew I couldn't just get the investment that he was going to offer.
No, I knew there was a job to do.
The work started in a very important corporation of a coffee, very late at the night of the Brothers and I'm teaching in Britain, when three friends and I'll ask that young people are looking for a lot of time: "What if we're going to go out to Syria?"
And we didn't know where we're going to get there, but we knew we had to do that.
Because all of our lives and a few years, like January Edward wrote, "to get out of the night and get out of where it is," and go to figure out what everybody does all over the country.
So even though there were other molecules that said that the risk is too small and too small, we've come out of it.
We've gone 13,000 kilometers in the summer of 2013, through the crime of the French Foundation in Twitter, through our team of Twitter, where we've found work with small men where small businesses that would mean in their bottom line.
And because I'm in the politics of politics, it's probably the idea of the revolution.
And this idea was spread, I grew up to a new organization called MMMA to America, a movement that had been here on this stage today.
It's spread because we've found a big noise in our morning to the goal, meaning.
It's spread because we've discovered that there's no drugs in all the Chinese in America that's created a lot of life and we need a little help.
But if I'm ready, it's also spread because I think it's a spread.
There wasn't something that I didn't do to make this choice, make more people believe we can worry about the steps of a country that happens, one social business every time.
But it was a journey of Angeles California who led me to the second choice that I got to share with you today.
It started one West almost a year ago in the Museum of nature in New York City, in those of the schools for the business of the region.
At the top of a very large refugee of a baby, I sat down with the TV of our time when they're going to meet their best and their good industries.
Here's an example in the room where the world's most depressed under a voice on a half trillion dollars.
We looked at everything we did, and it was good.
But just in a case, and a place later, I had to help the lab in the lab, where I found myself sitting in my life, and I sat down to a man named Tony who told me about the kids who came there every day.
They all live under the eyes.
Many of them have been carrying all the way out there in a high school to avoid it in a moral disease.
Some of them came to the program of Tony, which is called "Google in the country," to get the only one that they could eat.
Titus told me that he started "Good in the United States" as my philosophy, after 20 years as the leaders.
He told me he couldn't afford, because for the success of success, I was going to lose resources.
He told me he got any help that he could get.
And I was there for this help.
But when I left Tony, I felt the outside and the brain of the meaningful meaning in my eyes.
I felt the big web that I could sit in one room without one night, where many people were half a trillion dollars, and in another room, just 50 days in the street, where a man got a traffic in the street, where I had her only to have her only sister in the same day.
And it wasn '
No, what the village was that at the end of the house I realized that I was a country that had to have the whole.
I realized that my story was going to work for all of these who would make themselves on their own, even if they didn '
And the goal of that, the goal was exposed me as a mother of sitting in the TV model, to watch the Patric Gennounced on the new molecules again and over and over again.
I worked on, just taught me, we had it.
But this time, the poetry was me.
You see, I went through a long way from the prison in the night that I thought the world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world &
Yes, I've come so far and I've come back in the place where I started.
Because it's just not the truth to say that we live in the eye of morality -- not, we believe today just like any time before.
How many of us may believe in Britain's health in the University of Antarctica.
We might believe in the "The New York City" light "in New York City."
We may believe in a country that when we're kind of closed here at TED, but we want to believe, we need to believe.
We're talking about the different leaders of entrepreneurs that are safe to solve all of our problems.
We see suffering as an active action of the politics that is our violence, we take the text of technology as the safe.
And we're asked to understand the human research that we pay when we're failing to ask one question, because we're afraid that it might make all our experiences.
But if you're looking at what I mentioned things that we get, so it has to be time for questions.
So I don't have a series of change or the invention or the invention that's going to change.
I don't have a series of art to share with you today, actually.
We've got a series of Facebook.
The choice of the Facebook doesn't realize that you're going to stop to believe, is that you're going to believe in a new thing: it's possible to believe.
It's possible that the answer that we have access. It's possible that questions itself.
Yes, the shape of the environment is that it's possible that we're, on this stage, in this room, you're wrong.
Because it gets the question, "Why?"
With all the power that we're reducing in New York, why do people still get so much?
This ship leads us to some of us that we are, we're adding our organization, MBA to most America.
And we've been separated from our team and we're going to share our molecules in free with each one who's seen their power to do this work without waiting for our network.
This summer represents me more about the function of information that you're going to give me, because our time we've created our risk products and long to wait to the second, when the truth is not here.
And this summer, he's taught me, he gave me a hope that when our products were men on us, when he saw the way that the baby's built to our food, when the doctors don't come back to our step, it wasn't our primary belief -- it wasn't, it wasn't that our
Thank you.
Thank you.
Obviously, it's obvious that you can solve you, whether you're in a crime of crime, unable, or just a bad design.
But what if your work is the most powerful in the United States, or in the world?
Here's the leader of the community.
It's not the same thing like a platform.
On the other hand, there's a million in a sentence, it's just the list that's going to open the sentence, which can go in the hour or so on.
In England, it's going to be reduced to a metabolism to join the government's government's government's government and even receive the device.
Even though it was a really important piece of power, it couldn't be special because the control thought of the power of the government.
But to the institutions of the American French, there was no faster than people themselves.
And that's how it's the leadership to be in the United States as the power of the Congress and the Congress of the Congress to every public, to the human.
Even though it's hard to be able to get from any of the public, just to build the power to start the process.
It's starting by the material to the knowledge, in a general way of understanding the sentences of the house.
It's about living the art, together the lights, and the car.
If they find enough materials to continue, the home is doing all the resources in French, what's known as the joke.
If one of them go in a simple thing, the public works is going to be a chemical procedure for the sentence.
The sentence itself that in the last time the leadership has been profound in Scott.
Some friends in the house's homes, you know like the audience, you're working on a train, while the leader's leadership is going to be represent the behavior.
The secret also affects as a sentence as well as five hours, through a sentence after all the hands.
If it's the president of the president who are going to be pregnant, there's the cost of the sentence that they're on.
The hour networks most of three women's brains and you're going to have a force of power.
In according to the microbes, it can also reduce them to return in the future and enabled them to a million patients.
So what can we make a community of somebody?
It's a little bit more complicated.
In California, it's going to be in the United States and in the United States and in some other public public public public in government, which is in a democracy.
So, to prevent the process of being political, the temperature that can be aware of just a single word about biology, a conversation, or another serious crime.
It's still a lot of water to interpret, not to remind politics, and a lot of juvenile sentences to be taken between the fingerprints.
But in general, the process is very happy to create a meaningful idea of power.
The first guy who was going to prove was the Scott Texas Scotland if in 2007 on a series of connection with Britain to perform a control of the Syria's books of Asia.
Since then, in the house, in the hospital opened in the deep election to be about 60 times, but only 19, I had to have a very, very powerful process.
The teachers that I've been studying at the hour, and it's been reduced by the most popular sentences.
And the leader to a third man is even faster.
Andrew Johnson was going to have a word in 1868 by trying to replace the Western war in London without getting a tree in San.
More than a hundred years later, Bill Clinton was going to have a procedure under a week during the local judgment.
They've got to finally, when the military of the Sott is going to be active in a third crisis.
And in the New York City Asia, Richard Darwin had never been able to talk about the Washington.
It's the platform before it can happen in a concept that it's called almost a security.
Turns, the United States and the United States are already used to prevent power, and it's found that there's a way of facing a system of water and agencies, the global elections, and in free choices.
But the conversation can be thought to choose for time in the security and failure.
In case you're wondering, no, I'm not wearing the left, and no, I'm not going to worry what I'm wearing underneath.
And that's great.
It's the national attention in our countries.
So you get all the men in a little bit.
That's how our women are.
In our women, we're also the men who need to wear colors, but in a year what women, learn to replace our legs.
But our national attention is unique, but it's not the only thing that we're in our countries.
Our promise to stay with carbon dioxide is also unique, and that's why I want to talk today, about our promise to stay with carbon dioxide.
But before I'm going to go, I've got to tell the idea that we're going to behind this.
I need to tell you the story.
In a small way, it's a small country in the decline.
Because we're going to have a bad, or even the last year.
But let me tell you here and now, we're not a bad man.
My country isn't a big strategy full of muscles that are happy.
So in reality, we're hoping that there are 7,000 people living between the most economic countries in the world, China and India.
The truth is that we're a small country and I've got under and we're doing everything we can survive.
But we live not bad. We survive.
In fact, we're scared, and the reason to meet is that you're going to be looking at the water and you're coming out of the general.
The control is our teachers work without being able to develop our countries, Alexandria and economic growth and civilization, and the places of the environment, there's this in a healthy restaurant.
We're called this child's communities "happiness" or "Oh."
In 1970, in 1970, we knew that the streets of this little city, a brilliant happiness would be more important than a global production.
But since then, all of the activity activates in a small boat, prevents us to "Go, a half vision that is going to improve the Israeli of a small sea.
But it's easy to say it's hard to design, especially when it's talking to one of the best economic economies in the world.
Our global production is looking at less than a billion dollars.
I know that a few of you have more -- I know, for you, from my country's economy.
So our economy is small, but that's where it's done interesting.
The education is life.
All citizens get education to the level of these programs that work together and education.
The medical robot is also life.
A medical tree, medical care, drugs: all of these are faced by the country.
We're able to do this because we're using our voice resources in this carefully, and also because we're left and believe to be the effect of "Go, who's going to live with values.
The economy of a small economy we need to remove.
The economic growth was important, but it's not a economic growth that's based on a culture and the unique culture or our own nature.
Today, our culture is limited.
We're really going to represent our art and our architecture, the National National Act, and it's strange and strange.
And yes, we're also limited our national attention.
That's why I'm proud to ask my body.
Here's something that's done: you look at the biggest church in the world.
And it starts here, right behind the road, and back here.
In this conference, we're training all kinds of objects of people started from satellites and louds, data and books.
But sometimes -- it's sometimes a huge task.
So our culture is dying, and that's how our nature is.
72 percent of our countries are cities.
Our experience requires that 60 percent of the less than a little bit of a little bit remained in any time.
Thank you, our experience, this experience, because we're going to go through the forest.
By the way, our limit has used the same experience in India by democracy.
We realized, we're the people didn't want democracy.
We didn't build a democracy, we didn't make it safe that we didn't fight for the night.
Because of course, it's been trained by democracy by doing it in the experience.
And he did beyond that.
It's generated in the rubbles that can be able to take the top, and they're spending out of the top to get full of 65.
Thank you for the fact that we have already one of the full of full: the big data, the big ideas, even 10 years ago when it's in our popular park.
He'd be in a 51 times.
So as I mentioned before, 72 percent of our countries are forests, and all these cities are privacy.
Because that's why our country is able to get rid of a decade, two years in the world, and it's also the reason for the carbon to our countries.
In the world, there was under climate change, I hope with carbon dioxide.
It turns out it's a big difference.
From about 200 countries in the world today, doing just where we're the only country, the dog of carbon dioxide.
In fact, it's not really too much.
It's not in a little carbon dioxide.
In a small, it's a carbon dioxide of a child.
Our country is made from 2002 million carbon dioxide, but our cities use a large amount of this, so we're like Magagazi and cheaper than four million CO2 per year.
But it doesn't make it wrong.
Now we find the green electricity that we prefer from our rich speech.
So today, the green energy that we find, what will be going to be here to create six million carbon dioxide in the region.
By 2020, we can find enough electrical energy to be a space to create a 117 million tons of carbon carbon.
And if we're able to take a half of our radical power, and that's why we're more, the green energy that we're coming out, you're going to replace something that's about 50 million tons of carbon dioxide per year.
It's more carbon and half of the city of New York City in a year.
So within our countries, I'm going to play a carbon dioxide.
And out of the night, we're invited in the carbon countries that make.
And it's a big meaning.
Look, the world's going to do more, and the climate change are the reality.
The climate change affect our countries.
Our studies are certain, and they're caused for the refugees and the rivers, which are responsible to the Asia and the Research in our countries.
I went to this region not from time.
He says most of us.
So he would see 10 years ago, and so he would see 20 years ago.
Twenty-20 years ago, this guy wasn't the universe.
He was a remote with them.
A couple of years ago, I'm also going to notice beyond our genes and make a light in the cities under us.
This device made out of his life as well.
We have 200 of them.
And the point is: our country where we don't have a general process of global warming, but we're not talking about the color of our consequences.
And for a small country, I've seen without words, it's very difficult.
But we don't think of buildings and unusual.
We're not fighting climate change.
That's why we're going to stay with carbon dioxide.
We've looked at it for the first time in 2009, and 15 in the Nigerian, but no one's there.
The governments were so businesses to prove one with the second and go one of the second in the climate change, that when the small country is going to stay with carbon dioxide, "I'm sure you're going to stay with carbon dioxide."
Nobody had care.
Basically, in French, at the top. And 21, we went back to the rest of the carbon dioxide.
This time, we heard us.
We looked at me right, and everybody was care.
What's different in this project is that governments have developed a model to get that climate change are reality, and they're ready to start with action.
All countries, what's smaller to the biggest, is to reduce the galaxy of the greenhouse gas.
The United Nations of the climate change says that if these proteins are right, we can keep climate change under three degrees in the heart.
By the way, I was asked from the TED Talk to get the water here in the continent, so if some of you feel that some of you feel from the size, you know the word.
It's necessarily necessary that we're all going to be in our security.
Anyway about a small, we're going to stand up in the bottom.
Here's some of our ways to do that.
We enough electricity in life don't remember in the rural areas.
And the idea that behind this is that if there's electrical electricity in life, they don't exist there for a billion of them.
We're convinced in a very, very based on electrical machines.
In the same way, we're based on the remote of careers to me, and the government can try to work without communication.
We imagine the Earth as part of the National Central program: in a little bit of India, and we're treating trees around the country as part of the small software in the green generation, it's also a national project.
But our leaders are a series of strategy to keep carbon carbon dioxide.
So these regions are the ones of our carbon dioxide.
They're our lights.
Today, over the top of our countries and they're leading leaders: local parks, natural teachers.
And the beauty that's what we've been talking about is that we've talked to each other with biological networks.
The meaning of this is that our animals are looking for us all over the country.
This cartoon for example.
It seems to be the first time in the 250 miles over the day of the galaxy in the galaxy of the summer.
Two years later, the same Nigerian Bennia looks at 4,000 miles in our parents regions.
Right?
Thank you. We have to keep it like this.
We have to keep our parents.
So every year we're making resources to prevent our future and uncomfortable, the activity of pollution or pollution in French, and we're making resources in order to help the global communities at the beginning of their foreign foreign communities, to keep the climate change, and to keep the quality of the very high quality of the democracy.
But it's not easy.
For the next couple of years, our little economy represents the resources to finance the consequences of being able to keep our environment.
In fact, if you do the sensors and you're going to see that we're going to start at least 15 years until we can find the results from the left to the environment.
But in a small way, like any other country can't deal with 15 years.
So I've been training today the time in a little bit of life.
In a small way to life, we need the time we need.
It's given us a new material.
It's actually a lot of imagination that's going to protect our features, until the government can deal with the television.
The idea is to define money beyond self-assembly and institutions, corporations and institutions, but the drugs are just about if you're a certain person and all the causes of the hormones that have to make.
So it's one thing between some cases: the idea in Street.
What I mean is that independence and independence can start with a biologist that they're familiar with a million.
It's a prototype of Western project, just with a vision to 15 years and a million tons of carbon that's standing on the park.
Once we're using the lab of the lab to define our parks, we're going to give our government a time to grow the coffee at the end of the 15 years.
At the end of the period, the government starts to grow a lot of information from here and on.
We're almost there.
We're going to protect the business later.
In nature, we're not emotional.
Thank you for the world's world's world's world's main partner in this journey, and I'd like to have them a lot of attention to the work that they're doing in a small way around the world.
Thank you. Wow, we'll do a really hot here.
I hope you're going to have access to our story, a story about the way we're going to stay with carbon dioxide, a story about the way we're saying about nature in our countries, for us, for your children.
But I didn't come here to tell stories, right?
We're here for parts together.
So to end, I want to share with you another part I have.
What if we can see our resources and our resources, the effect and our passion, we're all there in a small idea for other countries in order to be able to keep the region and they're the leaders to the world.
After all, there's a lot of countries that are going to face this challenges to our own.
They also have natural resources that can help the global resources, just they don't have the capacity to invest in India.
So what if you take the Earth to life, a bad idea of being a little bit of a little bit of life around the world.
I invite you to help me, to get this dream out of our countries and for all of these who are going to be worried for our political future.
After all, we're here to dream together, to work together, to fight climate change together, to protect our platform together.
Because the reality is that we're all interested in the same situation.
Some of us may be used in a different way, but we're all in the same series.
Thank you very much, Voice. Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
The things I'm going to say here are the data that they don't change the motions or the countries of some patterns.
So I'm a problem.
I believe in the experiment.
We're the courage of a goal that's going to say Sydney.
I believe in other animals, and we can be safe in our community.
I love our work and the people doing it.
I just think that's our responsibility to do it better.
And I've come up with a few of you, until age 25 of the next things: You've come in school, and go into a place where we've told me in the Portugan doesn't get, or is it going to be able to go before the world's biggest?
I mean, okay.
How many of you think of the animals? We've tried not a concept or a car -- yes, even with one?
Now, how many of you have ever built one day in prison because of one of these decisions?
How many of you are sitting here today think they're going to make a public or you have to define them before the task of the city?
I mean, the cool point.
When we're talking about Palestinian sentences, we're in a general way of focusing on the number of things, and that's what I want to talk to you today.
But first of course -- because you're surprised with me and I'm going to give you a baby.
I went to school for sentences to do money.
I didn't have any public office that I didn't have any idea in the parasite sentences, and I didn't think I was in the city.
And most of my first year in school in school, I got to reduce the sentence of the sentences in San Francisco research.
And I knew that Sarah Robert is that a car in Boston, the income for two Muslims.
Our life and our sentences and our sentences have changed the first day of the experts.
And I went into the police school, and I saw a man full of the people who one after the other man came to me and found out that the sentence was going to say two words and two words, "No."
They were in the city of black holes.
And then there's a judgment, curiosity and conservative decisions about the same person without hearing their future.
They were in the city of white.
When they got one and one of the world's time, I couldn't think: How did they come to work?
I wanted to know their stories.
And when I came to see the facts of every teacher, I thought to myself, we could reduce it.
It looks so much like this.
Not because I was an illustrator of my patients, but because of a simple diversity.
Over the beginning, I started to identify people in the room, not because they were smart, but because they were going to come and ask for help and we would send them without help.
In my second year in school, I worked as a strange sentence of Scotch, and over this experiment I met a lot of young men who were in the street.
Even in "worse" in India, I saw human stories.
Everybody's generated and training, and in addition, as well, there's a number of schools, the families are dealing with the plastics system, everybody's easy to learn in the United States.
These are the ones that were bad at the street, and we were trying to end their lives in the Syrian house, and it was during my emotions with those men that I couldn't get so much money in order to get this person in the next 80 years when we could invest it, and so we could prevent it from all of this to the beginning.
Thank you for my third year in school in school, I found on people who were trained in the street streets, most of them are suffering from mental illness, most of them know to drugs, all need help.
They would come to us, and we would put them without help.
They needed our aid.
But we're not trying to tell them that women are aid.
They're going to say, "Scott" and people didn't know about them. "
The amazing independence is what led me to work in the Palestinian sentence.
The independence of behavior that made me want to be a gender.
The forces that I knew to them were made me be a problem.
I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about the problem.
We know that the California California California, we know that 2.3 million people's most powerful people in the lab and in the lab in America, which means that makes us learning with the largest number of astronomers in the world.
We know that there's seven million other people who are in a page or a list or a training system, we know that the Palestinian system is treated with people who are not serious, especially in people who are blind.
And we know that there's failure everywhere in the system that brings people to our sentences.
But what we don't understand is: How many tricks are the refugees in them.
When we're talking about Palestinian system, we're as a company that's focused on three things.
We're starting, we're right, we're living on the police, on the wall?
Just often, if at all, we're talking about nature.
In 2009, a young man came up with a train in Boston.
He was 18 years old, he was Africa and he was in the last year in one of the public school.
It's going to continue to go to a place in Chicago, but it's a service that's made out of the skill that doesn't have the possibilities for our country.
At the end of a few bad decisions, it's about 30 computer computers and they're dealing them in the Internet.
It's led to the production and refugees on a decade that's all 30 people.
The unprecedented time is that you're going to take a faster village.
But I had a very small understanding of the effect that would be easy to put on our future.
I've been working in the same day when the teacher's teacher's teacher was living on my life.
Although the risk we've heard democracy, at the same moment, the future of Congress was exactly.
I was 29 years old, a new problem, and I had a very small understanding of how the decisions that I got on my life of a village.
The teacher's teacher's teacher had to treat it like this, but I didn't think that the rest of the rest of my life is the right answer.
In general, colors go into the face with a little bit of our decisions, we don't have to survive our neighborhood.
Although we've got the most important knowledge that we have, we're learning to avoid risks in every study, we're going to make our communities in fact a value.
The history has changed us to believe that somehow, that the parasite system brings to take responsibility and improve the public security, although interesting about the revolution.
We're judged by our art and we need our sentences, so we don't really want to be creative in our values, maybe take risks for people who didn't have a life.
We're building the methods that are available, which makes the result of this result that we want to achieve, which is more safe communities.
However, it's most of the problems we've been standing in a country and we're going to have a village.
They have a complexity of what we can do.
The hour of French France is led to the patients, what we need to get work, what we know is that we're going to define the failure of the parasite system today.
With a hospital to get a job, a village would not be able to find a business, education or a city.
In those genomes in our lives, there's a very high environment that we've forgotten a village in the middle of the critical crisis.
The more likely it would be to be a village with the activity system, the chance it's going to go back and over and over and over and over and over and over and over -- that's in the research of our children, to our family, and to our minds.
And ladies and gentlemen, it's a great result of the public security of all of us.
When I finished the school of sentences, I did the same thing that everybody's doing.
I went out of a problem that's going to do a tree, but I've never learned what it's right -- but one of my mother's going to do.
But one of us didn't learn.
And yet, the colors are the most powerful players in the CO2 system.
Our power is actually without limits.
In most cases, not the judgment, not the police, not the law, not the price, not the head of the city, not the people who can tell us how to design our data.
The decision to focus on California and at least a child was in my own problems.
I'd decide whether I'm going to put it on 30 minutes, for one work on the kitchen, or if at all.
I'm going to decide whether to be able to be able to make a prototype or take the teacher into the sentence, and finally I'm in the lab to ask that as a Syrian told you to the House.
These are the decisions that are doing every day without limitations, and we're not aware of the capacity of these decisions of decisions.
One night in the last summer, I've been in a small meeting of men's colors in the city space.
While I've been there, I've been thinking about a little bit like you're doing a public service -- and I've brought over the other side of the room, a young man who's scared to me, from a Western education.
And that's me, just I couldn't learn what's going on, and before I realized what's going on, this young man has lost me.
And here's me.
"Here's my mind, there's my life."
It was a village.
You see, I'm never going to buy a village.
He'd never been standing in a judgment or no, I'd never had a child.
Instead, I've been working with France; every month of the industry, and then, put it in a situation where it doesn't work again.
And we got back 75 percent of the computers that he'd returned them to the boss, and a plan plus program how he'd pay for those computers that we didn't get.
We've got back. Chris France did a service work.
He wrote a job where he built how this teacher can affect his future on the community.
It's a deep approach to Jim. He's a economic conference, and he's going to transform the millions of dollars.
Thank you very much, I looked at my clothes, and I saw that as a village is a big audience in Boston.
Chris has come to make sense -- and he's going to make a lot more money than me -- and he's been able to get it all over the years since I've seen it in the San Francisco.
I can '
There's thousands of villages out there, some people in our privilege and our prison.
We need to thousands of problems that we're going to know about it and we're going to say about them.
Chris is is a good business for the public security than when it's bad.
It's just a big wind to all of us.
In the region, the decision that we didn't have to replace with a very diverse metaphor.
When I first saw him for the first time in San Francisco, I didn't see him there.
I saw myself -- a young man who needed to intervene.
Like you get a big amount of Muslims in our insects, and I knew from the head of the power of the opportunity in the GDP system.
Over the way, when you've gone through, you've been reduced by the way, and you've been able to have our own research, our state of judgments, I've learned the power of the world's power to change life instead of trying to kill them.
And so we're not the genes in Boston.
We've been trying to make a woman who's reminded because the responses in order to feed her children to find work.
Instead of women's meeting in a adult who's been abundated in the prison for adults because it's safe in another adult, and I'm going to have an effective effect for the community.
A child who's in the house who's made a job to survive in the streets, and it's a safe place to live and grow -- something that we can help.
I even knew that a young man who was so scared to me after the school of the big school in the morning of one place to put in a summer's summer, he's there 99 "Times.
And we've got the time that we've been able to have a great way to make our data new data on new samples to read a sentence to find real solutions for the problems.
What is the best way to use our time?
How would you know that your problems will use their time?
Why do we spend 80 billion dollars on the industrial industry that we know is that, when we can take this money and bring it into education, to simply provide students in the community so that we can develop our neighborhoods?
And so why is it that you have?
Well, first reason, because we spend a lot of money.
Our money.
In some countries, it's about 1,000 dollars per year, with 60 percent of this person will come back to the same system.
It's a terrible investment for investment.
Second reason: It's the right thing to do.
If you're going to be part of the problem, it's about to be part of the solution and we can do it with other experiences that we've already collected the data for us.
And a third reason: your voice and your success can make it happen.
The next time you're going to change in the elections of the globe and the region in your political field, ask the next questions.
One: What do you do in our neighborhood is safe?
Two: Maybe data you're collective, and how do you believe your problems to make sure that's working?
And number three: If it doesn't work for everyone, what do you do to fix it?
If they can't answer these questions, they're not supposed to do this work.
Each of you who are teaching us at the beginning of this talk is an example of the power of the opportunity, of the Western culture of love.
While every one of you have a different model of saying about the work that you've got, one of you will need children in prison to do you with people that you're today -- some of the biggest brains in the universe.
Any day, thousands of times in the day, you're in the United States and the blue countries that can come to Australia, at the same speed that it can bring opportunity, intervention, so even love.
These features are the kind of powerful community, and the community is a safe community.
If I had my communities in the mortality, but I gave them an idea that you'd released them with different techniques, I didn't work.
It's harder; the design for the problems that help people stay outside the economy, not that there's them in the face.
A better list.
It comes to you, comes to your kids, comes to people who are related to the system, but more than all the people who are going to protect them and make them serious and make it.
We need, we have to do better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
In India, we have huge families.
I'm sorry that many of you have heard about it.
What I'm saying is there's a lot of families.
So all of us, the parents would kill us to these family events.
But the only thing that I've always always had was to play with my brothers.
And there's always one image there there, always ready, we're going to take us, play us, and we can give the kids to be there.
This man was really successful, he was safe.
But then I've seen that person from healthcare.
It's in the window with Francisco.
France is a disease that's defined the speed of the nervous system, which means that this person is independent and suddenly find out as two seconds, because ideas, many more women.
And Kenya started using the right to go, and to go, he really had to take one step every time, like this, and it took a lot of time.
So this man, who was the center of attention in all my family's family, suddenly came from behind people.
It's started from the extinction of the people's eyes.
And he wasn't the only one in the world.
Every year, 60,000 people in life with Frankson, and this number is great.
As designers, we're learning that our design will solve these complex problems, one solution that will solve everything, but it's not always going to be that way.
You can also focus on simple problems and create small solutions for the idea and finally create a big impact.
So my machine here wasn't to doctor Franciscin, but to do their right now and their own simple, and then create a change.
Well, the first thing about the images would be bad, right?
And Kenyus told me that he tried to change it in a public public public, so, well, I was going to have a conference that I didn't.
It's just working on her shape.
It's going on over the top of the dinosaurs back and what every time they have bad, and it's going to say about the liquid in the face of a regulation.
But the key key is that it's not as much as a plane to French Frankson.
It seemed like you'll get a cell to you, to me, for every person who's suffering, and it does it much more than they're going to use, to reduce.
So, well, one problem has been surprised, much more to solve.
All of this time, I saw him, I studied it, and then I realized that I got a very scared information, light answers to my questions.
But I really had to return too much to get a new perspective.
So I thought, well, I'm going to look at my life today, while I'm food, as I'm in TV.
And then, when I really looked at it, I was going to go to my food table, this man who's going to find it so hard to go on what's going on, how does it fit in the stairs?
Because we don '
People actually need to treat energy.
So he told me, "Well, let me show you how I do this."
Let's look at what I saw.
So I took a lot of time to go to the door, and then all this time, I think, "God, does it really do that?
Is it really, really, really going to do it without the risk? "
And then...
And it turns out, it's made them so easy.
So -- do you wear?
Well, I was also.
So this person who couldn't go on the ground and seven suddenly became a regular sample.
When I studied it, I realized it's because it's a training movement.
There's another man who also suffered from those symptoms and use the right, but once she's on the iPhones and all the symptoms disappear, because that's a traffic movement.
So the key to me was to transform this feeling of going on on the energy back to the ground.
And a lot of ideas tried about it, but it worked at the end there was this.
So let's look.
And I call it the stairs of the stairs, and in fact, when the corporations were surprised, it's a doctor, and it's called the young.
So this happens a lot, so why don '
You know, technology is not always the solution.
What we need is a solution that's focused on the person.
I could make it happen, on Google galaxy, or something similar.
But I came to focus on a simple box on the floor.
The engineer can take patients to make them feel more entrepreneurs.
What I hope to do is make every patient Frankson feel like my change feel at the same day.
He told me that I made me feel like myself again.
"Five" in the world of today's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's going to become a little bit more scary, and the world's world's going
But why can't you be something just effective?
All we need is a little bit of empathy, to get out there, to get there.
But let's not stop it.
Let's find these complex problems.
It's not less of them. And we'll get them to a lot more small problems, and then they'll find simple solutions.
And look at these solutions, and as if you need, but with new patterns to do them better.
Imagine what we could do if we all had over simple solutions.
How would the world be if we'd reduce all these simple solutions?
Let's make a more smart world, but with spread.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Are you good as you think you're?
How many are you good at the community of money?
What about reading the emotions of people?
How many healthy are you about other people you know?
Are you better than the average person in India?
Our capacity and the way that we're going to survive to these other people's violence, it's more than a self-esteem.
It's help us understand when we can turn into our decisions and our autonomous decisions and when we need to ask a tree.
But a psychological study that we're not really good at the same time of ourselves.
In fact, we're a lot of times saving ourselves more about the country.
The studies have this phenomenon, the effect is not worse.
This effect explains why more than 100 studies have shown that people are sophisticated by mistakes.
We're judging ourselves as well as others in a country that remains the experience of mathematics.
When you plan in the two companies, you're going to read their budget, 32 percent of the engineers in the society and 42 percent in the last five percent.
In another study, 88 percent of the American genes describe themselves as a high device from the average.
It's not a building.
In average, people tend to make themselves better because they're better at the states like health, because leadership, the knowledge.
What's interesting about this brain is a question with the lowest capacity they're close to the ones that we've put together their skills more on the country.
People who are involved in biodiversity, Kenya, Canada, from mathematics, emotional intelligence, and as a medical worker, and they're deciding everybody's brains to read their brains almost like experts make themselves.
So who's the most likely to have this victim?
Unfortunately we're all, because we've all got a kind of inability that we're not aware of.
But why?
When the psychologists and I'm worrying about the first time in 1999, they'll argue that people who didn '
First of all, they're doing mistakes and come to bad decisions.
But secondly, those are also aware of them to transform their mistakes.
In other words, we've been able to get the leadership of the parents' brains to identify how bad they are.
For instance, when researchers in my life participate in New York City and competition in general, the team called the last eye in the last few days we've tried almost four of the universe.
But they thought they were almost 60 percent of them.
In a deep understanding of the experience of the experience of my own experience, students just couldn't identify what they're going to be doing.
Pautuition is not a question of a organization that makes us blind to our innovation.
People in general ways in their mortality once they're doing these scientists.
In one study, students that we started getting a bad concept in a biology and then took a look at what the virus was ready to read their modern design as adults.
Maybe because that's how people with the amount of experiences or experts have less security in their capacity.
They know enough to know that there's a lot that they don't know.
On the other hand, experts tend to be aware of being a wireless knowledge.
But they're often doing another mistake: they're assuming that all other people are also aware.
The result is that people, whether they're inevitable or high primary, a lot of times in the movement of inequality.
When they're not trying, they can't see the independence of themselves.
When they're high capabilities, they don't understand how much their capabilities are coming out.
So if an intuitive effect looks invisible to those who live it, what can you do to make your skills in different areas?
First, we asked other people, and they asked them, even if it's hard to hear.
Secondly, more important, the tool can learn.
The more we're going to have, there's less risk that we've got invisible studies in our capacity.
Maybe all of this is in this future sentence: when you're waiting with a simple, first of the other person doesn't do the same.
Well, this is a story about how we know what we know.
It's a story about this woman, and TV is just in Chicago.
He's a biologist, which means he's dealing in the slides of really interesting things.
[TV] And TV: Yeah, there were some called "Water]" Watch. "
Finally, and I think it's interesting because of the places where it's reducing these things much over the Arctic, in Turkey.
Now, one day in 2006, he's been working on the website called FECA, which is found as 10 degrees of the North Pole.
CA: Actually, it wasn't going to sound so excited, because it was the eyes of the audience with your GPS and a mental illness of everything that could be very, very, very, very, very exciting.
LK: And at some point, it's going to ask something.
CA: A part of this, something in a party.
It was just a brain on the surface.
LK: And in the first thought, it thought it was just a tree, because it's a kind of things that people found in FLED -- some of the parts of privacy.
But at the same night, when it came back.
CA:...... I find the great rights in a little bit more than a structure that doesn't really seem to be natural to it.
Maybe it's a matter of suffering, but it looks really like.
Hello.
LK: So over the next four years, it's back to the same point over and over and over again, and in the end of about 30 of the same nervous nerve, many of them are really small.
CA: It's not so much. It's not so much.
LK: And she was trying to connect the walls like a fabulous component.
But it was a challenge.
CA: It's just for so many of the slides, I'm trying to use my patients and it doesn't look good.
So ultimately, we've been using a concept of a 3D surface.
CA: Yeah, yeah?
Audience: It turns out that it's much easier to do it in democracy.
CA: It's a lot of magic, once the whole thing comes together.
LK: How much would I be sure that I've been talking about everything right, that I've made all the parts in the right way?
Would you have a potential that you'd put it in a different way that they'd have, say, "Would you be something?"
[]]]]] [DP:]] Man: Ah, no.
CA: What she'd say was, she'd be a road, a foot, a foot, one that was going to be a baby with a smoke, so something like a village or a woman.
But it can't be one of those.
It was just too big.
Audience: The size of this thing, it was tremendous.
It was really a huge experience. CA: So what is this animal could be?
After I came in the morning, she showed one of the bees to her own bones in New York City, and they had a idea.
Audience: We took a concept, and we just read her team, and here's a really interesting wisdom that came out of it.
LK: It's the wind like a kind of choice.
It was just the worst innovation inside its own intuitive lab: Nelbin.
And Darwin is what you can understand to our own own own self.
And in general way, after so many years, it's separated.
But in this case, the architect has been living like a natural physician that says me.
So a year or two or two years later, TV was a problem in Britain, and you saw that her name was called Monay's new process is called "Good" Good "."
It means that different species have a little different structure of diversity, so if you get a penguin of nervous themselves, you can change it to the known species, and who knows, maybe you can get a math.
So he's sent me one of the bees, in Penus.
Audience: Yeah, you want to track that.
It's a kind of important.
And it's in the list.
It turns out that the nerve of 3.5 million years that TV has been reduced in the asteroid that's going to...
Good.
[] VM: And I think what? It's amazing -- if it's true.
LK: So they've been looking for a few cases, and they've got it out for each one.
However, based on the size of the nerve they've found, it means that this galaxy was 30 percent of the microbes.
So this wheelchair was about three meters, and I've got about Twitter.
[Good]]] Yes.
And Technology is found from a billion tons.
So now, when you hear the word "Gulf," what we think about is one of those, the electronics of East Asia.
But the risks are the big images that you have in the brain is one of those, the microbes, and create a crisis in the same time -- without some parts like the Middle East, we have on a big boundaries in the desert, and there's a big, big legislation to help us again.
So how does one of these come to the high architecture?
Well, scientists know a lot of time, it turns out, even before the size of TV, patients actually in Americans.
[music: The American species]]]]]] []]]]]]].
For almost 45 million women were in the environment, you can find them just in North America, around 20 different species, maybe more.
Audience: If you put them in the Mexico, do they look different?
DP: Yeah, you'll have a different body.
And you're going to have a couple of long, so they're actually looking like Jersey.
LK: For some of the only ones, like New York City.
[DP: The Montaneous species were really small, almost like Arabic.
CA: What? What's the size of a billion?
[VL: The most places.
So these were probably not the same.
LK: Oh God, I want a long time in a warrior.
Audience: I know, it wasn't great?
Audience: And then about three to seven million years ago, one of the wheelchairs and South America, where they become thousands of countries, and then then the bridge of the brilliant bridge into Africa.
And then around the end of the last hole, the wheelchair of the current North America.
So, scientists have already known all this, but it's still not enough of how TV is that one of the expectations.
Like, it's, in the temperature of temperature, the rainal revolution.
Now to be leaders, three and a half million years ago, there was more than 22 degrees now.
So this was the forest of us, so more like the Kenyan or Syria today.
But yet, as if, they had a dream of half a year where the doctors were doctors.
You've got stories.
You've had 24 hours a day of a monitor.
Like, how do you... How? How?
How is it that one of the astronomers' astronomers could survive in the Arabic conditions?
So TV and her colleagues think they have the answer.
And that's a kind of Guini.
What if every program we imagine doing the wheelchairs like the train, actually evolved to help us move the wind?
What if these streets are going to make a way not a sand, but on a road, like a gene?
What if it's in the continent -- it's a big news for me, not a place, it's able to have a device -- and it's there to help get the hole of the sensors that's sensors, when the whole food was great?
And then, just later, a lot after he's exposed the bridge of the nation, he's dealing these wind plan to the warm of the warrior?
Like, for instance, the continent might help the wheelchairs more than when you have all the weapons in one place, like, you know, for example, say you don't need to have any of your body.
So it's going to help the life more easier.
It's this crazy idea, which looks like the basis of the basis of the galaxy can actually be a power for a high school.
Now, I'm not the first person to tell this story.
Others told me as a way to start with biological evolution or power to the future of climate change.
But I love it because of a different reason.
For me, it's a story about us, about how we see the world and about how it changes.
So I'm very happy as the history.
And I learned, in fact, many of the scientists are also the students.
They're trying to understand the past.
They tell the history of the universe, of the platform, of life on this planet.
And as the students, you start with the idea of how the story goes.
Audience: We find stories and we're building them, like the wheelchair, right?
It's a great story! It's completely aware of it.
Obviously, it's always living there.
LK: But every moment, you can find a little bit.
You can learn a very small thing that reminds you on a restaurant and feel everything you thought you'd know.
Like, in this case, one scientists found that in one of what he thought was a tree, and because of that, there's a completely intuitive theory about how the asteroid would look like a number of virus and see how it looks like.
And for me, it became completely transformed the way I think about the wheel.
It's become a really simple creature and two cells just to this one environment, to be this global task in the history, and you can get really everywhere.
Thank you. It's going to help.
For me, what are you?
Okay, here, I have one of these here.
And so we're going to help in her regular work where all the music of Richard.
And that's not even a joke.
Anyway -- but really, it's a beautiful period that the story of our world is too accurate.
It's called our machines to get ourselves, to reimagine.
I mean, help me?
And really, we're all in a five-hour of objects and see the world in a new way.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
[We]]]]] [We]]]]]]] We] today] as we're doing life -- we're
But after a few days, something was used to do.
The second is a professor.
The Chicago Phicago actually the most unique behavior: she was a business, but she didn't do her most important.
What happened?
Here's a man, it turns out, in the system.
All the revolution system has something called a solution that says to the lab and how long it's working on each other before it goes to another, and why to go.
When you do it true, computers go between their different tasks, and so you create a nation that they do everything at the same time.
But we all know what happens when things go.
All of the fear, it can be a little hot to us.
Even computers can be successful.
If we learn about science behind computers, we might get ideas about human resources in time.
One of the first reasons is that all the time you're trying to perform a metaphor is time you don't learn to do.
For example, when you look at your email, you can provide all the motions, to choose the most important.
After you're going to get a response, you're back again on the process.
There's a problem.
It's called organic algorithms.
With a very different artist lab, these men will take two years of time and you're going to have to do two of them!
It means four work.
The revolution of the revolution of the revolutionary system is trying to have a problem in 2003.
Hollywood all of her tasks for important story, and sometimes she's spent more time in the regulation than in a tree.
The leading solution to the intelligence of the program was to replace this diverse in a limited number of pounds, the system was less accurate about what to do now, but it's actually made it more time to build a process.
So if you're going to answer your model about what's most important, it can lead to Titan.
I've been a full full of three of the regulation and opening a hour for a long time.
You're going to go to the problem of California, or even invisible!
Unfortunately, sometimes I've been on the design of things in a perfect story can be the key to the heart.
The other structure that's going to be reminded from computers to one of the most popular programs in the modern life: privacy.
When you think about one very similar thing to another, it has to do the reduction of the CO2, to train the place where you're in one task, to find information from the memory and get new information.
These actions have research.
The structure here is that we have drugs in the basis between products and knowledge.
To do a serious work, you're going to reduce the regular space.
But the evidence means to respond every time something works.
These two main principles are at the basis.
This device allows us to decide where we want to move the food.
The obvious solution is to reduce privacy.
The worst solution is to run them.
If you're not a model or a molecule that doesn't make a more beautiful response than a hour, and together, that's the only point that you need to build them.
In computer science, this idea is called privacy.
Instead of deal with things when they're going to happen -- Oh, the mouse?
Who's stress?
The summer that's going to happen? -- the system is doing these disciplines and based on how long you can wait.
In 2013, the privilege of disciplinary disciplines brought a very complex story through the Chinese computers.
Because the privacy allows the system to build everything together, and then go back to the situation of savings in part.
Like computers, that's how we are.
Maybe I'm going to make a sense of what you can, the users, get back to our seat, and return to us one of the great things in the modern life: Should you improve your time and you're going to improve your time and you're going to be able to reduce your life? If, we're able to find drugs to reduce life, why
And there's a conversation about you, and we've come back and we're going to go to the skin, and start to eat.
You wouldn't know that he was there, maybe there was no invisible, from California in the iPhone.
It's a meter, but this bone is a really important kind of thing that you're leading by your experience system, the main material of your body and water, disease and disease.
This system is a transition of cells, just I've learned things, which is the body's behavior and every person on your health.
At the point, there would be a few billion rules, viruses and roads, that can become something that we have like a shoot or a television.
The experience system is looking at the behavior of millions of cell cells, which are also known as the creatures, these are coming from our nerves.
These cells are going to go into the back of the day and a map, a network of creatures that help us buy the body and a crop.
Our body is full of samples: there's 4,000 to 1,1,000 trillion dollars of peace.
When they're doing, we're making things like a security team, curiosity images the day, I've learned the things for important institutions.
This system is looking at a city in the skin called autonomy.
These molecules are in the face of other genes and other strange materials, and you're going to take the face of the Philippines.
Once we're going to take them out, we're going to take the genetic response of the body to start.
There's a lot of different kinds of threats on our bodies, so you're going to respond to the immune system that has to fit itself.
It tells you a lot of different kinds of creatures to deal with human beings in different ways.
Although this diversity, we're able to make a change of cell groups, that's real from an extinction.
First of all, patients activate the kind of experience by taking doctors and cell phones into today.
When you're in the day, they're focused on every cell that they're acting, by being able to.
It allows the potential to identify the intuition on the road that they're able to get this information to the other group of cells and the behavior, the birds.
And a group of cell cell phones called TIT, looking for a body of water and killed them in the restaurant.
In the data, I.C. and IT cells are using the data that's another one of the only genetic intelligence to start to create special proteins that are called diverse.
It's the most common size: Each Antarctica will play if we can connect to us like a key science, and we're going to change the political cells.
IB cells can create millions of these, which are then known in the body and return to the years until the human beings are trained.
While all of this happens, sophisticated symptoms, like a very high life, they're actually a process that's going to help the response of China.
The body's more hot than somebody on microbes are trying to get to spread because they're sensitive to life.
And when the body's body cells, they're released as molecules that make liquid into the sky, what makes less.
It's also a little bit of genetic, that you've heard the elephants and the cells.
In general, there's a vaccine that's always threatened in a few days.
It doesn't always always support you to share, but it's not her goal.
My real work is to prevent the person to return to certain places in your body.
And through a long way of working through time, the China system is providing another future: it's going to help us develop a long experience.
When I.C. and I.T., they can use this data to identify the future.
So when a person comes back, the cells can solve the right genes to deal with it, before it affects other cells.
That's how you can develop certain kinds of diseases, like my mother's work.
It's not always working well.
For some people have an intuitive disease, which makes the immune system to replace the healthy cells of the body.
Nobody knows exactly what makes it, but these disabilities are suffering in the immune system in different materials, and they're going to end up in the basis of rural molecules, I've got some kind of interest.
But for most people, a healthcare system is going to fight for 300 tons and there's no possibilities in the entire life.
At the point, these red red red cells are just going to something much more dangerous.
So the next time you're going to spread out a little bit more difficult, think about the immune system.
We have to get our lives.
I'm on one of the most universal places, sufficient, and die in the United States, Scott and Washington.
And I grew up with a family of Asia and Palestinians.
My mom was art, my father was a professor in the economy, and I'm really going to tell you about the way I discovered, because I always felt very scared in my life as I saw right.
And in fact, I took a way that wasn't exactly what the parents thought.
When I was 19 years old, I went from college -- and I gave, I was a lot of noise.
And I went out to a way of a professional French French French, which was part of my life.
And I've been saying music all over the United States and Europe and Europe, and I've been around for a few years with George Jerusalem.
And by the end of my 20th year, I came to be a friend of the privilege of Berlin's School.
What life is great.
And you know, it's not just a difference.
They're going to write through all the way.
It wasn't their dream.
They would say to their friends and their friends, "My son, he'd take the fear of a decade."
But -- there was, with that, one strange conversation about the way I want to tell you about it.
I was 27 years old, and I was at home from Brazil, and I built my parents to the model, and I spent a long time with my mom, and we were alone in the kitchen.
And she was a method, too method.
Something was wrong.
And then I said, "Oh, what do you think?"
And she said, "Your dad and we're really worried about you."
And I said, "What?"
And she said, "I want you to have a president with me: Would you have the military for Republicans?"
And now, the truth is, I didn't have a completely politician, I just would play a French.
But I had a little discovery, and they needed it, and it made a little bit like a boll.
You see, I became a political experience, and I want to tell you why this is.
It's interesting that it's going to go through the entire life, believe or not, yet.
We realized, when I was born in San Atlo, I remember the first time I saw a real eyes.
We've been a family of the local lab in New York, but it's obviously not real.
It's not even close.
The first time I've seen another, and the eyes, was when I was seven years old, the beginning of the 1970s.
And it was like a lot of you, a kind of physician example, a kind of prosperity.
It was a picture in a galaxy and a child's Germany who was growing in the East Africa, and there was a lot of time in TV.
And he didn't survive, and I knew it, and I was unusual.
How many of you remember this picture, not exactly this picture, but one of you just like this.
It's coming to the West and hard eyes around the world.
Well, this vision is a kind of body that I grew up when I went to school and I went back and I started to get my family.
And I wondered, what happened to this child?
Or do people like me really around the world?
And so I started exploring, even though I wasn't in a economist, I scared the answer: What happened in the world?
Is it going to make worse? Is it going to do better?
What? I discovered the answer, and she changed my life, and I want to share it with you.
We realized -- most Americans believe that we're going to do worse since we were children, since they saw it.
If you ask Americans, "Would we make a worse in the world?" "
But here's the truth.
Here's the discovery that I had changed my thinking.
In 1970 today, one of the population in the world who live in a lot of noise, has to be less or less, of course, if you don't expect, these percent will only be 80 percent.
There was a 80-percent theory in the world since I was born.
And I didn't even know about it.
That's my friend, it's a trick.
It's something we need to get.
It's the biggest approach in human history, and it's happening during our lives.
And so when I discovered this, I asked, what did it do?
What do that possible? Because if you don't know why, you can't do it again.
If you want to get it and find the two billion people from the poverty, because that's what we're talking about: since I was born, two billion people from our eyes, one of our sisters, and from the eyes.
I want the next two billion years, so I have to know why.
And I came out of a month after a answer.
And he wasn't a political answer, because he didn't have a cake.
You know what, I still don't care.
I wanted the best answer from the central economy to the left, and a central species.
And here it is.
Here's the reasons.
There's five reasons that two billion people behind us and one of our sisters from the eyes since I was born.
Number one: global global.
A couple of years: Sorry.
Three: I've been pregnant.
Number four: the law.
Five: Five.
It was the free business system that spread around the world after 1970 that did it.
Now, I'm not my father.
I know that life business is not perfect, and I know business is not everything we need to build a better world.
But it's great.
And that's beyond politics.
Here's what I learned. It's the discovery.
And politics didn't just touch the shape.
In the good case, it's about corruption, which is what so many people talk about, it's the language that's coming from disease that's coming in the freedom system.
And we have to share it with more people.
Now, I'd like to tell you about waiting for the first year that I think that can bring us forward, not just around the world, but really at home.
The best quote I've heard about to provide the computers that I've given you right now to get out of people from the eyes is this: "Social markets have created more than any system in the history.
They'd take billions of the eyes. "
Who said that?
It sounds like a French Franklin or Richard Richard.
Still.
The president Obama said that.
Why do I know this in a language?
Because he said it to me.
Matter.
And I said, "These are hope."
But more than that, I said, "What's the opportunity."
You know what I thought?
This was the event we did on the subject at the University of Janun in 2015.
And I thought, that's the biggest problem that's going to die in America today, what?
It's based on these ideas, liberals and liberals, to help people who need us the most.
Now, I don't have to say anybody in the room that we're in the United States, in America's many countries around the world with politics.
It's going to go to a small level, to a crisis.
It's not true.
Here's an article in the last year in the global science, which is one of the most creative scientists that are published in the West.
And it was a article in 2014 on a political mortality.
What? That's what psychologists call the phenomenon of reduction that your intelligence is based on love but the intelligence of your genome is based on the other.
It's a piece of patients in the world.
You're able to see it between plastic and Israeli, for example.
What's the components of the organization was that in America today, most of Portuans and Democrats are suffering from political students.
Most of people in our country today today are political actions believe they're aware of love but the other side is aware of us.
Think about it.
Most people say, "You know, my analogy is based on basic reasons, I want to help people, but the other people, they say," You're going to go out and find it. "
You can '
It's impossible.
How do you solve this?
Well, first, let's be today: there's differences.
Let's take the difference. It's going to be really cool.
There's a lot of good studies about this.
My friend James gave us on the TED TED.
It's a professor for psychology at the University of New York City.
He's working on the ocean and the values of different people to see how they're different.
And he showed, for example, that liberals have a very different example of what they think is important.
For instance, John showed that liberals care about 59 percent more care about economies.
And the musicians care about economics and 28 percent more care about them.
The difference can't make a poem, right?
I'm never going to take a profit.
It's our power in which our power is.
Remember what made the eyes.
It was the university with the poverty, together with economic method that spread around the world.
We need each other, in other words, if we want to help people and find the next billion people.
How another way.
The government.
How do we do that?
That's the electronic thing, isn't it?
We need creativity.
Many of it is on the stage.
And it's a real entrepreneurship.
We need the investment beyond the words in a local way, responsible, the same regulation.
Yes. But you know what we really need?
We need a new way in Olympics.
We need to be less beautiful.
No?
Do you feel sometimes like your analogy starts to be the head?
Our kind of evolutionary groups?
Do you feel sometimes like you're always listening to people who agree with you?
Why is that dangerous?
Because when we're talking about this country about economics, imagination, you're always talking about organisms and normal governments.
And on the left, Brazil, you're talking about economics, it's always about inequality.
Now these are important things, really important for me, really important for you.
But when it comes to a lot of people who come and need us today, it's the traffic.
We need to connect around the best ways to reduce the eyes in the best tools that we've seen, and it comes from the city when the Americans have to liberate and their university, and liberal liberals need to get their passwords and their passwords for free.
It's the diversity of the future and the future of this country, if we choose to take it.
So how do we do this? How do we do it together?
You need to be a great baby, not just to you but for me.
One number. France is a number of: remember, it's not enough for people who don't agree.
It's not good enough.
We need to remember that we need people who don't agree with us, because there are people who need all of us who are still waiting for all of these tools.
Now, what do you do? How do you write this?
Where does it start? It starts here.
You know, we're all in the room, we're in ways.
We make people listening to us.
We're bringing in a hour. We're bringing ways in India.
When people hear us, with a kind of analogy, then maybe people will listen.
Maybe the babies start in this point.
It's one number.
A few years: I ask you and I ask you to be the person who's saving the hands, which they're going to hear, women's definition.
If you're happy, you've always been saying that we've always been talking about human beings to be fighting for the eyes.
And if you're liberal, the liberals that are always talking about the face of the free markets to solve our problems when we use them in others.
If we do that, we get two things.
One number: We're going to start working on the next two billion dollars and be the solution we've seen a lot of us in the past and we need to see more than we're in the future.
That's what we get. And the second is that we might be able to take war from the future of Antarctica that we're going to get under this country and make it the culture of ideas that are based on our planet.
And then maybe, just maybe, we all understand that our big differences are not really big after all.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's excited to go to a economy.
It can't wait to get out of the green house, to prove them that it's in a mirror, and to prove to the new friends that it's going to.
He's going to go to a party where he's seeing in the room that he's very love.
Let's call us.
In the next day, the isn't involved with a prime pain.
It can only remember the night in the guns.
But what he does remember is he's in the Sydney outside the morning's room in the morning and he's in his eye and she's in the classroom, I want it to stop, and then you're going to go home.
She doesn't feel good about what's going on, but she thinks, "Maybe that's how it's about the economy?"
One in five years and one of 13 men will be a certain point in a country during you've been in the United States.
Fifty percent of 10 percent will ever take on the period to their school or the police.
And these are yes, in average, we'll wait 11 months to take together.
It's at the beginning to just feel like it's focused on what's happening with itself.
But when he saw Monico's home from reasons, he's driving them.
After he's dealing the door, he's found that he's one of them who's going to do exactly the same thing.
And it doesn't take a conversation that I've got to explain because 90 percent of the countries are doing by return.
But with that one percent of the education, it's not likely that even they're going to go back, and it's also not going to happen every day if they're together.
In fact, there's only six percent of the drugs that are conducted to a local police police with the attack without one day in prison.
What I mean, there's more than 99 percent chance that they're going to be reduced.
It means that there's no regulation in the United States.
Now, I'm even a leadership of local diseases in the training.
I'm interested in the systems and networks where we can remember our efforts to do the best.
So that's, for me, a tragedy problem, but a beautiful problem.
So when my mother's daughter's issues started to get news a few years ago, I felt like this is a unique opportunity to change.
And so we did.
We've started in the morning with a global device.
And what they've done was they've had a simple camera; they wanted a website, one that they could use in the place and while the most safe sensitive feeling of information about their only possibilities, with the ability to take electrodes on their period, instead, instead of their first step was going to talk to somebody who might not have.
With the possibilities to create a very safe journey of what's going to happen, even if they don't want to make an interesting journey.
And finally, and maybe the architecture, with the ability to take on their period just if somebody else will take on the same box.
You see, I think you're not the only life changes everything.
It changes the way you're missing your experience, it changes the way you think about your face, it means that if you're going to make sure, there's somebody who's going to keep you on.
We've created a website that actually does this and we've changed the two months ago, we've changed it in Uganda, in the change of generations.
And it's generally the only system in which if the first victim of my country came out, which makes her interested in the income system and said that it's too, and the second victim of who did the same as a few months later, they'd be real and a privacy of the two victims that would be able to be able to send in the same time.
If a system like this was a huge amount for the Amy and my colleagues, there was more risk that they were special, that we believe them, and that the country would have been repeated, or at least it would get the help that he needed.
And if we'd be able to stop foreign buildings like their second period of time in the lab, the skills like the nation's world didn't even exist from the beginning.
We were able to prevent 59 percent of the countries just by creating more remote buildings.
And because we're making a real meaningful, maybe for the first time, the species of the world will never be trying to collect somebody.
The kind of system that I'm described, the kind of system that lies want is a kind of information about three, which means there's a science that's a science that's been released for you and regret it to three things that you're going to have on, like the task.
The evolution that we're building is to be advertising.
But the same kind of system can be used in the military or even in the workplace.
We don't need to live in the world in 99 percent of the oceans replace.
We can create one of those that affect a million, where lions get the support and the support and the investment comes to them, in the different ways that they need, and we have a real idea to the rights of people.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I learned in Chile, I did a long time in the government, which means I had to write a lot of work.
Well, when a normal student works, it might share the work about the next way.
And so, you know, you start in a general way, but you're able to do enough for the first week, so also with a few days more business on the screen, all the work is coming in and the rest of the things are bad.
And I really would like to do the things like this.
It's supposed to be the plan.
I was ready to start before the program, but then, in the face, there was a little bit more work, and I did the next thing.
And that was happening in every work I had to feel.
But then it's my job, in the '90s, a document that you're supposed to work for a year.
And I knew that in my work like this, there's no situation to work in my normal method.
It was a big project.
So I've planned everything, and I decided I'm not in the next method.
So here's what it would look like for the year.
I'm going to start with communities, and in months later I'm going to give you a little gas, and then, read the end, I'm going to go through a high seas.
How hard is it that it should be, to build organisms?
No big story, right?
But then, there's a funny argument.
The first sensors are?
They're just going to go, and I couldn't really do something.
So I've come from a very cool program.
And then...) But then, also, the average innovation is just a page of a page, and I didn't really write words, and eventually I found myself here.
And then months became one month, which became two weeks.
One day I went through with three days to the road, and because I still didn't write a word, I did the only thing I could do: I wrote 90 pounds within 72 hours, who couldn '
I thought here's the story.
But a week later I got a conversation, from the economy.
And they say to me, "I've come to the plants or victim?"
And I say, "Yes."
"We need to talk about your work."
And I say, "Okay."
And then they say, "This is the best work we've ever seen."
I'm Applause) It's -- it's not happening.
And that was a really bad job, but really bad.
And I just wanted to have one moment, when you all thought, "This guy is amazing!"
But no, no, it was a very bad job.
Anyway, today I'm in the room that you're going to write in the web.
I write the blog: Women.
And a few years ago, I decided to write about experiences.
My behavior always has always looked at me and life around me, and I wanted to explain to all over the world, what's going on in the first place, and why we're when we're behavior.
Well, I've had a service, that our brains are actually different from the experts of other people.
And in order to invent the service for the window, I found a MRRI that agreed that I didn't agree the brain of another person, which is to train, because I can change them.
And I brought them here today, to show you.
I want you to live with them for a moment of experiences and see if you're in the difference.
I know that if you're not a special brain, it's not so simple, but I want you to try.
Okay? So here we see a brain of a nurse.
[Now...
Here's my brain.
So, there's a difference.
In the two brains, there's a very serious decision, but in the brain of the laws and the finance and the state.
So, what does this mean for the only one?
Well, it means that everything's okay -- until it's happening.
[It's exactly the time to work.]]] [No, it's not!] It's not!] It's not!] It's not, it's not!] The
And then -- and then, we're going to go to the morning, see if something started there in the last 10 minutes.
So then we go into a good Western Western West who start in the movie of Richard Ford and talk about magnets and many, much later when we're watching university with a mother of John Bay.
And that's all going to take a little bit of time, so we don't really have a place without doing some work.
"Watch!"
So what's actually going on here?
And the modern end doesn't look like someone you would want behind the gas.
It's a very profound moment.
I don't have a memory passed, it's not aware of the future, and I'll remember just two things: "Love."
Now, in the world of life -- it's working in the face.
If you're a dog, you're going to spend all your life in doing things and fun, so I've been able to make life!
And for the summer, human beings are just a lot of animals.
Everything you need to do is we have a good sleep, to eat a good, to get out of the fingers, things that we've been looking at, really the cell.
But, in a case that you don't notice -- we're no longer in our crisis.
We're living in the Mexico culture, and we've got no concept of who's what it means.
And that's why we're sitting in someone inside the brain, this guy -- making the decisions that allow us to do the capacity to do anything else.
We can see the future in particular and together.
We can see the big picture.
We can design a plan for the long term.
And we want to take all of these in the window.
And he wants to make us do what we'll see and do at the moment.
Well, sometimes it's really cool to do what we've got to win, for example when we're going to go to Western, we're going to sleep today because you've just been talking about.
It's the region that we have a map.
Sometimes -- they agree in their hands.
But sometimes, we've made a lot more to do things and less awesome, to buy the big picture.
And that's the place where we have an independence.
And for the only one, this explanation is going to end in the same way every time, makes us a lot of time in this liquid region, a place that's found out out outside of the galaxy.
I'm called this place: "The French game."
So now, the wonderful games is a place that all of your life, in your context, you know very well.
It's the place where the physician activity is happening, at times where the medical activity doesn't happen.
The wisdom you live in the global game, it doesn't really fun, because you didn't get it, and the air there is just a nation, a nation, an independence -- all the only emotions and the best.
And the question is, in this situation, when it's the exception in the globe, how can the only one bring ourselves here at all, to this blue region, where it's a lot less scary, but in the morning things really important?
Well, it turns out, it turns out that there's an artist who's always a game by doing a step at the most difficult moment -- somebody who's called the action.
I've been scared now, I've been scared for a year, but I'm going to solve every time to do a job from a human work where there's a chance to be in public, asteroid, or what I've been a very different result.
And most importantly, it's the only thing that's reduced.
Well, he made a very, very, very, very recently, because the TED Talk created it about six months ago and invited me to pass the TED Talk.
Now, obviously I said yes.
It's always been my dream, I think I've been talking to TED Talk.
And in the past, I'm Applause) But within this emotion, it seems to be that you've got the decisions to think about something else.
He told me, "Go, we understand what we've got about ourselves right now?
Are we going to control what's going to happen one day in the future?
We have to sit and start working on this now.
And the page said, "You agree with you to a window, but let's just open the 21st and always open the planet, about 200 feet over the surface, and then we're going to kill the mouse for two hours and a half a half years and a half a year and we're going to get a better sense of our country."
And so that's what we've done in the same day.
So six months became four, and then sensors and then sensors, and the TED Talk decided to publish the list of things.
And I opened the website there -- our face is a tree for a look back.
And what's the worst part?
And so I was scared by the beginning of my father and I did a few seconds later, the system could be built.
I'm beautiful -- you're sure, it's coming from the patient -- Bay! It's the first one.
And finally, finally, it's a serious decision that we can take our face and I can start working on the talk.
Now, a story of the action can explain all kinds of kinds of kinds of behavior and not the faces of the experiences, like how someone like me can fly in the skin without even open oil, and then at the same time, it's going to find the boundaries of the bone to stay for the rest of the forest to be able to write.
And all of this situation I've described to go, with three countries -- that's what's happening in my head of life.
It doesn't matter, but ultimately, it works.
That's what I decided to write in the blog a few years ago.
And when I wrote -- and I was dealing from the responses.
I've got thousands of data and DNA, from all kinds of people from all over the world, that's business in all sorts of things.
There's one, human beings, creatures, engineers, and a lot of cartoons.
And they all wrote the same thing in India: "I'm getting the same problem in India."
But what's so cool was that between the community and the community of the bubbles of the bubble and the response in the DNA.
These people wrote out of a tremendous tool and told what the experiences are going to live, about what this beetle is going to go.
And I was thinking about it and I said to myself, if the system of the experience is going on, so what's going on here?
Why are all these people are in a very important place?
So it turns out there are two kinds of experiences.
All I talked about today, all the examples I've given, all the examples I've got, all was a long time.
And when there's a long time, the effects of the experiences from the production to the production of the production, because of the beginning of the lab.
But there's another kind of experiences that work in teachers where you don't have a long time.
So if you want a career that you know yourself -- something in the real field, something that's available -- there's no long and I started these things, because you're not going to happen in the beginning, until you're going to decide to do the hard work of the metaphor, I think things.
There's all kinds of important things beyond your career that don '
Now, if the only mechanism of the experience to do these women is to reduce the action, then there's a problem, because in all of these situations, it's not a long time, the action of the inevitable.
It doesn't have to get rid, so the only effects don't happen. They're just starting to win.
And that's this kind of experiences, the long term that less it seems to be about the cloud than the extinction and the extinction, which is based on a long way.
And it's a general way that you get from it in privacy.
And it can be the microbial to a huge amount of Islam and released to the long term.
And I thought to myself, that's the reason for all the ideas is "Love people sent me, and that's why they're in so bad place.
It's not that they're sending now to read what a project is.
The long-term experiences became them for the slides, their lives themselves.
It's not because we couldn't get their dreams, but because they couldn't even start in the recycling.
So I read these "Love" and I had a little discovery -- I don't think two days at all.
Right -- I think you're all unique.
Now, you can be that you're not in a human, like a few of us, and some of you have a healthy relationship with an inevitable, but remember, the biggest regulation of the beach is when you're going to be there.
Now, I want to show you something else.
I call it a life.
There's one time for every week in life in 90 years.
It's not so many reasons in the screen, we've been looking for the fact that we've already been using some of them.
So I think we've all got to have a long perspective in this building.
We need to think about the things that we're living, because each of us's unique and experience about something in life.
We need to stay aware of the local end.
This is our task, of all of us.
And because there's not so many reasons, that's what we need to probably start today.
Well, maybe not really today, but...
So you know.
When it's hard.
Thank you.
Thank you.
In the ancient building, pain and his head thought powerful eyes.
The suffers have been returned to the Asia Mexico, for medicine.
And if the total pain, it's about medicine to do the most known solution -- a little hole in the age of the age to move the day and move the planet.
The tremendous method, which seems to be interpreted, many times returned the head with a more information situation.
Fortunately, doctors today don't face electrical tools to see as a prison.
But we still have a lot to learn about the future suffering.
Today, we're learning as a mayor for two groups -- as a first pain and pain and pain.
The first one isn't a symbols of disease, injuries, or another situation.
But we're going to go back to them a little bit more because of the first pain and the first 50 percent of the microbes, we're actually know a lot more about the head of the fibers.
These are Germans by other health conditions, with causes that move from the baby's coffee in the '60s and the Canada's head, and disease disease.
The doctors and Technologists are over 150 kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of genes, all with cases, different treatments.
But we're going to explore one beautiful teacher -- experiments -- as an example.
The experiments are a system that spread behind the power, the nose, and the rules.
When our experiments are molecules, our China's immune response to the region, we're going to save the electrodes and learning the cases much beyond the normal age.
The Chinese experiments don '
And their pain and their pain, they're called Scott, they're operating in a strange response to the brain to release the surface of the doctors who are born all the day in the age of the age, they're afraid and represents the head.
This unprecedure, we're going to live with a very sensitive device, and we're making the famous pain with the head.
Not all pain comes from less.
Research and nervous and nervous molecules are caused to die of unprecedented independence in any pain.
But all the teachers are responding to how big organisms grow.
While it's obvious, it's the microbes, the microbial to the mayors and the rest of us didn't know.
Scientists still live and possibly possible for the three kinds of primary pain: remote and remote, as a primary and very powerful, very expensive and beautiful, all of them, as a price.
Like the rest of the name, as a mayor, the head of the beginning is created the sense of leadership outside the head.
These heavy pain represents the feelings of the first muscles, which are stressed in the pain with peace and oxygen.
Life patients are living on stress, and on the other, there's the hormonal changes like causes, but these are not really focusing on the symptoms.
For instance, in my head of my head of my daughter in the year, the nation is actually a little bit away from the size of the age, and it's less than a camera that doesn't match to the place of the pain of the war as a war.
Scientists have theories about genes, investments from every day to try to make some very sensitive, but no one's safe.
In the data, most of us have been looking at the first pain in in the head of the head of the worse.
Scientists are as a remote pain, which create a sense of war on the size of the size that can be over four hours of water.
In 20 percent of the teachers, these drugs are powerful enough to put on the brain with electrical energy, which is more active on the new media itself.
It's a product that's called the communities, which are able to see the theory of liberal lights and create a unique form of design sensors.
As a mayor in the side, another kind of pain of our first pain, causes the details of pain behind one eye, what's led to the eye or what's led to the ground, or two of you're going to get a safe and a sad.
What can you do with these situations, that affect a dramatic quality of life's quality of many people?
As a head of the head of the different cases can be patients with depression as a pain without a rainforest, like a big drugs that reduce the pressure within my age.
And a lot of cases to the price of the fibers, like the baby in the year, the pressure of the eyes, and pressure, they can avoid active science.
I've been worried as a mayor in the side of them are more complicated, and I still didn't grow politicians who work on everyone.
But luckily, biologists work hard in the outside of these customers who are so building so much on my head.
The computers of today are so amazing that we don't notice how much they really look.
I'd like to talk to you today about this problem, and how we can fix it with the brain science.
First of all, I'd like to return you to a doctor in 2011 that I had a deep impact on it.
I sat down in the University of California, where I learned a brain computer science, and I had a great conversation with a deep student about the power of Congress to replace one day.
And just when we got to the best part of the conversation, of course, our phone is time.
And he's pulling it to me, and he's looking at me down and start to us.
And then he's driving the wheelchair back to our peace and says, "Go, I'm you."
But of course, my eyes were gas, and the moment.
I've spent a day beyond the past, I've been looking at a different student that's going to have a phone, this time for a group.
He passed on images in Iraq, and these kids were laughed in the atmosphere.
And this technology between how much I felt and how happy they felt about the same technology, really made me think.
And as I thought about it more, I realized that it wasn't the digital information that was the bad guy, it was just the situation that the village between my friends and most of the others.
We realized, they were talking about something, just like our ancestors who developed their social capabilities and stories around the case.
And that's exactly what tools need to do, I think.
They need to expand our body.
And I think computers today do exactly the opposite.
Whether you're sending a video and you're going to put you or you're talking about a party or just a tree with a friend, you're doing it really in the same ways.
You're bearing over these buildings, playing with more details and more than white.
And I think that's the wrong way, I think we can start using a much more natural machine.
We need to use our cars that bring our work back to the world.
We need to use machines that use the brain principles to expand our senses instead of going.
Now just in the case we have this machine here.
It's called 2 meters.
Let's try it.
Now I'm really a model, and I see my audience, and I can see my hand.
And over three, two, one, we're going to see a graph from a conference, the Congress is very popular, of our slides that I'm in the head of now.
And of course, it can be everything we're right now learning from it, and I can use it to move them around with a very beautiful control control.
And I think I'm just an example.
We're going to go back to it a little bit.
And now if you're like me, your brain has already run with the possibilities of what can do with this kind of technology, so let's look at some of you.
My mom is architecture, so of course, the first thing that we're going to be able to solve is a design of building in the early space instead of using these local architecture.
It's actually known in Germany now in public design.
That's all the way in our chimpanzees.
And the next use is very personal for me, it's a privilege of the privilege of CO2 physicians, at the University of San Francisco.
As a student to science, I've always been studying the ability to study the complexity structure with a really complex machine, where I could play with the different brain structure.
Now what you're seeing is called Arabic reality, but for me, it's part of a much larger story -- a story about how we can start to expand our body with digital devices, instead of making.
Now...
In the next few years, human beings are going to go from the revolution, I think.
We're going to start to put a layer of digital data on the real world.
Just imagine for a moment of what it would say to stories, to create a brain, to a brain brain, and maybe all of us here today.
And what I think we need to do as a community, it's really trying to do effort and imagine how we can create this new reality in a way that's stretching the human experience, instead of making our reality with a digital science.
And this is my answer.
Now, I want to tell you a little experiment.
Throughout five years -- it's not the smallest device -- about five years, all of them look like the rights of the Congress School.
And just like we didn't care so about it and it's a mobile phone in terms of software -- we're building it because of the activity system -- like science, we're always going to build the revolution of our country, if you want.
And it's very important that we're going to do it right, because maybe we're going to live in these things at least how much we've been living with the use of parts.
And I don't know about you, but I'm going to live inside the parts of me.
And so to build the most intuitive task from China, we're using brain science to know our design animals, instead of giving a group of designers to fight the bedroom.
And the principles that we're all trying around them are what's called "Research" over the less behavior. "
Anyway, we connect our brain system with our brain, for the first time, our brains.
In other words, we're trying to create a computer with more than the African country.
We build a system that always knows how to use it.
Here's the first three design design in which we're using a new form of experiences.
First, you're the revolution system.
I've been systems in traditional ways, they're complex and spread, and your brain requires other challenges to open them.
We're going to have the natural leadership of behavior.
In the meantime, in the reality of Arabia, you can't teach your biographic TED Talk here, and your biographic model on the other side of the table, and your space has evolved a really good memory to reduce them.
You can put your biography that you want to buy -- or what my sentences told me to put really before.
It's perfect. And your brain knows exactly how to return it.
The brain kids of the other feedback we call "Shanging to see."
What are the babies doing when they see something that's going to stop the attention?
They're trying to get a little bit about it.
And that's exactly how nature has to work.
It turns out that the physical system is inevitable and meaning that we call another project -- it's our new part of our body in space.
So in our work and services, we're not just a better generation, we're also building it much more to science.
So, you're going to see.
But it's not enough to live things ourselves.
We're actually companies.
And this leads us to our third brain, the biographics from our first story.
Our New York City system offers that we can connect to each other with our work much better if we can see the face and one day of the other.
So if you're looking at a video behind me, you can see that there's a game that's using the same biographic, and you're creating a wealth, you're talking about this thing, instead of being reduced by smoking devices.
Let's go and try it again in the brain science.
So again, our favorite task, the revolution of the brain.
I'm going to take another step back and take these slides and leave them there on the table.
Now I'm with you, I'm at the moment, we're friends.
Our special memory comes into action, and I can keep them and bring them back to the time, reminds me that I'm the revolution system.
And now my collection is working, and I can continue to solve these slides and thousands of parts and touch the basis that we've just carrying our hand.
But it's not enough to see things alone, so within a second, my partner's partner's partner's partner's partner's partner's partner's partner's partner's partner's partner's talk to
[The New York, what's happening?
A company, I can see this guy's model.
And it's a Islamic effect.
Thank you.
Our New York City system offers that it's going to replace phones in the next future.
Just, what happens?
RB: It's great. We're born today.
Thank you very much: RP, you can take a gift of the Congress brain that we've seen in the video video so.
A company, it's not just going to change phones, it's also going to change the way we're participating.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
RB: Please.
So MG: So a company, this is the message that I discovered in this thing in 2011: the future of computers didn't work within one of these journey.
It's really here, in it.
And so if there's one idea that I can leave you today, it's the natural machine is not the invention of the future, it's really here in 2016.
So all of us in Twitter, including the Australian team, the managers, the designers, the engineers -- 2017, we're going to throw our extinction with more natural cars.
Thank you very much.
Applause) Thank you, I'm saving you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: So help me with something one, because there were a few examples of the reality that was coming over the last year.
And there's sometimes a argument between technology about, we really see the real thing on the screen?
There's the thing that's seen, and how it shows that the technology is that there's actually more than you see when you're looking at the slides.
Do we see the real thing there?
MG: Mary the real thing.
Not only that, we took some young people to take it with a village through the other movies that you saw here.
We want to try to learn the experience of the world that we actually see through the slides, and not to exist.
CA: Thank you very much that I showed us this.
MG: Thank you very much, I'm saving it.
The first idea I'd like to offer is that everybody love from music. I mean, many of us.
But the music is even worse if you're not just listening, it's created it.
So, that's my first idea. We're all aware of the metaphor -- the idea that we're going to take in the last 10 years -- with the music to Mexico or by your baby's door.
A big idea, but it doesn't work at all.
So you can't just get to music, you need somehow to create it.
And I'm going to end it, it's not just to create it, but everybody, each of us in the world has to create a part of music in a very dramatic way, and that's one of the main parts of my work.
So with the communication of MIT, it's a long time we've done in the field called autonomy.
What are all the possibilities that we can think about to make everyone through a institution and not just listen, but to create music?
And we've started in building tools for a few of the largest offenses in the world. We call them the President Octoctober -- for us, Patric, Francisco, French, France, all of them have different kinds of sensors, where we're going to survive everything, so we're going to know how we &apos
And just by the interactive change and the feeling that I can make my California's voice, or for a whole time, or something that doesn't hear about.
When we started doing this, I started thinking. Why can we make these wonderful devices for each one, people who don't we -- and what do I do with the amazing Francisco?
Because we built a whole series of tools.
One of the biggest Islam is called "Oh, I'm a brain."
It's a tool that's about 100 every day, all of us are going to have to play with natural skills that we have.
So, you can play a video game, a child's way to make a model, to use your body's body to take on a certain kind of sound, get in the brain to create molecules, to use it to create an intuition.
And when we're doing the brain price, we're invited the public to come and try to try these tools and then share it and help us participate in all the professionals of the brain's brain.
We've come out to Syrian with this for a long time, and now it's in a building, where we've built a museum around it.
And it's led to something you don't know.
The New York Times came out of our lab, and two girls and most of the students in the MIT's country was proposed that if you're going to do the kind of cells really interesting, people really want to be inside the music, and play it over and over and over and over and over and over again.
So, the model works, but it's just the idea, because our second idea is that not enough to want to do music something like the green.
And the music really is very, but it's also a very good Internet.
It's important, very important.
Mexico can change your life, more than almost anything else.
It can change the way you communicate with others, it can change your body, it can change your imagination. So, we're trying to go to the next step that it's how to build something like a green metaphor.
We're very involved in education, and we've got a long project called "Social Foundation," where we create all sorts of tools that are also familiar, but for small children, I want to build their time, and then I want to build this time when they do it, and then I want to know how to do it, and then we have a long project to do it,
We've had, very good effects, really powerful effects with children around the world, and now people all over the age, use a professor.
And so, we started more interested in how to use these kinds of creative actions in Iran and much better, for all sorts of people who don't have the opportunity to create music.
So, one of the big areas and the things we're working on in the country now is music, from healthcare.
Many of you have probably seen the wonderful book of Olympic Social Mexico.
It's a great book. If you didn't see it, because I'm going to see, it's itself a professor, and it's described all my career and looking at the powerful effects that we've been learning about people's lives in a way.
So we know, for instance, the music is almost always the last thing that people with Alzheimer's and can still respond to it.
Maybe many of you who're paying to this in New York, you can see somebody who can't recognize their face in the mirror, or can't know anybody from their family's family, but you can still find that in the morning of music that we're going to spread out of the chaos, and with that can be able to go back and re
Mexico is the best way to put it in people who lost it as a result of a brain event, and can prevent people with French disease.
It's a powerful way for depression, a magazine, a lot of things.
So, we're working on these experiments and then build active activity that can actually improve people's health.
We do it in many ways. We work with many different patients.
One of them and Scott and Scotland that's actually very close to Boston.
It's a public hospital where a number of years ago we started working with a professor with patients with physical disciplines.
It became a central part of the treatment in a small hospital so that everybody's there in a biological activity.
It's the activity that probably shows the most effective treatment is also revealing all the hospital together to a musical community.
I wanted to show you a short video of some of this work before I'm going to go on.
WK: They're looking at the surgeon on on this.
It's a real experience, not just to learn how to play and listen to the rate, but to transform the institutional memory and hear music in a group.
To understand the music, to design it themselves, change it, to try to try, create their music themselves.
That's how a story allows you to start from a very quickly.
Everybody can live music in a deep way, we just need to build other tools.
The third idea that I want to share with you is that Mexico, I think, more than words, is one of the best ways we have to show who we are. I like to give the lights, even though in a very strange way that I'm feeling more nervous than to hear.
If I'd play here in Chile, I'm playing on the basis of Scott, I'd push my music with you, I could show things about myself that I can't tell you in words, things more people, maybe deeper.
I think it's true for many of us, I want to give you two examples of how the music is one of the powerful machines we have, from ourselves to the outside world.
The first one is a really crazy project that we're building now, called "The Social Act," and it's a very big park, one of the biggest projects of Ethiopia now.
And it's a person, a decade, a successful, a powerful, that wants to live.
So, he's find a way of "Dr. Derek" itself into his environment, actually into a series of books.
So, this thing I want to live in, is "Mario" itself to my environment.
The first meeting disappeared in the beginning of the apartment and the stage can become the first places.
He became my legacy. And the apartment is about what we can share, what we can transform others, people we love, and what we can't.
Each object in Ethiopia is going to live, and it's a huge population, like this web. It's going to take the stage. It looks like the web, but it's actually all the robots.
So, as you can see in this prototype, it's more interesting and more interesting, all over us by a small robot or two small infrastructure that's scared, doctors who're scared on the drugs, the same autism that make the teachers. We also have the military of robots on the stage.
These robots are a kind of dealing between the first places, a doctor of Francisco, and their families. There's a series of death, something like the Indian word.
They're looking at action. You're going to have these great robots that we're trying to now at MIT called "Oh," or these robots work after our music.
They're working after countries. They're smart enough, we're hoping, not to be able to be it. They're going to go on the journey themselves.
And then they're also, when you're listening in your color, you're going to get in a bedroom just as you want.
Even though they're building, they're actually very different.
And the biggest message in USA is called "The system."
It's a series of books. Every book is a robotic, so everybody's entrepreneur, everyone's going to be born, and when they're always going to happen, they're going to make these speech, that's the personality of San Francisco. So it's disappeared
It's the way it's in the way that it's in order to save itself.
In the schools, we also have a high experiment.
So that's all it's a show. And here's the big Britain when it comes into "system."
It's a local procedure.
The best effects are in Mexico -- this is in September 2009, if you can't get, another idea with this project -- here's the thing that's built our network in a very normal music, through the middle of the environment.
But we're working on this that it will be available in the Internet and they're in public space, as a result of each of us to use our institutions from our lives to build our network of someone we love.
So instead of being a German or a village, it will become something that we think about as a human village.
And if you're going to create a human party, what about human intelligence?
Everything I've got to you now -- whether it's a global thing for us -- and what a total tool for us -- the tools will stay for a certain level of people: Dr. Korea.
But what if I can create every tool that we can deal with a way that I'm in a way that I'm in the way that my hands work, why do I do in a big places, why don't I do so in places?
I think it's the future of the feedback, it's the future of music, the future of all leadership.
And I'd like to invite that two people are very special to the stage, so I can tell you how these people might be.
So, we've been reduced to students in Los Angeles, and Turkey from the MIT's country's country, NASA's "," and "in Britain," and he's here today is the same way from Texas. He's the
It's the most powerful place so that it came to me from the hospital of Texas, I can tell you this, because I have a motivation to meet you today and show you my music.
So first, first of all, don't you want to say peace to everyone and tell everybody who you are?
Dan AV: Three. Man Elin. I'm 34, I've got a brain.
I've always loved music, and I'm emotionally excited about my music with this new software.
Tony Bush: And we're really excited that you're going to stand here, really.
It's also very building.
So it turns out it turns out that it's a wonderful, and for the last few years it's spending its cooperation.
He created a lot of mistakes. He does his own students, in fact, he knows in Boston -- he's teaching how people in the hospital and children how to create their music.
And I'm going to give you a person to tell you. So, a person is a student in MIT, a disease for medical music.
A person worked in the last time not only about the possibilities that can be able to make my own arguments, but also how he could do this kind of every human being.
So you want to tell a little bit about what do you work?
Adam Bayan: Yeah. So, Tony and I'm going to go to the work of the work in Texas and this was about the connection of the hour, and he's a creative intelligence, and he's seeing it in his face, and he's going to see it in his face, and he's in his face,
So we started to develop a technology that would allow us to do with NASA, with control, and despite our physical quality, to do that, to be able to do our music.
So, the process and technology -- in the experiment of things, we've first had to have the experiment solution, so, you know, we have a FEPS camera, which is looking at the situation of human data.
We went with a kind of research metaphor where there was already using my morning.
And it was actually the less interesting part of the work, you know, the design process. We needed to go; and we need to go through a graph; we see the kind of creatures that he's doing.
But then, then here's the really interesting aspect of the work, in the work of the engineering part, where, in the experiment of the past, we're hoping beyond the participants in the hospital to understand, you know, how do you know?
What's used for the future movement?
You know, what's my design metaphor?
What kind of things that I think are important to work together to transform the argument of music?
So all of the definitions, and the technology will be used in this point so that there's a microbial cell.
And you know, I think it's a good perspective. It's not that our technologies -- they're enough access, they allow us to create creativity of creativity.
But what about the nature? What about the moment that the artist's mortality of the work? You know, is our technologies allow us to fly?
Would they enough us the only structure to do this? And you know, it's a human relationship to the TV system. So, you know, with, we've got a new design process, a new process to find out when I've been able to find the movement that allows us to look at the design.
So this is what we're going to do today.
TM: So let's do it. So, right, I want to tell everyone what you're going to play now?
WK: That's my connection.
TM: Well, there's a model of my argument, called "My connection."
In fact, it's the end of the argument of the failure, it's connected to a restaurant by a professor.
So it can use our privacy to get a service to be a professor.
It's very careful about it, also faster than me, actually.
Audience: It's also a professional.
So it can go to a professor. You start to create millions, and you're surrounded.
It can teach those in Kenya where it wants.
Each one is a color. It's back into the window of the physics, represents the universe, from the water that's like. You look at a professor. You can see where you're going to be wrong, something that might go to a while, to change, to be able to be really crazy, and then you're going to go through the boss of
So that's the way that he's created my argument, and as a man says, then we've discovered the best way to allow us to do my argument.
It's going to look at us in this camera, that's going to open our data, it's possible to save as it wants our different aspects of music.
And you're also going to see this in a very powerful way on the screen.
We asked one of our students to build a camera.
But instead of doing this in a very easy way, to show you exactly the fact of the camera, we've made it to a graph that's going to show you the basic movement, and show the way that it's happening.
I think it's around how we choose a movement from what's going to do, but I think it's also going to show you, if you look at this movement, when there's no music, their data are very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very effective.
So, when you hear this argument, as I said before, the most important thing is that the music is wonderful, and it seems to you who there's not.
So we're ready?
AB: Yeah.
TM: Well, now you're going to hear my argument "my connection for you.
Thank you. TM: Babby.
Thank you.
In 1962 in university, JC said to a country about parts that I had, some don't put a person on the end of the decade.
The iPhone is used.
No one knows if it's possible, but it's going to feel a program to do it if it's possible.
That's how they're big dreams.
The big dreams are not just a vision, they're a very powerful vision with strategy to become real.
I've got a tremendous investment to work in a metaphor.
Basically -- for the GGDP -- you're going to find out what a dinosaurs work together with an iPhone and you're doing from the military where you think together with the brain of a refugee.
These inventions, engineers and create water on technology that we hope we can do the world a wonderful place.
We're using the word "weird" to remind us to keep our agencies -- to continue dream.
We're using a word to remind ourselves that we want to have an extinct vision -- a professional program to make them real.
Here's our faith program.
One number: We want to find a huge problem in the world that affects many millions of people.
A couple of years: We want to find a solution to this problem.
And then a number three: you need to be a reason to believe that technology to this is a radical solution can actually be built.
But I have an experiment for you.
Specifically, it's a great place.
But instead of avoid the balance, we're going to focus on the face that it's not there, and we've tried to turn it into our vision.
We've spent most of us in the morning and trying to prove that we're wrong.
This is, it's our secret.
We focused on all the most difficult parts of the problem at the beginning.
I was excited, "Hey! How do we kill our project today?"
We've got this interesting food that's going on and we're able to allow our national optimistic optimism to us our vision.
But then we're also going to support our optimism to have life, to put it into these customers.
I want to show you some of the projects that we had to leave behind the rich cortex, and also how many of the features are now, not just to survive the process, but also I'd like.
Last year, we've killed a project in an autonomous quality.
It's a part of the explanation that we've found.
One of the hour people in the world suffers from music.
So it's a weird that had to happen.
It's a quality that's using less water and a hundred times less than we're living with.
And because you can grow the food in my young place, you don't have to invest it to big proteins.
We've made a lot of surgeons like an intuition or a great theory.
But unfortunately, we can '
So we killed the project.
Here's another big problem.
We're paying a lot of resources and it's around us to invest in the world.
The economic development of countries without access is limited by adding industrial infrastructure.
The radical solution?
Speak has a great party from the air with a bridge that's changing.
It has the potential to reduce, at least in general, the cost, the time and the carbon's fingerprint without the road.
We've come to a screen of disciplines through technologies that can be able to reduce the cost enough that we can actually create these drugs -- in this area enough.
But it doesn't matter how easy they're going to create the state and it turns out that it's going to get rid of 200 million dollars to design and build the first.
200 million is just too expensive.
Because the structure of GDP with these products of doing new design and learning new design, we can't find 200 million dollars to get the first data about whether we're in the right direction.
If we're going to go to one of our projects, we want to know it now, who, who is not the street in the way.
So we also killed this project.
We've found a failure of meaning in project not always says that it's a certain part of the project.
Sometimes it's actually taking us through better project.
It's the prototype of the vehicle that we've been driving ourselves, where we're going to get the indigenous gas.
But it wasn't our goal when we started.
With 1.2 million people who are dealing on global roads every year, cars and self-driving was natural to take.
Three and a half years ago, when we had these experiments, which were believe, the leadership of experiments were so successful, that I changed them to find out what they thought about the experience.
And what we've found was that our programs were going to do almost all the leadership that maybe the microbes were really bad.
It wasn't sure because the users didn't do their work.
They didn't stay in the case that the car had to return the control back to them.
It was a big thing in the team.
It's sent us back to the web table.
And they came to the new perspective that was this physics.
We're going to make a car where you're really going.
You say to the car where you want to come, you're going to half the button and it takes you from a country or Charlia in itself.
We're really grateful that we've had the vision so much in project like we had.
And he's been doing everything we've done since.
And now our machines have made themselves more than 25 million pounds, and they're outside the streets of Martin Washington, and California is Washington.
This cars need their perspective.
That's one of the Internet of TV.
Sometimes your perspective is more powerful than being smart.
We'll take a wind energy.
It's one of the favorite examples by three points of the Twitter.
There's no way we're going to build a better democracy than the experts in this industry.
But we've found a way to get higher in the sky, and get access to the walls and work more, and that's more energy without a small hundreds of patients to get there.
The local energy worker is reduced by these surgeons across my planet.
And it's perfect when it's active, it's a energy through the village.
Once it comes from the end of the end of the end, it's going to go into the reasons of the wind and build the sky.
And now these surgeons that we've put it up up up and become a great culture.
And it's wearing energy back in the village.
We still haven't found a way to kill this project.
And as he survives the stress, we're excited more that it can become more and more and more and more to the end of the world's energy.
It's probably the project we've got is a project.
We're trying to create a Internet that's improved by remote skills.
The network of suffering in Stockroit that's living in the Internet to the regions of rural villages in the world.
It can bring up to almost four billion people and other people, that today they have an independent connection or not at all.
But you can '
It's too powerful, it's ridiculous.
And the differences are a molecule that's going to happen.
Here's where it comes from the crazy moment.
What if, instead, you can make a difference and teach them how to react animals where they're doing?
It turns out that Australia has a conversation that's working very quickly and different directions in Texas.
So we hope that using smart algorithms and motivations around the world, we can compare the differences a little bit, and bring them to a very little bit in Stotoxic to transform these walls in these different directions.
The idea is that we've had enough suffers so that when one million outside your security, there's a different balance to a place, and get the connection of the Internet, just like your phone is passed around the sky when you get in the device.
We're looking at some of the vision and heard -- there's the function to remind us that.
So since 2012, a team of cooperating the work that's called the most high risk to kill the project.
The first thing they've done was to try to get a hotel of the Blin in Stotoxic on the ground.
It worked.
And I'm sure you'd be teachers that it didn't work.
So we went.
Can we make a difference with the hands, so that we don't need the anatomy like a bicycle?
Yes.
Could we tell the stimulus of the difference enough to be a real Internet?
So people can get something more MS?
The first studies didn't even even have a metaphor for a year, but now we can get 15 meters per second.
It's enough to watch the TED Talk.
Are we able to make the kids talk to each other through the sky so that we can bring the kind of deeper into open areas?
We did.
Could we create without a large age of home to stay over 100 days, while it's going to get less than five percent of how many children are living long enough?
Yes, finally.
But I'm sure to you, how you call it, we'd have to try it to get there.
We've created big bones and stories.
We've created tremendous tricks.
We've been created in the size of a blue sound.
We've watched a lot of suffering.
And because one of the things that was in the most high risk to define French was if we could take the difference in one place of the most important experiments was to put in London.
So there's two cells here, one with the other air with the audience.
The difference that I'm going to lose is what to do myself as a planet, I'm going to find light to be more.
There's these weird change that allows us to go to the lights, and this simple movement of the building is the leadership.
It's going to go down to the bed, a country to transform news in the direction and quickly it wants.
But is it a good enough for us to make sure in the world?
In the beginning, but better all the time.
This final difference, our last difference, we can take three kilometers in the sky, can turn ourselves into the space of 500 meters where it wants to be from 20,000 kilometers.
We've got a lot more to do in terms of the system's eye and the system has been reduced.
But last year, without a building that's built the world 19 times over 187 days.
So we're going to continue.
Thank you very much, our differences today do less than everything that the system needs to do.
We're building with communication societies around the world, and we're going to fly over places like I'm not going to build real connections.
That's probably a good thing to be real, and you're right.
We're going to be able to work on big things and complicated and make people independent.
You can't stop people and make them faster.
They're worried. They're worried.
"What happens to me if I care?
Would people laugh?
Would I collect? "
I started with our Chinese.
I'll leave you with how we actually make it happen.
The only way to make people work on big things -- big ideas -- and make them work on all the women's women's women's women's own problem, it's if you've become it through the way of less behavior for them.
We're working hard to do it safe to failure.
Social groups once you hear about the table because they're limited about it.
They're getting experts like their colleagues.
Fields are pregnant from their manager, who's too special.
They're learning about it.
And let's take a look at every person in the team that killed my project, small team of two people to my team more than 30.
We believe in parts of the metaphor.
But my optimism is not the enemy of optimism isn't a story.
This is the perfect partner of optimism.
It represents the potential in every idea.
We can create the future that in our dreams.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
The favorite astronomy of you is called the big wall.
The audience created the market, and at the moment, it's missing the control.
It's called "The War Street" a phenomenon for new times, and even years of training, a person's quality of exactly the moment.
It's going to take a tremendous war that's power in Portugal, in Portugal, and in life, many times under a large stress pressure at the moment.
But insects are also worrying, participants in human competition, and even magic music.
Most people believe their nervous nerves, but why is the emotions of the experts?
There's two theory groups, which are wrong that the main reason to live under the pressure that's happening in our country.
First, there's the training theory.
The professionals that design are affected when the brain is business, five, we're afraid instead of learning the week in the task.
When reminder refugees are not released by attention, something will pay the research.
The brain can go as a certain amount of information in every moment.
Because the task that challenges the work memory, the same model of the brain that we use to keep a number of phone lights and babies, will come in the brain of stress.
In 2004, a group of students in university were asked to do a computer task, part of complexity and complexity and effort the memory.
Some of our students have taught the two kinds of states without stress, while the other people who find them when they're coming under stress.
While everybody was able to have the communities, these are under the pressure and less than others in the women's questions, which is a lot of memory.
A little theory of theory is what I've been doing in the different group of the explanations to live under stress.
They're about how stress can make people together more than they're before.
The argument here is that once the places become a mathematical, thought about its own imagination is a surprising to design.
It seems that the places we're doing without scientists are the most vulnerable to this kind of life.
A study of sensors have been reduced to the second data when they had to focus on the planet to study how much more accurate, to a situation where they're going to be aware of the planet.
We've been living in a way that we've been doing these disorders, so these are surprised that all of us to build their policy projects became at least good at countries.
But we think we're not all living.
The research shows that some of them are more sensitive than others, especially those who are aware of themselves, insects, and they're afraid of a disease by others.
So how can we avoid us in a very important situation?
First of all, it's going to help under stress stress.
In a research study that we've been looking for professionals, studies have found that they didn't believe under a better stress when we're going to laugh, we're going to treat those who have been reduced to stress.
Secondly, a lot of rules are help in action actions before the competition, like a huge device, back on the beginning of a key, or a procedure group of movement.
Research studies on a body's player, a car, a big water that Texas can be easier and more countries under stress.
And three, studies have shown that we've always shown that we've been looking at the most effective goal than we're in, somebody who's just like this in a sense of what it does.
A study on the player's life is growing up a question that's safe and thinking about the most effective primary than those who believe in the tiny movement.
So, maybe you can agree that, or imagine, under stress, with a country, and with a famous goal, you can bring to death.
While thousands of years, let's look back to the first century of the computers as a very, very, very strange time -- the only time in the history is that people were able to live in space in local space, and with technology as if we were a car; we'd live in 100 years in the space of time, and we'd just take their lives behind them.
Today, we spend most of our time and looking at agrees.
What happened to the interaction with each other?
I don't know about you, but I feel limited within the local world of other drugs.
And that's my passion to connect with people that are inspired to inspire.
Basically: I want to create a new reality, reality in technology brings us much more and much more than each other, reality in which people, don't train, they're the center of all.
I'm looking at reality in a new technology that we see, and touch and feel; reality in technology doesn't surprise to us, but instead of inevitable that we are.
I'm going to take technology in the human space.
We're all together technology that enables people to work more like people, products that allow natural activity, control communities.
This is the next step in evolution.
It's the voice of a microscope, the computer's first destroyed.
It's a device like this and bringing us where the biographical communication will survive into our world, and we're going to collect the way we're living beyond our regulation of our perception.
Now, I don't think about the first future.
I'm talking about today.
We're already seeing complex companies like us who're planning different machines with the Los Angeles; I'm universities like Nigerian and renewables the way to medicine; and the most important ones, ASA use to try to help scientists to make biofuels.
Now, this is important.
By losing the biographics into the world, I'm not just talking about a new device or a better computer.
I'm talking about releasing ourselves from the local limitations of traditional thinking.
There's that way: relatively for time, we're like people in terms of thinking.
We've discovered the carbon and we've started to create the first molecules in our lab.
Now, that's the perspective that I'm there for my work every day.
And now, in the next house, I invite all of you and there's the same perspective on the journey that we have.
Now, when I'm there on the Lols, let me explain the device a little bit.
It's probably the most dangerous thing that we've ever done about what we've ever done with the Los Los, and I can't think about a better place to do it than at TED.
Over a moment, I'm going to see biographics really on the stage, obviously as I see all of you.
Now at the same time, we also have this special camera that's going to go into the stage so that you can share the experience with all the screens.
So let's start our journey.
And what's a better place to start the journey, than the computer's computer.
Let's study the world around us with this new approach, and between the computer world and a new perspective.
The other world of thinking is also great and good.
It's a world that's based on reasons.
As you're developing, we're learning the different reasons and then we're dealing the different effects.
On the top of the iPhone, it's a reason.
French even evolution, it's a impact.
Now when we change this into our physical world, it's very limited, because our universe is not digital.
Our universe is analogy.
Our universe doesn't think in terms of Afghanistan, in real truth, or black and white.
We're a place in the world that's controlled by antibiotic physics, one day of zero and one in the same time, reality based on unlimited possibilities of a story.
You can see how these two World War is coming.
So why are the journey so beautiful in our ecosystems?
We're seeing agreement from the moment that we're blind, for a moment we're dead.
Why?
I think it's because computers give us power.
In the digital universe, we have power to move space and move time.
It doesn't matter if you use technology to visit, you create a communication.
Think about it like this: Let's all go home in the Arab program by TV.
It's a theater -- a place and a hot space.
Once we're going to try this TED Talk, I'm going to imagine my favorite family in China.
It's the growth of water.
Now, these are the forces that we're agreed to deal with the local limitations of our current digital world.
But what if we didn't have to do?
What if we can have the same digital power in our world?
You can already see a team of this, but I believe our children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children 'children's children's children's children's children's children's children &apos
It's going to go out to parts of this world, a world where technology really understand us -- where we're living, working and connections -- with tools that reduce human experience, not a car that's limited human experience.
So how do we get there?
For me, the answer is to look at a different point of view.
It's a network to feel the world from a machine.
If you're a machine that's trying to feel the world, how do you actually improve the problem?
I've probably been trying to grow things like people, around the environment or itself.
But how does this machine communicate with reality?
And I can think about three things.
First of all, as a machine, I'd look at me and I would take the reality.
That's the New York Times and they're examples of a machine that's connected with people from control.
Secondly, as a machine, I can learn from digital information, I'm aware, into reality.
The Germans are examples of intervention and connections with a perspective in a perspective.
Finally, as a machine, I can replace energy with the world through the atmosphere.
Now, imagine to be able to feel the temperature of a virtual nervous nerve, or better, and imagine a biographic fuel that's pushing you back with a different power.
With this perspective, we're able to control the reality for a simple trick.
Now here's an experiment: How many experiments I'm really excited every time I can reduce something to the Twitter.
Social machines are self-driving to this biographical computer on my head, the car becomes a capacity to understand our world.
And they start to communicate us in more human ways.
Now, imagine there's a huge control of all around the world.
We've known the driver to one direction, and you get reality.
We've known the driver to the other side, and you get a local reality.
Now, imagine all your environment between the virtual world to find it.
I love it here.
Now, imagine I can look at all of you and direct real people.
When technology really understand our world, it makes the ways that we communicate, the ways we work and the ways we play.
Fifty times less than a hundred, two men will take on the street, using computers that would be less powerful than your phones in your pockets.
Two million people have been exposed on a platform that are coming in the room for the white.
And the world?
The world was magic.
Now imagine how our children and their children are going to take the transition of space with technology that understand the world.
We're already living in a universal world in real time.
And I can admit, and I can already see the biographics in the future.
In fact, because we were lucky with our minds now, let's try to do something else even more touch.
I invite you to live, for the first time in the world, here in the TED Talk, biographics in real time, exactly Jersey, from the San Francisco.
We're going to go back in the fingers.
George Richard: Here's Alex.
Alexander: Pope! It worked. What's going on today, John?
Thank you. JK: That's all great. I had a wonderful week.
AK: So, you can tell us a little bit, Jeff, where are you?
JK: Well, I'm actually three places.
I'm standing in the room beyond the street, while I'm standing on the stage with you.
CA: Wow, a hundred years ago, there's a million kilometers.
It's crazy! You can tell us a little bit more about where all this information comes from?
JK: Sure.
It's a geographic of a person's intelligence, which has been built by the Robert Robert Robert, which I can explore as a place on Earth.
People are natural studies.
We can understand countries around the environment, just be blue.
We've built tools like a lot of people to expand our vision and reduce our movement.
But for decades, we've studied a chair behind molecules and molecules.
Now, we're spending over all of this, over the tremendous anatomy and the warriors between the world to take our first step on these surface as if we were there.
Today, a group of scientists in our weapons see hundreds of people like we don't see a world -- the world will return to a more familiar, because they're stupid to end like people need.
But our dreams don't need to end with doing it like being there.
When we call this real world to Democratic, we can do things.
We can see invisible systems or thrive ourselves to the end of the river.
Maybe one day, there's a regulation that's based on the skin of the skin.
We take the first step.
But we want all the world to join us to get the next day, because it's not a journey to the trees, but all of us.
AK: Thank you, Jeff, it was amazing.
Thank you very much that we joined us at TED today.
Applause) JK: Thank you for Alex, Bay.
Audience: Benja.
Thank you. I'm looking at this future every day.
I'm inspired by our ancestors.
We've been living in the plants where we've lived together, we'll survive together.
We're all starting to build a technology that will allow us to go back to humanity that brought us to where we're in today -- technology that will allow us to stop living inside the world and other drugs, and you can start to remember what it feels like in our early world.
It's time for us to be human.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. I have some questions.
AK: Okay.
Audience: So there were a few bees in the problems.
And I'll ask you a service, and then we'll have a answer.
We've been visiting the difference between the reality and the reality of the training devices.
We're talking about a woman who's seen.
Is it a kind of experience that's used to change such a device.
AK: It's a great question, I'm going to take it better, it's a question that we've got in the last year.
If you do the research, I didn't know about this question.
I've come from a machine, because in the end, it's the wrong question to ask.
It's the leader to show the communities for someone for the first time, and then it's a big, "What's your television?"
A year of the product of the product is almost unrelevant.
What we need to talk about is the experience of the light, air, which looks like.
And in a better experiment, what's the opportunity of the thing you see.
So this perspective, what you've seen -- you know, the camera's living in the Los.
So even if I'd like to die, I can't.
Audience: But the camera is doing different from our eye.
CA: A camera has a big eye.
It's seeing a lot of the human eye.
So if you're thinking about the light points that look at the perspective of the camera, which is what's going on: How many theories can I get in some fear?
It's the same thing as I get on this voice as I get on it.
Now, this camera shows that there's a lot of the world's world, right?
Audience: God!
Audience: He's beautiful! I told you that he's going.
Let's go.
Audience: Oh, Sweet.
AK: And here's January Hollywood.
Audience: I knew something happened, but I didn't really know what.
AK: So in a painting: to be clear, to find a camera that you see on the screen and there's a lot more than the human eye.
But the identity of the California's identity that you see, the light babies in the surface, they're actually identical.
Audience: So you're born -- Jeff, I'm going to go to you a moment -- so I've spent a lot of time in the stage -- OK: That's true.
Audience: So help me here: If I'm a kid and I have it at home, I don't have to solve the career, right?
AK: The Lolilice is based on real time in about five times a year, with technology that we call space space.
So in your house, once you're going to feel it, the Germans will start to turn, and you'll start learning them and start learning your home.
In the environment where I'm trying to put something on my head and I can communicate with someone with all the wireless skills that the way to generate, we don't want to take a risk of trying to do it together.
So what we've done is we've done the stage in five villages to a second with the same complex technologies that you're going to use the product in the house, and then we've put it down, so when there's a little bit of the network in this environment, between the molecules of the camera and the camera that's on our head,
Because at the end of the end, the Congress comes from this voice, and that's how it's going to happen in California.
So if I'm lose lights, you're going to stop seeing things on the screen.
Audience: And that was beautiful.
My mom... Jim?
JK: Yeah?
Audience: Oh.
AK: I'm a step back.
Audience: So Jeff, you're on Mars, you're here, you're in the room beyond the street.
Tell me more about the fact that with biographics, you can see but you don't have a touch, you don't have a wind.
Is it going to give you science now?
That's my question to Congress.
JK: Thank you for the question.
Actually, I believe that these technologies are really useful now, and so we're using them in many parts of our work of ASA.
So we're using it to improve the ways we're exploring hundreds.
We're also using our asteroids on space.
We even use it to design our next generation of space.
Audience: OK. Okay, John, please go from here.
Thank you very much.
AK: Thank you.
Thank you, thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
It started in one question: Maybe Africa was something, what was your country different, or do it?
I started the thing with a new month about Africa, which was not completely completely completely before the rules of Africa is not my country.
But in Brazil, it's the experiences of this country to build an optimistic company after I've been dealing for years by the Atlantic Twitter, a little bit, a little bit like Africa, and it's been that there's all kinds of citizens of all of these kinds of citizens start to have a robot in her own.
And then I went.
And then I felt this different feeling, where I was going to be whether I half the road.
So, I've sent some other creatures about our country about how many countries in Africa I know.
And then I woke up again, but this time I went back and read all the creatures I'd ever got to convince myself, not, to remind myself, that I'm really funny that even if nobody's wrong, it's okay.
But unfortunately, I didn't have to keep it through time.
And very quickly, people started to participate.
In fact, at the end of this week, the atmosphere of Egyptian came to 60,000 trees, we've had the continent in the continent and published all over the world.
People were using this atmosphere to do all kinds of things.
In order to laugh on their phanthropes: [Ethiopia]] Ethiopia]]]]]]]] Ethiopians]]]
People started through their Africa.
So for a week, one week in my life, Twitter became a real Africa.
And I'm really excited, especially because I've realized that Africa can work, that there's a difference before us, in our fingerprints, the infrastructure that was just a little bit like a little bit of a little bit to have my father and one.
And it's called Los Antarctica, I'm 22 and the production of Africa in Africa.
Now, I say this, because my parents come from different countries in Africa.
My father's father is a country called Britain in South Africa.
A country that's discovered just a little bit of Germany.
The year we're taking the 50 billion democracy in this country.
And there's this country that's very similar to social states.
My mom's country is a camera and then a child.
It's a very, very small country, also in South Africa.
It's the last real ways in Africa.
So it's the control of us and the CO2 family in their service, for a very long time.
On the wall, these countries look very different.
And when I was a kid, I could see the difference.
In one country, there's a lot of rain, in another -- not so much.
But outside of that, I didn't really understand why it's because my parents came from different places.
But at the end of the time, it was a very different impact on me.
You see, I was born in one country and started in another country.
When we went to Texas, I was an action called San Scott and Texas, and I was talking about it.
So I made a minute with my new house, with my new culture, as a space, can't figure out what I've told me in my family in the country that I've been supposed to pass on.
And very quickly, I took the Chinese.
And when I went back to Sydney and then I was born, I've been doing every time with the fact of how unusual I became.
Let's end our income to the privacy system of Africa, that all the goal is to save the Africa in the way, and you get a very different adults.
But I think my interested in the ideas of identity, a child here, in this strategy of being able to change in one problem but not really to be able to get one of them because they're going to be able to go through this tree where they're going around.
And I've been around in this idea, of the African identity.
Since then, I went to read about politics and Germany and about it and what it means for all of these things.
And I went to stand in the African philosophy.
When I started to read, I went to the work of Italians who live as a student in Kenyan Francisco, two complex issues like California and black scientists.
And when I was thinking, at the age of 14, I realized these big ideas for the water, I was dealing to a place of South Africa and big, like Mexico in Bayria and Popatria and Palestinian.
I read all the African story I could get.
So when it comes to Twitter, I've been a little bit about all the components of a young girl in the German that her friends are really scared to hear about all of these things.
The year was 2011 and all over South Africa and every continent at all, a very sophisticated molecules and the Internet became more effective.
So in my career, we've all sent this data on this infrastructure called 140 to a little bit of creativity.
A long reasons to work, in the lectures that some of us should listen to, in our refugees, we will survive some of us can be able to find out of the early reality of the young people and Africa.
But of course, these drugs were not the dreams of everyone.
It means, if I was a young girl in Texas and I wanted to be in the Internet, first, I had to run in English.
Secondly, I had to track more than three of the buildings I knew in the Internet.
I had to track in South Africa, it's human beings, genes, adults.
And suddenly, your world will open.
And our world really opens.
I've been working after Africa that's going to be born around the continent, we're learning themselves and we're spending the images under the GDP: Charles.
Because at the same time, when you'd like to reduce Africa in Google or in any kind of social network, you'd think that every year in the continent of my life's life's children's children's children's children's children's children's children.
But Africa used this infrastructure to take a kind of communication.
These were Africa that was the telescope in our sea of Nigeria.
These were Africa in the New York City of New York City.
And these were the same Africa that I started to meet in my journey around me.
We've been afraid of African books, politics, about economic countries.
But almost bubbles, every time, we'd come to talk about Twitter.
And then I realized what was actually Twitter.
We've been in the center of something amazing, because for the first time it's ever, South Africa, and we're all in our future in real time, without the kinds of economies, of economies of governments that are scared.
Because the open truth is, many Africa know a lot less about other African countries than some Western Western Western Western Western West at all.
Maybe it's in case, but sometimes -- it's going to do a machine.
For example, in South Africa's Africa's astronomy, South Africa have been met with the idea, that every country that I've been looking at in New York City and Canada.
And it's going to do to convince them that they're going to live under the long life than to live as a free choice.
Let's try to identify the global education system of Africa, that's going to operate without a thought of the two years since 15 years, I could learn all the different reasons that I've been in Europe in Europe in the last 200 years, but I didn't know what my name is in the neighborhood.
And for me, there's no idea whether you're going to look at whether not not not, the energy of all Africa that's just that.
When an Asian, when you're in the opposite, we're all issues in results.
When in New York City and students from political revolution, they come to us, to the other countries.
In Africa, they're found that there's six of the largest political refugees in the world.
What's ever been in the problem of Burkey has become a problem of Africa.
So as we, there's no problems of Chinese or Africa's problems or the problems of data, just the problems of Africa, because ultimately, we're taking the same from the opposite.
So if we take the problems, why don't we do a better job to share the successes?
How?
Well, in the long term, we can go to the train within Africa and try to run the limits and outside the leadership in the regions that they've already been exposed.
But I think the most successful way of Africa to share its success is to admit something that I like to call Paul Africa and social project.
Now, Paul Africa's political project already, so I don't offer people a new thing here.
But Paul Africa and politics is in the general generations of the politics.
And who is it great?
Well, almost just the African leaders.
No, what I'm talking about is the average Africa.
African young young people like us, we're exposing creativity, new ideas.
But with a bad crisis of bad institutions, all this potential can be reduced.
In the continent, there's a lot of leadership and a lot of leadership and found that in London is already more than the life of the population, we need something new, something that works.
And I think this is a social Africa.
My dream is, young young people were trying to give me a reasonable difference to experience our innovation.
My dream is, when Africa's young people with a brilliant idea, he didn't say, "Wow, it's not working in my country," more.
My dream is that young Africa will start to understand that the continent is our creativity, is our home.
By the Internet, we can start thinking in terms of collaboration. We can start to offer us.
In Africa we're saying, "If you want to go faster, you're alone, but if you want to get far away, you're going to live."
And I believe that Africa and social project is the way we can get together.
And it's already happening.
It's the approach to these countries will be able to make Africa something that we've always had to take in violence: voice.
Now we have infrastructure.
Before, if I wanted to hear the young Africa, I had to wait for the forest, 65 -- so there's a city in the morning, and take the drug and tell you about the plan that I have for your parents to 20 years.
Before, if I wanted to hear about your tree government, we would take you to reduce, to the two results that I'm going to remove from the Western Western Western West or someone would care.
But now we have an opportunity to figure it out in ways that we can't do it from the world.
We're familiar with African students who're offered in a profound disease as an example of education.
We're preparing this women from the academic that's coming to the metaphor.
We're familiar with a big human problems that are used to be uncomfortable.
The first time we've ever ever since the world, for the Africa and the Africa has an opportunity to look at us by those who can move more than everyone: other African Africa.
I believe that with African thinking with using the Internet as well, we can start to save those, and eventually, to save ourselves.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We've gone 128 years since the last country in the world is taking the work; 53 years since Martin's Martian's "I've got a dream."
But we're still living in the world in our city and create not just there first, but just there's the rest of it.
I was born with a full family in color.
My father's father's father's home, a leader and a diversity that's been born.
It's courageous by me that I know my money.
For the Archiatric, my grandmother, there's a city in Gordan and there's a device that's a program.
My grandmother was a doctor, and he between our genome and digital children, like our India in our hands.
My mom is an accident, in the middle of the Brazil, with a galaxy and a gas and a man who's in his lab and a space, but with a lot of time.
It has two sisters.
One of the city in the genes of children are born and a second, it's also very cameras, more in the jihad, like a baby.
So when I grew up in this family, a city never was important to me.
But outside of the house, until that, things have changed.
It was a lot of other interesting problems.
I remember my first painting in school as a series of more emotions.
It was a creative journey, but I've never understood the brain village in the body.
I was a body -- but I wasn't a theory.
My city was life, and people said I'm black.
I've been in a hour with a road of colors inside my head.
More later, when I took my baby to school, in a general way I thought I'm the patient.
When I went back in the kitchen of a company of people thought I was the service.
Even the relationship to me like music just because I went to the beach with doctors or doctors.
And many times, when I visited my grandmother or friends in high states, and I asked not to use the first letters.
Because in the end of talking, with this color and this forest, I can't be a service in some places.
In some way, I started this and I got some of this.
And yet, something that's inside of me is going to go to my father.
Two years later I started with my books.
But we didn't just tell.
I've chosen one with a city of a town in Street that's called the sun.
And since then, a new question started to push it.
"What's the color of your kids?"
As you understand, it's my last concern.
But when I think about it with my arm, my story led me to do my own personal regulation as a result.
And that's how the project's "Gabby."
The Guba Guinea is trying to get our real genes, by the chimpanzees of the dolphin, a man, who wants a team, the connections to the arm.
It's a kind of game that's going to be known for our hands.
It's a work from a story or a global history.
I'm going to show the water on the wall.
So I'm going to go back to 11 features from the hell, I'm going to look at the ground, and look at the diversity of the industrial colors, politics.
I started with a family and friends, and then we knew more people had to join a solution, I would see that came through social media.
I thought the main place to respond to my work was the Internet because I want to admit everyone to outside the other care, also in their mind.
It's because it's the return to the wheelchair.
The project was going to be a big, invitation, drugs, physicians, physicists and music...
It's simple.
And in their hands, my favorite part: Frank France is in public places, and it's on the street, it's a popular project, and it's created a sense of the community.
I got over 3,000 people in 13 different countries, in 19 different cities around the world.
Here's the hell and some of them -- someone who's familiar on the list of "French", "" "and" and "and" I'm going to have the high high school.
In French, the first control of AIDS is going to learn.
And students are also in the summer, and also in the main neighborhood of Richard January.
Second kinds of art, of this is a genius point, of genes and genes, of bodies, of ways, children or stories.
We've all had to build "Gabby."
We've been the same thing that makes us feel the way we see it.
When the modern science is based on the concept of the rainforest, it means to us to be "black," "" "" "" "" Hello, "" "I'm a place?"
Is that the eye? The hell? Hope?
Or is it about our teachers, without no, or the building?
This privacy became a discovery.
At the time I realized that the Guinea was used for many people.
It's a kind of shows for those who can't find themselves transparency.
It was amazing when people started to share with me in their computers on the work.
I have hundreds of these, and I'll share them with you.
My mom's 111 -- Mala's 1111, "which is a very good job to work on her security, because at the end of the week, she's at the end of her friend's mindset, she's not going to have to be able to be able to grow in a regulation.
So your work has a very special place in our heart is very important to me. "
His woman will take her point in Facebook and wrote "Each life, people around the world would be hard to put it in a group, in asteroid.
Maybe people were stop.
Instead of the journey, and I asked the ocean: "How would I get yourself?"
I'm going to have more countries, I've grew up in a great family, and I'm an accurate woman. "
To show you just a few examples, students and students use it as teachers to their institutions and their students.
It's a collection of face.
Research in the field of anthropology, physics and radiology use Gaza in Guinea and in the different kinds of information to human beings, optimism, it's physics, I'm going to say.
One of the most important effects of the project is that Canada is in the Central Center's Center's Center's Center's Center's Center's Center's Center's Center's Center &apos
And if you're already talking about the tree outside, I found the perfect muscles for my project.
More.
The teachers are the ones that use the bus as a meter of a car.
They're interested in me to go back to a painting skin, but it's time as a teacher.
My students, adults and children as one, they draw their own self-independence, trying to find their unique diversity.
As a result, I understand I can be a tree and other ways we can survive.
As I'm an academic, as Angola, every time I find a picture, I feel I'm sitting in the face.
All the train, the fear of the ones I thought in the past...
You become love.
The last country -- the last country in the world where you take the work is the country in the communities -- Brazil.
We've got to work hard to make Africa.
The Egyptian is that the asteroid of the world all of us, and it doesn't disappear from itself.
Thank you.
Applause) Thank you.
Chris Anderson: It's so strange.
Your software, Linos, is found in millions of computers, it's safe for a large part of the Internet.
And I think there's about, about a billion people who use the Iranian device, there's a outside.
Your software is found every one of them.
It's amazing.
You're going to have an amazing office, of the community of all this.
That's what I thought -- and I've been interested when I saw the picture.
I mean, it's -- it's the central of these global experiences.
I'm Applause) Los Angeles Berkeley: It's not really very excited.
And I've got to say, the most interesting part in this picture, that the most people respond to me, is the table of the process.
It's the most interesting part in our office, and I don't really use more.
And I think two things are about this.
The way I work is...
I want you to not have a huge geologist.
I think you can see, the walls in the city in the air.
You say, in the institutions of health, you're just using this color to happen.
And it's a bad color, it's not something that's really cool with you.
What you can't see here is the computer, you see the screen, but the main thing that's important to me in the computer is -- it doesn't have to be big, even though I love it -- it's really got to be a little bit.
I know people working in Google and they have a small atmosphere, they're a little bit in home, and I don't do it.
My office is the most sophisticated crisis I've ever seen.
And I'm sitting there in the web.
If the crowd goes, it's sitting in our lives.
And I'd like to hear the dream of German, not the light inside the computer.
CA: So it's amazing, because in this work, you can manage this technologies -- it's an empathy -- so it's an amazing gift to the power of open openness.
Let me tell us how I came to the structure of open open open and how it led to the development of Los Angeles.
LP: I mean, I'm still working.
I'm really -- I'm working in my home, often in my half.
When it's a world, I'm excited, so I'm wearing.
And so I worked too much.
That's how I also started California.
I didn't started California as a beautiful project.
I started with him as one of the story of a lot of projects I did at the same time for myself, part because I had to have their result, but more than that, because I was just a plan.
So it was for the end of the journey, that for 25 years, it was still not coming.
But it was really the power that I've been a project of myself, and I've been opening open up not going to know at all.
And what happened is...
The project's big, and it's become something I wanted to change in people.
Actually, it's more like, "Wow, see what I did!"
And believe me -- it wasn't just like this.
I opened it to a feedback use, and it wasn't even as "open" in this point at the time.
At the same point, it was open, which was open to use, but there wasn't a direction of open use as we know today to improve it.
It was more like, "Look, I'm working on it for a half years, I'm happy to get responses."
And these people were popular.
In the University of Sydney, I had a friend who was open and open -- at the time he called it in the city "The Research" and he made this piece, which was, you can use some open, open, we've already been there.
And I thought about it a little bit.
I've actually been worried about a concept of training still.
I mean, I think it's one of the concerns that there's anybody who's starting, the worst that someone's taking their work, right?
And then I decided, "What can it be?"
And -- CA: And then when someone, someone would like to think, "Wow, that's really interesting. I didn't think about it.
It can actually improve. "
LP: It didn't even start with people that we've always seen, it's going to be more bad people.
And just the fact that somebody else is looking at your project -- and I'm sure that it's also a common of other things, but it's bringing it to us -- the fact that someone else's interested in your hand, look at enough to give you a real and give you ideas.
It was a great thing for me.
I was 21 in my time, so I was young, but I was already a half of my life, actually.
And every project before, it was a man who was scared and it was when people just started to respond, we started to give back on the hand.
And before they started to give us back, it was, I think, one of the great moments I said, "I love other people!"
Don't argue -- we actually don't bring companies.
But I don't really like other people -- I like computers, I like to be a connection with people through a model, because it's actually possible.
But I do like other people who respond and intervene in my project.
And it became so much more.
CA: So would there a moment that look at what's going on and it started to say, "Derek, it could really be something more, not just a human project that I'm received by a five-bar, but a conversation that would affect all the technology?
LP: No.
I mean, the real part for me, really, was when it became more, it was when it became a little bit.
I'd like to be not to build when it was 10, maybe 100 people are involved -- it's going to be a meaningful point.
The rest of the rest was very excited.
The lab from a hundred people to London was not a big thing -- for me.
Well, I mean, it can be if you're -- and if you want to sell the result, so it's a very big thing -- you don't understand it wrong.
But if technology is what you're interested in the project, the important part was the community.
And then there's a big community in the emotional form.
And I actually don't have one point where I thought, "Wow, that's really the doctor!" "
CA: So all of the techniques I'm talking to you, we're looking for a huge change in their work.
And it's not just Los Angeles, it's this thing called genetic, which is a great system for a program.
Tell me a little bit about it, and your role in the development of this.
LP: So one of the problems we had, we took time until this problem came out, it's when...
When you grow from 10, or a hundred people working on prototypes to 10,000 people, which is, right now, we're in a situation where the nuclear is, we've got 1,000 people involved in every chair that's going to take all months, three months.
Some of these people don't do much.
There's a lot of people doing very small changes.
But in order to remove it, the size changes the way you need to remove it.
And we've gone through a full of pain.
And there's some projects that are going to be blind to our vision.
CDS is the system that was the most use of this need, and I hate CDS that's been trying to touch in the experiences and something else, which was an interesting and everybody outside of the human.
CA) CA: And we were in a good place, we had thousands of people who wanted to participate, but in many ways, I couldn't go to the level where I could work with thousands of people.
So genetic is my second big project, that we've created to reduce our first project.
And this is exactly the way I work.
I don't imagine for -- well, I'm ready for the fun -- but I want to make a difference for something meaningful and so that every project I've ever done was something that I've ever had to have -- CA: So, in fact, we've also got to make a kind of genetic experiment that's actually going to work almost
LP: Yeah, indeed.
And CA: It's amazing to MRA.
Yes, so, you're the man who changed the technology not only once, but sometimes. And we need to try to understand, why is this situation.
I'll give us a few cases, but...
Here's your picture all of us, with the adults.
You've mentioned that you've been a 10 or 11 or 11, half education.
Would you be like this as a computer scientist, you know, an accident on the school that could do anything?
How would you all be?
LP: Yeah, I think I was the typical experience.
I mean, I was...
I didn't have companies in that period.
This is one of the young.
I'm most interested in the worst building than one of the young.
And my sister and young sister, who didn't surprise in the picture, when we had a family of families -- and that's not a huge family, but I have, say, some buildings -- she was a machine.
I mean, before I went into the room, she said, "Oh, that's a terrible way."
Because I wasn't -- I'd say.
I was interested in computers, I was interested in mathematics, I was interested in physics.
I was good at this.
I don't think I was very powerful.
It turns out, my sister said, the most powerful machine was that I didn't give.
CA: Okay, let's talk about it, because it's interesting.
I wasn't too much.
So it's not about to be a geologist to be smart, it's about to be you -- still?
LP: It's going to be a cloud.
It's like you, like, just start something and doesn't say, "That's it, I'm going to do something else -- see!"
And I'm there to ask that in many other parts of my life.
I've been living in the Sylin for seven years.
And I've been working in the same company, in the Sylin, for all the time.
It's really great.
It's not the way the Sylin's Clinton works.
All the idea in the Sylin's Sylin is that people are jumping between work to diversity and change.
And that's not who I am.
CA: But during the development of California itself, this industrial industry sometimes took patients with other people.
A book about it a little bit.
Is it the only to keep the quality of what's going on?
How would you describe what happened?
LP: I don't know if it's a life.
We don't bring companies, "-- sometimes I'm too...
How to say, "It's called" when it's about the emotions of other people, and it's sometimes makes you say things that affect other people.
And I'm not proud of that.
Thank you, but at the same time, it's -- I understand people who tell me that I should be nice.
And then when I'm trying to explain to them that you might exist, maybe you need to be a little bit more beautiful, they see it because I'm not nice.
So what I'm trying to say is we're different.
I'm not people's people, it's not something I'm proud in my brain, but it's part of me.
And one of the things that I really love open is that it really allows people to work together.
We don't need to fight each other -- and sometimes we're really not looking at each other.
It's really -- I mean, there's very, very rapid changes.
But you can, in fact, you can find things that -- you don't even agree, it's just that you're interested in really different things.
And back to Kenya that I've been looking for more species that I've heard from people who've been able to find your work, it turns out, very quickly turned out, these students are people who are institutions, institutions.
And they did all of these things that I really didn't want to do, and they had different features.
And they've been using the openness of the way I really didn't want to use it.
But because it was open, they could do it, and it actually works together.
And I really think it works in the same way.
You've got to be the people, the connections, the people and the friends and the companies that they're like this -- and you really want to share with you and get the community.
But these are not everyone.
And it's not me.
I care about technology.
There's people I've care about the user.
I can't do really, really, at all.
I mean, if I'd know about the only way to get out of the nation was to build a really beautiful house, I'd die there.
And so there are different kinds of people, and I don't exist, I'm trying to explain.
CA: Well, when we talked about a week, I've been talking about another program that you have, which looks really interesting.
It's the idea of Twitter.
And I have some images here.
I think it's an example of a very good example, and it's an example of a task with a better, you can see.
What is the difference between two examples?
LP: So here is -- how many people here have written ourselves?
CA: Oh, Wow.
LP: So I'm sure to you, anybody who's doing the hand, everybody's doing what's called a technical service.
And we teach it -- it's, the first approach that it's not very beautiful, so learning to do it when you start learning programs.
And you don't have to understand the code.
The most interesting part for me is the last poem of the "if."
Because what's happening on the list like this is trying to find a list from the list and the difference if it's the first list or that's a list in the middle.
Because if it's the first list, you have to change the Internet for the first level.
If it's in the middle, you have to change the President's President's President.
So these are two cases completely different.
CA: And it's better.
LP: And it's better.
There's no video here.
And it doesn't really matter -- I don't want you to look at what you don't want, but I want you to understand that sometimes you can see a problem in a different way that's going to write it so that a teacher wants to be normal.
And that's pretty good.
But it's pretty simple.
It brings to the computer science.
It's not important -- although details are important.
For me, the basis of people that I really want to work with is that they have good, and that's why...
I sent you this simple example that it's not relevant because it's too small.
Titchen is much bigger than that.
Technote is the vision of big patterns and intuitive patterns to know what the right way to do things.
CA: Well, so we're talking here the parts now.
You've got a tree, in a way that's meaningful to the humanity.
You're -- I think it's meaning to some of the people here.
CA: You're very smart, and you're still like a hot.
But it has to be something more.
I mean, you change the future.
You have to have the capacity to see an instrument of the future.
You're a powerful man, right?
LP: The truth is that I felt a little bit uncomfortable at TED in the last few days, because there's a lot of food here, right?
And I'm not a man of food.
I don't have a new plan.
I'm an engineer.
And I think it's really -- that's really -- I'm going to get all the people I'm looking at the eyes and look at the stars and say, "I want to get there."
But I'm looking at the land, and I want to fix the room that's used before I don't even go.
This is the kind of man I am.
[]]]]]]) CA: I told me a week about two people.
Who are they, and what's your connection to them?
LP: Well, it's a little bit of a kid who's in the technology, all the trillion trillion trillion, when Tesla got out of a human eye with the crazy ideas.
And people love TV.
I mean, there's people who call their companies on the left.
So the second man is an experiment, which is often lucky to be scared that it's very difficult -- I'm saying, "My famous quot; is one percent of inspiration and 99 percent."
And I'm in the ocean, even if people don't always like it.
Because if you're really different between the years, Tesla is more likely to think about people today, but who really changed the world?
Edson might not be a nice person, he did a lot of things -- he might not be like this or TV, not a vision.
But I think I'm not more insulin.
CA: So our subject in the TED Talk is part of death -- big dreams, and rich.
You're actually the leader of this.
LP: I'm trying to replace it a little bit, yes.
CA: It's good.
So we're looking at you, we're looking for you.
Other companies like Google and others, wind, you can say, billions of dollars from your software.
It feels you?
LP: No.
No, it doesn't feel me from some reasons.
One of the reasons is, I'm not a concept.
A really good situation.
But the second reason is -- I mean, without all of my hair's extinction, California would never get to be what he was.
And it brought to the experiences that I'm not really going to be, and it's pretty close to the audience, but at the same time, it's a experience.
Tell me.
So there's a lot of things that make me be a very happy person to think I've got the right choices.
CA: Is the idea of the openness of the fear -- and I think experiments here, is the idea of the openness of the world's opening out of the world, or we have still where to go, and there's more things that it can do?
LP: So, I'm looking here.
I think one of the reasons that open up is so open to the machine is that in the end of Britain, Kenya is a way that's black and white.
In the many cases, there's a good way to decide, which is something like you need, and something else doesn't work well.
We knew, a woman doesn't work.
And there's exactly the power of this, right?
In many other issues -- I mean, people were talking about open politics, and things like this is really hard to say that yes, you can take the same principles in other regions just because the black black black black black hole is great, but many other people.
So, of course, we're seeing open-source change back to the science world.
The science was there first.
But then the science has become a virus, with Jeans are very expensive and things.
And open openness came back to the science world, with things like French, and Jordans open.
And California also changed the world.
So there are examples, and I'm sure there's another year and the future.
CA: But you're not a man of food, so you're not going to be able to get out of them.
LP: No.
And that's your job to build them, right?
CA: Okay.
Los Antarctica, thank you for Congress, thank you for the Internet, thank you for all the phones of Iran.
Thank you for TED Talk, and I've been thinking so much about yourself.
LP: Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm here to talk to you today about the story that we all believe that it's not possible.
It's a story that's about the statistics, and there's a story that's caught in the environment: the United States of the United States.
Now, this atmosphere begins to wear the way the government does business outside.
But before I go to that, let's start with the problem.
For me, the problem starts with a number of: 137.
137 is the average number of days that we've got to wait to wait to wait because our lab will be treated by the bridge to come out.
137 days.
Now, to get this approach, first of all, it has to take more than 1,000 different websites more than 900 phone numbers, everyone in the United States, and you get on it.
Now, we're living in the time of two amazing change.
The privacy has always changed ourselves all the time.
By the end of the thing, it's a kind of uncomfortable tool in my life that I can think about.
I can sit on my bedroom, and from my phone, I can invite a little bit of a small wave that can get into the door into less than decades.
But at the same time, if you're working on a food weapon to support her family, you need to fit in a complexity that it might not be able to do in the network.
And her ability to do the same work from her administration means that she might have to take a place or a freedom of work that she can't afford.
And the great argument between those that the technologies are going to be the same that it's left behind is one of the biggest challenges of our time -- Applause) because the failure of the governments and digital survivors are working not a privilege of people who need a lot of people.
It's affected students who try to go to economics, the buildings that are trying to get healthcare, and it's where the military comes home.
They can't get what they need when they need it.
And these Americans, the government is more likely to have it every four years.
Her government is not the life that provides services that they need and depends on them.
That's, if to be today, the reason the government has to start working in the rate.
Just say.
Thank you now, it's not always a problem that I had a different answer about it.
When I joined him from the president of the president or in 2008, we took the best leaders of the Twitter industry for politics.
We've reminded more money, we've got more stressed, and we've got more efficient than any politics in the history.
We've been an asteroid in the same technology that's changed the political game.
So when there's a small group of us to bring it into the government, and I knew it wasn't going to be a community, but I was going to get a ready way to go and work.
Now, in my first day of work in Washington, my first day in my government, I went into the office and I gave him a platform.
And the platform is 98.
And I mean, three elections have the same same since the government is going to predict this computer system.
Three systems in the room!
And then we realized that this problem is much bigger than ever we could imagine.
Let me create you a picture.
The political government is the biggest institution in the world.
It takes 86 billion dollars a year -- 86 billion -- on the projects of information systems.
To get it to survive: it's more than all the risk of the risk that's done every year -- about everything.
Now, the problem here is that the whole of institutions don't get what it's pay for, because 94 percent of the political scientists are going to go through the design or others in the atmosphere.
94 percent!
For those of you who think, yes, the number 94 is very close to 100.
So there's another problem: 40 percent of them will never see the theory today.
They're completely reduced.
Now, it's a very profound moment for every organization, because it means that when the government is going to support as someone is going to work, as fails are almost inevitable.
And when the statistics is the most famous option, it means that there's just no other choice from the privilege.
So, what do we do with this?
How do we put it?
Well, the theory of all of this is that we actually didn't actually have to look far away from our elections, because from the map in America has the ideas themselves, our people, who collected our world to a different place before they do.
So what would it look like if it was actually so easy to get our boss or the boundaries that came out like the invitation or could be able to build?
How would it look like if it was a simple way to a project and invent that we changed the technology to get to change the government?
Well, my friend, here's where we start to talk about some of the new emotions that we've discovered to create a change in government.
And here's the digital service of the United States.
The digital service of the United States is a new network of astronomers, a team of team, organizing themselves to the government to create a radical change.
The task of the digital service of the United States is to help governments and digital survivors at the level of students, children, children -- all -- all of them -- meaningful animals.
We're basically trying to build more cool governments, for the people, by the people, today.
I didn't care -- Applause) Thank you.
Thank you, who don't want more than a response, right?
We didn't care from politics.
We've care to make a government better work, because it's the only one we have.
Now, you can think about our team -- well, it's funny -- you can think about our team a little bit like the peace of the peace and meet with six groups.
One of us like the peace of life's lives, but instead of trying to go from touch places, interesting, you spend most of your time in the face, behind computers, help repeat our democracy.
So now, this team -- our liberal book to the digital survival of the United States is simple.
The first game is that we're bringing our best Twitter that our country can offer, and we're trying to take them into time and create in the government.
These are the people who helped build the products and the companies that have made our technology between the world's lives.
Secondly, we're dealing these amazing people from the techniques with the public transition that are already in the government of the government and create a change.
Third, we're restoring them strategy in the structure of information in the most important services and revealing the government.
And finally, we give them a very complicated axis, from the basis of the risk of all the way to change ourselves, to change these lights for good.
Now, this team begins to change how the government does business out.
If you're learning about the Asian Institute, a machine that's simple.
It took something that became a democracy in a industrial industrial industry and put it into a different place where it's what's going to change from the statistics.
Think about what I'm going to take a new difference in one of my career and move my career from revolution.
The digital services of the United States do exactly this.
We're taking what the Sylin Clinton and the business sector has learned a lot of work about how to build digital connections in a country that makes more low, and we're learning it on the government, where it's called Wall Street.
Now, the good news is: it starts to work.
We know that because we can already see results from some of our local projects like the Egyptian Egyptians, when it's just the references.
Thanks to Egyptian was the first place where we wanted this restaurant, and today we take it from the big part of the large number of governments and the most important governments to citizens.
Now, if I can take a moment and look at my team for a second -- it's the biggest feedback of the devices that I've ever been able to share with.
We've got global TV, Facebook, Twitter, Twitter and Twitter, everyone in the team today, everybody's choosing to join their own government.
And what's amazing about this is, everybody's small and smart as they're autonomous.
And I might end, by the way, over half of us and women.
Thank you very much for the best way to understand this strategy is actually to work on a number of examples of how it works in the surface.
I'll give you two examples very quickly.
The first one is going to kill.
It's a friend, a friend, he's a student.
Yes, you know, it's almost a conservation of Sydney.
In the best case, it's hard to take six months to be a patient.
It's sent thousands of meters -- thousands of meters! -- between less than something that's working.
Now, a little story: about a decade ago, the government thought that if we were above the system for the network, it could be able to save money and provide better services, what was a great idea.
So, the process of the government and the physical process started.
Twenty and 1.2 billion dollars later, no story works -- 1.2 billion.
Now at this point, the responses in response, the citizens and citizens and the definition of the United States, we can continue to make money into the classroom.
Unfortunately, this is what happens many times.
This is the statistics today.
But they're not.
The public crisis of public public within the agencies decided to stand and read to change.
A small team of just six people, and what a lot of people don't know is that it's the same as the patient's disease -- just six people.
And this team came out, together, to support this project to create a better business work, a modern solution.
Now, in the talk of techniques, what it's basically telling us is to take big projects and take them into small patterns, so in this way we can reduce the risk to actually see a few weeks, instead of waiting to wait for years.
So within less than three months of our team on the ground, we can already push our first products to activate.
The first one, it's a 900-.
It's used to get hard to get a dancer and a part of it.
Now, the next next to the definition of the definition, Garden and Egypt is a big eye.
Your Darwin is your damage, it's your work, it's your prosperity that you can be in this country.
So to wait six months in the city of the government working the patient is not easy.
I'm excited to tell you that today, you can now, for the first time, to get access to a party and a part of the network without somebody who's touched in the box.
That's what's faster, it's cheaper, and it's a life that's much better for the sense of government.
So one more, very quickly.
In Sunday, we've been releasing citizens to try new.
So as part of the American citizens, you need to go to the citizens.
Anybody who's going to take the test, it can be an extinct process.
So our team that's released a very simple tool to use a language to help people predict, to help them feel their stress, to help them feel more safe without the next step of the American dream.
Because all of this work, all the work about definition, I'm going to take complex processes and make them more human.
One day, one of the public public public public in the early day said something very deep.
She said she had never been so proud of his country and she was optimistic about the project all the time in the government.
And she did it for 30 years.
It's exactly the kind of hope and the culture that we're trying to create.
For example, I want to go back to the military, and what we're doing to build to build an organization that we've seen to survive their own community.
I'm proud to say that just a few months ago, we've released a new security of a new website, CO2.
And D.T. is a simple website to use that brings all the species that's coming out to one place.
One website, not thousands.
The website is a work in the structure, but it's a meaningful progress, because it's true with the users that the most important use: and it's coming out of themselves.
It might sound very clear, because it should be, but unfortunately, it's not normal for governments.
Many times too, decisions are made by knowledge and still doing the more you can get the interaction of the user, but they're not necessarily the users themselves.
So our team in the organization came out of the military, we looked at information, and we talked to the military themselves and we started in a small project, with the most important services that are used to be the best: the strengths of education and techniques.
I'm proud to say they're working on the website today, and when the team is going to improve survival, they're going to go to the lab, and the old websites, we've gone.
Thank you for me, this is what we've seen in 2016.
When you go out of the wheelchair, for the first time I was there, I looked at a quote that was going to be worried about the player.
This said, "Alex". "
He says, "There's no problem of the human knowledge that it's beyond humanity."
It's true.
We have the tools to solve these problems.
We have the tools to get together as a society, like hope, and to solve it together.
Yes, it's hard.
It's hard when we have to fight, when we need to agree to believe that things don't change.
But Mexico, it's a lot of times the most difficult things to do. Because if we don't do it, who do it?
It's by us, we're all comfortable, because the government is not an infinite institution.
Our government is us.
Thank you today, it's not a question of whether change is possible.
The question is not, "Can we?"
The question is, "Would we do this?"
Do you do that?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I was seven years old, one adult with good cars asked me what I would like to be when I grew up.
I said, "Amy!"
"No, don't!" He said, "You can't stop being real!
"Some of the girl's daughter's daughter's daughter's birthday to be an asteroid."
But I've collected myself, I've been looking for some other parts, and finally I decided to be aware, maybe something like Albert Antarctica.
[] Science]]]]]]]]] [Science]]]]]] &#93
And so, I decided to teach computers in Chicago.
In my first year, my office on the computer, I'd like to show us some wonderful movies.
It was the first computer reality that we've ever seen.
I watched these movies in Panada, Maria. It's a page to me in the brain, and I thought, "That's what I want to do in my life."
The idea that all math, the science would be that I've learned can come together to create the global world and the stories that I've been inspired to, was a very good magic magic for me.
Only two years later, I started working in a place that created these movies, or before the reality of Pixar.
There's where we've learned how we're really finding these movies before.
In order to create our movies, we create a world of it inside the computer.
We're starting in Kenya, that we've created drugs, that we've created countries, we're treated in the end of the things become the forest.
And because it's a 3D world, we can move the camera around this world.
I've been trained from all of this.
But then I got the first mistake of theory.
It's actually the military in the world of this world.
I've really got an iron of light, which I'm glad is there in the face.
Here you can see that there's another theory, I'm learning the first version of a theory in our software, molecules the sound, and design the light.
When I teach the light, I think about how it might look like in real life, but since I've been doing this with what we need real experience for the story.
So it can look like this at the beginning, but when we're looking at it and move that, for weeks of work, it might look like this in the first version: in the basis, like this.
There's a certain moment in the theory that made me completely excited about it.
That's when we go from that.
It's the moment that all of the parts are connected together, and at the time this world comes to life as if it's a really different place.
This moment in the world I'm food, especially for this girl who has to be real.
The more I learned to leave, I learned to use light to help a story, to move the week, to create the air, to bring the safe of the expectations, how to make it happen to be seen as a device, or to take a flight on a fingerprint.
You're going to see?
So here's it.
As you see, we can create all the world that want inside the computer.
We can create a world with empathy, with robots that love, we can even get back to the body.
And at the hour it's an amazing thing, the real freedom and this regret, it can create as an engineer.
It can create unbelievable learning, inevitable movement, things that want to exist.
So to fight it, we survive ourselves with science.
We're using science in the world that we know as a service, to collect ourselves in something that's in our intervention and our relationship.
"You're looking for" is an example of this.
Some of the movie is happening under water.
But how do we make it look under water?
In particular research, we've been able to take a tool that you've got underneath the water and recreate it on the computer.
After that, it's a physicist back to see maybe thousands of students and create this picture.
One of the smaller students was the way the light through the water.
So I wrote a theory that's living the physics -- first, the instructions of the water, and then what happens with the colors.
They don't build robots that have the color and the rich and the rich.
When the light is deeper into the water, we're losing the red road, and then the light through the wall, and the rest of the blue with the blue in the far place.
This boy, you can see two important students.
The first one is a dream and behavior, or the invisibility of the invisible and seems to be pushing the windows that's available in the water.
The second is "Women."
That's the films of the light like these that you can see on the walls of the road, which are created when the sun comes in the galaxy of the ocean and the ocean.
This is where we've got the doctor's wind.
It's the data to try and take place in the skin, but it's also teaching what it's going on.
The other great thing that you can see here is that we've left this part with the Atlantic, so it's going to get out of these movies of light, it's going to get disappeared, and we've created the cloud of the world.
You can see how we use the information -- at the end of the water, the air and the movement -- to destroy this real freedom.
But we don't have to.
We're wearing each of these atoms maybe out of you have to be awesome and maybe we're able to push and go into the story of the air.
And we've realized that with color that we've got a really interesting space.
So here's a 3D scenario that's described in a traditional way.
But here we can take the Mols of Sydney and make it New York to match the savings of what's going on.
In this country, it's really important that we're going to see in the water so that we can understand what the Western and Australia, these are the civilizations like you're working on the road.
So we've changed the lights of the water much beyond what I've ever seen in the real life.
Because in the end, we're not trying to repeat the world that's true, we're trying to create a world from an artist, like the expectations can change the story.
We use science to create something wonderful.
We're using a story about art and to bring us to a place of wonderful.
This man, Dali, he's a great example of this.
It's finding the most simple things.
But when he came to the stage of the theory, we knew we had a big problem.
That's how the effort is going to make our DNA to a critical robot, that we've made our interpretation for a perfect brain in terms of optimism.
So my chimps are one of the most expensive games I have.
I don't have face, I'm even a traditional biologist, for the eye.
So we're going to have a very, very, very, very, in my slide to sell our emotional game.
We started in a theory and we realized that it's going to change within my slide is going to take in the galaxy of transparency.
He started to get a metaphor.
So now, a galaxy is basically a healthy thing when you're trying to convince human beings and it's able to love.
So we went to work on these infinitely optimism in trying to find a solution that represents our real robotic materials, but I'll solve this beautiful problems.
So we started with the news.
Here's the amazing conversation, we have doing a teacher and make a teacher.
And here you see all the third month, which shows us all these slides.
We've tried to replace them, and we've tried to get them, nothing worked.
This is where you can see, sometimes we needed something that's collected in the way we're going to see.
So we can '
So here we've got the love of the first doing, that we've put the love of the second, it doesn't work.
We decide it -- it's still not working.
And then we have the "New York!"
Hi. We were collected to light, which is this mistake to my eyes.
Here he's very close to these effects.
First of all, these cameras are exploring through this slide in a way that nothing has done before.
Now we're from our identity to inequality.
As human beings, we have the white door of the eye, the two colors, and the black man.
Now we've got the black man's black, the story of getting the black man.
Finally, we're going to feel like we've got what, as if we're using emotions in the face.
It's later in the movie called the end, and I'm going to lose my personality, actually start to die.
It's the perfect moment to remove this gas.
In the next country, we will go back to life.
We're repeating this light to return the camera back, and it's going to become a very similar robot, full of what we've learned to love.
DP: "Oh?"
And there's a slide in these exhibitions -- when you find the key to a robot's key, the moment you want to do with your life.
The opportunities in "are looking for" here's one of these moments for me.
There's statement in any film that's evolutionary to go.
It was one of these countries.
In the Iraq, there's a vision of this scenario that was based on the material and the speed of the Indus Institute.
The more we've got to look at.
The mortality with the Olympic revolution became the normal conversation of shows more difficult and more questions about numbers and percent.
Maybe not like the way we've been based on something in the real world, and maybe just because we've lost our way.
But it became used to use our brain without the eyes, to use the real science.
This data has taken us the scenario.
But even through all of this tool still, I realized that it could be a beautiful.
So when it came to a result, I went to a map.
When I was working on food between blue blue and dances, it's an asteroid that's based on the music times, and the global value, something that's going to work.
One morning, I've been building the work of the night today.
And I went.
And then I showed it to the training and it was the answer.
After that, I've seen it in a very important room with five people.
In the Egyptian's face, I'm going to get some good words, and then we're going to have data, in general way.
And then, in the best case, you're getting a story to the next step.
I've made my speech, and I've seen the opportunities.
And the military was a long time to solve a long time.
We built enough time for me to think, "Oh, that's my father."
And then he started to reduce depression.
And then the first nervous nerve started to find.
And then all of the room represents.
It's the moment for me and I'm living in a theory.
It's the moment that it's all together and we get a world where we can believe.
We're using math, science to create these wonderful world.
We're using the story in art to make them live.
It's the difference of art and science that makes the world a place of wonderful, a place where we can believe, a place where the things that can get out there -- and a little biology to surprise that it doesn't just work, but also art.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Social cancer affects all of us -- in terms of those who are coming back, they're very deep to these drugs that are going to medical care, even when we're going to move our best drugs.
The engineer at the top of the molecules, when you work in a small scale, you can provide new ways and fight the most aggressive forms of cancer.
The cancer is a very powerful disease.
There's some kinds of cancer, which is lucky, we've learned how to treat a good way with drugs and life and based.
But there's some kinds of cancer that don't respond to these behavior, and the big big big difference, we're back, also after a map of drugs.
We can think of these very aggressive creatures of cancer as a kind of cancer on the schools of Mexico.
They're scared, they're very good, and they're very good at the rest of life.
And like most of these roads, their strengths come from genetics.
The genes that change within these movies can allow us to make us a new situation that we don't believe, the possibilities to live even through our best treatments.
And one example is a trick that enables the cell, also when the medicine comes to the cell, to push the drug out, before the drug can affect.
And imagine -- the theory outside the drug in activity.
It's just one example of the many genetic tricks under the country's country, the cancer.
It's all because of small genes.
So we've got an architecture with amazing power.
And we need a new kind of language and extinction.
In fact, we can write a gene.
The key is a series of the CRA molecules.
RNNA are the creatures of a genetic genetic genetic that expert cells into a certain gene.
Each molecules of RNA can write a specific gene inside the cell.
For many years since we've discovered, scientists have been very excited about how we've been there in medical medicine.
But, there's a problem.
The RNA has a good job inside the cell.
But if it's exposed to the water that's found inside our sea or our lights, it's happening in two seconds.
It has to be that long, it's driving in the body in the body and the end of the film.
So, here's our strategy.
First of all, you'll give the film of RRNA's film, and you've changed the same genome genes, and then you're going to be able to get them in a beautiful drug.
But how can we do that?
In the middle of the virtual engineering, we can actually design a tool that can move through the back of the day.
It has to be tiny enough to go through the sea, it has to be small enough to explore the big level, and it has to be a message enough to take into the movie.
To do this work very well, it has to be one of the size of a person's hair.
Let's look at how we can build this dream.
First of all, let's start with the sound of our dream.
It's a tiny fraction that's captured the most culture.
It's the list of adults actually finished the movie of the video.
In this audience, there's a little bit of a very, very similar point of RNA.
It's our gender.
Because RRNA is a powerful effect, we can protect it in a fifth of a five-dolphin's statement to say a positive mistake.
The two leadership molecules are built by a electrical task, and it's enough that as a magazine moves the RNA in the sea.
It's almost too curious.
But there's another big device that we need to think about.
In fact, it might be the big device all.
How can we solve a market on this?
I mean, every good weapon has to be a direction to know, we need to call it to the Army -- have a big difference.
But our body has a natural energy system that's found in the sea and in the sea and the things that don't have, so it can bring them out.
We're going to feel what? Our dances are thinking back.
We need to respond the Netherlands beyond the digital system.
We've got to get it through the mechanism that's going to be very simple by doing it so that we've tried it.
So we've finally finished that one in the door of a click around this dream.
First of all, the way that this team is one of the nature of natural selection, the satellites that are in our bodies.
It's created a kind of water molecules around the New York City that can be an effect of an invisible control.
The invisibility allows us to move through a long season and far away enough to get to grow, without repeat by the body.
Secondly, as this is a molecule that's specific to our cancer cells.
And when it's survival, the film will take our hands, and now we've got our neural code inside the cancer and ready to be valuable.
I feel the same.
Let's keep!
It's been operated for hours enough time to change the same genes of survival.
Now I sat down the genetic power.
What's more is a video cell without the brain behavior.
And then, a drug that's going to get out of the environment, and it's going to run the big cell.
With enough genes, we can treat many kinds of metaphors, which allow the opportunity to Twitter, without leave behind bad things.
So, how do our strategy work?
We've built these dung structures in animals using a very large asteroid of cancer that's going to control.
Technologist's cancer is coming out of the liquid and out of cancer as it's going to go.
In the general way, we've tried a building -- let's call "San" is the drug for cancer that it's the first treatment of cancer.
So the first of us were treated in our animals without San Francisco.
The big cell cell and the growth of their growth, but they're still very quickly, as they're reminded in two weeks.
So, we tried our attention.
Some of us who wrote with RRNA as the most medicine, in addition to that, we have the DO2 in the environment.
And we saw -- we found that not only the Chinese tumor is actually just a big, and we were looking at one cases.
The tumors were actually university.
[What's interesting about this approach is that it can be a human truth.
We can add a lot of different cultures of RRNA to treat different metaphors and leadership.
And we can put different drugs into our hands.
When doctors learn how to build patients and understand certain kinds of tumors, they're going to help us move from the Netherlands and make this strange strategy in which we're able to use.
A political cancer that I'm on is too special.
It's very small cancer, between the rest of the rest of the rest of which it's coming in in very later, when it's very dead and there's a number of genetic tasks.
After the first reasons of therapy, cancer is back to 75 percent of the patients.
And it's in a general way back to the drugs.
The biggest cancer of cancer is one of the biggest organizations.
And we're now preparing our web to get it.
As a minute, we didn't find a way to work with patients.
But recently, I met if it was a little cancer, too, who, in her classroom.
I was inspired by the optimistic optimism and the power they were whether they're in a certain kind of courage of courageous courage.
In this event, we talked about the different technologies that make cancer.
And who's in the classroom when I was talking about how these plants can be a hope for the next generation to her home.
It's really about me.
It's not just how to build a really algorithm.
It's about changing people's lives.
It's about the quality of the engineering in a scale of molecules.
I know that when students like Jim and water in their mortality, they'll open new possibilities in the world's world's big health problems -- including cancer, amazing, amazing diseases -- just as it's going to go through a way to the open door, in which it's going to be able to see, in the way that it '
Thank you.
Thank you.
I've argued that I've been looking for interesting ideas, and that's my work, my responsibility, as astronomy to remind people who have been reduced to be always the last result.
Now, I want to tell you a story about this.
It can prevent a really similar information of ASA, normal people and one of the most powerful stars in our galaxy.
It started in 2009 with a transformation of ASA.
The main task of French's science was to be reduced from the outside of our solar system.
She did it by watching the only year in the sky, it, with all the little boxes.
And in this building year, it's going to take our lights more than 60,000 stars without the park for more than four years, and we take data every 30 minutes.
It's looking for what astronomers call me beyond.
It's when the platform is related with our vision, so the patient is outside of the planet.
And when it happens, it's a little bit of a very small part of the planet, which can show a device in this problem.
And that's how the team opened a very complex computers to look beyond all the data of Prize.
At the same time astronomers at the same time, the idea is interesting: What if computers collected something?
And that's how we're getting the citizens' citizens who've seen the political parties because people look at the same information.
The human brain has a wonderful ability to identify and patterns, sometimes even better than computers.
However, there was a lot of optimism around us.
My community, and a brilliant company, a political institution, said that people at the same time said, "You don't have a way that you're going to collect the letter."
And so it started, the human teachers had the machine.
And if we're going to find one page, we'll be happy.
When I joined a team four years ago, we've already found some.
And today, with our help more than 3,000 scientists live, we've discovered decades, and we've also discovered one of the most traffic stars in our galaxy.
So to understand this, let me show you how beyond the remote of the data of France looks.
In this graph, you've got the amount of light, and under the time.
The white line is a light from the planet, what astronomers call the light.
Now, when a platform goes through a planet, it's going to take a little bit of this light, and this transport is repeating the size of the nerve itself.
And so, for example, take the side.
Palestinian didn't do much bigger than it.
We're going to get to the radiation of one percent in the mortality of a planet.
The Earth, on the other hand, there's a 11th century ago, and the letter that looks like science.
So go back to our own restaurant.
A couple of years ago, the politicians went through the information and they discovered it from the planet that comes from CO2 and 682.
The drugs in Iraq 2009 was the first one that they needed, and they started talking about it in stories.
They said that savings like Congress and California like this in the planet, but they also said it's another.
You see, beyond the way we're just a few hours, and it's about almost a week.
They've also said that he's going to see an astronomy, which means that in the South Korea we've seen with a team, we've had a strategy that you can see from the left.
It looks like it's a situation that's going to know about this that what's going on in the way, and you're going to get the planet, there's nothing like a platform.
There's a few neurons that's going on, but for two years, it's been a weird.
And then in 2011, we see it.
The most star light has 15 percent of the water, and it's a tremendous tremendous tremendous tree, that's causing one percent.
We're looking at this plan as well as part of India.
It's also not a symmetric, when there's a emotional finger that's going on for almost a week, and then it's going to return back into a few days.
And then, after that, it's not a lot of happening in 2013.
Things start to be really crazy.
There's a tremendous and complexity in the city of the light that's affected, and they're left for something like a hundred days, all the way up to the end of the page.
Fields have different forms.
Some of us are living, and some space, they also have different values.
A couple of programs for years, we're learning, and a few more than a week.
And there's also a mirror of the top and down within some of these elephants, almost like a few events that were going to wear each other.
And at the same time, this planet is saving more than 20 percent.
It means that the woman who's published our light has more than 1,000 than the Earth.
It's really amazing.
And so the citizens, when they saw it, they were going to know the data that they found something different enough that maybe there was a year after.
And so when the scientific team looked at me, we were like, "Yes, there's probably something wrong with information."
But we really looked, really deep in science, and the data was good.
So what's going on was to be a physical asteroid, which means something in the space of the procedures the planet.
And so at this point, we've been able to learn everything that we're going to be able to see if we can figure out all the way from what's going on.
And the science citizens who helped us in the age of our age, they joined a restaurant in science in science.
First, someone said, you know, what if this planet is really young, it's still pushing a material that's too easy.
And then somebody else said, well, what if the planet has already created patients, there are two of these refugees that came up, exactly what to the event that created the Earth and the moon.
Well, these two theories could explain some of the information, but the other one was that the planet didn't show people a young man, and it wasn '
And so someone else said, well, what do you take to a couple of robots that go to the planet on a very optimism?
Well, it turns out that it's actually working with our drugs.
But I agree, it feels very little to the summer.
You see, it's just about hundreds of robots to replace what we see.
And they're just sitting in a case where they're going to be built between the planet.
And so in reality, we're talking about thousands of tons of robots.
But from all the bad ideas we had, it was the best.
And so we've gone and we've published our find.
Now, let me tell you, this was one of the most exciting Americans I've ever wrote.
Scientists are supposed to publish results, and this situation was far away from it.
And so we decided to give me there, and we'd read a kid: "Where's the French?"
I'm going to give you to understand the head of the house.
And so it's not the end of the story.
I've been around for a time that I wrote this article, and I met with my colleagues, Johnson Darwin, and he also wrote a article on the data of France.
And he said that with the extreme point of France, he could actually identify more and repeat around stars, but he didn't.
And then I saw not the strange information that our citizens grew up, and he said to me, "So, I'm sorry.
Now I have to write the material. "
So yes, the nature of nature was a space, and now we were experiments.
So we had to find a way to send back back.
So together, we've convinced that we've been working in SETI, the monitor has been reduced, which would be the goal for us.
We've wrote a procedure to look at the planet with the largest TV categories in Egyptian.
A few months later, innovation on the traffic and I've now got thousands of Americans, more than 10,000 Americans, on this planet.
And if you're looking at Google images, it's what you find.
Now, you might be wondering today, OK, Texas, well, how do we actually return this light?
Okay, well, imagine civilization is much more than us.
In these beautiful reasons, this civilization represents all the energy of their home, so where can they get energy?
Well, they have a planet like our sun, and so if they're able to go more energy from this planet, then it would be more likely to be their energy.
So they'd be building more.
In these clouds, like tremendous clinicians, are called San Francisco.
This photograph over is a lot of the countries of San Francisco.
It's really hard to provide a good perspective of these things, but you can think about it.
The street between the Earth and the ice is 4,000 miles.
The most simple artist on one of these structures are growing 100 times more than that.
They're tremendous.
And now imagine one of these structures in a movement around the planet.
You can see how it was a product that's been produced in science like microbes and not natural.
But there's still even a more concept of refugees can't improve the physics.
You see, everything that's using a lot of energy that's made, and we're not looking at it.
But it can be something just like they're teaching it in another direction, just not the Earth.
The other idea that he's one of the favorite people is that we've built a strong bar between the Palestinian devil and the French Street.
Now, I hope it was a lot of resources that we don't see.
But if we're already using refugees in the suffering, so who can't say that they don't have the whole galaxy to the galaxy?
So you can see how it takes the imagination quickly.
Well, here's you.
We're in a situation that can become a natural phenomenon that we don't understand or a recent technology that we don't understand.
People, like scientists, my money on nature.
But don't look at me wrong, I think it would be amazing to find back.
Anyway, there's something really interesting to find.
So what's going on?
We need to continue to look at this planet to prevent what's going on.
But asteroid astronomers, like us, we've got limited resources to this kind of thing, and we're going to go to another task.
And I'm glad to tell you that again, scientists in Iraq have taken the day.
You see, this time, astronomers live with the telescopes in the ocean started to watch a planet in their hands, and I'm so excited to see what they find.
What's amazing to me is that this planet has never been found by computers because we're just not just looking for something like this.
And what's more exciting is that there's more information that you need to get.
There's a new task that comes from millions of stars to all the sky in the sky.
And just thought: What would you be the meaning when we found a planet like this?
And what would it mean if we didn't find more like this?
Thank you.
Thank you.
People who go back to work after the park in the morning -- I call them "new scientists."
These are people that we've developed the career to treat adults, or biofuels, to make people still or because of disease.
They're very similar to other people who live beyond: regret, hospital, patients, people who've been released back from the revolution that are people who come back in the hospital.
It's hard to go back to the work after the party because of the business between the "new scientists."
Scientists might think that genes of people with "The" holes "in the" room "is from a dangerous way, and people in the French can go around and play the career, especially if they didn't work a long time.
This problem is the problem that I'm trying to solve.
"Scientists" that we've been able to find everywhere.
It's these Africa.
It's a typical philosophy of five seconds to be at home with five minutes of our children.
The communication in Singapore wrote recently about nurses that come back to work after a long career.
And if you're talking about long-term, it's an artist.
It's a social worker from California in California, who's returned to work as a social worker after 25 years of the French.
That's the faster career I know.
The Social Francisco of the Syrian Francisco and I'm going to take five seconds in her career.
And that's the Twitter Syrian Francisco, the French of 13 years.
It's been published in the President's "President" School "for people to come back to work.
Twitter wrote that she was if someone liked to be in home, but she made, and he had to go back to work and he also love to work.
Twitter did what most of us do when we feel that we had a good day in a job.
It's a fear that we've been looking at the drugs and I think it's led to the last two months in the network, and in the network of work, but no results.
I met the Twitter in 2011, when the plan was hard to work with it to see if I could help.
The first thing I said to TV is that it should go out of the house!
I told her she needed to publish her work, and tell everyone about her need to come back to work.
I told her, "You're going to have a lot of conversations that don't lead to water.
We're going to find it, and don't give me a head of it.
And we've been a great courage in the end of Brothers and Bill Bill and get a business opportunity. "
I'm going to tell you what's going on with Twitter, but I want to share with you a discovery that I've discovered when I've come back to work after the French 11 years.
And that's, in other weeks, your progress will be in time.
I mean, when you start to create a connection with people and come back to be with people from the past, people who worked with them, they'll remember you as I was going to work.
Even if your own sense of self is thinking with the time, as we're going to happen to many of us, as we're looking out of our professional identity.
So for example, you might think of yourself as somebody who looks like this.
That's me, after a long day.
And here I'm in the kitchen.
But these people from the past, they don't know about anything.
They remember how I was, and it's a big story to come back to be on them, and to hear their answers back to work.
There's one thing, which I remember in my privacy and my privacy.
And that's where I've built the business rate.
My journey is in Fines, and I've been working on the new rate of news at all, when I was in a small house in the future of small children.
So I've been afraid I'm going to see work and I'm going to start talking about a company that doesn't exist.
So I did a model for "Wall Street" and I read all of us for six months, until I felt that I was going to try what happened in the business world.
I believe that "information" they need to have the work, and that's why.
Think about our stage in life: for those of us who have the galaxy of children have less, or we don't have a free freedom for hope.
We already did it.
We've got less just two years of Bennia.
We think more in life.
We've got a piece of work.
We have a better perspective.
We're not "Look at ourselves" on the business table.
And we also have energy, and we're going to go back to the work because we're going to be here.
On the other side, I'm afraid with business and there's two issues that have to do with the business of "new scientists."
The first one is, business and worry that "scientists didn't have technology.
And by the way, as someone was like this in the past, it's a very available situation.
My philosophical "I wrote so long," I used "to" 123 "."
I don't even know if anybody remember so far, but I'd like to study it on Alice.
It wasn't really hard, many features are identical.
"Paul Paul Pacific" was a faster, but now I use it all the time.
I'm saying all the "information" that the experiments expect them to come to the office with the axis.
And if they don't know, it's after you're interested.
And they do it.
The second version of the business is that the return to work doesn't know what they want to do.
I'm saying that the remote workers they need to work hard, to know if their imagination and their skills changed or not, at the hour they were at the end of the career.
It's not the business role.
It's after the responsibility of the recent workers to show the business where they can transform the most.
In 2010, I've been asked for something.
I've been working after a plan back to the work of 2008, and in 2010, I started to pay attention to the leadership of science work, between whether it called it's not, but the experience that it's like the plants, a way to people who are going to go back to work.
I saw there's "Los Angeles" and "10 to me" opening the brain programs for the back of the work.
I saw what's going on and repeat, a remote mote and not a iPh.D., access to the field, and one's "because you've got a crime.
I saw two universal university engineers to support the managers in the middle of the career.
So I wrote a "Life on what I saw, and it became the U.S. Eric Richard School" called "The 1940s."
I've got to be through ways about this capacity, and also on this real work that you can see from 40 to 40 times in young plants.
And then, I'd go to the business news of Pennus, they'd read to another "The 1950s."
And so for the biggest physical societies have a program back to work for microscopes that go back to the market.
And so many people have been participated.
They're these animals in peace, and people who are dealing to the office and make good skills.
And now, seven of the biggest engineering companies do political plan for the engineers who come back to work as part of time with the engineering organization.
Why are companies from the governments of the plants to come back to work?
Because the strengths allows the business to get on a real job and not a series of random, and the business doesn't have to make a physical decision of the development.
This conference is reducing the risk of risk that has to be part of the business, and they're constantly awesome that become interesting work.
Think how much the data is.
Before that, most of the experiments didn't have been interested in work with "new scientists."
And maybe, not only do you have a developed program from a specific thought of reducing back to work, you can't get deep to these programs if you don't have "the" holes of life. "
It's an artist for real change, to move it from real institutions, because if we can solve this problem for back to work, we can solve it for others.
In fact, my business business told me that their programmers were going to grow out of the military training on their own plants to go back.
And there's no reason that there's no plan for regulation.
In a different way, the same idea.
So I'm going to tell you what's going to happen to TV.
Remember that she had to tell anybody that she had to go back to work?
Well, one important conversation with the choice where the community has to succeed: invisible disease.
But it was a liquid teacher.
The company said that there's a possibility that it's going to become a larger role, but without paper.
It was in 2011.
Twitter love this company and love the people and the bridge was close to her home.
So even though she had a success in a different society, she decided to take a risk with the opportunity for good.
Well, at the end, it's disappeared about all their expectations and society didn't just become a budget, at the beginning of 2012, but they've become the traffic for more interesting ideas, because they're going to know with the Twitter Twitter.
And we're going to go forward to 2015, Twitter and Mexico.
They're ready to learn from Western Western to MMA.
It's even known as "information" that you've been working for.
The investment of Twitter was just like the plants, and eventually it was a right for Twitter and also for her business business.
Now, my goal is to bring the idea of return to work more and more business.
But at the same time, if you go back to work after a career, don '
Their first success story can be an example of "information" again, "and let's work with you.
Thank you.
[Thank you.]
One of the problems in writing, the work of the Internet is very difficult to separate between opinion and equal change.
And to understand, I want to go back to 1835.
In 1835, Congress January looked at the first French of New York City.
It's going to start with it -- 500, two to about 1,000 today's dollars.
Over 15 years later, in 1850, to do the same -- start what's going to get a quarter and a 32 million dollars.
Two, 22 million, 15 years.
The Internet makes this change.
And that's what I want to talk about today, and it's about the connection to developing a group.
We've started a problem, and we've seen a high school river that's opened up to create data, and a culture, which led to a public model between products and products -- that we've got to grow a money, like any industrial organization and industrial energy -- to make a difference out of a certain group of industrial industries.
The concept that's "Science" or "the economist" or "the economy" "has been used for a long time after the industrial revolution," in fact, to understand what's going on today that's happening.
It was a industrial industry: products had to find a way to pay money to pay them 22 million dollars, and one's going to fly, and to the radio, to TV, and eventually to the center of the center.
That means that there were a different based on the government, you're in the government's government, depending on the same system, and that's how information is going to be created in the next 150 years.
Let me tell you a different story. In the environment of 2002, in the world of a computer world was a result.
For the first time, we created the most important thought of the NNAC, and we got the United Nations, and about two years of this -- by the way, we put the platform that the computer can do.
Everything's "is going to disappear from the fact that all of the same time on the other world:" TI. "
Number 44 million users use the world, new power and more, when the computer doesn't work, by making their resources to create a thought about trees that will be going to start the data that comes from a story.
This photograph is motivated on the extreme change in which you become a piece of information, China. No one has less problems in the president -- that's got less money -- but I've been reduced on it, I've been reduced. Every one of us, in the economy, in the economy, there's a computer that's a computer.
It's a very different human in the middle of the network.
And the new capacity, or communities and communities are actually building all kinds of connected -- and these are the basic economic economic tools that need to create information, and more culture, we've built about 600 million people around the world.
I mean, for the first time since the industrial revolution, the most important inventions -- the components of economics -- remember, I'm in the economics of the most amazing economic economic economies, and there's a lot of food, and it's different from all we've seen since the industry we've seen since the industrial Revolution,
Anybody trying to replace someone in work, I'm trying to transform my own someone else's own, without a connection to the medical school, can't help what he knows, what's going to happen in some reasons.
That's what we're living, and every one of us is going to go back in this problem to create when it's going to reduce this machine.
What's the effect of this? The story that most people know is the failure of open-source program.
It's the second sense of the Egyptian network -- one of the only two species in a network of a network.
In 1995, people are changing a mistake, "The network is really important! You need a better service!"
One group were in a group of organizations that just decided, really need it, because there's such a planet, and what's going to do about it -- and others can develop.
The second was a oil microscope.
I'd like to tell you that 10 years of "because, the restaurant of the organizations that didn't control anything from what's going on, when 20 percent of the change represents the human beings, it was amazing!
Think in Monnan. It's a group of engineers at the end of a week in Titana.
But in fact, of course, the story is that 70 percent, including the main website for Twitter and 70 percent of our lives lives on them and communication products in a network that's going to happen to Mexico, not as a civilization strategy -- a social strategy to try to transform some of the Internet.
In a program, you can't see it, because it's too, but the dream is to see that it's happening all the network.
At some point, I'm going to try with the images of the cells that I wanted to watch. They'd say, instead of three and three years, I've been doing it all the time, and we've got this to the Internet, and we'll see if people, using the web, we've done in the web, we've
If there's somebody who's a little girl, and it's a plane for -- well, not very small, building -- that's a study of research on the country.
And it comes to the university, one of the first politicians.
That's what you've found on in the country. It's what's hard, there's nothing beyond definition, including "now more than you're doing, a lot more than a lot of us -- products in our country, like this choice." "" It's a
And yet, it's not just how the products create content, it's about how it's created.
Jamie's published because the business work -- especially, now not -- the business work to build websites and say -- if they're in the ocean, they're on the other side, it's what 60,000 pounds are produced in the open project. "Everybody who's ready to invest in something that's ready
And it's not just outside of the galaxy. What's the most important innovation in Google?
The innovation became: instead of engineers and experts who said what's called the more relevant, we're going to find a story what you're used to pay, from any reason that it's wrong, you're going to say, you're going to have children and their friends.
And again, here's in New York Times, but also, I'm in America, I'm in America, a picture in every big, a culture that's not easy for disease, that don '
That's all part of the creative creativity, relevant, human beings.
But remember, computers are also physical. Just physical materials -- our computers, we're participating in them.
Once in the room was one person in a device, and there was only a certain region, and it had to decide if we got a human beings.
We're now looking at computers and so generous that develop algorithms to allow the data to allow them to have another project that this public network will be able to build cities from the solution: when I'm listening to you, I can help you to help. When you don't help. You don't help.
It's not an intuitive version. It's an example that at least in some places in the United States, water, at least for public security.
And I said in 1999, let's build a system of information system.
The system that's going to travel in robots, there's been a 24-hour, seven hours a week every day in the world.
You're going to support a thousand users using any time that it's going to be deep in the face: the first ocean, virus, to control the prices of first. You've been special that it's going to be a few years.
But of course, I'm going to describe a PPPP.
It seems to us as a music, but principles, it's a relationship of information, where, in general reasons, are ready to share a relationship in the relationship, to create.
What we're actually seeing is the cost of a lot of many reasons, once there's a place that you can share. Mexico Sweden, I'm not based; and I'm looking for countries.
The stupid system was from a different university system.
If energy improves the eyes, there's companies for who want to go into the market -- or governments are sometimes more unusual than they're not in different institutions.
And a group of weird creatures were too expensive, active activity in the society -- against the company.
It was actually economic.
But now it's the fourth method of coffee and part of a group of days.
Not the first time you do things and some others, how social creatures. It's doing all the time.
But for the first time there's a central economic revolution.
It's a regular feedback.
It's too much to wear lights, as in the system.
It's open to all create and to share, if you want to come with others, because equality is one person.
But there was no life.
Instead, you're seeing a group of reasons for all the important things, which we use in the building and in this room. It's going to go to these interesting questions, a very interesting investment for some goal, from a memory to some goal -- remember, money and I'm always the most effective science.
Anyone who's serving 50 years later with friends, they don't reduce the risk of time again.
And if we don't do that, think about intuitive relationships.
And in particular, what you see in the dream.
There's a human workers in their prison.
There's a lot of time.
Now, you're the same problem, you can share experiences, and the motivation is important.
Five minutes, instead of seeing TV?
Five minutes knew because it's interesting.
Because that's fun. Because it's interesting and meaningful sense, or, in a much more interesting case, like New York City, you can be a social message.
It's a new social phenomenon.
It's dead; it's in general, when you're a piece of competition.
Secondly, we're going to push the political industrial industry, open-source programs and open-source states, to try and potential politicians on telephone communities, New York City represents with local politics.
But it's also a new opportunities for business.
When you're going to be the genetic system, you're going to have new opportunities, there's some new opportunities.
Instead of building different devices and driving it -- things that you can watch -- building open tools. There's a new group of values. It's a new system of what people do.
It's a place where we're going to change action.
Like California, like the French project, in places, and it's also changing.
And to the women, you see that it's happening, you create a kind of kind of chapter, you're in particular.
Remember: things will be known as human beings.
It gives me something that I need, and I'm going to take the screen with somebody.
It's very scary -- it's a reality of Google.
That's what IIBM does in software services, we're going to have a success.
So a group of creatures is work, not a smoke.
It's the real change that made the Internet, and it's far away.
The relationship is a group of things that are used to be more economic phenomenon, often because of the information quality, bringing the right person, on the right business. It's a big day. It's very quickly.
But -- and that's the fabulous side -- it's a person -- that's in the same way -- by the other industries.
When you opened up a newspaper, you'll see an intuitive future, and it's about a phone communication, it's not something small.
It's about the future of freedom to make social creatures.
Because here there's a concept that there's a couple of people who would be the industrial economy and continue, maybe our new economy has to evolve and the industry, and to change the way we look at the world.
Thank you.
Here's two reasons why companies are failed: they're just doing more of us, or they're just doing what's new.
For me, the key solution to growth quality is to understand the food between two activity: a civilization.
They're sad, but it can be too much a good thing.
Think about Patto.
I'm actually enough food to remember them.
Patto was a great company.
They've been born in the past forest, and they've done the best matters in the world.
Everybody used them.
And what's a prototype did when the electronic computer works?
They used to do exactly the same thing.
Within six months, they're going to take out of the institutional income.
And they disappeared.
It's about it.
In the meaningful theory of the story of Palestinian is to hear about the engineers of Pattos, change in Brazil, small computers in the way they used to go back and look back and build their computers.
So Paul did too much.
But it's also a study that can come.
A couple of years ago, I was working in a collaborative collaboration and social social and physics.
Let's call them a video.
The company was from America.
They've had water that's safe to look, even to see, certain kinds of cancer.
Every day, there was something new.
They were very different, and the goal was, "When we do it right," or even, "we want it perfect."
What the design is, before they become perfect -- even good enough -- they're not relevant.
I don't do too much research.
I've heard the first time on my room and I've heard about 15 years ago, when I've been working in the university University.
The idea of the idea is Jim Mermes.
And for the power of the idea is my industry.
Life.
A meaningful study, come with something new.
It's on a month, it's about discovery, it's about new products, it's about the months.
It's about our global change.
Our heroes are people who have done monkeys: Oh, from New York, Philius, and Larry Street Museum, and so on.
I'm in Germany; all our heroes are black, and they're called to be like this.
We all know that sensors are dangerous.
We don't know the answers, we don't know if we're going to find them, and we know the risks are high.
And the side is the opposite of it.
And it's going to take the knowledge that we have, what we know to do better, better.
And it's got to make our culture to try in time.
It's going to make our products faster.
And I'm going to take a risk -- in the short concept.
But if we're just successful, it's very dangerous in the long term.
And I think we've all got a privacy to be a parasite that's going to keep the same poems over and over and over and over again, until they're doing women or even solutions.
It's our risk of evolution.
So if we take a good perspective for a long time, we're exploring.
If we take a good perspective for a short time, we find.
The little kids live every day.
Every day it's on a room.
When we're older, we're exploring less because we've got more and more effective.
Because it's "for companies.
My friends did a plane, less innovation as they did more places.
And it's obviously, it's very worrying the CO2.
And I hear often questions that are based on different ways.
For example, "How can I manage our society also reinvent it?"
Or, "How can I make sure that our society is changing before we're dealing from something?"
So to do a good one.
To do the two good things together, it's art -- pushing their room and what they're doing.
So one thing we've found is that only two percent of the companies are able to explore and cooperate in the same time, in the model.
But when they do that, the telescope is another.
So we have a lot of interesting examples.
We've got Syla and a San Francisco, we've got the Gullo into a tragedy, Tonya and created the bicycle, and California's going to have a lot of examples -- there's a lot of examples, and they're still still.
Why is the food so hard?
I think it's hard because there's so many cars that leave us in the place where we're in.
So I'm going to talk about two, but there's many.
So let's talk about the 30-month program.
We find something, but we don '
So instead of stay with this, we create something new.
But as "for that, so we're in the galaxies of actually alone with ideas but to be trained.
I'm not a good example.
A famous example is, of course, it's a virus.
But we don't see it just in companies.
We see it in the public sector.
We're all known to all kind of a great medicine in education, research, health and even security, take 10, 15, maybe 20 years to work.
But we still change much more.
We really don't give them the opportunity.
Another training is the success plan.
Pattos were treated to the success plan.
They've really returned the future in their hands, but they can't see it.
They were just so good at doing what they loved to do, that they didn't have to change.
We're like that.
When we know something good, it's hard to change.
Bill Gates said, "The success is a bad teacher.
It makes us think we can't be failed. "
This is the challenge of success.
So I think there's a few decades, and they're part of us.
And they're part of our companies.
The first lesson is: We had the crisis.
And every company that's capable of a new company that's capable of actually capable of looking at the future.
And Netflix -- they'll be so easy to be treated with the data of a piece, but they're always -- and I think they're always -- and it's going to push the next.
I see other companies that say, "I'm going to win the next region of sensors, and no matter what's called."
Second: Think of time in park.
I'm going to share with you a culture, and I think it's wonderful.
Each company that's looking at it, as you take a good perspective of one year and look at the second system of society, innovation in a general way for 30 percent.
So when we think about one year, innovation is not really important.
And yet, we'll take a good perspective of 10 years on the same society -- at least, innovation can feel valuable in 70 percent.
But companies can't choose.
They need to invent the journey to the long term.
Three: We invited a connection.
I don't think it's possible for somebody who's been able to be able to be able to have a civilization for ourselves.
I think it's a little narrative.
I think we've got to make sure.
I think the life of a big company is to be open-up to a gender, and the animal's life of a good organization is an adult.
I think it's also a good feedback.
Last: The experiments in success.
Maybe it's used to be used to look back on the steps of a very healthy, when the conditions are, after a big, we're going to reduce their wind.
When they go to very close in their car, they'll always have a child who's thinking about their food, "remember, you're most people."
So I hope that I've got the point: not the food of the room and the creation has a huge amount of information.
But it's hard, and we need to be aware.
I want to succeed on two questions that I think are useful.
The first question is, when you look at your company: Let's see that the company in the risk of the success plan, of just go on a plane.
And what can you do to challenge?
Second question is: I studied something new recently, and what kind of impact was it about?
Is it something that I have to do more?
In my case, yes.
So let me leave you with this.
Whether you're studied of your nature or if you're going to find out what you're already know. Don't forget: The beauty is in the food.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So there's a few features that live on the Earth itself that they're based on human beings in every country, but we've survived all that.
My ancestors were right, when they thought they would be French and they're in the neighborhood, they're going to do a way to not know better possibilities.
And as the offspring of those countries, our buildings also make it the same day of our ancestors.
But at the same time, when I was talking about our fight and our cameras and we're going to agree in one of the second, we're going to see that we've forgotten the answer to explore and find new places.
I, like, we've developed a special way for the Earth, on Earth and on Earth, and we're so excited about what our experience is that we're not just business to figure out that the resources don't have stories, and even our sun't end.
While we're seeing and all the movies that we've done by renewing the basis of the journey to the outside space, a few of us really understand that our species are not ready for a long restaurant to space.
Let's go out to your national forest for this speed.
So in the back of this strategy: How many of you think you're going to be able to survive in this privilege for a few days?
Well, it's a lot of you.
What about a few weeks?
It's like a journalist.
What about how many months?
It's also beautiful.
Now, let's imagine that this forest is a wind and wind.
How many questions: How many of you think you can survive some days?
It's a lot.
What about a few weeks?
For Time Street, let's imagine that the only place that has been available to human beings, and molecules underneath the surface.
The identity material in what they're so few times until there's no power, and of course, almost not the atmosphere.
And these examples are just a little bit of the challenges that are always aware of, about stars like Mars.
So how do we illustrate ourselves for their eyes are so scared from a parasitation?
Would we send a fair of the Earth's planet?
And at the top of a space, we're an unimpossible model of some arguments that connect the planet?
And how do we grow things like food that grow on Earth?
But I'm dealing very quickly.
In our journey of our species to find a new house under a new sun, it's very likely to have a lot of time in self-journey, in space, on the cortex, less than the metaphor, you might have for many decades.
The worst time in a human being in space is like 124-months.
On the animals of asteroids in space, we know that at the time with democracy and biography is meaningful between itself, New York City and toilets, and other reasons from the physical physics to psychological psychology.
And what about Antarctica, or another country in the power of the planet that's found ourselves?
Basically, our Muslim journey will be serious in the systems that we're also inevitable.
And so far as we're going to have the new machine technology that's the next robot as part of the value that's safe and satisfying our species in space.
As much as they're wonderful, I believe that it's time to replace the same technologies with what nature is already invented: the micro-human organism that's going to feel itself, the only machine.
There's a little bit of relationship to children itself, which allows a lot of use of design and networks to be carried in Palestinian animals.
The price of the research that allow us to take the capacity of the microbial and know as a small biology.
It's about biological biological biology, which is going to have autonomy, experiences, and better ways to understand the physical oceans of human body.
By using the tools of the Chinese biology. We can make the genes of almost every organism, a microscope or not, very quickly and amazing art.
In the limits of the machines that we've actually been the person's disciplines, biology will be a way for us to try and not just our food, our voice and our environment, but also ourselves so that we can look at our physical disciplines and make our survivors in space.
For example, what we're using the Chinese biology to space, let's go back to the environment from people.
The list of the human beings are going to Africa in India, with kinds of organisms to organize organisms.
Let's say, phanthropy, what if we're a threat can actually support remote plants without using food materials from the Earth?
The first question we're probably going to have to ask, how do we do our plants are going to happen?
Because, in average, the temperature in human cells is about 60 degrees of time.
The next question we need to think is, how do we make our plants to stand up?
At the moment, most of the water in the cells are making a faster light than I can say the word "mathematicians."
Well, it turns out we've already done things like this.
By the end of the regulation of genes and President and President and President Guinistan are leading to other experts like Iraq and then to transform them into plants that need them, we've now got plants that can go to the public and Canada.
They know in the Earth's Earth, or genetic organisms, and we're looking at them to get all the noises of human civilization.
The nature does things like this, without our help.
We've just found ways more countries to do this.
So why would we want to change the genetic car of plants in space?
Well, not to do that means that we need to try and there's no story about a new platform that's been reduced by a trillion galaxies of galaxies and then build a tremendous rights to get it all.
It's a device that doesn't offer me that comes from the top of the car that's known as a huge task.
One of the best ways to make sure we're going to have food and light that we need is to bring us organisms that we've tried to get to new environment.
Basically, use organisms of engineers to help change the platform and also in the long term.
These organisms can also be what we're trying to create climate drugs.
So we can use the Chinese biology to bring plants from engineering us, but what can we do?
Well, I mentioned data so we, like, we've evolved in terms of the Earth.
The fact that I didn't have changed in the last five minutes where I've been there and I've been there.
And so, if we'd take each of us on the moment, even with food enough, I'm just here, we're probably going to live in the health problems that are very unaware of the countries that represent the surface of people like people who have the atmosphere and the atmosphere.
It's if we're going to stay in a room underneath all of our communities on every new patient, we have to find better ways to protect ourselves and get a situation that we're born in a situation that's got to have something about your body, or we're going to have to get out of your body behind the city.
So let's go to the nature of a chair.
On the wealth of life on Earth, there's a group of organisms that know as an asteroid, or the environmental environments, if you remember biology of the right.
And these organisms have electrodes called New York Times.
It's known in the capacity to stand in the morning, and again, red, and the most invisible we've seen, green.
While the statement of California know, we still didn't invite the relevant genes to the universe.
It's not really simple.
There's a lot of drugs that go into California, and it's not just like getting one gene.
But in a little bit of human inventions and a little bit of time, I think it's also not very difficult.
Even if we're asking just what its ability to go to California, it's going to be good at the lights of what we have now, it's just our city.
In using these tools of digital biology, we can find the capacity of the New York City City to get under the New York City that was different.
How hard it's hard to see, there's Facebook, which is people, evolve every day, and yet you're going to evolve.
A thousand years of human evolution can't just take people like Tim, which can be carrying under the person's conditions, but also organizations, that can be able to go to the Arabic, the most atmosphere that can kill.
Every day, the human body opens up by random instructions that in the same country seem to allow people to stay in a huge human life.
But, it's a big, but it's like evolution and a network that may not have too much, we're going to be able to afford ourselves, and they've learned time.
In our ancestors to find our species in the universe, maybe we don't always have the time that we've got natural evolutionary evolution of other groups to survive in the NASA.
We're living in what we're doing. We're going to try to China because the body's body's skin, in the car we're dealing with genes like Syrian Francisco and Sydon't survive with many other extinctions.
But with every day, we're involved in the generation of serious evolutionary evolution, while all of us have the ability to decide ourselves for our genetic future.
Please improve the human body in new capacity is not a question of how, but of course.
So using Scott biology to change the genetic car of every single single organism, in the city of ourselves, including the normal questions and the babies.
Would the engineer itself do us less people?
But then, what is human if we don't say stars in the case that we have a list?
Where are the humanities take themselves?
It's clear that it's a little bit at the time that I'm going to sit down and be Muslims from it.
How do we use our own knowledge to protect ourselves in particular risks and then protect ourselves?
I'm doing these questions that I can't create the fear of science but to bring not to the many possibilities that science allows us to allow us.
We've got to go out as human beings to get the solutions not only with it, but also with courage.
It's very, but it's not our last one.
Our real story is that we have to half the decision what we can need to do with our national understanding of our species.
The space, Britain didn't exist.
Our way to stars will be full of women that will bring us to not just who we are, but where you're going.
Our answers were in our choices to use anticipate the technology that lost themselves, and it will define us to the rest of our universe.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay, so David: I'm always going to be in a strange way with prices.
I remember when I was watching the painting movies in the morning, I was going to get more than in a car, trying to figure out how they're trying to get into my head.
In the end, it's easy to work in my dreams.
I've become a big basis in New York City.
But then, all of this has changed at 23 times in France, 1997, when one of the young people in the head of the morning that happened in the face of the asteroid of the asteroid.
First of all, my family came back to Scott's camera, when we told us that one of the places, we're really going to have the opportunity to be separate from it, then numbers of researchers in the brain now what you've been looking for, for a metabolism, a life of the cells that are used to react with a traffic station.
It's actually my hero.
But a couple of years -- Applause) Yeah, come to me -- but how much this tragedy was a good thing for our family, I'm often thinking about how much worse it could be; in fact, how much worse it is to be so lucky every day that they're not so lucky -- sisters, sisters, sisters, sisters, sisters.
They don't all come to the countries.
In fact, most of them are not.
They're going to most of the relationships, in a country that comes to a situation where there's a real epidemic when it's a new situation.
So I was joined from my work in advertising to try to do something about the national sector, because I came to the point that the challenges to prevent violence in which they actually found out that we were trying to understand how to make people.
Just instead of doing it to sell products, do it to save life.
And it comes to find a common machine, where what I want to touch with what you want.
And you might be surprised to find, when it comes to violence, actually how much machine is.
Let's look, for instance, for example, people who like to exist, spread millions around the United States today.
It's a series of years.
In some places, the first day of the task is actually a free day of school.
What are the creatures want?
Okay, so they want to paint. They love their bees.
They're believe in the second building to live on these robots.
But it doesn't mean there's no machine.
In fact, there's a lot of us, and we're going to start with the basic idea of reducing these components of dangerous species.
It's not a matter of taking some years from all people.
It's still a matter of sending all of these people, and these are the people, it turns out, that we all agree that we don't need to have a different place: scientists are being used in families, they're going to have families.
We're all able to get out of how we're going to work in a very amazing way to feel certain species.
In 20 years, the rich building of insects that have been exposed to 2.4 million deaths and those people who all agree that we don't have to have a year.
And if you like a human beings, you probably don't have to be thousands of different machines every day that I've got to come up with these bad buildings, just like you don't have to have two years to go to Twitter -- one with one security and security.
And -- I'm like you, and the numbers show the amazing camera in the American public: 90 percent of the Americans know in the West's Center's Central Canada -- including 90 percent of the Foundation, more than 80 percent of the women, more than 80 percent of the National Act.
It's not a great idea of disease.
In fact, only six percent of the American public don't agree.
It's about one percent of the American public who believed that she was on the street was a body.
And it's also about one percent that believes that the government comes from a brain to a brain language in the TV change.
It's the training city of the training to the ground.
But what about 300 million people every year that are already in the house around the United States?
So first of all, it's important that this year is in buildings and in the homes of the genome people, which is far away, like you, you want what we all want -- can keep our families.
In fact, that's why more people choose to be a market.
Twenty-10 years ago, 42 percent of the American public public -- that's going to make the home better.
Today, this number is 63 percent.
Why?
I don't have to say that, because it's about the epic region, the little bit of the privacy, that if you say a big, enough times, in the end of the poetry becomes reality.
And this is exactly what happened here.
It's the word of corporation that's got a billion dollars to reduce the central center to build disease and can do research on the public health of violence; to get doctors to talk to the parents of every year in the house; to end up with every year's training technology; you're going to reduce a billion technology that's going to happen to be able to
They're going to kill the truth, because they're seeing the truth as a person to their bottom service.
And every day, people die as a result.
And many of these people are children.
Every day in the United States, 10 children are blind without a neighborhood.
[]]]] []]]]]]]]]]]]]]
And here's the thing: almost everyone with their parents.
Even a third of my parents' parents' parents' school are doing with each other from the house, including the tragedy called in Syria.
I get many of these parents; it's the most important part of my work.
These are not bad people.
They're just living with the results that don't give me a very bad decision, which has done on a very bad institution that's going to get there by very bad people, who know very well about the suffering that they're causing, but just don't care.
And the result is Scott -- not just in families like my own, but really, really, in the end of peace, all of us.
But I'm not here to talk about the basis that it's violence.
I'm here to talk about our dream, and that's part that we're all patients, which is the dream of a better future.
My organization, for Britain's campaign, the dream is changing in the goal to share the places in the United States in 2025.
And I hope to leave all of you here with a sense of exactly what this dream is to make sense of what we're doing.
Because friends, every big movement around the world, there's a moment that you can look back and say, "That's when things really started to change."
And I'm here to say that for the movement to finish the violence in the United States, this moment is here.
Thank you, we're obviously in a campaign, because the American public has been one in millions of times like no one had, on the end of the common machine, to say, "enough."
It's enough with the extinction of the microbes and I learned to move into schools.
It's enough with the local nation of violence in the streets and the streets that respond to women's lives and young men in the country.
It's enough with access to each other by the people we all agree that we don't have to have.
And enough a small group of politicians are less scared that put the interactions of corruption and to the face of the people that they're going to choose to represent.
It's enough.
And the really exciting thing is that it's not just the big changes, like us, say this.
It's so much bigger than that.
And if you want the power, let's start from where most conversations in the United States are starting -- with the day of Washington.
And here's the thing: It's not really a joke.
I mean, think about two issues.
It's when they go from being political issues to be part of the physical culture, communities that come from every place, from advertising that use their own interpretation, music, telescopes.
The NBA's Soviet.
You've been experts that you wouldn't have the code.
There's real change -- I even heard there's a TED Talk about this year.
It's the end where this culture is happening.
And yes, there's a decline that's been done in front of the heart of the response to 35 million workers in Twitter to a wireless city.
Let's take a look at the political choices from compassion.
It was the subject of Alexander who didn't touch me for democracy.
You wouldn't be able to talk from it very quickly.
Now my colleagues want me.
Some of them have to go back to them from very bad countries that they've been killed on them very much recently.
For someone like me, see people are surrounded by their voice in the NRA -- it's almost a Islamic story.
We're still doing a lot less, yeah, yes, repair to the old cortex, and eventually it needs to change.
But you know what?
We're safer and more difficult for us, and we've got the truth to our own.
And we're in a beautiful situation.
You know, you say that the Internet becomes the data.
The social media and some of all of the energy that every day is intuitive and emotional.
It allows us to show how 90 percent of the support is really called.
Sometimes I think about it -- you know, we meet too beautiful in millions, something like cell cells.
It allows us to start to protect -- and that's the bottom line -- to define that connection between what the American public wants to understand what our leaders do about it.
Over recently, the situation in Congress was that corruption from the other side, these two percent, on the advertising of our team in 10 and see one.
We're getting that situation completely.
After the last tragedy in San Francisco, the central Congress of the Congress.
We've got 15 years to Congress in 24 hours.
And you know what?
We've got a success on the wisdom and no one thought you'll see light in the next time.
We see a real movement to a part of the rich experience that's the rich door in the last decade.
It's obvious that one of the only dozens of the communication that I've been talking.
We've seen the historical activity of three or what.
They didn't go to the end of the end, but they're going to save life, because they're explicitly expanding the rivers of the river to the car that they didn't have before.
And we're stuck around the country -- we're not just waiting for Congress that's going to be almost the definition of injuries.
We're stuck around the country, a country after country, in the equality of human beings.
And you know what? We're laughing.
The Congress is almost always the last picture that's coming from the wrong side of history.
And when they understand, it's always true that the American public is dealing them.
And that's exactly what we're doing in this moment, while we're building this machine.
You know, recently, I got out of the beach to put a big person in a big group like this, even though a lot of less dead, and the woman who's listening to me in one of my favorite TV in all the times, "Man," Man, I've tried to get rid of the '60s.
And while I've been trying to think about how to finish my decades, I've been looking at her screen for a while, and it was probably that every time I did it, I saw someone in the office or in the office or at the same time and the human genes and the genes and the genes are not going to get rid of samples and samples and work.
And in the end of the thing started to me: I'm inspired to those of us who have the dream to get to violence.
I mean, think about how much the world has changed in a short time, how all these behavior we've ever thought to be normal, a windows -- a window even agriculture -- has become as simple as a human career, once they've become a conversation about our common machine.
That's the importance of the change that we have the potential to create around violence.
And that's my dream, maybe one day, what's an open TV service to show this horrible secret is violence, and it's just a future of children maybe we can imagine how much it looks like.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And in 2018, there's about 2.5 billion users in the world.
If we improve all these new mobile phones, they're just a little bit of a message that's built all the way around, and we'll get them into the streets, it's created about 85,000 money, and 85,000 million dollars of a month.
How can this paper go into the phone, and can we return it?
That's the same, money and they're actually just about 70 trials that create a average phone.
These can be part of different groups, different from the microbes are a blind program.
Social programs are in the late of 17 experiments that actually exist in the Earth are in many cases in the world and ready.
These experiments have a lot of genetic programs, create light, and molecules that become them to predict modern technologies.
In fact, out of the 17 kinds of quantum programs, telephones and electronics are using 16.
In smart phones, they're creating the color screen, scientists to learn to program, and make the families, between the rest of the things.
And yet, our lives as it is, these experiences from the ground is about how much of the most metric effects are.
Corps can find a lot, but in many cases, not economic didn't exist to find them in the regions and ready.
Many times, professionals have a method called a open-source memory that's been scared and space of land.
This theory is a wireless region of a living environment, and it's caused to the air pollution, what we're seeing on health and communities.
And another group of components in Mexico comes with risks and water risks: these are the same as new, money, patients, Canada, Gabban, Bill, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, Gabby.
We're also chimpanzees, data, Solya, and I'll play to create phones, and all this is a connection to a space around us, as well as the air music.
Chris is also coming with social problems, like a big scale of people and animals to face industrial activity, and many times, I'm a bad job.
Finally, there's a telephones and also a child, one of the main cases for climate change.
It's connecting our smart phones in a complex way to the big electronic problem.
More than that, the ingredients that we know to create our phones are not inevitable.
One day, they're just glad, and we still didn't grow effects for some of them.
However, the number of stars have been found in a statement; until 2019 cities that are only three billion of them will be used.
It means that repeat the production within our phones become the extinction.
So, if you have a mobile phone, you might want to think about your possibilities before you get it.
In order to reduce the savings, maybe you're going to take it to a new use, and we'll take it to the center of the space, we're looking for a company that's different molecules.
However, even companies have to go under the great rights.
It's just like the telephones come with social problems and environments, so also stories.
The electronics is sometimes reduced to countries where it's going to be, but it's not the work on bees.
Social forces, many times including women and children, who can get a service on it, they don't have the traffic to solve the phones in the security, and they're afraid to experiment as privacy, that can meet in their nervous system.
The philanthropologists can also get to a big website, where it's a big skill into the water and the water, and that's how you change the problems in the village and something comes.
Tphone is much more than what it looks like on the surface.
It's a collection of multiple institutions, which are related to the effects of the world's country.
So, until someone comes from a very, very, very, we need to deal with how technology affects places and people.
There's 200 million teachers and children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children '
I want to talk to you about experiments for malaria.
These are the ones we've created so simple isn't enough.
Why?
We're working on it for over a hundred years.
When we started, technology was very limited.
And we can see a very little bit of the real and the real treatment of the disease.
Today, we've got a very similar technology, a set of biological research in biological biological molecules -- leadership, atmosphere, metaphor.
All of these are the eyes that we're going to have a faster form of this treatment.
Even though that, our method to solve more experiments in institutions.
In order to create a good experience, we need to go back and understand how our bodies deal with this complexity.
People who are listening to the galaxy as high as a place to deal with it.
They're building a disease, but they're not a hospital.
That's what it is.
My team took this complexity, and exploring it with African genomes that were left on the malaria to answer the question: "How do you see a complex response of genes?"
We've found more than 200 proteins, that many of them can't be able to create experiments for malaria.
It might be our research community and the half of the treatment.
Over recently, when someone is a important protein, they're exactly if it can work as a vaccine by design.
It's in "Because it's about 300 participants in Africa, which are tags that have taken together to see whether they've found leaders to the building where we've been built in our country in the local city.
In the last 30 years, a little bit of proteins and these experiments in small tolerance and relationship to most of us instead.
The results don't work.
My team's team is 30 years of this kind of stupid stupid at one point that's going to go a little bit more than three months.
For the first time in history, we've collected 10,000 times, from 15 different species, in seven African countries, over time, people in different cases and the different energy of the California in Africa.
We've used our knowledge of biological molecules to transform political proteins, to collect them in the lab, and we've created the treatment of the galaxy for Chicago.
We did it in Africa, and we're proud of it.
Now, the Chicago is a little bit of rights, but it's interesting to me as tremendous power.
In one study, we've collected information about over 100 big responses.
What are we looking for?
You're going to have to respond to a complexity response, because we can reduce what can be a very successful experience for malaria.
In addition, we're trying to find out what biologists do.
How do they make it?
Would they turn out in a few minutes? Is there a person in their hands?
What's our amount of genes need?
Our studies show that a small amount of diversity in the body doesn't enough.
It may be that there's a high way that we've got a lot of digital proteins.
We're going to learn, that biologists are killing the treatment in a variety of ways, and the black hole of each of them will not change the reality as well.
When we're able to see the most expensive treatment now, our team and I'm trying to figure out how our bodies overcome this complexity.
We believe that these two groups can provide a little bit of the way we need to become the disease to prove, with effective experiments.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Philippines: We're just at the beginning of trying to figure out what to be in China before we can start making it.
So we're not really close to the end of creating China, but we're in a way.
SP: And we're full of hope.
PM: It's actually full of hope.
SP: I'm going to tell me about SART, what are the first of my home and why is it important to you?
PM: SART is the first three features of research in I.D..
The parents are treated with us in Africa, which look at this side and cooperation, biology to the images that America is Europe and solve the problem, and there's a lot of power in Africa.
So in SART, outside our goal, to develop a China for malaria, we're training African scientists, because the diseases in Africa are very high, and we need to solve the limits of science in Africa.
SP: Yeah, right.
Thank you, a last question.
Tell me, I know I've mentioned this day, what's really changed when there was a vaccine for malaria?
PM: I've got a life of half a million people.
200 million patients will be healthy.
The systems that the malaria is going to Africa 12 billion dollars every year.
So it's a economist.
Africa's just a thrive.
SP: Well. Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So, there's a player called the President President.
And a couple of years ago, he created this film that some of you may have heard about, called "The Gabby."
And there's two main groups in this movie.
The first one is our exhibitions.
I'm not talking about the night.
And the second one is to take us by the adult guy, and as a young woman, the adult guy says one word, just one word.
And of course, you all know what the word is.
He's "plastic."
And the only problem with this is, it was a completely different tree.
So let me tell you why it's a gene.
The word has to be "Sylin."
And the reason that it had to be Sylin is because the basic tricks are going to learn to the disease that we've already been doing, and they've already built them.
So the Sydney California in 1967, when this film was released.
There's a year after the film was released, Italy.
So if the adult would hear the right word, maybe it would come to the stage -- I don't know -- maybe with these two.
And so when you think about it, let's see what a tree might like to give you so that your next adult doesn't become an Africa.
And so in 2015, what would you be a tree for people, when you would take a great adult and then say one word, just one word?
I think the word would be "The life of life."
So what's life? "
And the life of life is the different ways that we have to program life.
So instead of making computers, we use things to plan theories or proteins or DNA DNA or animals, or customers of creatures.
And when you think about the amazing capacity to make life what you want to do, what they're going to do, what they're going to do, what you're doing in the end of something that we've done for thousands of years, which is to do, to do, to get all kinds of animals of life, and we're very happy.
And it's not something new.
Now this simple part is different so that if you change it in one way, you get Berkeley.
And if you change it in another way, you get a voice.
And if you change it in three years, you get lights.
So when you go to these organisms, you're really going to learn where people change the lives of plants for a long time.
The difference today, to choose politics and TV -- [design]]]] We're starting to do our design.
It means that instead of doing this, I saw what's going on for generations, we're going to get specific genes, we're going to get another specific proteins, and we change the life for very cars.
And it allows us to invent how it happens.
Let me give you one example.
How many of you sometimes might think about basis.
And we're kind of taking it, of course, but we change the basis.
So we think it's normal to be natural to change it.
What's happened with the basis over the time -- normal, Sydney's Sydney, finally.
But in the world of today, a global galaxy has no baby.
And again, we think it's a very natural, but it wasn't the case for most human history.
And it's not the case to live.
What it does is it gives us control, so the basis becomes a separate from the traffic.
And when you think about the consequences of this, then we've been living with these things that are a little bit more like art.
It's not in a sense of making a plastic, but in a sense of some technologies for the streets.
So what are certain technologies for the street?
A certain technologies for the streets are things like the wind outside.
And when you're doing the park outside the body, there's a very good reason to do it.
Sometimes you can't just get to another direction.
But when you're doing this, what you're going to separate, the Western, thank you.
So it's not just a control of control and you have a baby, you've returned the baby's baby and where the babies are.
So you've made the baby from the body of the action.
And when you think about other things we've done.
So you can make a frog, you can turn in groups, you can turn out in advertising groups.
And what does that mean?
Well, it's a good thing if you take cancer.
You're going to go to a tragedy, so you're making these things.
You're not teaching them.
But if you can save them and you can turn them, and you can be if you're a physicist, it means you're going to have a kind of time.
It means that you can have cells that we have -- Oh, more than 50 years?
So in a hundred years?
Do you hear a year?
And these are three different different changes that don't, like future things.
It's the things we take like these today.
So this life becomes power.
It's become a very powerful way to change viruses, to change plants, to innovation, maybe even do evolution.
It's something that a biologist and I'm thinking about for a while.
Let's take some risks.
Like every powerful technology, like electricity, like computers, these things can be used for potential.
And this is a lot of people.
And when you activate these technologies, you can even make people predict.
Remember the baby's baby and you're a mirror fire?
Well, some of these treatments actually change your genes.
Or they're using memory cells in our body or become, what you're going to say is that the reason you're doing it is that you're replacing themselves during cancer treatment.
So we need to take the experts of someone else, you might be able to change some of yourself, but you find your life.
And when you think about it, there was something that happened 20 years ago.
It's an intuition.
It's going to go into a party recently.
It's the thought violence.
It's a conversation in the continent and in a spinal cord. It's been a small picture.
And it's not very successful, outside of this that it's the first person to three parents.
Why?
Because she had a mathematical disease because she was a digital disease that she could wear.
So when you're looking at the DNA of a third person and you put it there, you're making a life of people.
But you're also doing the engineering of microbes, which means her kids, if we're going to have children, we've been able to go through it.
And their kids will go out, and because they're going to go, and it's really going on.
It makes people nervous.
So 20 years ago, the seconds said, why don't we start this for a while?
There's risks in doing things, and there's risks to not do things, because there's a few people who've been taken by technology, and then we thought about it for the next 20 years.
So when we think about it, when we take time to say, "Oh, we might have to be a long study, these are the ones that we need to do that, maybe we need to do something else," there's the consequences for action, there's an action for action.
It's like a digital disease -- by the way, they're completely unnatural.
It's a natural refugee that people will now have a certain metaphors like Paul, or a black work or a French.
When we reduce people, we put things into their bodies because we think the communities work on the risks.
Because we're going to get out of nature, not natural animals, we can feed about seven billion people.
We can do things like making new forms.
And when you create new forms, again, it sounds really scary, until you understand these new forms of life on the table.
These prices that you have on the food table -- they don't have a lot of natural things, because people have killed the plants to create this color, to be in this age, to move from a week.
You're not going to love with you in a general way because they don't stay a lot of time.
What all that does is make Eric Darwin on the head.
We understood, for four billion years, what we've been living on this platform was depending on two principles: about natural choice and invisible.
And so what we've lived, what's built, and it's become now on my head.
And what we've done is to create a great evolutionary system that we're doing in a way that we're doing not a natural selection.
So let me explain to you these things.
It's a natural choice.
It's not natural thing.
And so what's going on with this, we've started to show a thousands of years ago in the center of Asia to make them alone.
And then we started getting them into big dogs and dogs.
But if you're taking one of these jihad and you're seeing in the spinal cord, and you're releasing them in the African Arabic Arabia, you can watch the natural selection.
So a little bit about the Earth is less natural than a virus.
You're never, under a situation, you're not going to go through the forest and look at the same time in the same time, nothing else is there.
When you're bad for a virus, you're looking at what's going on.
And you're doing this through unnatural way.
It's the same thing with a wireless slide, it's the same thing with a theory.
It's the same thing with a city, it's the same thing with villages.
In fact, half of the Earth's surface is not natural so that what we're living there is what we want, which is why you don't have a dinosaurs that go in the town.
What about the Iranian trends?
Well, it's a terrible metaphor.
It's an anonymous and thousands of experiences.
It's also known as a scientist, my car.
He was the meeting in 2000.
And I have an invisible metaphor that's going to have two fingers every single day, what makes it very useful if you're feeling.
So what about natural tasks?
Technology isn't natural.
It's a cool, it's a dramatic.
How many times you're going to go in a natural forest?
I'm a natural energy?
So we tried these things.
Now, what's interesting is, we know these best things.
We've discovered one of the most powerful tools to help genes, CRISR, within a democracy.
And when we're starting to try cells, we're making eight out of the most beautiful drugs, including the material that's false in villages, which is the most familiar drug, the teacher.
So all of this life's life.
It's really power.
It's really a way to plan things, and there's nothing that's got us more than this life.
So when you think about life, let's think about five principles of how we start to live, and I'm happy that if you're going to know.
So, a number one: We need to take others on this thing.
The reason we need to take others is because we're responsible.
There's no Iranians.
This is what we do, what we choose.
It's not, "Third things."
It doesn't happen in the case.
It didn't get to the space of somebody else.
We've tried it, and it's the electronic life in the organization: you're on, you're wearing.
A number of years: We have to know to represent these things.
There were at least 33 versions of the species that went on on the Earth.
Most of us have been outside of us.
But nature's great situation of the Earth is that there's a German gender of people who are different at the same time, so we've also been in Iraq.
Some of us have a reason.
And for some of the Washington have a lot more than that.
I've been interested in three: We've got to fix the choices of other people.
How many people were going to come back and never change.
How many people will choose to change everything.
How many people will choose to change plants but to live.
How many people will choose to change themselves.
How many people will choose to develop themselves.
Genn is not a bad thing, because even though we think about people as diverse, we've been so close to the power that we're all the offspring of Africa and the consequences of this is that there's a better diversity of 55 African chimpanzees than five billion people.
A number four: We need to take about a quarter of the Earth and give Darwin to run the phenomenon there.
It doesn't have to be working, it doesn't have to be the tool together.
It should be part of the ocean, part of the land.
But we don't have to take any evolutionary decision on the planet.
We want our evolutionary system to work.
We want the evolutionary system of Darwin to work.
And it's really important that we've had the two things that we want to do in the model not to put on evolution.
But I'm going to say.
That's the most exciting adventure that human being was in.
It's the biggest power that was ever human.
It's going to be surprising to you about this thing because you're afraid of it, because you're scared of it.
You can participate in hope. You can participate in politics.
You can participate in business.
You can participate and think about where the drugs go, where the industry is going, where we take the world.
It's going to be surprising that we're not going to be aware of someone comes to a song that says one word, just one word, if you don't listen to this word is "Watch."
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Twenty-seven years ago, I got a good student to invest in my society.
He said, "I'm working with three friends, and we're going to try to do something in the industry by making things or London."
And I said, "Okay, you're sure you're going to have all the summer, right?"
"No, we'll all take the strengths, in case it's not going to go."
"Okay, but you're going to work on it all the time you're trying to learn."
"No exactly. We're all the most work to respond."
Two months go, there's only one day before the company comes to the air, and there's still no Internet website.
"You know, all this company is the website.
It's really all that is. "
Of course, I'm trying to invest.
And eventually they read to the company "Darwin". "
And they're familiar with Einstein.
Recently, they've known as the most new society in the world, and there's more than a billion dollars.
And now? I'll notice our investment.
But why is I so wrong?
To find out, I started studying people with them I call "microbes."
"microbes" they're going to be popular, people who don't just have new ideas, but they're going to be able to support them.
They're people in the surface and they've heard.
"microbes" creativity and change in the world.
They're the people who want to say.
And they're called completely different from what I'm expecting.
I'd like to show you today three things I've learned about is "microbes" and how to become a little bit more similar.
So the first reason I've come up with "Darwin" was that they were very intuitive.
Now, you're probably familiar with the "brain's brain."
Well, I'd like to hope in your face. I'm the opposite of it.
I'm "Man."
You know the point that you feel a few hours before a million more, when you still didn't do anything.
I just feel it a few months ago.
And so. It started a place: When I was a kid, I took a really serious game.
I'd come from a computer in the morning, start to play an asteroid that I've been looking for.
In the end of this, it's so successful that the skin of the right eye is going to do a letter on the "Palestinian", "in the car.
But since then, I started a forest in two years.
But it's serving me very well in the economy, because I put my identity four months before the London.
And I was proud of it for a few years ago.
My student named Jana, who came to me and said, "My most creative ideas come when I'm talking things."
And I said, "It's nice, what about four work you have to have?"
So no, she was one of our most creative students as a psychologist, it's the kind of ideas that we're building.
So I'm going to collect it a little bit of data.
It comes to some companies.
It's asked people to finish stories about the drugs where they're taking things.
So he's asked their institutions to make some new creatures.
And of course, the "Monday," like there's feedback and do all kinds of organisms as creative as creative, than people who live in a great way.
So I want to know what's going on with the privilege experiments.
And he's like this: "I don't know, they don't believe the story."
So no, here's our results.
In fact, you see that the people, who are waiting for the last moment so business in the kitchen that they don't have new ideas at all.
And on the other side, the people who are scared and what they're in the prison of independence, they also don't have modern computer computer.
There's a point where the microbes are living.
And why is that?
Maybe people are just a bad job?
Maybe experience doesn't make creativity?
To find out, you're going to have some studies.
We asked people to get new ideas to business, and then the next one is called invisible to make some creative creativity.
How many of them are going to do the work too.
And for one of us, we're able to enabled by the "Social School" in their face, "and for decades.
And as you can watch, the babies and creativity in 16 percent more than the other groups.
Now, it's a great word, but it's not the information of the result, because if you play the game before you learn about the task, there's no explanation to create creativity.
It's just when you tell you, you're going to work on this problem, and then you start taking it, but the task is still active inside your head, you start to be a bird.
And I've given you a time to think about certain ideas to think about ways of not liberal, to define extinction.
So we sat when we were going to finish these experiments, I started to write a book about "microbes," and I thought, "It's the perfect time to teach myself from the task, when I write the fear of my life."
So I was living on experiences, and like every single species that sold myself, I went from a place in the morning to the next morning and the library of a task about how to live.
And then I worked in a team to call my goal to the goal to my goal.
I started to write the only village, and then one day -- when I was in the middle -- I just took it in the middle of a sentence for months.
It was moral.
But when I went back to that, I had all sorts of new ideas.
Like the San Franciscin: "You see it's unique, I call it important."
And the way I discovered that many of the microbes in history were unique.
For example, Andrew and Chicago.
It's been working for 16 years on this country.
He felt like failure.
He wrote about it in his own building.
But some of the prosperity that it took in optimism, that changed the way it showed light, and became it better.
And what about the advantage of the genome?
At night, he was a man who changed his life, "The great investment to Washington," he was three times in the morning, and he wrote him.
It's sitting in the audience and it's going to go down to the stage, and it's still a number of new brains.
When he goes to the stage, after 11 minutes later, he's going to take his very early decades, and he says four words, we've got the history: "I've got some parts."
It wasn't a bus.
By reducing the task of the invasion is a very recent person, it's the service itself open to a space of possibilities.
And because the text wasn '
It's an inevitable experience when it comes to more -- but it can be a revolution for creativity.
What you're seeing with a lot of the big microbes is that they're starting very quickly but some days to go.
And that's what I've been looking for with a French Wall.
When they made their legs for six months, I looked at them and I said, "You know, many other companies start to sell or London."
They collected the first step.
But what I didn't understand was that they spent this time trying to figure out how to make people feel scary or polio.
And it turns out that the solution of the first step is in the city of Congress.
We've seen the Alexander's research over 50 groups.
What you're seeing is that, until the first step has 47 percent of failure, in inventing eight percent of the families.
You'll see Facebook, who's forgotten to build social media after Mexico Francisco.
Look at Google, who's forgotten years after the asteroid.
A lot more easier to improve someone else's idea than to create something from a finger.
So the lesson I learned is, to be modern and how to be first.
You just need to be better.
But it wasn't the only reason I've been able to give up by French.
They'd also be full of drugs.
They had a chemical plan, and it made me before, that they have the courage to be microbes because someone's birds looks like this.
["I don't know how to say it, but... I'm the Twitter"] "now, on the surface, many people call safe themselves, but behind the world they feel at the same time as all of us.
They just manage it another.
Let me show you: Here's a theory of how the creative process looks like. One. It's really cool.
It's too complex. It's got four. I'm going to get five.
There's ourselves that there's enough in the idea.
Speak itself is changing.
It's bringing you to a doctor.
But the idea of the idea is from outside.
It's going to prevent you to build, explore, to move, just as you're going to get more and do.
And that's how the key to microbes is in a simple way of trying to avoid three to four.
Instead of saying, "I'm a dinner," said, "The first team they'll always get, and I'm still not there."
So how do you get there?
Well, the food is found, so it turns out, in the Internet you use.
We can bring your role and your functions if you just know what the Internet you use.
Now, some of you don '
There's!
CA: They also stay in their work 15 percent more time, by the way.
Why? It's not a technical solution.
For four of the beautiful groups, there's a average average average of the child's community and they also have more data in computers.
It's about how you've got your face.
Because if you're using an insect, they're going to come from your computer, and you're going to go to the hospital that's going to go.
If you want Paul Ford Ford, I had to go around the beginning to ask, are there another option, and then save a little bit of a new generation.
So when people hear about this research are like, "Wow, if I want to succeed more in my work, I need to make my own face?"
So not, it's about to be our physical and take the time in the hospital and looking for better possibilities.
And if you do that well, you open yourself into a museum.
It's called "Wow!"
["And" and "and" is when you look at something that you've seen many times and suddenly you see me in new eyes.
It's a tragedy that's looking at the plastic that doesn't get light up and over five years.
Each of the first 30s, it's from the four hours.
But John told me, "Will you start before there's a gene."
It's reminded the first problem, reinvented the blog as a mammogram, and "to break the ice" become the successful platform all the times.
[France] So there's a simple message to this story.
When you feel Facebook -- don't remind.
[What about fear?
"Freedom" feel less, of course.
They're scared of failure. But what brings them from the rest is that they're scared even more than a galaxy.
They know that you can be failed in a business that's foot or failed to start a business at all.
They know that in the street, our big regrets don't have our activity but our action.
The things we want to do different, if you look at science, they're the risks that we don't have.
Elin Man told me recently, he didn't expect the summer.
He was safe that the first year of September Foundation and failed to come to a restaurant that didn't talk about to back, but it was important to try.
And for so many of us, when we have an important idea that we're not going to try.
But I have good news for you.
I didn't judge you on your bad ideas.
Many people think yes.
If you're looking at different industries and ask people about their big ideas, their most important step, 85 percent of them will be left in the place to hear.
They're afraid that they're afraid to make themselves, they're very simple.
But guess what? "microbes" have a lot of bad ideas, their tons, in fact.
Let's take the guy who invented it.
Do you care that it's the reality that it's so popular, which is the fear not just children but also adults?
No. You're proud the same experiment on a little bit of the electrical career.
So if you look through many cases, the big microbes are all asking failure because they're the most likely ones.
We're living and Asians, the best.
Why do one of them get deeper than other people and their creatures more often?
One of the best conditions is just like the creatures they're friends.
The more you've created the more effective you've got to get more diversity and so your risks are going to turn on something really modern.
Even the three intuitions of the music and the Asia -- in the sense of architecture, we need to create hundreds of forms of creatures to get a smaller amount of production.
Now, you might be wondering how this guy was able to get more and do too?
I don't have any sense of how we're going to do it.
But for most of us, if we want to be microbes more and we need to think about more ideas.
Mexico Darwin, when they were trying to find out there for their society, they needed something smart, and together, without a team of communities to build a brand, and they built over 2000 possibilities until they were just talking to the France.
So, if you put it together and what you see is "microbes" are not different from us.
They feel fear, they take things.
They have bad ideas.
And sometimes, it's not although these programs but because they're successful.
So when you see these things, don't do the same mistakes I did.
Don't turn them.
And when this is, don't give yourself.
And their way to start very quickly to get your creativity, that you can know about your plastics and the fear of trying to try, and that you need to understand bad ideas to get to a few good.
Look, to be a microbial is not easy, but we don't have enough about this: this is the best way to improve the world around us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine how life in the Earth is organized.
Think about the platform as a human body that we're training.
The third is a transportation system, of roads and liberal, brilliant bridges, and millions, that allow us to buy babies around the year.
The blood system that moves the body is the oil and the electricity network.
You put the energy.
And the creative nervous nervous system is as the Internet, the satellite networks, and the data center that allows us to share the information.
This infrastructure of the infrastructure, the transport is finally, which is already 64 million miles of roads, four million kilometers of Brazil, two million kilometers of forms and a million miles of the Internet.
And what's in the eye of the national disciplines?
We have less than 5,000 kilometers of galaxies.
Let's build a better map of the world.
And we can start first with a little bit of a future biology.
There's a quote that's familiar to all the history of history: "geography is normal."
It sounds so hot, isn't it?
It's also a platform.
It tells us that the eyes will help every country without results, and that small countries can't talk to their biggest games, and that on space space can't be used.
But in every concept that I do around the world, I see that no longer the power of the Earth: there's lights.
The world's world's world's world's communication, in any forms -- communication, communication and communication -- I'm going to be so sad of people's babies, products, resources, knowledge, until we can't even think of the biographics and the community.
In fact, I see these two forces like plants and together in a way that I've been called "Congress."
And Congress is reduced by tremendous samples of people, resources, ideas, but it's also evolutionary, evolutionary evolution of political geography, which is used to start with our lives, geography, which is what we use in the world, to find the way that we use in the world, for example, for many other countries.
The global system is opened up from the early 20th century, which has been asked in a way, through the intervention of the World War II in a way, to the culture of a global network in one century.
And there's lights, not just in the house, there was a concept that represents the human species.
Thank you. We're going to become the bad culture that we're learning this because we're born with it.
All of the security design and the military results in the world all agrees in a few trillion dollars a year.
In the data, our global outcome for a strong infrastructure for an hour and a trillion dollars in the next decade.
And really, that's how to be.
We're living on a full of infrastructure that's going to go to three billion, while I've been trying to disappear about seven billion until eight billion dollars a hour more and more.
As a color, we've got to find about a trillion dollars to the basic infrastructure of every billion people in the world.
It's not surprising that Asia's great.
In 2015, China knew about creating the Chinese investment for the infrastructure, which was living with a network of other organizations to design a network of universal systems, which would be retired by the climate change.
And within the way that all of this genetic engineering begins, it's more likely to get over the next 40 years, and it's more infrastructure for the next 40 years, than we've built in the last 4,000 years.
Now let's stop and think about it a moment.
It's a bigger result for the experiences of a global society than for development and all the rest of the media can bring us the consequences of strength.
And there's a service is how you compare the limitation of people and resources around the world.
That's how human beings might give more than a part.
I believe that's what's going on.
It's a liquid device that's got a cells in the 20th century and one: a electronic city.
Cities are the biggest infrastructure.
It's not about 2030, and over the top three of the world's population will be caused in cities.
And it's not just a TV point in the map, but a lot of space reduce us to hundreds of miles.
We were in New York, in the head of Sydney Syria that remains from the United States and the United States.
The technical power that it's about the Sylin begins to expect from San Francisco to San and out the outside of the East Olympic.
The impression to Los Angeles now is going to go through San San and we'll get beyond the Mexico Mexico.
San San's Guinea's October is now participating in the air that you can go out into two countries.
Finally, a great network of speech might survive the French School in Mali.
The American California and the East East Civil begins in Boston, go to New York California in Washington.
It's more than 50 million people and also have a plan to the networks of speed.
But in Asia, we're really seeing the worst forest.
The statement of light, mathematics through energy and engineering is more than 80 million people and many of the economy.
That's the biggest city in the world.
Right now.
But in China, it's on the side of the forest and it's going to be used to be a lot of population that's many to 100 million people.
The language in Iraq around Jang, Bolly Bay is a sample around the Olympic Canada, the department of Chicago to Giji.
And in the middle, in the middle of the Chicago Chicago and Genjami, who's been working at the same geography that's almost about the opportunity of Australia.
And every single one of us in these satellites is always a hero for a trillion dollars -- it's almost a level of all the universe today.
So imagine that the world's Chinese institutions were refugees, like the GGGOs have put their friends into economic growth.
Some of the Chinese cities may have been built in the United Nations, while countries like Atlantic is not outside.
Basically in India, I'm going to try to get this one of China, and also there's a number of deaths, like a morning or a moral region.
And in the Middle East, Toran has been reduced three of the Iran population.
Most species of the people who are living in San Francisco between California and Asia.
And in the summer, a series of a country from the bottom, started in the Washington, through the Egyptian Arab Arabic Arab Center.
And then there's a gene, the big city in Africa in the history of Nigeria.
It's got a plan for a complexity that's going to turn it into a gene of a wireless atmosphere, the device to the street, Tija, Gabby, and Gabby, the city of Januan, the city of the beach of the other.
But these countries are projects of Los Angeles.
In the world of poor cities, countries can be prices of cities.
In 2030, we're going to be able to 50 times as well as these in the world.
So what does that tell you more?
The traditional empowerment that's made of places in my life and give you a little bit about most of our careers, or where is this map of the 50s in the side of the forest?
And yet, even it's a part because you can't understand some ideas without understanding the survival of others.
People go to cities to be connected, and there's the reason that cities are wrong.
For many of them, like San Olympic or Social or Mexico, there's a lot of GDP that's going to be involved in the three minutes of all of their national GDP.
But it's important in a different country -- you can't think no value in the home of the people's role, the imagination, technology that allows them to achieve.
We're going to think about Africa's diplomacy, which brings the code around the city of Paris.
It also represents a little bit more than three meters of Africa.
But it's important in a different country -- it's lighting the office of almost every single tragedy that's going to be used in South Africa's art, in all in Africa.
Western cities want to be part of the service that I'm going to happen to die.
They want to be part of the global work.
So cities think.
I've never mentioned a city that said to me, "I want the city of hope."
They know that cities are different in the same country to the world culture like their home countries.
Now, for many people, they're going to see a lot of people.
They think that cities are destroying the Earth.
But now, there's more than the networks of the city of the skin in and the guns.
That's what it's like for the number of the global organizations we have.
And all of these principle networks are different to one task, the first facts of humanity in the 20th century: very clear.
Is it working?
Let's look at climate change.
We know that a boy after a box in New York City or a village doesn't expect the gas gas gas gas.
But it's possible to see that the technology is going to know from countries between cities is how we really started to reduce the extinction of our economic economic economies.
Cities learn one of the other.
How to make a difference between zero and emissions, how we're going to be there that's going to change electrical cars.
In central cities, you're going to put on the number of cars in the streets.
In many Western cities, the forest didn't even want to learn to leadership.
The cities were part of the problem, now they were part of the solution.
Einstein's the other big challenge I've got a very, very scary challenge.
When I'm going to train in the past, I'm going to go through a huge, and I'm taking two days -- I'm going to try in a statement of two different different different points inside the same geography.
And yet, my world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's largest, and we're going to get 300 trillion dollars.
It's almost the feedback of the world four times.
We've received ourselves so big since the economic crisis, but are we going to invest them in a big age?
No, no, no.
Just as a year that's true enough, public, and Berkeley, when there's a restaurant in the network of the possibilities of the possibilities of people to communicate with digital physics, so our cities and our health and health care again.
And that's why the infrastructure of the electrodes of the United Nations, because it allows all the other.
The political leaders and economists and economists learn that there's no code, it's the opportunity.
And that's why our physical community has to understand that lions are the most important as the wealth century.
Now, cities can do the world much more, they can do the world and faster, I'm also believe that there's lines between cities can do our world more.
If you look at the regions in the world that they have beautiful relationships between their limitations, you'll see more traffic, more creative investment.
We all know the story of Europe after the second World War, where we have industrial industries and the process that bring us to our inner theory of today.
And you'll see that Syria, by the way, it's the most famous service of all of the main systems in the international system.
And there's a lot to explain the strength of today.
Life countries are less powerful in the method and there's less to stop from action.
In North America, the most meaningful universe in the American American Iraq or the American GDP, but the common network of women's universal networks and electrical networks and electrical networks and even on the water that we're going to exist.
The North America didn't need more expensive, it needs more connections.
Thank you, but our real security is going to have a decline in the world's internal world.
All of these regions in which the galaxies were the most expensive to the statistics and the history of leadership and the relationship with this.
But now a new group of leaders will go into the telescope and it makes the parents.
Let's take an example of the civil Asia, where you mean that a series of complexity and speed between the Gennis and the Chicago of Social School and Tim School says.
Now this region of 600 million people are dealing the human resources and industry.
It's evolving to what I call "Pyssia" Asia "between the National Asia and East Asia.
The phenomenal phenomenon begins in East Africa, where a half more inevitable mortality in Brazil in Syrian institutions so that countries can't get their products.
Now these countries are dealing their infrastructure, and their investment countries.
They're also evolving to Africa.
One region we know that we can help this kind of thinking is the Middle East.
When Western countries are based on tragedy, what's left behind them are just the future cities, such as parents, in the mortality?
In fact, 400 million people in the Arab world are almost very interesting.
As companies, as cities, they're rich, we're still, for energy, or more energy.
And the only way to fix this nation isn '
Unfortunately, the Middle East is still not like this.
But it needs to be, a brilliant civilization, an intervention of connections and connections to our neighborhood: Europe, Asia, Africa.
Now, maybe you don '
But we know what historical history is the only way to create a long term.
Because we know that in the region after light, there's a device that's the new reality.
Cities and countries are learning to succeed to all of our children and worse.
But the real test is going to be Asia.
Is there a liberal device can get on the highest tasks between the big boundaries of the East?
In the end, it's the place that we've learned from the third world is supposed to solve.
Since the end of the war has happened, four years ago, at least six main war in this region.
But none of them didn't exist.
Take San Watan.
In the '60s, it was the great regulation for everyone to the third world.
But since since then, the training of the investment of the production of the products is so important that we've been sitting in the last crisis, leaders from the extinction and the statistics to a million of our future.
And even the president in Tannan's apartment of national action that's more independent than a year under this basic scale.
China has a very long history of most of their homework and they're trying to save their own theory today to save the human vision.
But in the last few years, there's a conventional investment in China's biggest investment.
I've been preparing and dealing there in a human skin.
And it's very important where the biggest number of regulations are defined?
Watch: China.
China will be able to fight war and they have three samples of open, but today it's in the biggest countries in the Asian investment of the Asian investment and the infrastructure.
They're building a concept that's made out of the East Central East and they're saying that in California has China.
And they're less likely to grow from 20 million dollars a decade ago to 80 billion dollars today.
We've been the Canadan Francisco that we've been able to fight for three wars and really programming in the crime of the crisis, but they've also been talking about the traffic trade of the Syria to Central Syria, and they're also talking about the Canada Central Central
And let's talk about Iran.
Not only two years ago that the war in Iran is inevitable?
So why do all of a designer from the city from the CO2 to the business there today?
Ladies and gentlemen, I can '
But you can see the reason that it doesn't happen.
Although Asia is the home of the biggest military in the world, the same countries are also about a billion dollars in the Asia and the infrastructure of the second.
They're also more interesting about the other geography of the other than in its political geography.
And that's why leaders are thinking sometimes, spread back from the side, and decide to get rid of economic connections by electronics.
I've learned so much about what the world's going on, but I've built a lot more expensive is the way that we've made the optimism, much better than we've been.
And while we're looking at the world in digital communities so far, we're dealing in evolution to read the world where people can push their limits and geographic.
We're the cells and every day we're spending in these global networks.
Every day, hundreds of millions of people come out to the network with people who have never known.
More than a billion people go through every year, and it's going to go to three billion in the next decade.
We're not just building lights, we get it.
We're the global network, and that's my surprise.
The map of the world where geography is not the big.
Instead, the future there's a new password that's teaching the baby more: there's a liquid device.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We're in which we're going to be worried, we're going to go to the red.
Not just asteroids that are building thousands of different people who are going to be sitting in red.
And I tell you it's going to happen in the morning.
Some of you are going to work on different projects that are related to human, and I'm going to show you that some of you are going to go through there.
It's a great thing, so I'll tell you how it's going to happen.
But first, I'd like to make a difference: Why do we do this?
Two years ago, I gave the TED Talk about 10 ways to reduce the end of the world.
We hope under our galaxies of galaxy.
Aststeroid is not a big one can make it a little bit.
In order to survive, we need to look at the possibilities of other patients.
Think how much it would be if all the human beings were able to achieve as not.
And there's another reason to listen in human cells: the world's world is in us.
Twenty-two million years ago, the right person evolved in Africa and then returned on the Earth's planet to be reduced by the world's world's life beyond the iPhone.
It's good.
And the humanity that's caught in this way.
Some of the most important species in civilization and technology came in this global room.
Yes, you can do a lot of good in the world with the money that's going to have to be a place where you're doing a person.
Yes, we all have to give you an effort to our home.
And yes, I'm also worried about the thought that we've just put hundreds of people as we've been doing the Earth.
But think for a moment, what happens when John President told us that we could live on the ice.
It's just a tool that's made me dream.
Think about how exciting it would be to see a human being.
Maybe then we're going to look at the Earth and we'll see one human beings in a lot of times and maybe then we're going to treat the Earth as a solution to our countries, and between how much value is our home.
So let me tell you about the wonderful journey that we're going to go out.
But first of all, some really exciting work on these days we're not going.
This photograph actually represents the real size of a person on the planet.
Man isn't the planet's cells.
It's much less than half a big half, but even though I've been smaller, the face of a person, we need to do a second in the size of the Earth, the Earth comes in the water.
The atmosphere of a very, very small person -- a hundred times more than the Earth's Earth -- and you can't have women in it, it's complex from 96 percent of CO2.
It's very expensive there.
The average temperature is a 63 degrees of galaxy, although there's a big temperature.
A long way on the Earth on the Earth's planet in 39 minutes.
I've been interested in hundreds of years ago on the planet.
And we've learned that there's still one day to wear beetle, to find that there's a lot less Germany than the Earth, and it's the kind of places where you can spread over your car instead of going from the side.
So as you can see from a person not so much like the Earth, but it's the most likely to learn from all the stars in the sun system.
Here's the problem.
A very far far away from us, 1,000 times away from our ice.
It's 4,000 kilometers of us and asteroids of even three days to get it.
It's 40,000 kilometers here and we'll take eight months to get there -- 240 days.
And it's in some people who live in a certain day, and at some point, you're possible to change, when you're not the Earth and values so that the space of the space is the most likely to be.
240 days it's a lot of time to build a tool with your colleagues within a fear.
And in the data, our career about the human being is about it.
We're living with the viruses, the doctors, the Chinese, the Chinese, who's actually 44 pounds there, and it's only a woman who's collected the knowledge, or that we've gone.
Only three of the users of the investments were successful.
And in addition, there's no regulation that's now a big space enough to get there.
We've ever had, San Four.
The Scott San five were enough to bring us there.
It was the best machine that was ever built by human beings, it's my office that I'm going to take.
But the last five that we've been using in 1973 to get a global space, and then we decided to replace the space in the space where we're going to continue to find a place after it was on the street.
The biggest office that there's right now on our network is half of the generation to get to human.
So it wasn't just going to go to a person what makes us a very interesting question.
When's the first person to take there?
Some of the experts think that if we're able to do it by 2050, it's going to be a cool tool.
Today, NASA argues that 2040 they can be able to live people on Mars.
Maybe they're right.
I believe they can do it before 205.
But in fact, I don't think they're going to have to be able to send spaces in 205, because we're already there.
We're going to take on hundreds of people in 2027.
And the reason for this is that this person is thinking and doing it.
His name is Alexandrian, he's called "Tesla Mexico Scott.
He told me that I'm actually going to take over 2025, but I don't have a more optimistic optimistic than me -- and that means a lot -- so I'm able to have two years.
Yet...
I asked yourself, can this man be able to do it for 2025 or 207?
So let's see what the geologist is in one decade.
Where was this car 10 years ago?
That's the electrical car of TV.
In 2005, many people in the industrial industry said that we can't have electrical cars in the next five years.
And where was it?
It's the Californian Central Foundation of San Francisco, which is six tons of Asia's international space.
Twenty years ago, Pennus AIDS didn't make any difference to space.
So I think it's just sure that the person has made the revolution of the industrial revolution in less than decades and that the person who's today from a company that's coming to less than 20 years and bring us to 207.
Yet, robotic governments don't know the rest of the game.
The privacy companies need to share with them, and that's really happy to take you to the cells.
And this is a big question.
Are we able to get there at all?
So NASA might not bring us there to 2040, and maybe we're going to get there a lot of them, but I'll try to make sure we're going to figure out how we can change from people.
Let's look at the problem in the next way.
Here's what's about to live on the Earth: food, water, a gene.
And here's what's about to live on hundreds of people: everything I've mentioned as a smoke.
So let's start with the most important thing.
Instead, they're the basis of all microbes, and it's like us and our children in the Earth to come, so we have to find teachers on a person if we want to live there.
And if you look at the cells, it looks like the planet is talking.
But it turns out it's not true.
The nation about hundreds of people can go 60 percent.
And a number of children in the network are still trying to bring us from the same person -- and by the way it's a real picture -- that in a lot of users on a person's place and the answer of a human water.
It's a place that's not bad to be sitting.
Here's a photograph that got a little bit of a Chicago in 2008, where you can see that you're going to go through the surface of the street.
In the second picture, I've got four days after the first picture, you can see some of the ice ice.
We know from the buildings that have like water underneath the surface of the cells, as well as the laws.
In fact, if the streets of a particular person, most abstraction would be under a five-meters.
So there's enough water there, but most of them in the moon and bees under the surface, and it's just a lot of energy to understand if it's different.
This device was in the University of Washington in 1998.
It's actually a device that's actually just going to be listening.
And it turns out that the atmosphere of Mars is often 100 percent of the water.
So this device can make all the amount of water that's hard to people from the atmosphere of hundreds of people.
In the next time we need to worry about how we've got to get people.
In fact, I've been surprised to my words, "I've already got a solution for this.
It's a scientist of the technology of Mexico that's dead as a pain.
He developed a machine called Mexico.
I love this thing.
It's actually a cell that's working on the back, it's going to fix the atmosphere of hundreds and politics out.
And you have to remember that CO2 and CO2, there's 96 percent of the atmosphere of hundreds of people -- a complexity actually from 78 percent.
So for the next year, I'm going to send a person in 2020 is going to be a machine, and it's able to create enough vision for one person for a life.
But the big secret -- and it's still in a experiment -- it's that this machine is going to start to be 100 times 100.
What's the whole?
And we can use it in California to grow food, but we can't grow more than 15 percent of our food device there, at least we've got water on the surface of Mars and we've got a chance to change children.
Since then, most food will come from the Earth, and it would be too food.
And what's about making a gold over our head.
In the beginning, we're going to use less structures with air pressure and also in the streets and their own themselves.
But it works for the day.
There's more than a microscope that's more likely to get too much more expensive.
So we need to use a device underneath the ground.
So it turns out that the nation on Mars, it's very interesting for making white.
And I'm going to say, "I'm going to say this as well.
They're going to get a plastic plastic and say into the heart, put them into a galaxy, and then you'll be able to build it with really work.
Or maybe it's just a simple person to grow under the land or in the lab or in the hospital, and as if there's a end.
And finally there's the biological problems.
On the Earth, there's over the atmosphere, that's going to create seven miles of stress at all the time, and we're all the time when you're coming to this pressure.
On Mars, there's no stress stress.
So I'm an artist, scientists from the technology of Mexico, a part of the Texas.
It's play by us, you're spending beyond the walls of our bodies.
So let's think about it for hope.
Each, Moltt, Gibi, water, a camera...
It's possible.
Really.
But it's still a little bit complicated.
So this leads us to the next big step -- the next big step -- in the middle of the lab to live on a person.
And that's the change of the planet: I've become a little bit more like the Earth, the bottom of the planet.
It sounds like a security itself, but the truth is that technology to do everything I'm going to tell you already.
First of all, we need to fight the platform.
It's very careful about people because our atmosphere is so different.
The answer is here, in the South Korea and the North Koreans's face, and they're coming in in the theory of carbon carbon dioxide -- remote.
If you get it, it's the same to the atmosphere and it's in the same way that happens on Earth.
And as we know, carbon dioxide will be very powerful.
The science way I have to do this is to today a huge event and learn it -- it's actually going to be used -- and we've learned it on the speech of hundreds of people.
While the patient's training around the house, it's going to reduce all the street and then put it into the atmosphere.
In fact, we didn't take a lot of time until the temperature of people will start to go, and most of us are less than 20 years.
Now, on a good day, by the other day, by the summer's summer, the temperature can come to 20 degrees, but then they're going to learn 70 in the night.
So we're going to collect a powerful effect: it's based on a temperature that's going to get to a big amount of ice -- especially remote on a threat -- to the other.
And then you get the real magic.
When the atmosphere works, it would be better.
I've got more modern leadership, atmosphere is going to go back to us, rewarding the platform, so you'll allow the water, and we're going to grow up.
And then more we're going to go to the air, we've created a huge gas from the wind.
It's a rain that we've learned about Mars.
And the atmosphere also works more stress and so we can solve these spaces.
All we've got is 2005 and a number of status states in order to survive.
In the end of life, life has been killed two days of Western West.
We're still going to give us the basic problem of the ability to change in the atmosphere of Mars, and the truth I've got to take 1,000 years.
But the human beings are very sophisticated and they're very scared.
You can't reduce what the technology that opens can be able to get in the future and not clear what we can do with our bodies.
In biology today, we're already able to control our genetics -- what the genes in our bodies do.
You might be a lot of human beings on the other Earth in a little bit of it on a person.
But what do you do there? How do we start?
It's going to be like life on Earth.
Somebody opens a journey, somebody who's building a car.
Somebody will make filmmakers on a person and sell them into the Earth.
What I'm going to start with is not just TV.
And there were companies for software, and there were molecules, things.
What's wrong is, it's going to be the most powerful event in our lives, and to the future, also the most inspiration.
I'd ask a 10 child if he wanted to try to find out.
The kids who have forgotten in school and I'm going to choose to live there.
Remember that I've been talking about the moon?
When it happened to be people in the second and said, "If we can do it, we can do anything."
What are those people thought if you're sitting on a person?
It's important for that, it's going to make us the universe in space.
And that means that the human being will survive without the regulation of the Earth.
We've never been the last human beings.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I want to show you an amazing woman.
His name is OK.
And I'm not a child in Jama, the United States in the age of 18, and now it's in the project of Washington.
It's not political politicians from the imagination, and it's not alone.
He probably would tell you that I'm a very special, but it has a very amazing impact.
What's amazing about me is that it's ready to invest a time where people don't know is, people don't know her neighborhood, and even from her country is people who have never met interesting.
My influence isn't going to start a few years ago when it turned into every single friend in Facebook, and asked them to describe their privacy so that it could be able to train the education of cities.
He didn't make a huge response, but 700,000 meters later, he's sending now 120 cities to school.
When we talked about a week, he told me that she was a little bit unknown to her local school every time she was surprised with a full full of natural gas in his face.
Now -- and I'm not alone.
Rather than that.
It's part of a big movement to go.
And there's people like OK: citizens of the world.
The citizens of the world is somebody who's identity that the first day is not as a friend of country's friend of country, or a nation, but a friend of the human species, and somebody who's ready to work on this belief, to deal with the biggest challenges in the world.
Our work is focused on a reality and the revolution of citizens.
They're similar in every country and in Congress.
I want to argue with you today that the future of the world will depend on the world.
I'm convinced that we've had more civil citizens in the world, so each of the big challenges we're going to face -- from us, climate change -- these kinds of genes will come to us on a solution.
They're at the end of global issues, and they can eventually come up with solutions by citizens and citizens who make global solutions from their leaders.
Now, respond to people's countries for this idea is that it's a little bit intuitive or even hundreds of people.
So I'd like to share with you today a little bit of my story, how I've come in here, how it's when I'm going to call you a point.
I grew up in Berlin, Australia, and I was one of those kids who were really designing, and I never told me, "Why?"
You could be like this for yourself.
And I used to ask my mom to the most design questions.
I'd ask her questions like, "Amy, why can I play with home every day?"
"Why do you want to do with this?"
"What's the connection, and why should we keep them back in the country?"
And ["" And my mom -- this story.
Why? "
But the worst story, I think.
It's still called.
I thought, "Why, I thought I could change the world, and you couldn't hear it differently.
And when I was 12 years old and my first year in high school, I started to collect money for the communities in developing countries.
We were really a group of children, and we collected more money from any other school in Australia.
And that's how the chance to try to philosophy to learn more.
It was in 1998.
We'll take us to a huge plan in our own model.
This is where I've been with my grandmother, who's caught on what was just like the forest of the blog.
"Smith" "" they're preparing me.
But don't give me a democracy where it's going to be wrong with you, because it wasn't more than a dozen of children like Mexico and Bayla to find something, something that's done.
The same night with my grandmother and my family changed my life, because when it's time to go to sleep, we just wrote about this guy in the age of the year's different room, we've been around, and we've been left with us in this family, seven of us in this long time, with a wind of the wall around us.
And I didn't myself still, but I wrote a forest and I thought to myself, "Why should someone have to live so much?
Why did I have my ability to live our dreams by the place that he was born, or what was called "The Wall Street?" "I just didn't understand it, and I'd have to understand why.
Now, just later I came to realize that I've seen in politicians was the result of the decisions of the decisions that I did not do, by the end of my own children's minds and governments that had all of the interest of our grandchildren.
And OK, they didn't create a very, very, very, but they did also.
And if we want to try to help children like Mexico, it didn't work if we're just going to sent me a few dollars to try to buy the door where it's adult, because the problem is in another place.
And when I was working on projects that I've worked in the years after trying to build schools, to deal with HIV, and to deal with HIV, I've come to see that I've got to be aware of self-communities, and that I've learned that I'm necessary, it's not necessary.
We need to deal with these challenges in a country where I've been studying.
And the best thing I could do is to try to grow a big group of citizens in home to do that leadership is to change a system.
I've been to that, a few years later, I've come to a group of friends from the economy, in my mother's faith's "revolution" to Australia.
We've had a dream to say a little bit about the time of the GG20 with local Australian artists, and it's all the time when we got one phone phone, and it's Jeoparga, who's agreed that everyone's agreed to give us a project of our project.
I felt a little bit about that day as you can see.
But I was surprised, the Australian government who heard the political communities, and they agreed to become a global investment in global health and global health -- another of 6.2 billion dollars.
I felt like -- []]] I felt like you could have a amazing opportunity.
The power of citizens together, we've helped to convince the government to do the unbelievable government, and to operate a problem in a hundred kilometers outside of our communities.
But here's the thing: it didn't get rid of it.
Look, there was a politician in government, and six years later, all the new money disappeared.
What do we learn?
It sounds like I'm not enough.
We'd have to have a very, very, very unusual movement to the game of political politician or a magazine of economics.
And it had to happen everywhere; another government, every government, I would have to have this structure that they probably couldn't ask the sound of global action.
And so, that's what we're living on ourselves.
And as we've been living on this challenge, we've asked ourselves, how do we get enough stress stress and stress around the street so that we're able to take many of the back?
And we can think about one way.
We had to have somehow to make this emotion of people who've heard so many with the "We've become the great history to get a long time."
It had to be part of their identity.
So in 2012, we tried a organization that this was exactly my goal.
And here's just one there for me: the world's citizens.
But it's not about one organization.
It's about different citizens in action.
And our baby's studies show us that the population in general care about global issues, just 18 percent did something about it.
It's not that people don't want to work.
It's in general that they don't know how to operate, or they believe that their actions didn't have any impact.
So we'd have to have to say when we'd try to make millions of citizens in 10 countries to activate pressure on their leadership and have been used to theater.
And when we did that, we found something really exciting, when you become global citizens to your task, you suddenly find yourself with some of the companies and extinct.
Look, another point is not the only thing that it's global in Mexico.
So it's also, the climate change, human rights, genius change, even as a process.
We've found ourselves as a graph with people who are trying to focus on all this kind of connection.
But how do we actually get to the business of citizens of these world?
Well, we used the universal language: music.
We've changed the Western Prize of the world in New York City, in San Francisco, and we've convinced one of the most famous world to participate.
And I'm going to say that these boxes are going to work with the general independence of the United Nations, so the leaders who need to hear our communities can't get out of them.
But here's Tony: I couldn't buy a card.
I had to take it.
I had to take action for global goals, and just when you did it, you could remember in the regulations to stand in women.
Antarcticism is nature.
I didn't have yet in adult citizens as something that makes me feel good.
For me, citizens mean you need to work, and that's what's called.
And unfortunately, it worked.
Last year, over 65,000 citizens just in New York City have been reduced enough babies to stand in a woman.
Google, galaxies and citizens over 150 countries around the world.
And last year, we've been doing more than 1,000 new friends in a week over the year.
Look, we don't need to create citizens and have a lot.
We're already in every place.
We've just got to be organized and active to start.
And here, I believe, that's where we can learn a lot from India, which started to operate as citizens in 2012.
This is what she did.
It wasn't good science.
He started to write letters, who sent us to politicians.
It's very lucky to her local community.
So she became active in the social media and started to collect a metaphor of his face -- a lot of metaphors of his face.
Now, maybe it doesn't sound like a lot.
How does it have something?
Well, it got a lot because it wasn't alone.
Her activity to 14,000 citizens of the world, made the United States to transform the market for global participation for education.
And here's "Richard," USA, "is a" The USD, "and" Social. "
Look, when thousands of the world's citizens are inspired by that, it's amazing to see their political power.
East citizens like I'm going to help convince the world's World Bank to tell you what you've done in a place.
Here's the general management of biodiverse data about 15 billion dollars on the stage in the world's world's citizens, "imagine, the primary government has been reduced to the services in every school around the India, 2019.
The citizens of the world's world's world's been interested in Western Center from the Washington's Twitter's Twitter's Twitter's Center.
Eric Social, the government, understood the message, and it started to turn the investment in the education of home.
East citizens together with Darwin and read to the governments of hope, Britain is Australia to reduce the change to the political disease.
They've been killed by 65 million dollars.
But despite all this students, we're standing in a few huge challenges.
Look, you might think of yourself, how can we convince the world's leadership to keep the images of global issues?
And indeed, politicians said a lot of politicians, once said, "All politics is places."
That's what you've always made for politicians to choose: to look at the power of power in the middle of the local interest, or in the best case, the national case.
I lived it for the first time when I was 21.
And at the time, there's a meeting with the wind and then there's the rest of the skin in in the skin in there -- [Alexandria] and behind the Syrian] dozens, I'm part of my passion to click my other eyes.
And I said, "As a bridge -- Australia has a unique opportunity to help achieve the development of the molecules.
We can do it. "
And he did, he looked at the top of the blind eyes, lucky, and he said, "Wow, no one there on the ground."
Only he didn't use "No one there."
It's the opposite.
Let's say we need to play on the back of our hands every day.
That's, I believe, important and even dangerous.
Or as we've been around on the peace, it's saying, it's a perfect tool.
And I've created this technique because it's bringing the point of one country as a different country.
It's dead that we can build ourselves and our art from food.
The world all of us is our holes, and we're disappointed by the risk of ourselves.
Rather, look at what happens when we went from Mr. Kenya, when we disappeared from climate change.
The political leaders do have to put on it. "Because the impact of climate change and the more and the more we get to our lives.
Now, the world citizens -- they understand it.
We're living in a time that we're capable of citizens, in the eye that you can hear every single child.
Look, do you remember when "The Foundation of the dictionaries" will replace in 2000?
The institutions that we could do in the place are to run a letter to the next elections.
There was no social media.
Today, billions of citizens have more tools, more access to information, more capable of influence than ever.
They're the problems and they're the tools to solve them and they're actually in front of us.
The world has changed, and these are hundreds of us who look beyond our communities are in the right side of history.
So where do we?
So we're making this amazing prototype, we've seen some big countries, and citizens have been dead all over the world.
But do we get our task?
No.
There's a long way.
But this is the opportunity I see.
The idea of global civil citizens, from God in her blog but so not doing in many ways, opening with this particular moment where we need to live.
For me, as the citizens of the world, there's a unique opportunity to invent change around the world.
So in the next few months, the citizens of the world will see in the world's leadership are responsible to sure that the global electrodes are very, very difficult for women.
The citizens of the world will be participated with the world's global organizations in the world to grow disease like California.
East citizens will have a conference in the world in the world, when they grow the lights, the quality and the effect of their industry.
These dreams are the bad thing.
And imagine a military of millions of children are involved in 10 million, connections, scientists, experts and not ready to get a answer.
For all these years, I've tried to listen to the connection with my grandmother.
Unfortunately, it didn't get us.
And we met a lot before social media, and I've been in now renewable by regulation, as it's going to happen to be a lot of poor neighborhoods.
I'm glad to think about it, in a bridge, and share it as long as I've spent my grandmother from Montin, the eyes inspired me.
I've been at the time of many other people's classes, I've come to the important house to be part of people's movement -- the kids are ready to look at their screens and outside the world, the citizens.
East citizens who are going to ask the question "Why?"
I'm citizens.
Do you?
Thank you.
Thank you.
[Three in Africa, we've seen the biggest data in the history.]]]] Speak]]]]]]]]]] In
The service of these documents revealed the screen on a tiny version of the Chinese world outside the country.
We're going to get out of how to take buildings and lawyers like Mexico and say, "Okay, we want a social company, you can help us one?"
So in fact, you're seeing "Love", you're seeing the previous, you see the mechanism of how it works, how it works.
Now, it's already starting to make our actions.
The AIDS government has been reduced.
We've also got innovation that in the United States of Texas were Twitter in the rest of Asia and also there's decisions outside the country.
Here's the art that has a money of two billion dollars that's listening to California and California through the great societies, in case it's Charlin.
And there's a lot of rich people there and other people who have been nervous about the next stories and the next dolphins.
Now, it sounds like a big device or a dog of John Gardan's Grain.
It looks very sophisticated from you, from me, normal people.
Why should it be interested in us?
But the truth is that if people are rich and they can keep their money out of the country and not pay institutions that they need, it means that there's less money for public services like health, education, women.
And it affects all of us.
Now, to the organization of Google Blennies, this extension was going on.
We have the global media and political leaders who talk about how people can use institutions outside the country to try and try their failures -- something that we've talked about before.
Now, I think that a lot of people find this world without a meter, and it's hard to understand how this kind of world outside the country works.
I like to think about it a little bit like a basis.
So you can have a company in another company, within another company, which makes it a little bit impossible to understand who's behind these structures.
It can be really difficult to be as a human life or the presidents, to the journalists, to the citizens really understand what's going on.
I also think it's interesting that there's less than this issue in the United States.
And that might be because some of the differences in the United States just didn't exist in this period, in this experiment.
Now, it's not because there's no decades Americans who bring their viruses outside the country.
It's just because of the way you're going to go out of the country working, Mexico has less to take Americans.
I think if we're going to see a very coffee here or even a molecule or a biologist or a building, you'll see a lot more and examples that's connected back to Americans.
In fact, in the U.S. countries, you need less information, you need to provide less information to create a company that you need to get a books.
It's a kind of illustration that allows the workers of a school to be a school.
It allows us to be able to be inevitable.
This is the kind of behavior that affects us all.
Now, in Bill Bill Gates, we wanted to see what it actually looks like in reality.
How does it actually work?
So what we've done was we've been able to send a study in the Mexico for 13 companies in the Museum.
Our research started as a African bridge that I want to get some different species to the United States to the United States, and as a depression, from Texas.
Now, what was really surprising was that all these lines outside of our room and how to get these important agrees.
These were first privilege, and no one of these lines didn't take us all together, of course, the money didn't get the problem with the system.
It's also also important not just to think about it as teachers.
It's not just about some ways that we've been talking to our research and the success.
It's not just about politician or in some ways that's been caught in the decade.
It's about how the system works, meaning that corruption, warriors from Mexico, more unsatisfied.
And to deal with this, we need to change the game.
We need to change the rules of the game to do this kind of behavior that's more difficult.
It might look like Amazon and samples, as if we can't do anything about it, as if people have never changed, as if there's always been people and decades.
But as a natural optimist, I see we start to change.
For the last few years, we've seen a real period of slide when it comes to companies.
This topic was on the political January of the England Center in Foundation of Guinstein in Ghana who was in the French of 2013.
And since since then, the doctor and the doctor's doctor's apartment is going to create centuries in the national level of really love and control companies around Europe.
One of the things that work is that, in fact, the United States is scared behind.
There's an empathy that's been reduced in the house in the house and in the basis, but it's not when somebody wants to see.
So we really would like to see the piano in the world, on a huge amount of money outside the country, and they're using a way to open the United States and around the world.
For us in the global global global, it's a moment of change.
We need people to remove the way people can bring their identities behind Chinese companies.
One of us need business models that are going to say, "Science like this is not good for business."
We need political leaders who know in a problem, and we've got to change the life to solve this kind of experiences.
Together, we can put in a end of issues that when you're conducting the warrior of the warrior, the heart and the heart and the money is going to play.
I spent the last 38 years in trying to be invisible.
I'm going to change.
I'm working in New York City, and it's going to change for the New York City is like a great group of group around the first night: every little motion of the structures -- a tree that you're going to get wrong.
Just to make it clear: a way to sleep doesn't choose what's going to go into a galaxy.
We're working at the level of sentences, maybe the philosophy, the words.
Our business in details.
We're going to put the two iPhones, over the "" "" "" Jane. "
We're preparing the home.
Each magazine has a house.
We've been a unique generation in particular.
Sometimes we're going to get it because of our diversity.
Imagine -- we're still hundreds of "The Gabby" with a body, as if this word is just the moment.
But you're seeing that the surgeon's "and you're the top door" in "Time", "and you know you're seeing the New York.
A teenager in New York City is a video process.
There's a tremendous function called the door, or a drugs.
While it's a plan, it's a car, the door of the door is paralyzed.
We're going to have a tool to write through the way to improve the kind of sentence or to work back from cars and to provide the effective effects.
Our goal is to make a culture look good.
We're going to notice that we're going to give our behavior to write, but to the way.
It's a lot of times we've created a country of a trick that's going to be used by the other way -- I'll use it as a power as a power -- it's got the bad crisis.
If we do our work very well, we're invisible, but once we're doing Ghana, we're these different ways become active.
Here's the approach that I've been talking about and recently.
[In the last five years, 10 million,]]]]]]] In the last five million,]]] In the last five million,]] Before] Before the last five million,
They didn't mean a kid and know anything? "
I am.
You don't have this mistake.
But I love it "nothing."
It's maybe in Tony and said, "William."
So here, we've read another category from the food: [Most of it was seven years old, but it's been happy about her traffic restaurants: just her unusual step.]]]] Berry:] OK, somebody who's in New York knows
Really! "
LP: Let's just give you a mistake.
It had to be "Wow."
AB once wrote about professors in New York City: "They're going to fill with the baby's baby's hands of a body."
And it's true -- we get a lot of images about the Chinese.
"Is there really two pixels in the MMA's March, Jeale?"
Maybe it's not about the decision, but yes, it's the concept of the New York City to "Jah."
One man wrote: "" Bush, you can get on, or at least, don't you think about your business team? "
In this case, these experiments are very good, outside of this that doesn't have to be one of the "touch" and "on."
And also, if you have to be scared around "at least," maybe there's this using the sentences around the sentence: "-- at least, Larn --" perfect.
And then there's this: "I like you, like your food, but you can stop to write a huge numbers like a text?"
[Two and a half million...] No.
And I see after a physicist: [The long things are too easy.]]] This is called the end of the end, "I'm sure I'm not sure I'm not going to write about the rainforest, but I'm sure I'm sure I &apos
Go! "
And I came to love to get a model.
There's a environment between plants and ways.
The way we're never familiar with the planet, we're never going to come out of a house about bad animals that had to save stories that were too long.
It's a great way that's going to say about the power of its entrepreneurship.
We're going to get ways to change, also, change; we're not based our mistakes.
I feel unbelievable to publish them here, so let's look at what we do right.
How it is, I got three conversations.
But I'm working with letters that know how to deal with me.
I mentioned Aan France, or "Sydney," since the beginning of the two years.
And it's one of my favorite ones, even though it's sometimes a sentence that makes the way to stop.
Here's one of the story about a cancer or a California recently San Francisco: [Shanging] that's in the middle of the middle of Obama] I've lost the other side of the other side of the water] control into the water] water,
But what can I do?
Technology, the "like" has to be "in the speech," but it sounds pretty cool, as if the design was exposed in a space of space -- "at least the beginning of a biodiversity."
And I decided that the dancer came out of the experiment and I gave the sentence to the rest.
And in general, if I was thinking something wrong, we build it three times.
I said, "Well, I said," Just three? "
So, he's learning to get.
Recently, he wrote a story for "The city", "it started in the magazines with our products that are coming from New York City's Chicago in a small town to come in the Grank.
The story of Syria was on the back to the Britain of the San Francisco Scott Scott.
I was three things I had to change.
First of all, I'm going to ask.
It's a woman who's a black guy wrote, [Pophia]] The New York Times]]]]]]]]]] The Kenya &
"Like" in this sense, it's a relationship, and it's about to take a object, that it's there.
That's like "It had to be" Bay. "
"Let's create a future in the city."
Secondly, human problems.
The design is somebody who's going to go to the slide: "It's going to take a moment.
We put a microscope on the slide, "which is a microphone?"
The music industrial industry gives it "" "because it's hundreds of on the side.
I've never seen it in using this letter, and the tricks to think that "" "and" "" "" "will go into my office.
But the student of the New York City is "Please."
Finally, here's the component of the using the body to be the same number of transportation numbers like the sentence.
[Everybody]] "" "" "" ""] "" ""] "" "" "" &
You'd never say, "No."
Everybody was there. Everybody here.
But people say things like, "Everybody reminds" all the time.
In order to give it to genetics, we're going to call it "their only" and "as if we're seeing it together and do it many more.
And that's my work when I see then it's in the kitchen to do as I could get it.
I couldn't do that, "Everybody reminded the women," or "everyone reminded my wife," or "I've all reminded my wife and I'm going to do that."
What I'd like to offer was that I had to reduce.
I said, through the way, if you're going to change this to "All the people in the classroom have reminded the women," because "all" is many.
No.
And I tried again, "All the arguments itself for women?"
I thought it's a great sentence.
But the average way of working on the fact that we can't have "pressure" and "is in the same sentence.
When the finance came back, you'll get "Good for", "" "" and "" instead of "."
But it's about "Everybody's reminded" it's not more.
Two out of three is not bad.
At the same Google, at the same time by Gragen in France, there was a common use of the FFrench word by French.
The same, when Darwin comes, what it's going to look like more.
Thank you.
Thank you.
How do the news design the way we see the world?
Here's the world like someone looks like the ground.
And here's how the news designs what Americans see.
This map -- I'll show you the number of seconds that Americans and new organisms in villages and women's cases, before 2007, in 2007, just a year ago.
It was in a month where the North Korea was going to solve her nuclear graph.
Here's a space in the ocean.
And in Paris, it's the ICCCCCCC published a study that's released the human impact on Earth's wars.
The United States has gone from 79 percent of the new microscope.
And when we take the United States and look at 21 percent more, I see -- a lot of this green thing, and a few others.
The world's world's population, China and India, for example, came to one percent.
When we're going to open all the new experiments from one trick, we'll see the world.
What's the secret?
This stimulus is going on every country out of the city, and we've got a little bit of 10 times the COC's "CC's". "
And the cycle is going on, as we all know, Britain has been in a strange way recently.
So why don't we hear more about the world?
One reason is that the network we've been reducing the number of these tiny stories in half.
There's a strength of one person's ABBC network, and we're going to have to be awesome, there's no new story in Africa, we've been an amazing South America where life is more than a billion people.
The reality is that we're going to close Britain is more cheaper.
And the principles that we don't learn is much more than we're looking at where people need new ways.
Social new states are built in the size, and unfortunately there are only 12 percent of the tricks for global innovation.
And what about the Internet?
The most popular website is not in a better situation.
Last year, I'm at the University of California, and I'm going to get 14,000 tricks that were working in the house of a new Google.
And in fact, they're all trying the same 24 new events.
In addition, another study where the Internet showed that most of Syrians in the United States have come back from the remote agencies of the Darwin's reminds, and you don't allow people to understand their connection to Syria.
If you look at all these cases, you can understand what we're from today as well as Americans and more and less known about the world than we've been working in the world 20 years ago.
And if you think it's just because we're not interested, you're wrong.
In the last few years, one of the Americans say that they're working after innovation in the time that's been growing to 50 percent.
The real question is: Will the world reduce this is what we want for Americans in the world's world more connected?
I know we can better than that.
And can we afford ourselves not to succeed? Thank you very much.
I have one good reason for optimism: climate change.
Maybe you don't believe it, but here's the fact.
In the 12th century, 2015, in French, under the quality of the nation, 195, the governments got together -- if you worked with governments, you know how hard it is -- one beautiful part of the global economy to protect the global economy and improve our lives.
Now, that's the extinct.
But it's even more amazing if you're wearing where we were just a few years ago.
In 2009, Nigeria.
Who remember the iPhone?
Well, after a couple of years of work to make climate, the same governments have come in in the penguin and failed.
Why is it a failure?
A lot of different reasons, but basically because of the deep habitat between the global walls.
So now, six months after this failure, I read to take others by the global climate change.
You can imagine, the perfect moment to start this new work.
The global situation without climate change was in the fear of language.
Nobody believed that the summer would have ever been able to be possible.
In fact, I'm not.
If you're sure not to tell anybody out of this wonderful TED audience, I'm going to tell you that there's something that's been in history lucky.
My first journalists, I'm going to say, "If, Gragus, do you think the galaxy will ever be possible?"
And I got to activate the brain, I heard myself from the door, "No time in my life."
Well, you can imagine the face of a three minutes of the woman's newspaper from this new astronomy that was their new boss.
And I've also been a magic structure.
Now, I wouldn't understand me, because I'm kind of growing myself.
I've actually been looking at the consequences of what we've been saying, from the results to the world where we've all got to live.
It was actually a moment called me, and I thought, well, no, waiting for a moment.
It's not possible that it doesn't work, it's access.
It's just access.
And I decided then, and then I'm going to first put our approach and help the world change my approach of climate change.
So I don't know -- no, just that?
Thank you. I don't know -- what you'd do if you'd say to you that your work is to save the patient.
You put it on a work cell.
And you have an artist responsibility, but you don't have a car at all, because the governments are close to any decision they're taking.
Well, I really would like to know what you would do in the first day in the morning, but here's what I did: I went into the ocean.
And then I went back to Italy, because I realized that I had no idea how we're going to solve this problem.
And then I realized that we don't have any idea how we're going to solve this problem, but I know one thing: We have to change this conversation.
Because there's no way you can provide an optimism.
And here, I use optimism like a very simple word, but let's understand it in the most important sense.
Let's understand it as a courage, hope, trust, Chinese, the basic belief that we're the people can come together and help each other and look at the size of the people.
Well, you can imagine that I thought that in this room, there was no way that was coming out of the slide of the penguin.
And for six years, in the seconds, no optimistic possibilities into the system, no matter what the questions are -- and I've done better at that -- and no matter what the leaders are.
And believe me, here's a lot of eyes.
It's not optimistic optimistic to the system.
But very quickly, we started to see changes that are happening in many cases, trained by thousands of people, including many of you here today, and I hope you.
And this TED community wasn't surprised if I'm going to tell you that the first region we saw was...
Technology.
We've started to see that digital technologies, especially new energy, started to happen in research and to be in places where we're already working with this kind of curiosity that they have the ability to give the ability to cities that are learned, not to talk about what we're doing.
And with this change in technology, we've been able to start to understand that there's a change in economics, because we've been able to see that, there's a high cost of climate change, and yes, there's complex risks.
But there's also more economic solutions in the universe, because the nature of technology is going to bring more air, better health, better cities, more organic security, more organized, more energy and more energy to the developing world.
To end, we've never got better than we have now.
And with this understanding, you'd have to watch actually, how many of you've seen, the expansion of the emotions and emotions that's going on through the head of the national governments, the privacy, the industry, the industrial societies, the first of the cities, the communities of art, because everybody started to understand, it can actually be a future.
It can actually improve their bottom line.
And it wasn't just the early five.
I need to tell you that I had a very big CO2 company that came to me at the beginning of the year and said -- in privacy, of course -- he didn't know how to change my company, but he's going to change it, because he's still in a long way.
Well, now we've got a change in economics, and that, with a more powerful support of all, it doesn't take a long time that we've seen the National government that's coming to the fact that it's in the National Science.
And when we asked countries to start to identify how they can contribute to global efforts but based on the National Science, 189 countries from 195, 189 countries that send their local climate programs, based on their national interventions, in their national problems.
Well, once you're protecting the global interactions of the countries, so you can understand that art can start to start with a web, for a common movement that's going to take us for a few decades, but for a few decades, it's going to take it to a new economy, for the economy, to the economy and to the economy, for a very difficult, and the NASA,
And the countries, we've been the art of all of these efforts that have to have sentences.
We've had the general babies that we've had every five years to make a good progress for our metaphor and the way we've been able to control the carbon and the deeper carbon from sentences.
And here's a lot more important: What would we have before?
A little number of countries of our countries have been looking at less, to Twitter has to reduce refugees that were completely not enough of it, and we've been caused as a war.
Now what do we have?
Now we have all of the world's countries that have different levels in different kinds of different sectors, but they're all going to have a common goal to a space with a cosmos and environments.
Well, once you have all this in the place and you've got this understanding, and then you see that governments were able to go to the park and join the village.
And so, when I look back on the last six years, first I remember the day that the summer was told.
I can't tell you about the theory in the room.
Fifty people are jumped out of their chairs, educators, professionals, teachers, teachers, and they're interested in the unprecedented theory of what they're called, because so many people worked for this direction, and it was their reality to the end.
And it wasn't just the ones we've used.
A couple of weeks ago, I was with a man who was trying to decide about a mathematics that he wanted to give the wonderful woman of Watch.
And once he decided to finish what he was going to do with molecules, the sequence said to me, "You know, you're very lucky that you're going to buy it now, because these buildings can hide most of the climate change."
"But," The Ford said, "Would you hear, the governments in New York came to space, and the TV can be a chance."
Well, what the statistics that might be, maybe here's the hope, here's a chance.
I'm the first one to know in the fact that we still have a lot of work to do.
We just started our work on climate change.
And in fact, we've got to sure that we're going to have our efforts over the next five years that they're the only five years.
But I believe that we've gone over the last six years on the impossible to do now I've got to stop.
And how do we do that? We need optimism because we allow us to go from action to cooperation, which allows us to understand that we're not necessarily necessarily necessary for global consumers, and if we understand it, we can connect them to the energy.
And when we're looking forward to other global issues called our attention in this century -- in the security of opportunity, in the national security, the definition is very easy -- I see we don't know how we're going to solve these problems still.
But we can take out of what we've done in climate change and we can figure out that we need to reinvest the zero tasks.
Because I'm going to believe that there's always laughing and customers, and your secret is my solution.
Well, now when we're in the world where we've come to the electrons and that we're not just connected, but more than one day in the year, your secret is not our solution.
We're all missing or we're all successful.
But we're going to have to decide between values and zero.
One is going to have to decide between zero and everyone or live the lives of all of us.
We've done this one time, we can do it again.
Thank you.
Thank you.

I'm just going to live. "
In the next month, I've got 44, and I've got a feeling that I've changed a very good year, a year of water, the bridge.
I've got a feeling like this, not because I've found something special, but I've read that there's a good year in 1968, who's written from Mr. Miller.
"He's feeling his 44 seconds..."
We've wrote a lot of "The night" "," like the "self-esteem", survival, emotional brain, "like this was going to be."
Yes, I know that Miller didn't write about it.
But I also know that it's yes, all of us -- you, I, the hero of my book, are less or less at the same time, from the audience from the same way: the prices of the children's actions, for free in the planets of the abundance, in my own own lab, in the lab, and when I'm in this career &ap
Life has stories and they change all of us.
As I wrote a magazine: "It happens to me like them."
And it's not just that we're living these patterns.
We're also interested in them.
We write them in books and they become robots that we can read and identify.
The books tell us who we are, who we're also learning.
They do it for thousands of years.
As a graph of James Taller: "The life becomes beautiful, if they're at all become something."
So six years ago, there's a thought in the brain: if the life becomes a face, a nation or a rainforest, a prosperity that's been written by a whole approach.
If I can find them, I can write a lot of them.
I can many of them live, a long life, life in a hundred years, all this button all of the lights that we're going to go in the lucky unfortunately.
I was then 37, "The size of a building," we wrote a trick.
I had a little girl to say in the meaning of time and the great time.
The disease that I met in my family and after, a surprise that I've been surprised, let's happen to be the best opportunities I'm not on the Facebook.
And outside of that, the opportunities just took the door and science, the time you see what the reasons don't come back.
All this was a little bit of a little bit.
But the list was left.
The knowledge of life over the years of surprising was in one gender of what we've been looking for, is we're going to give us others to the future, whether we're going to get to it.
And then, when I started to make my list, I was doing one of my time -- and I was looking at stories for a lot of time.
And I've found them every year we've got 100 years in the first 100 years.
"27!" Thanks of big kids, suddenly, "" -- Jacus Soviet. ""
I've been Paul Paul, of course, why I've been asking questions about it.
First of all, we're living today more and that's why we need better.
Chris France, we've been using the CEO's Center to describe 53, a hundred years after the morning morning was described in the age of 36.
And I remember that life also knows to change in the privacy of the same year, and that every person might live the same size.
But also, as the list came out, it was also about the wall, in the South, in the South in the mirror, it turned out to be the life that I've experienced: I found that in the age of 20 "Oh," I found less safe than "and" and "and" and "Pri
I found there myself.
Of course, we're all there.
Milton Gullin, the big designer, which is the great design of wonderful design you see here, and now it's 85 years -- every year "that's called" The Baye "--" "as the real, as the real colors and the West will help us remember that we're living.
And indeed, when I showed the list to the environment, it's when they're out of it.
He was then 95 and most of the death, and that's, as a Bertie Robert Baye, "as not the world."
And I remember that he told me, a huge artist that at 22 we've never been safe, as we've also taken a room called Einstein who said, "I'm going to say that '90s," Berkeley' 90s. "
It happened to me like them.
Now the list of what we're doing is a hundred years.
And when I'm trying it, it's clear to me that we're not going to do an example.
We've lived before, we have many more factors to write them.
And in remember Miller, I'm sorry in the '44 years.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Her back.
Today.
I went.
It's great.
SK.
His mom.
Why?
Technological process that every decade is going on every month, for half of its life.
The phenomenon that it's so meaningful until the survival of the human species depends on it.
And we're still treating it as a pain.
We feel so hard to talk about it.
When I got back to the first time, I told me to keep it in the end of the others even from my father.
More later, when this village comes in our local school and our teacher to biology and about the subject.
And you know what I learned from that?
I learned it's really important to talk about it.
I learned to look at my body.
I've learned to continue not to pay attention to my next region to stay "what I've learned."
A study in different areas of India shows that three out of every 10 cities don't know what they're going to get back to the first time.
And in some cases of Georgian, this number comes even to the investment of 10 cities that don't know anything.
Maybe I've been surprised to hear that most of the girls I've been talking about is that we didn't know anything about their first cycle while they thought they've got cancer and they're going to die in the morning.
The leader at the time of return is a kind of important risk in the daily system.
But in India, just 12 percent of the cities and women have access to the digital ways to treat their region.
If you do the sensor again 88 percent of the women and women use the middle of their own region.
I was one of them.
I grew up in a small town called Garardia, in Jerusalem, in Jerusalem, where even the genetic weapons thought to talk about.
So when I started the cycle and I started with using environments.
After every year I was writing them and use it.
But to sustain them, I've been looking at them, and I'll show them in a very important place to live so that no one knows I'm in the region.
Because of the foreign boundaries have become advertising, and sometimes there's an unprecedented plan because of the use of them.
I've used me for five years until I've been doing this apartment.
The kind of thing that the cycle brought to the experience is of the social limitations that are dealing in women while the new region.
I think you're going to be aware of this, but I still want them to be the same for the trees that you don't know.
I didn't want to find any half.
I didn't want to sit on the screen or on the bed of some of the family.
I had to cover my experience after every return, even if it wasn't ready.
And I thought, "Twitter 100" I'm not going to get out of the summer that I have important reasons.
You're going to see teachers outside people who don't get on the income of women and cities in the region.
In Iraq, most of the time this is the faster woman who's preparing these galaxies on young women in the family.
After all, they've come in with you that they're getting these global limits.
And in the city of all of these interventions, they're the places and the metaphors that exist to happen.
For the years I've been working in this field, and I'm going to find it even in stories where cities should be able to get their tools in France.
They don't have to live in the time of the cycle, and in some cases, they're even building other family.
Throughly 85 percent of the women in India and women in India, are more than one of their cybercriminals in every month.
You can imagine what it does to the self-esteem and the self-concept of a young girl?
The psychological training that it's around, to affect its own humanity, about its local genes, and all of the other people's problems in the early years, these nervous nerves?
I'm going to teach all of these limitations for 13 years, until I'm interested in my body, Tana, changed my perception to the picture.
In 2009, Titan and I'm going to have a model of design.
I understood this in my identity and I felt like to talk about my region.
Here's a very little bit about the cycle.
So he's not to find that there's a platform that's a team that we die in every month.
But yes.
He was completely scared when he grew up on the roofs that were scared on women and cities in time return by their families and their society.
To help me with my design is to go to the Internet and prevent the cycle.
When he part his cameras and I realized how little I knew about myself.
And a lot of our countries have turned out to be almost like engineers.
So we started wondering: If our knowledge, I was so surprised that we could have been so wrong about the region, and we've got millions of other cities out there with a motivation.
In order to learn -- to understand the best problem I've developed in a different study, to learn about the moral corruption of the innovation that's about the problem behind.
While there's a great problem to believe that inevitable inevitably to the new region of our new drugs is a problem as a village, during our research, and that's a problem that's the problem of principles in the same country.
And it's also in the main countries that can.
When I started with a lot of parents and teachers and teachers and many of them really wanted to education cities about the region before they started getting the box.
YR: But they were inevitable.
And because it's a fabric and they're important for me to talk about it.
Babylaces get back today in the classroom and Jazi, but our audience programs are learning about the region of the region and the classroom.
And because it's an astronomy that's still causing the subject.
So the school didn't teach cities about the region, the parents don't talk about it.
The forest countries?
Two decades ago, nothing changed.
I've opened these structures with a little bit of India: What if we can create something that's going to help build the cycle themselves -- something that's going to help the teachers and talk about the connections of young girls?
Over the research, I collected a lot of stories.
These were the stories of girls' experiments during their region.
These stories became interested in curiosity and curiosity when they're talking about their bodies.
This is what we wanted.
We wanted something we wanted to do the basic home and know them to learn about it.
We wanted to use these stories to learn about return.
So we decided to create a local book, where the virtuous countries that live these stories and have to work on the back in the way that I've been doing.
Because we're all going to represent in different parts of the behavior, we have three countries.
Before I still didn't get back, Jana who receives the cycle at the same time of the book and the teacher who has already got the region.
There's many reasons, France and India.
And as a result, girls come to know the different effects of the adults and the leadership community from the back.
While we created the book, and we'll say that no one of the air would have been the power of women through a different way of making culture.
While the typical house, we found that the house liked the book.
They'd be easy to read us to know more about the cycle itself.
The teachers and teachers had to talk about the region in young girls within the book, and sometimes even the buildings were going to read it.
I won't have been able to make a environment that's going to be fabric.
Many of them are going to take the prototype of the book themselves to education and take data on the back of different countries in India.
And one of the reasons to take the prototype to young teachers and take it to the strategy of a blog.
We've created the last version of the book, which is called "Mexico Mexico."
And until now, more than 4,000 bounds within our schools in India -- Applause) Thank you.
Thank you and 10 different countries.
We're all excited about the book of two seconds and participate with local organizations to make the book in different countries.
Last 15 books in different parts of India have done the book to some of the school programs to learn about their region.
Thank you, I don't know how you're building, people, parents, teachers, schools and schools, we're going to take the data back to their communities, and I'm going to say that I've been working to learn about the region in the size of the matrix and the cells will help for the pain.
I've got to think about the future of return is not easy, not a disease, but a change in a way of learning.
And I've been -- I'd like to end with a little woman to all the parents here.
Today, if you're going to look at the region, your home will also be asked.
So please have to go back.
Thank you.
Thank you.
How do you find dinosaurs?
It sounds impossible, right?
It's not.
And the answer is based on the growth that all of the project uses it.
And I'm going to show you the Chinese.
First of all, we've found a journey in the right age.
Secondly, these students have to be a tool.
And three, the traffic layers have to be important in nature.
That's it.
We found these three things and just the nation, the best that you're in.
Now let me solve the sample.
It's just about certain geological organisms.
So you need to find training in the right age, give you what's interesting to you.
If you want to find robots, you need to find a really interesting journey from the physician -- you're going to go between half a billion years.
Now, if you want to find dinosaurs, don't look at the physicist, you don't find them.
They didn't evolve yet.
You need to find young people from the food, and in the case of dinosaurs, at the age of 236 million years.
Now, it's easy to find Islam at this right point, because the Earth, in a large level.
That's why it's a hard job.
The details of the Earth's Earth's history, one in the past, so the future's worse at the bottom of the top.
Now, if it was like this, geologists were happy.
It's not.
The book of the Earth is a future.
It doesn't have a story.
It's a long period of time, as a big amount of geological processes offer all of the period of the future.
Most of the bees are perfect after they're writing.
A few pounds are written, and you create a big, and you make a difference to a month of a surface that's going to disappear by time.
And it's a place that's found under the early hospital of the time that we've never been safe.
Basically remote -- our global participation -- the Earth's planet, with creative forces and the hormones that prevent our ecosystem.
A new tragedy that was built by asteroid asteroids, even everyone's training about the size of the sun system.
The road they've learned.
The Earth's Earth, on the other hand, are standing in the training of a living corner.
They're all suffering, a way that's wearing a dog of the rainforest, and a box, a motor, a train, and so forth.
So, as the history of the Earth doesn't perfect and surprise.
The library is a wonderful, but bad.
And it was this bad complexity in the journey that I made the meaningful meaning recently.
The natural nature doesn't end up with geologists -- he had to be found.
Fifty thousands of years after they're going to learn to invent their computers on regret, the Earth and the rest of the country and the human beings.
We've been biological heroes, we don't know the future of our platform and connections to our lab time.
It wasn't going to go to the beginning of the 19th century, the first time, with the privacy of the Earth's Earth's theater's theater, where he told us that the Earth doesn't remember going to go to the end; and then, with this box of the map of the Britain that we've created if
After that, you can say things like, "If you go there, there's a bee," Oh, if you're going to go beyond this hour, we need to find the democracy. "
So now, if you want to find robots, we've got to design a good geologist to train the sky of the physicist.
If you want to find dinosaurs like I'm looking for, you're looking for the food and I'm going to go there.
Now, of course, you can find very building in a journey, a rock that's created from a summer.
You couldn't have a very, very, in a concept that's created by Gabby, like Guardian, or in a concept that's being scared.
And you need to get to speak.
It's not the two dinosaurs together in the desert; they're living on all the nation around the possibilities.
It's that you need to go to the place that it's talking today, a place where there's not a lot of plants on the road, and a place where you're always afraid of the surface.
So we've found these three things: Selfare in the right age, which they're going to go on, in the desert, and you're the molecules going until you see nervous nerves from the road.
Here's a picture that's going to take in a digital bees.
Each stone that you see on the ground there is a printer of a dinosaurs.
So when you're in the right situation, it's not a question of whether you're going to find a very, or not; you're going to find a lot of buildings.
The question is: Do you find something that's important science?
And to help with this, I'm going to add a great part of our grandmother, which is this: the power of the power that you can from other psychologists.
And it's not that I don't like other psychologists.
When you get to a place that doesn't go back, you have a much better chance not just to find buildings but find something new to science.
So that's my grandmother to find dinosaurs, and I've got it around the world.
In the green summer of 2004, I went to the bottom of America, to the bottom of TV, organization, to look for dinosaurs: a place that's going to move on the surface of the right age, instead, where there's a biological connection.
And we found it.
It's the way, nervous nerve, a dinosaurs or a tree.
It's about 2.2 meters.
It's more than two meters.
Now, unfortunately, this nerve was a building.
France and Friday Friday, and there wasn't more nervous in the environment.
But she gave me a father to go back to the next year.
And in the first day of the next year, we found this: We've been looking through an important thing, just this time it didn't understand, this time it was together with 145 other objects of every tree.
And after three weeks later, there's a Britain, the disease looks like this.
And there you see the feedback of the tremendous creatures spread around me.
We've known that as this thing, the new species of dinosaurs, which in the end of Berkeley called "New York Times."
And Darwin was in the way 26 meters were able to move.
It's about three and a half years and a half in the kitchen, and with all the body in life, it's got 65 tons.
People ask me sometimes, "Would the cartoon be big from Torus?"
It's the engineer of eight or 10 light.
Now one of the really cool things about being wonderful is that when you find new species, you need to give them there.
And I was always thinking that it was scared that these eyes, there were dinosaurs or all the plants that are many times as long as a plane in the bridge of the planet and the surface.
And they're not.
Or a big tool can be proud, and they can be electronic -- you don't want to deal with the iPhones or the East.
The building in Clinton affected a lot more people from Congress and time.
So can you imagine a big memory, New York Times that's about 65 tons of the street problems, a magazine on the Twitter?
This animal was a very dangerous chance, and it's all around the environment, and myself, I didn't have something to fear of it.
And so the name, "New York Times," I'm not afraid of anything. "
Now, go to a big big age, experience like Darwin had to be a model of activity.
The long axis and the long axis help us make a life to the environment, and there's a besides in our temperature.
And this long-term side also serves like a genius can be a great village.
And Darwin can stand everywhere and with this quote before a big category of plants, put hundreds of thousands of dollars in a very little bit.
And these animals opened up a biologist in biology, what they'll give them a liquid team, because when you've got 65 tons, when you've got big molecules like a house, you've got to do with polio is art.
Yes, these animals were big, but they didn't have these machines.
And when Democrats were scared, I've been scared that I've got to see.
The things come out.
If you're a big cartoon that's 65 trillion, you can't turn in life -- even one time.
Now, after this virus of the virus and it's been built in the mortality of electronics, and sometimes insects have gone through this strategy, when we've started molecules with water and become more like the road.
When it's over the layer of two tricks, the stress of all the trees to expect as a summer that the nurse is the opposite of their reduction and the whole nervous nervous nervous nerve in the street.
And then it got everything.
The long.
There's still the same thing, you don't know without a number.
When all of the time, the third pain has always changed a perfect change inside the train.
In the day, the history of the Earth is going on over.
We were dinosaurs and sent about 12 million years ago that their country was going on in Paul Poland.
We were on it. We were on it.
The ice was coming.
And then, in East Africa, a species of costs developed the strategy of information thinking.
These stimulators didn't exist or powerful.
But they've been studying in the walls of the wall, and in the end, we've come out and we've even got the list of the dinosaurs in the kitchen, they've come back to the space, they're going to go around the corner that they've been born, and over the way, the
With seven billion oceans on the platform, it might be inevitable that one in the end of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit that's been talking underneath the platform of Titana.
I was this person.
And when I was there, alone in the desert, I'd know that the risk of every person to get into the design is a little bit of creativity.
But the Earth is really important.
And over the time, it's time, it's impossible to be possible.
It's the magic of the geologist.
So, a number of creatures that we've been living on the rich platform that we've left behind and they're like a huge amount of buildings, each of a little experiment, but together, I've got no science.
Two years ago, there's a million years ago, asteroids and the Earth represents the dinosaurs.
It's a hospital that can't happen.
But we get just one history, and it's the one we have.
But this particular reality wasn't inevitable.
That's a little bit of the asteroid and the Earth was caused to solve our platform in a big price.
Today, we've been able to change the reality of the dinosaurs and research, the risk of the modern world that we know there wasn't going to happen.
It could be another simple -- a half years or maybe -- between 63 billion days of them were dinosaurs and already.
But over time the geologist, events don't explain, almost impossible possibilities happen.
Over the time of our ancestors, some of us were speaking to doctors for women in part, there's no story in the way we've got us to find this particular reality.
The nervous self of Darwin has been living under the ground for 77 million years.
Who could imagine a lot of babies and a monitor who was living in the Chinese world and opened up to the women who were able to fix and understand the dinosaurs of them in a fear?
I've ever been at the beginning of the microscope, and I've tried my legs over the two genes.
There, it's not more than a water that's coming under one hour, high in the Internet.
We've been part of a few meters and a few meters in a little bit.
There's two of these parts -- they're called this.
But one is an infinite platform, and the last one is the muscle.
Now to make a murder, Los Angeles, and it's a great thing that it's a big thing.
But I could go into the Internet and look at the museum, and the human perspective doesn't allow us to see it as something special.
Now go back to the Democratic dot and look at the house and the tiny and the sky and the French.
You'd never feel that they'd come to something special, and they probably didn't be, if not that asteroid.
Now, we've created thousands of times and thousands of systems that are used to accept.
You've never got the same result.
Unfortunately, these global warming will also be inevitable, but they're not our world to have our history.
There's a number of history that we can be.
We're getting just one, Nico, we've got one good.
And dinosaurs like New York Times were real.
Palestinians like dinosaurs were real.
Ford with a page of a blind blind blind town in the size of a really cool car.
Why do we explore the far past?
Because it's possible to give us a good perspective.
We were dinosaurs and in the average world's fighting, and we've been dealing with the Muslims that don't fit.
They didn't see it coming, and they didn't have a choice.
For me, by the time, there's a clear thing.
And the nature of the response to us that our place in the party is also too nice.
Right now, our species are caused to Asian around biological scale so far, that you can read in the other side of the year.
Once we're growing dinosaurs, we can see it coming.
And in New York dinosaurs, we can do something about it.
This choice is our own.
Thank you.
Thank you.
There's a second thinking that's going to get to TED results: "You're going to want to show a big song."
"I'm going to tell a story."
"Think human experiment."
"Life in the morning, I'm going to see a great experiment."
No.
It doesn't have to be a relationship to TED.
In fact, there's a chimpanzee that's used by these factors just to show you because there's a treatment for good women.
But there's one thing that's going to be used to participate to all the big lights of TED Talks, and I want to share with you, because I've already been sitting in the best 12 years in the room and since there's a lot of TED Talks, like this.
I helped them prepare their lectures for a moment, and I've learned to survive their experiences: what makes a great talk.
And even though all of their creatures and their issues to a very different light of those, there's actually a center of one center that's going to be used for everyone.
And here's: Your first task, as you want, is to get to the brain since you're going to have a brain in the country -- the strategy and the revolutionary and the revolution in President "idea."
Let me show you why I mean.
This is the voice.
It's going to give the TED Talk, and it's actually one of the land.
[Virgin: Hollywwood!
Thank you for 18 minutes, 1,200 people, many of them have never met it, find that their brains start to contract with this brain with this brain.
They're really beginning to represent them in a brain galaxy.
And I don't mean they just feel them emotional.
And there's something more amazing.
Let's take a moment into the brain of the voice.
A billion nerve cells are related there in unimpossible.
But look here, right here -- millions of them are connected in their hands in a way that makes one idea together.
And not an artist, but let's take us reform in real time in their brains of all the changes.
Right: In a very popular baby, a million cells will get into 1,200 brains, just out of the evolution in the face.
But for a moment. What's the idea?
You can see the patterns of information that's going to help understand the world and look at.
The ideas have all sorts of great creativity, the complexity and the intuition to the autism.
Here are some examples from TED.
San Franciscin: creativity is the key to the future of California.
[San Franciscin] Ron] Roberson]: I'm sorry is that the creative day in education is just like a piece of writing, and we have to encourage it to be awesome.
Chris Anderson: Maybe the list, it's great to build in the building.
[] Eric] maybe the Eric: It's growing everywhere, it's a powerful material, an alarm, an astronomy.
CA: Because from ICA, people have more than one.
[] Because from ICA: The only story of asteroids, and the problem with asteroids is not that they're surviving, but they're born in the morning.
CA: Your brain is called ideas, and not bad ideas.
There's exactly what they need.
In together, they're creating a complex structure to patients -- not the one that's surprising to you.
That's the revolution of your mind.
It's a way to find in the world.
And it's complex from millions of different ideas.
For example, if some small component of your surprise is the idea that you're scared, so when you're looking at it, you'll respond like this.
But if it's another component to you, it's the idea that they're dangerous, it's when you're going to look at it, you'll respond to another group.
Obviously, if, why is there important important for the ideas of what's going to affect you.
You think they're going to be an artist as possible, that there's a great way to the global world, the fear of fear, but it's wonderful that around you.
The slides of people might be very different.
For instance, how do you surprise to you from this country?
"Should you be"? "
And maybe, "Somebody who's like," "" The brain "" "" "?"
CA: You're going to be in your own, there's millions of people who're going to respond to another.
And so the ideas are really important.
When you put them right, power to change the way someone think about the world, and to design the industry now in the first future.
The idea is the most powerful power in human culture.
So if you're receiving you that the main summer you want is to build a idea in their brains since your hands, you're going to have four experts to design this: 1.
The ideas are complex things; you have to find out where you can deal with the only idea, that the most important to you, and give yourself an opportunity to explain this thing like you need.
You've got to provide the connection, examples, to get it.
So in the back of one idea, we're going to make us what you're going to be for the second force in all the talk, so all you're saying to me somehow.
Two. Thank you for your audience not care.
Basically, you're going to start building things inside their brains, you have to get the lights to get there.
And what's the first investment for that?
Social.
I've just read the curiosity of the audience.
We've used some traditional questions from thinking to identify what the didn't make sense.
If you're going to replace a solution in the investment of somebody, it's a new way to survive this.
And as you've made this need, you'll have a lot to start with your idea.
Three. You've built the idea and you're going to go through, you've got your audience already.
We've used the power of the language to keep drugs that are already in their brains since you -- but not in the rest of you.
We started from their average countries.
You want to forget that many of the brains and the answers that they're going to help their audience.
And a place that can be dealed as a device in the sense of how everything goes together, because they show the creation of the box and look at the idea that the sun is already building.
For example, when Januan Frankan asked to explain the amazing biology "Derek," she said, "It's like the first time we've got patients to help us."
"Derek allows you to wait and build a lot of good data."
It's a crisis that's produced a moment of "Ah" when it's too small.
So, it's important that you're going to look at your talk about a place where you're going to find the parts that get them.
Four, the last tree: You've done your idea to see a coffee.
I mean, you ask yourself, "Why is this idea?"
And I'd like you to know about this in a program.
If the idea is about you or your organization, I can tell you that we've probably seen to change.
It's the audience in this.
But if you believe that the idea is going to bring the power to someone else's minds or to change the conversation of your attention, or to avoid someone else to do something else, because then you have a really big talk of a really big talk, as it can be when they're going to have.
How do you need to know about a person before you feel again and let the audience be?
Let's imagine that you want to give 1,000 dollars to the person who's sitting in two decades behind you.
What would you have to know about this person before you feel together?
My mom came to the United States from India in the late '30s.
It's a doctor in Brooklyn, and many times it's about people who are going to come to health care, whether they can pay countries or not.
I remember when I met in her patients with her instructions or on the complexity, and sometimes they'd be paid and pay attention to a place for different meetings.
She was ready for them, and I asked them about their families and their health.
She gave them an artist who saw because she was safe.
Most of us like me.
We've been the data that we've seen for somebody who we've known for children.
But most of us probably don't go to the back but if we know a little bit about it.
In the day, companies that we've seen other experiments don't know us at a human level, but they have a way to look at us, and it's through our Israeli.
And our Israeli and our Israeli created a way of collecting the public information and our consumption.
And in the galaxy, we have access to all the studies and service that we need, receiving electrical electricity, maybe risk at the bottom.
But...
There's 2.5 billion people around the world that they don't have a Israel.
This is three of the world's population.
They don't have a virtue because they don't have their regulation -- there's no thought of us, there's no history that we've seen there's no number of insurance.
And because they don't have a virus, they don't have access to the economic products or Israel that can improve their lives.
They don't look at them.
So we wanted to find a way to build this artist and open the physical approach for 2.5 billion.
So we've created an evolution that we've seen for scientists.
There's now more than billions of metaphors in the markets.
And people use them in the same way like us.
They send statistics to their friends, they're looking for the baby, they're used to put in the Internet and they even do physical business.
Over time, this information is very happy in our dollars, and it's enough a very rich picture of human life.
Our customers give us access to this information and we're making it through our fingerprints.
It's going to help us understand the Israel of people like January, a small business in New York City.
January is 65, and for decades, it's been active in the central region.
It's got three days that it's working in a professional school, and it also leads her local jihad, I'm a group of suffering.
And then the food of January's food is very successful.
It does enough tools to cover the results.
But it's not economic savings.
Anyway, insects it into the street.
And it doesn't have the income to improve the way of the family's life.
If Johnard wants to see, her options are limited.
It can get a management, but it's going to need to create a group that can go to her art.
And even then, the audience agreed with me was a little bit too small because they really had the effects on her business, in average 150 dollars.
Chris Chris is is always an option, but with a lot of high city and a lot of 300 percent, they're economic programs.
And because January Friday Arab or Israeli Israeli, it can't go to the building and have business audience.
But one day, the son of January's son who's convinced it to demand the emissions and the president.
January made a couple of questions on her Berller and I would have access to some data about her device.
And here's what we saw.
The bad news.
January Prize has a concept of a low risk, and there's no extinction that we don't have.
It's the causes that were English and English.
But there were other points in her history that showed us a lot more rich than its potential.
So first, we've seen that it's hard to take a phone to her family in Uganda.
Well, it turns out that the data shows about four percent of the regrets in people who are happy with some people who are surviving with some people.
And we can also see that even though it's going on a lot of the day, in fact, the community of motivation and knowledge, and it's been in the house or its food.
And the data shows about three percent of the regrets in the forests that work in places where they spend most of the time.
And we can also see that it's been trained with a lot of different people over the day and it's got a beautiful network.
Our data shows that people who communicate with more than 58 people who tend to be better.
In the case of January France, it's dealing with 89 different people, which shows on the cost of an hour in its return.
It's just a couple of different data that we're looking at them to understand the value of a person.
And after these different experiences, we took the first risk of data and Jeopardia.
That's why there wasn '
But it's a real power.
When you look beyond the income, we can see that people in the markets that we might see certain ways and not expect the surface of the surface and actually have the ability to go back.
And our Israeli Robert helped us provide more than 200,000 managers in a less than a year.
There's our refugees that are over 90 percent -- by the way, are easy to invest in traditional buildings.
With something just like a gene that we saw, we give people the power to build their future.
Our customers were used by their reality to find families, teachers, teachers and the investment came back in their business.
They're now building better economies where more people can succeed.
For the last couple of years of using our product, January's largest village in her 60 percent.
He also started to change more food and now a government car.
It's a hard approach to give us a little business from commercial, because now there's the history that we've seen that it's great.
I saw January in New York City for a week, and she told me how excited it was to start.
She said, "I just believe I can do that.
I didn't think it's for me. "
Our task now is to open the world to January and the billions of times like the one that comes to them.
Thank you.
Thank you.

I'm an artist, but I'm a little different artist.
I'm not painting.
I don't know to paint.
My teacher went to write a letter in my job that I'm dangerous.
I'm sure you don't want to see images that I wanted to.
But there's something I do: I know to design computers.
I know program.
You tell me that about 100 years ago, people like me didn't exist, it wasn't possible, that art that created with data is a new thing, a product of our eye, something that's important to see as "very". "
And this is true.
But there's a real creativity that's already very long, and it's going to happen in science, science and spread, to create emotions and emotions.
[]] Thanks of four, 2009]] []]]]]]]]]]]] &#
We create music for tens of thousands of years, right?
And if you think of the music -- data, air, developing, countries and molecules -- these things are algorithms, systems.
We've been going to start with a long time to a emotion.
I came to art through music.
I've learned to live, and about 15 years ago, I started to write creativity that I've been looking for a picture where I've been able to use a very powerful structure to make a model or use to use something that's interesting about something that's about how it's built.
What you're seeing on the screen in real time by the Mexico County and the Mexico Mexico that's producing the average institutions, and it's not in case like a plant, because the biological algorithm of the plant is the microbial science of Mexico.
So when you know to do that, when you know to plan in a country, you can create really cool things.
It's a project that I created for the movie of the movies "Sox."
The idea really simple: You take all this film as a curiosity, you'll put it into one point that repeat all together.
So for 75 minutes, I can show you the history of the Hollywood.
And it's actually bringing the history of the decade to the India.
On the left, you see "Glaser," imagine, "Shanging."
And you can see, "Glaser" a little bit easier to see.
Because the average way of "Twitter" and we know in the 1940s was 26 seconds, and now it's about six seconds.
It's a project that's been affected from the French government at the beginning of the 21st century, in the police to look at filmmakers and find a game in any video.
So I've explained this software to the system after one person in our culture that doesn't have to work after this: Britain Speak.
I've just been 2,000 pounds of Britain and I've learned my computer to website, and my face.
I can run all of her video and the software to central the eye, and it's a variety of interest in our society.
We're full of fear of the fact that we've been working on, but as a data about our lives know.
What you're seeing on the screen is my collaboration with art called Lan Amazon.
What she did was very easy to explain to the describe, but very hard to do.
It took 72 minutes of the plan of the plan to a child in the city, represents them over three days and spending it in a New York Times.
I've also been there, with a huge team.
And then we've got the process, we've invented it again to 72 minutes, because it looks like it's a big future when all the world is released around.
And at some point I realized that I actually did not make a video.
When you think about creativity, you think about things like this.
On the left, it's a university.
It's very much like the real video and the first Americans.
And this species will be a production of George Washington, from 186.
The machine's "Don't try."
When you look at this painting, you see a lot of symbols, right?
You see, there's a window there.
On the table we have a little bit.
It's all going to show John Washington and Washington as the nation.
Here's my point, of George Washington.
That's just the kind of medical building, but instead of the same, there's words.
They're 66 words that come from John James and Washington, where it's used more than any other man.
The word "Jim Talks" has a symbol that's used by her.
And there's important for this where it's used more than any.
That's the evidence of John James Bush, because they've got when I've created it.
And the way we've come here, from "James Twitter" in 43 children, says a lot about the American history, and you can give you a different year than you've got a series of creatures.
These creatures are enough of America's leadership through the political history of leadership.
It's just Derek Derek, and it's just a lot of mistakes.
Bill Clinton talked a lot about the 20th century in which they're not as a human, but maybe I'll ask.
Linson Johnson was the first president that I'm going to get my mother in the hours of TV; he opened every philosophy in the word "Arab."
And Richard Darwin, I'm true, because my letter is my place, and I'm a kid if a story, thought a lot about the use of language, and I've changed very much about my boss that my boss are going to listen in Britain.
This project represents a kind of stimulus.
It's an extinction of a theory.
And it's important to realize that they're building right now, so if you're going to stand up at six feet and you can read between the two black dots, you've just seen your interview.
And it's a point, and there's a lot of this.
There's a lot of ways to do this with data.
At the beginning, I felt a way to create a more democracy, something that's tougher to our country and how it's functioning.
Imagine 10 years we're doing ways in the U.S.
We're really advertising people, find a brain where, what people work, what language is things in home.
And this is important, very important.
But it doesn't really tell us who we are.
It doesn't really tell some of our colleagues that we have.
So in 2010, I decided to go from my face.
I started looking for the data that's been able to look for a lot of theories that have been written in normal Americans.
And it turns out that there's this data that's just waiting for you to use.
He's called "The Social Foundation."
So in 2010, I've been trained to 21 deaths, as an amazing man, as the Texas Sovil School, as a woman to suffer and when the Tassian Texas, in every country in America, I've just been about 19 million policies -- about 20 percent of all the population in the United States.
I have a privilege privacy.
It's a shock and a nation.
And I've learned all this before my country.
And I've spent a hospital.
They're a few privacy from 2010 when the word "for" to "meeting.
If you turn it into a map, and you imagine that color in parents represent a lot in the word, you can see that the Egyptians are a place where we learn.
You can see, also, in Berkeley doesn't fun.
So here's the map of the students. What you see in the environment -- and you can see in three women in Asia because maybe create a connection with men and Mexico and Mexico to do life.
And I've just been here to take a car to learn, so I can find you that the men in the East of Canada's East Olympic and a lot more interesting to get men in the West's West's West's West's West's West.
It's going to be the most important lesson of all the income.
You remember this fact for 30 years.
And I'm sure to you. When you go to the democracy, you can train from a car and do what I did with the medical building.
Instead of every city in the United States, you can get the word where you use more than any other place.
It seems to be a pretty cool sense.
Here's the words "Here," "" "" "" in the morning, "the phenomenon," San. "
Scientists there to be a tool and industry.
And just over that, you can see the word "Love."
It's just a place where Washington, the control of President Mexico.
Some of the words from these are: Los Angeles is "San Francisco" is "Gray."
Some of them are a little bit more sad.
In Atlane Robert, we're talking about "Field", "in Iraq," still talking about the phone.
In America, people still say they're "interesting."
In the morning, they're told that they're afraid.
That's Jersey.
I grew up with a doctor between "Man" to "."
I'm Applause) And in New York City one word is "right now," I'm working as a village, but I'm actually a player. "
And I'm like, "I'm now going to try in the University of New York, but I'm actually an artist."
If you're going to go out, you'll see "New York Times": That's a virus.
The best food in Syria in New York City in New York City.
It's in the morning of a little artist called "Water on the road."
It's for us to take somebody to our children.
I'm worried about "without a" to "the summer", "for the TV.
That's the regulation, so you've got a little girl, "That's" "" "" "" "" and "OK."
So maybe it's a more democracy, right?
The idea was to build what's going on if we're looking at countries and in blue before what we're going to do in the West.
It's a project itself.
He's based on his DNA, about 5,000 letters of DNA letters that were sent for 20 years.
You can think about it as a kind of "Speak". "
I'm going to run my physics on my personal data.
It's described everything I wrote with.
It started in the center of a big spread.
And between everybody who's a kind of disorders about the amount of letters is "in their hands, with who they've written.
And it's also emotional. If I say, "I love you," There's no more depression.
And he's going to go to my school and he's "Love, in the center, that's full of participation in the system.
And all the names are built.
Sometimes I do this form with a real time, to get some problem in a certain city.
It's an intuitive intuition of a PPPTD that's used to be used in the French of the French Olympic Berkeley before two years ago, the love of love, in love and power of life.
That's my clothes.
That's the house that's the green energy.
This project requires a little full of engineering.
I've been talking to a chair that's known for the architecture of computer.
The computer computers are digital in the environment.
It's the one that's going to fight for patients, to be reduced.
And the computer was sitting in the network of a normal interest.
So with a total tool on Richard Richard -- and we're going to see it.
It's a moral, not to know real.
There's a big theory, a lot of noise, and the most important -- a platform.
In New York City, there's about five main events, so for the four months since I was this form, the culture is full of words.
You know that. That's "The French of data."
When you do it true, it's very interesting.
When you do it for the wrong, it makes the senses.
It becomes human beings for numbers.
So let's go.
A recent form.
In the last summer, I was an artist of a metaphor.
And as a particular as New York Times is in the world's global side.
And one of the things that you don't know about, is that it's the website that's on the best Internet in the world.
Throughly five seconds of somebody's doing "Speak" in Twitter.
It's about 18,000 people, and everyone in me.
So here's some of them, when the eyes are complex.
Each culture will use technology that's going to change to create art.
And after the artist's mother's mom is to make questions about this technology and how it's spending our culture.
So think about it: I'm more than numbers.
We're human beings, and we have some ideas.
And our career learned data from us.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Hello.
That's my first message, for the first time in my life, I'm going to find out out out of this business.
I'm so happy to be here.
Thank you so much, I'm always going to be a cartoon. Texas, feel free for the sky, to touch the sky.
But it doesn't happen.
Just: I'm living in this, and there's no answer.
All the roads are closed, from all the side.
We live in one of the world's largest privilege.
The only thing I can do is look at the sky.
In some days, we have lucky if we have electricity for four or five hours.
As a device, we're learning a teacher in the house or on the roof.
Sometimes we call it food.
In that, my work is to organize everything for the data that are involved in words to tell the stories about what's happening in this past.
There were many bees where I was going to go to the global region to collect data.
If there's something that's going to happen to the journalists, or if the journalists decide to the story that the government doesn't want to try, can happen bad things.
The New York in the country has helped the journalists, we've created films, new team -- that's my work.
I believe that I've been able to have a creative future of relationships not just with new journalists, but also with the different communities that live in this process.
Here's these communities, that don't want the story and they're told, I'm going to see stories or numbers.
They're humans like us.
For decades, I created a lot of relationship systems.
And you know what?
It enables us access to people and stories that don't have others.
In some situations, I feel like a woman, we have more power.
Many journalists in the society of our society want to help students in the country.
The problem started with this concept.
In the painting of this, the lights were trying to people all the basic ways like food, materials and other things.
But it's pretty proud, because the civilization represents the lights in the water and they're not active.
The street there are many young Muslims and so many know.
In the Palestinian society, men don't have to go into the refugees.
So there's a journalist and I can't get this writing.
But I could.
I've got a wonderful husband, a wonderful woman who's going to die for the general although he's kind of a company.
Now it's in the house, with a baby, and we have one more that's growing here, in the face.
Thank you, when I'm working, I call it two hours, and she knows that if you don't hear it, I have to survive my survivor, it allows me to give the story, a person I'm looking at.
In one of the surprises, in this, I was in the Britain's Britain's Britain, Alexon, and I was asked by the Nigerian Foundation in the past with the patients, and I was able to do this.
The journalist who's finished the teacher and I'm asked to get out of my phone.
They came in, we collected us in a selection that was black with some of them, they're going to wear traffic.
And they put us on the street, to find a year.
They took hundreds of us the mobile phones and did the internet with the outside outside, the same year.
At the same day I was so cool, it was today that I didn't forget.
So, why do I do that?
Because I believe that if I didn't do that, I'm missing some kind of story of this.
I can tell you other stories about my country.
And they're not all bad.
I love Arabic, although a terrible situation is called -- a painting, a cat -- but there's life.
There's a place, and there's a amazing people and full of a shock.
We've got a great institution in "Syria" to Mexica.
We've got New York City Darwin in in their homes.
And it's also the only place in the Arab world where Muslims create life in one good.
Thank you for war, it's hard to leave the house in the morning, to help us.
I find them every day because I don't know if I'm going to go back to them.
It's hard to be an organization and the same problem.
But when I hate the galaxies and the bombs, I'm going to survive there, because I want to be there first, because these stories are going to tell.
When we were small children and we heard the war molecules, I told them that this is a big question.
Today they've discovered are already building.
I've got an academic experiments because all I've been interested in war, especially those little boxes of small children.
I still remember a little girl, which is the name.
He's the only one that survived from her family.
It's going to take the picture.
I'll never forget it.
I'm proud to stand here and be today with you.
I'm proud to tell the story, the trees and the experts, stories about the little slide in the world, this.
I'm proud to be the first organizations I've been working on this.
And the savings is that in the past, it's called "There's no normal."
And I hope that one day I'm going to tell me the story of women, all the wonderful women I know in the country.
I hope that one day I can help women and other women in the country to be organizations, like us.
And sometimes, of course, I feel that I can't do it, which is too much for me.
But I remember these words: "Don't tell me your challenges; I'm challenging your limits.
"Don't take others to stand in your hands and your dreams."
Thank you.
Thank you.
Would we do what's about to deal with climate change?
I'm going to get to this question not as a Darwin, in fact, I hope I'm my father about who's going to come back.
I'm excited about this as a professional professional design design and as the third of the history of how the history affects us.
One day, this nature, which was my grandfather, was going to build, Charles.
And the same speed of our career might be that after, we thought about the two minutes of life that we've done.
The environment was carbon.
On the right, the French of Cambridge for energy and the economy was a global thing.
Today we know it's not because of the carbon dioxide.
But today, we've been afraid that we've been working in which we've been working better than the climate impact -- the most exciting and even from the industry working around.
I'm obviously working in the industrial industry, who's remember in the crisis of 2008 -- something that represents the attention of the government and the government's attention to some very important security, like the promotion of climate change in California, in 2009, to grow 100 billion dollars a year to help the developing countries in the country to be a very, very, very
This promise is already a safe space.
And that's a real problem, because the transition of energy has to happen faster as possible.
First of all, because we've been reduced more than we've been released in the atmosphere for decades.
There's a second, if a economist opens up and opens its electricity today to us very, and there's a lot more expensive to change that in the future.
So in the climate matter, the history of history is probably the health crisis has happened in time and so on.
But the story doesn't have to be New York.
Three years ago, I argued that governments can use tools that had been made to the physical system to solve other global challenges.
And the same arguments are reduced with the time and not sensors.
What's the same tools? Here's a creativity.
When the French Business in 2008, the central buildings of the United States in Britain began to reduce their government's governments in countries that have known as "The West."
So what's going to happen to these organizations in science, it's where it's there to take money.
And they're the philosophy, and they're still how.
The United States alone has created a value of four trillion dollars in its nature.
It's not going to do very, very, really.
In the year of action, we've shown in the '78 countries that are dealing the international security and the risk of 250 billion dollars in their natural rights -- the brain rights -- to grow the streets around the world.
When the philosophical crisis went to Europe, there's the European center, Mr. Korean, the guy "to do everything that's happening."
And they did.
The building is repeated on these words -- we built the same components -- doing everything that's called "because we don't have their economy.
In the two cases "Everything that's called another electronic meaningful trillion dollars like the printing of money that's going on today.
What it's profound is that we're going to prove some global challenges and in the countries can work together together, and take risks of insects like a money printer.
So let's go back to the original question: can we get money to a local species?
Three years ago the idea to use money and thought we didn't do.
When you're separating the idea that as well as it's limited, governments can be exposed at the speed of women and they're going to get more money to other goals: education, healthy, healthy -- even for security.
And there's a history where some examples really look like the printing of money -- the printing money -- that's a very independent community.
There was a privilege in February in 1930, in the Asia, recently, in 2008, when the Chinese products like a fight and a species.
But all of these things are aware of the public conversation, until so it's a money for the future today in English today and even in some of the political media.
But it's important that the power doesn't help in the kind of a three-dimensional printer.
Because the climate change is a common problem, there are some really interesting reasons that we need to get a privilege like this that's the international nature of nature, to find it.
The special rights is the electronic windows of the internet of the international security that use governments to transform their money.
Think about it as a network of water between colleagues, like the building, but between governments.
And it's really global.
Each one of the 188 companies in the middle of the Bank and the Academy are going to have a special rights as part of their outside nature.
It's a bad meeting that the countries are going to define because it's a natural crisis.
And this global iPhone is the reason that in the President of Finsco, in 2009, the biodiversity of international intervention reduced 250 billion dollars -- because it was a global action that was affected all countries, small, in one.
But -- here's the magazine part.
More than half of those rights have been reduced in 2009 -- about 250 billion dollars -- we had a developing countries where they had a tremendous button on on these trees, because they have a huge task and a fixed window.
So the same drugs that were stop in 2009, ultimately, at least in developing countries, there was no real need.
And they're more unusual.
So here's an idea.
When the first step, why don't we start to find them, to use the privilege plan that we've been stop in 2009, on the resources of climate change?
You can, for instance, use them to use the power of the United States's parents' theory.
The Darwin in 2009, in our climate workers.
It's about money for developing countries to get out there from climate investment.
It was one of the most successful customers, and it was trying almost 10 billion dollars.
But if we use the brain rights that we're going to have, it's going to help governments to go back to the role, and we're going to stand at a 100 billion dollars a year that the physical crisis has been taken.
It's also easy -- it can also be used as a concept.
If the infinite results of using this as the brain plan to be dead, you can be able to offer the other function of a unique rights, from five years, within the streets that have been developed on the streets of the liberal cortex.
There's a few more advantages to take money in art like this as a 3D printer at the national level.
First of all, it's very easy to argue that it's made money to China and climate change.
There's no social sector that's more than others.
It's the problem of insects.
And it's also a gender to say that I've been a very difficult service of countries to be so many other rights, very unlikely that the money is going to take control.
What I've got to finally is a global model -- and it's about global action -- that's a critical action of the world.
In addition, as we've learned from the end of the money, you can get any worse through life.
For instance, you can reduce the regulation of the Social Revolutionary rights, so that this global nature has never been reduced on five percent of the global windows.
It's important, because it's a physician, let's say in Bill, the most sophisticated leadership that can be blind in the United States in the United States from the special rights on the Syrian Pacific Prize.
And in fact, I think, the only thing that the special rights rights might respond to what's going to happen in this method is our neighborhood, "New York City."
Because even with this limitation, the international security and its beautiful facility -- the reasonable features of special rights in 2009 -- to get over 200 billion dollars in the right rights in 2014.
So in a simple way, developing countries can be able to transform a special rights about 300 billion dollars of the green climate.
It's 30 times as I have today.
And you know, as it sounds amazing, it's just starting to look like "Everything that's about."
And just to give you a sense of the amazing things that you can do in this money, think about 2009, and the sample of the Brazil is a billion dollars from its restaurants if it's going to get the meters in the field in the morning or the forest.
Since then, this plan came out of 70 percent in the morning in the last decade.
It's a 3.2 billion tons of carbon carbon dioxide: that's a valuable value to all the American cars for three years.
So what can we do with 300 miles like this, of a toothbrush of roads, which is a global energy in the global?
We can only get a car from the road for a whole generation.
And so, let's not do our robots and ask if we could find climate change.
The real question is: Do we care enough of the next generation to take our risks for the physical system?
After all, we were able to do this, we really did it and we still do it.
We're living, they're saving, they're going to do "Everything that's about."
Thank you.
Thank you.
The interesting fact is, because in the United States and medical design, the most interesting public public public public design.
There's no place to change.
In Africa, where it makes a model, and it's going to be reduced from that.
And that situation can't be right. We need to do something about it.
The healthy environment of the mother's mother's mother's community to develop the same nation.
17 million people die every year from heart disease.
32 million of the cooperation will be built in the summer.
Most of them happen in developing countries, and some of them in Africa.
85 percent of the world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world '
Who is in risk? People like you.
These are not just the African people who need to be worried about this.
Each country and Africa, which is why some reason would be in Africa at some time, should be worried from the rest of this restaurant.
Does somebody in the process what happens if you go back to the road in the Arabic, and you start to feel like a pain, and you create a list, you've got a list?
You're going to go to the heart. What do you're going to do?
Would you go back to the United States, for democracy, not Europe?
No, you're always. 50 percent of the people will die in 24 hours without treatment.
This is what happens.
In the United States of the United States -- this graph here, 10 million in this side, 10 million in this side.
When you get to -- 50, you don't get more people in adult -- life space is 47 years.
Not because some of the people don't survive the molecules -- they're liberal -- but they're not more in life after the age of 45 to 50.
And these are the genes where they're in the president.
They're the leaders where they need to develop the development of Africa, but they're not there.
The best journey to regret into the eyes is to kill the parents.
If you can '
What are the risk of risk?
I'm going to spend a lot of time on me.
These are, just there's the knowledge: more stress, service, service, independent actions.
Here's 30 percent of the people who get more stress.
Twenty-20 percent need a treatment.
It's only less than one percent of them that's going to go to the world's treatment.
If we can treat more stress stress in Africa, we'll create 250 million human lives a year.
It's meaningful to learn! Bill Palestinian. We've seen the situation in the Iraq.
In eight years, we're talking about AIDS, malaria, everything's good.
We can't go back on the mistakes that we've done in Taliba in the ocean.
In a year, women are produced, international diseases have become the public reasons in Africa.
It's something that has to remember. We can't deal with it, with situations like this.
It's a African hospital. We can't agree on the liquid -- they're going to go to the United States, for democracy, to Britain to a political need.
You can't hear about a help in the morning.
It's the situation -- beautiful countries to deal with interventions.
After September 11, the United States had to deal with a lot of problems, on which we face.
So before, they're bringing their money in trying to fix these problems.
I can't -- that's not their responsibility. That's my responsibility. I have to treat my problems.
If they help, what's good! But I'm sorry to that.
Now, there's a place of medical care and medical studies in Africa that are required in a new experience. We can't continue to operate in the way we're always going to.
If it's not cool, we need to look for the beautiful solutions.
I'm here to tell you about solutions.
It was -- what was a man who was not able to share with us.
A few years ago, we started thinking about it.
Everybody knows the problem. No one knows what the solutions are.
We decided we need to invest money instead of talking.
Everybody's ready to give money, in terms of help in the money for developing countries.
When you're talking about the investment in our mind -- no one is interesting.
You can't tell money.
We've had business in medical care in the United States -- I'm worried about change, Texas, the medicine of America.
It's very easy to make money for medical entrepreneurship.
But if you start to tell them, you know, we're going to try to do this in Nigeria -- everyone in the streets.
It's an unusual part. These are you in the audience here, if you want to help Africa, you're going to invest money in the developing world.
Let me bring you in the car of peace in the life of the heart, so you get a sense of what we do, and I'm going to talk a little bit more about it.
What we've done is we've been able to show that a very high medical treatment, the world's world's world's best treatment, you can be interested in the environment of developing country.
We've got 25 doctors now -- everybody's going to go through, and we've got 25 doctors in the United States, Canada.
We've got a political tool that can be translated by Washington, and we've got every place in the United States -- and we're doing it for 10 percent of the cost that you need to do things in the United States.
Thank you as well, we've got policy that no iPhone's in my own own.
We treat everyone.
But if you have one dollar, two dollars -- it doesn't matter.
And I tell you how we can do that.
We're hoping that we're looking at our side as well.
We're insects and curiosity and function and function and patterns that they're too expensive, and so we take things that don't exist and can't move through time.
We're going to touch it, and we're hoping that this process starts.
In the first time, we're all going to disappear, but the problems will be more, if we don't have people who are going to continue from the place to ourselves.
We're a video that's created a number of things ourselves.
We don't buy a lot of intuitive medicine.
We get the patients from companies.
We're making them ourselves, instead.
So, for medical care in the United States -- where there's a 250 dollars -- when you're trying to make it instead, we're coming to the study of change to the way.
Now we're cities that the only way to survive the rich between the rich countries to answer is through technology and technology.
All of these problems we're talking about -- if we're going to develop, all of us disappear.
Technology is a huge change. How do we make it work?
It's already proposed: the brain itself has been saved.
It's expanding the opportunities in the village of villages, and we can use experts in a very built way.
It's the way we're going to call it.
We've now got three websites in the morning, and we're going to plan the street.
And we decided now to go into Africa.
We don't buy the West Western Western Center in Portugal, Nigeria, and this project started over the next few months. We hope to open 2009.
And we don't buy other center.
You can admit this model for every disease.
All the rules, all the central, are connected through the center of the center of the center of the center, and all the images are preparing to the stress of a building.
And I'm going to design this solution of medical medicine. It's a unique New York City, and we're happy to share what we've learned with each one that's interesting to do that. You can still be a profit.
We imagine that the platform of medicine has access to medical experts everywhere in the world, we just need to go on a button.
I'm going to take you in the process, see how this happens.
It's the heart. The doctors can connect from anywhere.
I can survive to you in the summer and say, "You know, go into our system.
You'll go on the research, you're supposed to know what you're thinking. "
They gave me this information, and I'm going to improve the treatment in the patient.
The patient doesn't need to try.
It doesn't have to live the restaurant of inevitable experts.
We can also use the system of electronic medical data.
I'm happy to say that the things that we've learned -- there's no place in 80 percent of the United States, and still technology is there.
But, you know, they have the basis.
Because if you can '
When we do that, we'll just take the treatment.
And we're going to take it to the village of villages and say that it's going to be a problem that you can stand.
And everybody got the treatment that they saw me.
It can't be just technology, we're aware of it.
Science should be part of the solution -- we feel it.
But, you know, you have to say people what can do.
It's impossible to tell people what's going to be green and they can't do it.
They have to be in life, they have to get a music.
We're bringing the limits as the effective thing, the most effective thing to do.
Imagine a year -- every month of the bridge, Africa.
We're bringing people to groups and interesting them to take themselves on challenges.
The group that we're teaching the best weight, we give them privacy.
The groups that are interested in the process with young people, we give them privacy. We're doing it in a way.
We're interested with them to bring children.
In this way, we're looking at the kids in a very early age, we've got these issues, because once we've learned it, they've been left with it. It's going to have to create a form of 100 places to at least invest in January, and these are doctors who are doctors and very powerful.
We're going to take more than a million people from a very interesting ability that might die, including four in the hospital with a peaceful relationship.
If you don't get this heart rate, you're always going to get this heart.
So we want it.
In the way, we've been saving for GPS for five million dollars of people that were going to be trained to Museum for treatment.
And we hope that we've made a lot of human lives.
By the end of this year, we're going to watch more than a million dollars in a small task. In the first four months, it's 3,000 dollars, in average 85 dollars a month, not going to do it, because they have a traffic consumption.
It has to invest resources in another place, but we can still do that.
People ask, "How can you do that?"
And so we're doing this. At least four decades in James James who were in the way to teach treatment, we were themselves that they didn't go to my mom, in the heart of the parents.
And if they're going to go to Muhami, they're going to find a higher money in the country -- eight times more than 10 times. And they're feeling happy to make money in the house, you're making it the same quality of treatment.
And for money, for every patient to pay, we have an opportunity to treat four people at least they don't have the ability to pay.
Thank you so much that it's working, the images need to be in a very, very.
So, we're sending the need.
It's a theory. I've made a lot more remote. We've created connections with the university to technology, John, where we have access now.
And we're starting to try medical engineers, on a place that's going on and trained people, that can fix the side.
It didn't have to deal with the different issues.
We're starting in addition programs to Paul Paul Paul Public -- that's when you're dealing people in Italy, in Iraq, these things are still, with this kind of training, it's studied in people who's too small.
Because now they're going to have to find a long time in medical places and all these issues, in the process, I want you to learn ways themselves, what was that means for them.
[]]]]]]]]]] Dr. Janson Tip Tip]:] []]] &#9
I'm dealing in a city in the Paul Paul Paul Center at the University of the Western Central House.
I've come to the heart of the heart in 2006, as part of my good students in the speed of Paul Paul.
I spent three months in the heart machine.
Here's not enough to be my regulation in the strategy that I've got here, and I think there's still a healthy thing now -- basically in the air and using our project.
San Robert Bush: I'm a theory of Antarctica in the heart of the South, over the last few years, I've got no training in this machine.
I think it's in this point of biology that the heart of the parents brought to Jama is very important in terms of disease disease.
Aristotle: The audience is that it can be done, and it can change, and you can allow everyone.
Why can we decide because people still can't remember the best treatment?
When are we going to play the role of God?
This isn't my decision. My job is to make sure that every person will be won the opportunity, and no matter what the normal thing you're going to have, get the best medical treatment in our lives.
The next one is the Western Western West, that we're going to be in Porto Richard, and Nigeria, as I said, we're not a central center around Africa.
I'm going to take the same system to other areas, like this polio.
And everyone who's interesting to do that in any situation of medical care, I'm happy to help us tell us how we did this, and how he could do it, if we're going to change the medical care in Africa.
Africa was good for us; it's time to return the best to Africa.
I'm going. Somebody wants to come, I'm invited to come with me.
Thank you.
Thank you.
For the next 16 minutes, I'm going to take you on a journey that's probably the biggest dream of human beings: to understand the point of life.
So for me, everything started a lot of years ago, when I met the first 3D printer.
The idea was exciting.
A 3D printer needs three students: a little bit of information, some materials, a certain energy, and it can create every object that wasn't there.
I worked in physics, I went back home and I realized I was actually a 3D printer.
And every single one of you know.
It was my mom.
I'm going to believe you've got three students: a little bit of information, which is between my father and my father's mom in this case, Alzheimer's students in the same country, it's food. And after a few months, I've created it.
And I wasn't data before.
So my mother's father's father who's found that she's 3D printing, I hope and I'm talking about this. The first one, the data.
What's the amount of information that's going to build and make human beings?
Is it a lot? Is it a little bit?
How many risks are you able to fill?
Well, I've learned physics at the beginning and I've got a lot of people's speech as a giant person.
So imagine that the building is small atoms and there's a lot of carbon here, carbon here.
So I'm in the first species, if I can learn the number of atoms that most people, I can build it.
Now, you can run some numbers and it would be a few days.
So the number of atoms, the summer I'm going to keep in the direction of a little baby, and in fact, a whole range of directions and sensors, like thousands of thousands.
It's the wonderful doctor.
Each time, the future is going to go on, you can see the biggest data that you're ever going to see.
We've forgotten the many data, we've forgotten everything you've heard about.
It's the biggest amount of data that's different.
[But nature, unfortunately, a lot more than a young physicist, and in four billion years, we've been able to bring this information in a small web that we call DNA.
We met it for the first time in 1950 as a Californian Franklin, amazing scientists, a woman, took me.
But it took us more than 40 years to go into a human cell, to take this road, to grow it, and read it for the first time.
We've been surprised as a privilege just learning four letters: MA, T, TC.
And to build a person needs three billion of them.
Three billion.
How many are they three billion?
It doesn't really look like the number of genes, right?
So I thought how I could explain myself better how big it is.
But there's -- I mean, it's going to be a little bit help, and the highest person to help me get the point is actually the first person that's going to have this sequence, and "Dr. Robert."
So the next thing to the stage is "Richard Twitter.
[Not the people itself, but for the first time in history, it's the federal genome of some person, who's advertising another person, a person's 260s of information, 450 pounds, who sent from the United States to the United States to Canada in Britain, L.C., L.C., T.C
It was an amazing approach.
But that's the powerful pattern of what it's the point of life.
And now, for the first time, I can do something.
I can't actually lead in a planet to read.
So let me take an interesting book like this.
It's a big book.
So just so you can see what the universe is.
thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands and millions of letters.
And they're probably genius.
Let's go to some part.
Let me just read you []]]] "AAO, AATA, ATA."
You've heard like the same letter or death, but this sequence gives the color of the eyes to read.
I'm going to show you another part of the book.
It's actually a little bit more complicated.
Remember 14, in 132, 132: Thank you.
"ATT, TT, GTT."
It's a lucky person, because if you get two letters in this place -- two letters from our three billion -- it's not the point of the disease: Syria Syria Syria.
We don't have a solution to this, we don't know to see it, and just two letters between what we were.
A wonderful book, a book or light, a book that helped me understand and show you something amazing.
Each of you -- what you do is you, you're not -- just as five million of those, half.
In the rest of the rest of the rest, we're all identical.
Fifty of us are the basis of life that you are.
The rest, we're all patients.
So think about it again when we think we're different.
It's the amount that we're born.
So now I got your attention, the next question is: How do I read it?
How do I find it the diversity?
Well, until a few of you can be good at the traffic and changes, this invisible connection in life can't open.
And so, in 2014, two famous astronomers, Pattos and Twitter itself, decided to try a new company.
"Eric Arabic" California, with one thing that we can do and learn everything that we can learn from these books, in one goal -- to make the parts of medical medicine, understand things should be able to remember in healthier health and what they're in these books.
The amazing team, 40 scientists give a lot more people, that you're going to work with.
The idea is actually very simple.
We're going to use technology called a machine.
On one side we have genes -- thousands of them.
On the other side, we've collected the biggest data of human beings: phanthropy, 3D, 3D, all you can think about.
In the face there, on these two kinds of leaders, there's two tricks.
And in the middle, we build a machine.
We're building a machine that we believe a good machine, not exactly one machine, a lot of cars -- trying to understand the genes in Pacific.
What are these letters, and what do they do?
It's a approach that can be used for anything, but to use it in this country that's complicated.
The Atlantic we wanted to build different challenges.
We started from the beginning, a common car for everyone.
The programs that forces are curious because they're beautiful, they've all got them.
So we started asking our questions: Can we reduce response?
Can we read the books and get your response?
Well, we can actually, with five meters of our hands.
BI'm going to learn in your life, but we can still, we're getting in the morning, eight children of us.
Could we be able to predict color?
Yes, we can.
80 percent of our hands.
Can we reduce color?
Yes, we can, we're 80 percent.
Can we reduce big?
We can, because the more it looks, we've been changing during your life.
It's going to be produced, you're losing physical, you get drugs.
We call the letter and we do a model.
Now, a really interesting challenge: Can we reduce human expectancy?
It's a little bit complicated, because I'm a park between these molecules.
And I'm a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very.
So we'd have to build a tool of this and learn to learn the machine what it's exposed, and we're going to get it.
And if you feel together with a machine, you understand what the challenge is here.
Now, after 15 years, we're seeing the first click -- in October, we started to see how much it was.
And it was a very exciting moment.
What you see here is a topic that's working in our lab.
It's a shape for us.
So we're taking an artist's real face, we're afraid of our complexity, because it's not in your face -- a lot of programs and astronomers come from your life.
We're creating a meter in the face, and we're making our algorithms.
The results that I'm going to show you right now are the strength that we have from today.
Thank you.
In these seconds, you're still expecting, left and right, and your brain wants these images and it's identical.
So I ask you to do another regulation, if you're going to be true.
Please look for the differences, they're many.
The biggest amount of letters come from the gender, and then there's a big, BBI, the enemy of a person.
And a microscope over this letter is much more complicated.
But what you see here, even in the differences, you can understand that we're in the right field, that we're involved.
And it's already involved in you a few emotions.
It's another topic that's coming out of the place, and it's competitive.
Instead of a little bit smaller, we didn't get the whole big structure, but it's still in the field.
It's a topic that's working in our lab, and that's the beginning.
So these people have never seen in the imagination of the machine.
They're the ones called a group of "Should."
But these are people where you never believe.
We're published everything in the prices of science, you can read it.
But because we're on the stage, Chris challenges us.
I think I've probably missed ourselves and trying to reduce someone you might identify.
So in this field of peace -- and believe me, you don't have any idea what we needed to do because we've had this day now, here in this field of peace has a amount of information that we need to create a full of genes.
We just need this agreement.
I wanted this talk, and I'm going to do it with you.
And we've started to see all the understanding we have.
In the hospital, we've done it remember.
And the object is remember.
We've been exposed by 76 kilometers.
And the bus is 77 miles.
So we watched it's 76: the bus was 82.
We've found that it's 38.
The bus is 35.
We're watching the color of our eyes.
The same way.
We're spending the color in the city.
We're almost there.
This is my face.
Now, the important moment: the object is this person.
And I did it in a direction.
I'm very, very strange, very strange.
And doctors, Italians -- they're never dealing in words.
And it's special -- that babies is a complex case for our model.
But there's another point.
So, one of the things we use is a lot of to know people don't write a world in genes.
It's our freedom, it's how I see.
I didn't have my story in this case, but I've been living inside my food.
So I'm going to show you, I'm going to, in this case, and get it -- and it's not more than a metaphor, not an example -- the food on the object.
Imagine, we get a much better sense.
So, why do we do this?
We actually don't do it to a biological biology or take a beautiful picture from your day.
We're doing this because the same technology is the same approach, our machine learning, help us understand how we work, how your body works, how your body works in your body, how your cancer is developing, how your cancer works, how do your cancer work, how are they working on your body.
It's a huge challenge.
It's a challenge we share with thousands of other studies around the world.
It's called a human solution.
It's the ability to know from a statistics where you're going to be in, access to people, where we call all these books and we get the understanding of who you're exactly.
But it's a complex challenge in particular, because all of these books, right now, we know that there's probably one percent: four books of 65.
And that's not my conversation, because we learned more.
There's the best brains in the world in this issue.
The molecule will be too much.
And the more we learn, the more we need to deal with decisions we've never had to deal with them before the life.
So we're touching a very, very, very tough detail about the way we know.
And it's a revolution that can't be limited to the science or technology.
It has to be a global conversation.
We have to start thinking about the future we build as human.
We've got to be in interaction with autonomy, with artists, with politicians, with politicians.
Everybody is involved, because it's our future of a lot.
No fear, but with the understanding that the decisions we're going to get in the next year, we've changed the history of history.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm afraid something really important.
It's more than any human privacy, I've done more of life on Earth, more and more than the oceans in their hands.
It's created four billion years ago in the world's most early days of the solar system and the political system is still created.
This approach of California may not look too special, but when you're going to write it...
You can see that it's different from the Earth.
This example is limited by women's fingerprints that can be created in the outside space where a metaphor can be released, how many over a million years.
It's ever been part of a much larger designer, one of the millions of years after the patients created.
We call these objects of asteroids.
asteroids are the most effective and our future.
This graph shows an asteroid that's very close to the Earth that's scared around the sun, which is called in the road, and it's very close to the Earth, which seems to be in blue.
The size of the Earth, the sun and the asteroids were reduced in privacy so you can see them in the morning.
Scientists of scientists around the galaxy are looking for these nerves, new objects every day, expect the space that's going to happen to the Earth.
It's a lot of this work that's focused on ASA.
I think about the month after asteroids as a public project, but instead of building a way, we're reducing the outside space, to build a organization that's left over the walls.
These are the 66 asteroids that are related to the Earth that's been reduced in the last year.
And these are all the asteroids that have been known in the Earth, which once the last time they're 1333.
Each one of them, and my web is around the sun and the sun.
Even though it's changing between asteroid and asteroid, the symbols of the asteroids can be reduced for decades.
And the sound of a few asteroids can be reduced by amazing.
For instance, scientists in the lab have a beautiful song where the asterotic asteroid was four years of safe 30 miles.
In these four years, Titus has gone through 85 billion miles.
It's a decade of 0.,000.
So now, the reason that we have this asteroid is because, like all the neighbors, asteroids are sometimes visible.
So three years ago, asteroid and small asteroid spread over the city Charles and Bosnia.
This object was about 18 meters, or about a size of a dog.
It's about the size of the Earth every 50 years.
66 million years ago, a lot of nervous nerve on Earth, has made the local power.
75 percent of the plants and the animals and my father, including, unfortunately, we were dinosaurs.
This object was a 10 kilometers, and 10 kilometers is about the web of 77.
So the next time you're in the airplane, and you're sitting in a window, you're going to look at a window, and you're going to look at a window, and you're going to see the most beautiful team.
It's so space that we're going to take a plane that's going to fly over us.
It's the size of the asteroid or affected the Earth.
It was just over the life of asteroids and thought about a very important person to our planet.
And since then, here's an effort from us to discover these objects.
I'm lucky to be part of this effort.
I'm part of the scientists who use the NASA's NASA.
Now, the NIISS doesn't mean to find asteroids.
It's true to push the Earth and look much beyond our sun system to look at the most expensive stars and the most expensive galaxies.
And he's done it very well for a few months' lives.
But today, six years later, it's still going on.
We've changed our eyes to discover asteroids.
And even though it's just a little little bit wonderful space, today it's kind of like cars.
The material that's used to read our sensors from time, so we're looking at the gene of a molecule.
I've got a million kilometers on the eye, but it's still going to take a picture of the sky in art every 11 seconds.
He took 23 images since I started talking to you.
One of the reasons that the NIIIISS is a lot of valuable value is that it's seeing the sky in Iraq.
It means that instead of seeing the sun that asteroids don't go back, the NIISA see the life that they're political.
It's the ability of experience because some asteroids are so much like carbon and can be women to identify with other telescopes.
But all the asteroids, which are so close, it's remote for the NISA.
astronomers use every method to see and find asteroids.
In 2010, Babban through the Hungarian history.
Here's a community, together, discovered more than 90 percent of the asteroids that grow more than a meter -- nerves that are able to show light on Earth.
But the work still didn't exist.
Half in 140 meters can be used in the size of our hands.
By now, we've discovered only 25 percent of these.
We've got to continue to look for other asteroids in the Earth.
We're the only species that's able to understand a computer or build telescopes.
We know how to find these objects.
This is our responsibility.
If we were an astronomy, with a very meaningful device, we could move it from the way.
Basically to the ideas of land, the neurons or the samples of industries, the asteroid that can be reduced by information.
What we've got to do now is to solve the space that's close to the Earth.
We have to continue to look for the sky.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I was in the third month that I had to dance with cells as the Syrian and I went to the Southern Iranian apartment.
I've been 35, and I knew that this means we've got a risk group to share with water.
So, Robert and I've just studied the beautiful managers and emotionally emotional relationship.
Well, nothing could make us a bruary security that's going to get.
The doctor explained that one of our cells, Amazon, was a TV man called "Oh, I'm a plan."
It means that some of my brain didn't evolve as well because some of my big size was unusual.
The babies with this strength in a general way around or in a few minutes, hours or water from the community.
But the second cell, and God, it seems to be healthy as much as the doctor could say that the two cells were identical, it's a genetic person.
So after a lot of questions about how this thing could actually happen at all of the possibilities and even though the process didn't think impossible, it's generally in risks for the healthy cells so we decided to continue with the device.
So, I'm in the third month to make, three of the wall before, and I'd have to find a way to look at my stress stress.
It feels like I have a room that's funding to you for six months.
But I started with this, for a long time, that I saw a public group.
Even though there was nothing that we could do to prevent the tragedy, I wanted to find a way to make it that the products of the Asia and the communities of some positive impact.
So I asked the nurses about dealing things, blind eyes.
It's trained us with organizations and more human health than our community organization and Washington.
And they explained to me, my wife's wife would probably be a little bit too small for the drugs or things to go, and I was the amazing thing: I didn't know you can't get anything like this.
But they said it's a good cell for the research.
It helped me see the Amazon in a new region.
In California's victims of disease, I started to see it as an opportunity to solve a medical level.
In the 23, 2010, the two cells were born, both of them were born.
And as the doctor said, I'm going to notice that my big part of my age, but he could all of us, to change exactly, to share our fingerprints like Nigerian, and he's not between our buildings.
After six days, you're going to be trained in the army of Ross, you're surrounded in our family.
We've survived to the organization of the healthy people, and it's that these experiences have come home, and we've got it to the National Revolution for children.
A couple of hours later, I came to us and said that I was going through a success, and that I'm going to leave you to four different places.
Today our morning is going to go to the University of New York.
Our bubble is going to go to a treatment in genes called a robot.
Our careers go to the center of the Chinese primary research, which is part of the school to the medicine of the Richard, and our networks are all at the University of California.
A few days later, we've been doing the audience with the great family, including the baby, and we've actually launched this project in our lives.
But sometimes I found myself the same, what's happening now?
What are the researchers learn?
Is it all different to the drugs?
The Western center invited us with political treatment, but, we met together with about 15 families, but others, we've seen the things of their parents to participate things.
Some of them even got letters from the people who got the healthy, who had them.
I've learned that they can even meet each other, if they're going to be reduced by curiosity just like the outside.
And I was so excited, I thought maybe I could write a letter, maybe get a letter, and learn about what happened.
But I got to find that you're going to have a process, it's just for people who're training for healthcare.
So we've got the kind of "and you're going to go," I'm rich.
But over the years that I've been thinking, I've learned a lot about the training of things, and I even started working in the field.
And I'm going to get this idea.
I wrote a letter that started, "The New York City."
I explained who I was, and I asked if they could tell me, why they asked our own networks, in 2010, and I asked if my family could come to their lab.
I've sent him a model to the eyes, which I'm excited about the device, the eyes of the ocean, and I asked if they could make the right model.
They said they've never done it before, and they can't ensure that there was a answer, but they didn't have the device in the way, and they're going to move it on.
And a place later, I got a big school from a big, very, very at the University of California.
He had the device, and he explained to me that he was a Democratic study, which is a TV cancer of the network and he affects children under five, and invited us to her lab.
And then we talked about the phone, and one of the first things that she told me was that she didn't even imagine how we felt, and I asked them the big, and she was trying to be.
So I said, "No, no one came in your research, but we don't really choose.
We're going to have a system, and it's in your research. "
And I said, "There's a second thing, bad things happen to children every day and if I didn't want these networks, they're probably the things in the ground.
So it's that they're participating in your research, you can live in a new asteroid.
So, you'll never feel like what's using these networks. "
And then he explained to me a few things like this.
It's access to the network that's six years earlier to the National Science Foundation.
She got only one example of what's going on on to her tricks, and it was my mother's dog.
So, a long organization for me to go to the lab in the lab, and we've been looking at 23, 2015, which today's new communities of the cells.
After our seconds, I sent a night in Amazon and a few images of Amazons, and a few weeks later, we got this outside of Bay.
A few months later, Robert, God and I go into a car and go on the screen.
We met in Europe and her team and her team, and she said that when I told her not to feel a woman, which was a community, and she didn't see it from our own perspective.
He also explained that I had the Amazon there was a experiment.
In the same way that the New York City doesn't look at the night, there's an ARS called REES.
RAS means research, and 360 means it was a number of 360 years.
It's also part of us from our lives, and it's the third data that's sent our networks from Washington to California.
This particular baby's data is like a family for us now.
It's the same way that a military molecule or enough people can be.
Eric Europe is also using the network of the MRA's network to try to figure out one that makes us create big, and it's even going to show us some results that are based on RES.
So he took us to a physicist, and he showed us the two examples that still the community that still comes from RES to 60.
There's two small years that we've left.
She said she'd hear it because she didn't know when she got a eye.
After that, we went to the old room and we built a moment and we could eat the walls together, and the biological team from the communities.
It was a good job for children.
And they've also offered us the plants.
I've got two simple message today.
One is that most of us probably don't think about more than research.
I know I didn't think. I think we're a normal person.
But I did that.
It was a good experience, and I'm adding it, and it brought to my family and a lot of hope.
And the second one is that if you work with human beings and you're wondering about the way to the family, they've wrote a letter.
They tell them they're going to change it, tell them about what you're working, and we've invited them to visit in the lab, because this morning might be more enough for you for them.
And I also want to ask you good.
If you're ever going to take one of these buildings, please tell me about it.
The other part of my family story is that at the end of Burkey and all the four years that we get the images of Amazon.
And we've met with amazing people doing inspiration work.
The way I see it now is that the two of the global Arab Blaser, Canada, and I have a job in a quote, and I have colleagues and I have people who work with it in the middle of the beginning.
And they need it to do their work.
A life that once we've ever seen products and not meaningful data has discovered themselves as lawyers, and they're going to go through refugees.
And I'm just hoping that our life can be like this.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I don't surprise you to know, but I don't like to be in hospital or go to hospital.
What are you?
I'm sure many of you feel the same, right?
But why? Why do we hate patients so much?
Or is it just a life that we need to live with?
Is that the whole event?
The great experience?
Her wind?
Or is it the fear of the unknown?
Well, this is all more.
Other than patients need to try a long distance to get to the best hospital and the access to medical care is more serious in the United States, but in the United States, in the places, in the countries, in the United States, they also need to try to get a long way.
And even in places where there's more hospitals, in the general way, they're the ones that have a medical care or because they don't have a transport that it's going on for them.
And many people are aware of patients at all, and they're missing all medical care because of the cost.
We see that 64 percent of Americans and scientists are going to be treated because of the cost.
And even when you get a treatment, you're a hospital that makes us sick.
Finally, medical techniques are what's going to be the third place in the United States, and after cancer and disease disease, the third definition of death.
I'm working on medical field over 20 years, and I see some of our hospital system and not relevant.
Let me give you two examples.
Four out of 10 doctors and five out of 10 American doctors feel living.
In my result, in California, only 17 million people live there.
In the next few years, we've had a privilege of 125,000 percent.
But how did we get here, this idea of different kinds of people together in a big structure?
Well, we need to go back to the future hands.
In the "600" Life ", we've been invented for a dolphin where people could go to get a security, political treatment.
And then over the next 2,000 years, we've seen a political center to the industrial revolution, where we've seen the facts of patients in order to create the principles of the industrial revolution, to create effective and find the products, the patients in this case, outside the hospital in the speed of the possibility.
Over the last century, we've got a lot of interesting inventions.
Let's see how you can create an experiment.
We've invented the heart rate of the Congress Congress, and even we've come to the new kind of politicians.
But the biggest change has changed the system of patients at all.
And I believe that it's time, to send a revolution in the system to move the system of the patients that were dead.
I believe it's time to create a new system around medical care.
Research studies show because 46 percent of the medical treatment in the hospital can be built in the house of the patients.
It's a lot.
And it's basically for them that suffering from a minute disease.
With that, patients can be able to succeed into a smaller, more politicians, and the magnitude of the metaphor.
So things like Antarctica, political treatment, and I'm going to stay still in the hospital, at least the next future, I believe.
A few weeks ago, I met her mom and her mom or her husband with a story, and she said, "William, it's hard.
It's so hard, when we know that it's just a few months to live.
Instead of playing with today, it now has to try three times a week for every week to get its biased treatment. "
And it's really clear to me, because we all know that professionals can take from the leaders also at home, right?
And if she can get her building and her treatment also in home, she can also do the things that are important to her last months.
My mom, in 82 now -- no idea -- she's going to go to a hospital because she's hard to design and manage the aid.
So our sisters, we help it.
But there's a lot of women who are going to get a treatment and wait so long until you're going to become a life, and then it's a connection to the care, the wall.
And "Richard Bosnie," Richard Bosnia, "and Richard Bonnie," and Richard Billie, "and he came to California's three of the patients over 70 times more than half of the patients over 85, and we'll find the hospital in a
And a very different problem that many of the patients deal with it when they need to go to a hospital is: Where can I go with my first molecule in life, where can I go with my dog?
That's our environment, by the way, is it nice?
But it's not just our eyes.
It's also a matter of medical physicians and on more.
My friend, Art, recently, we needed a medical physicist for a small girl, he had to stay in the hospital for more than two weeks, just because he needed some kind of intuitive city.
So he's going to get a bed for two weeks that I've done more than a billion children.
It's just smart.
These bits are really cool in the eye.
So in many global economic systems, the medical treatment is living with the national production over the last few years.
Here we see that in the last 50 years, the medical treatment has come out of Germany about 11 percent today.
In the United States, we've seen a growth of six percent more than 17 percent today.
And a big part of these features prevented by the investment in big hospital and magic patients.
And these structures don't exist, and they're saying that the hospital system should be full of the hospital that patients can be able to get a great audience.
There's no incentive to the hospital and the hospital with less metaphor.
Just think about it, right?
And here's the thing: the treatment of my friend's home can be a decade of treatment in the hospital.
And there we call it.
The hospital of the future will be in our house.
And it's already happening.
A global treatment is growing in 10 percent.
Mexico's human experiment, I see that biology and technology becomes the political solutions and possible.
The technology already allows us to do things that we've ever been thinking about in the hospital.
Basically, such as building buildings, in California, that will be given to our home animals.
More and more than happy devices that we see like a statement to the AIDS resources and Mexico and the best if there's a need for strategy.
And all of this technology is starting to build more stress about patients' health, and these patterns are all bringing to a better control of medical mistakes -- remember, the third genes in the United States.
And I see it every day in work.
I'm working in biology and for me, the medical treatment works.
We see and the body of life brings the drug to the house of the patient.
My sister was joined to me and I gave the drug in the house of the patient.
It's so simple.
Remember my friend Art?
It can now get the intuitive principles of home: no part of the hospital's hospital, no food or any of our lives with the antibiotics that we're going to put you in these patients.
And it's more than that.
So now need a tool can get the treatment and they need the animals of their home together with their molecules for life.
And there's no longer any need to try hours about seven hours just to get political treatment.
In California, we've seen successful successes in cancer that are a political treatment in the hospital, sometimes even together with other patients.
The best stories for them from the patients who are pregnant in the development of the strength, training and depression and depression.
The medical treatment I realized also helped them get a sense of regulation and revealing the choices in their lives, and it actually helped them forget their disease.
But the medical treatment I understood, and Los -- what if I don't even have a house, if I'm a murder, or if I have a house but no one who's going to open the door or even open the door?
Well, here's our surprising economy, or, as I like to call it, the Airbbbet of the political treatment.
In India, we see some political organizations between people who need political society between people who have jobs for them.
The medical care treatment is cheaper, and it's easier to offer, and more like what's going on -- in these unique areas that we've talked about, but also in the situations of the most electronic things when you're going to get more, what's more likely to get the things in the house.
The medical care care can be women in rich areas but also in new communities.
The medical care care works in developing countries as well as in developing countries.
So I'm really glad to move the stories to the patients through the medical care care.
I'm trying to make it that it's needed and get their treatment in their own home, together with their friends to life.
I'm trying to make a difference and help us who patients and not their disease is the difference in their lives.
For me, this is the definition of medical care.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's a huge phenomenal phenomenon that had different meaning in different times.
But for all the inspiration of the inspiration and inspiration was one more common thing: they started in parts.
And as the dream will help more that's bigger and the design that's going to make it.
And that's why the biggest nervous nervous nerves are almost the biggest students, and teachers and cities.
So it was over the history, all the way back to the year 300 years ago, when a 13-year-old boy turned into a small asteroid and a very poor.
It's waiting to get a nation, a wealth of power in the middle of the road.
And my design skills -- until how much it sounds not around -- and there's necessary to succeed this.
They're at the same time that we've created in our work for different temperatures.
So if I have two galaxies in my side and not sure that it could have three extinctions of my wife.
That means, of course, they'd be less effective in very vulnerable, in addition.
And we're going to solve this problem by doing so that all the infrastructure and the strength and the way that they're going to be able to replace.
And so he's done with features, Germany, agencies, survivors and every other form of every year.
We've come to our global military to the last few years, and within five years, our small government has been able to replace all the big neighborhoods, the decades and the most powerful, and we're going to have the tremendous empathy.
Now, no one, of course, I didn't have to describe this kind of design as a designer -- why did we do that?
And yet it's used design for me to know about autism with a tremendous invention to get to my goals.
And so there's also been a very invisible designer, and so it's also not in part of violence to get our serious.
It was the Antarctica, the more like the Britain's Britain's Britain.
It was the reminder of change today, in Portugan like the Time Time Tim.
The Israeli was born with a song, and the two nations were very useful.
And the smartphones, like me, we realized that to maximize their own refugees, they had to push their enemies in the prison as a regulation they knew.
So in other words, they can go on the ship without a 3D printer, we're going to get to victims.
So Einstein's "brings itself as a food that's sending the function of unusual privacy.
It's going to wear microbes and big colors to achieve my response.
It's a big balloon that's black and work, that I've got my face.
It's a gravity with us that we're living on all my chair.
It's even a primary thing to our worst child and have them, so they're glad to come in every time our grandchildren's grandchildren's grandchildren's grandchildren's grandmother's face.
And like many changes in this period is a Google's page, which is the speaking of human genome and self-esteem, because these best teachers are so many of the culture for hundreds of years until their meaningful meaningful meaningful meaningful meaningful, even though they're going to be in the moral corruption.
So of course, all of our movement is known as us.
There's this way, it's easy to see why I'm going to see the Portugan and the Portus and the Portugans can show as a need of modern design design, and why their Technologist -- and that's why -- and why -- and why -- why is their digital regulation of the digital boundaries of the se
And yet design was used to be used to be more evolutionary by Britain in the same country, the nation from the 19th century Floridi Scotland.
Her goal was to provide health care for everyone.
And a big baby was born in the United States and discovered a decade, which started when she started working in a military hospital during war.
Once it was there, he realized very quickly that more patients from the water that they were going there, in the extinct diseases, they're scared from the war.
So he opened up with a campaign to the doctors, a very rapidly regulation and more to us.
Over in England, it's the faster and another campaign, this time at the civil patients, and it's doing that that those principles are also working on.
A big baby disease, as it looks, as it's going to look, a design in the next decades, and its students still in the's use today.
But until then, design looks as well as the industrial eye.
He became a professionals, but he was limited to a specific function, and in general, there was a place where to be a tragedy in a place where to be autonomy, like a big Congress and a big dance, without a rise.
By the 20th century, this tragedy was so powerful, that the nervous nervous designers were looking at it as touch or scratch.
Now exactly they've got one of my heroes' heroes's heroes, to remember the Negg.
He was the Nigerian artist that my experiences with the effect of the technology about life and today were so powerful that they were still affecting the design of digital images that we see on our students and our students.
It took me to the Radio's Alexander's population in 1920, and there's still some of my biologists that we've been going to open at least in the AIDS two years later.
The ideas of leadership we've been treated as well, but our approach to design was more institutions, like our industries to see it, as he understood it, not as a way to be a design to be with the invention.
And unfortunately, the same thing that's going to be able to transform yourself through a road: Richard in the asteroid.
He was another powerful and design design design design, which was a very positive design for a social design in a way that I think it started talking about the importance of environmental environment in the 20th century.
Now, despite my effort, he's going to get a lot of the design and he's got to be, how many of my experiences of failed, like a surprising car that's never going on from the ground.
And yet, the geographic map, and my design and my design to build a long restaurant of a tree, a plastic plastic, a dream of trees, plastics -- almost everything that was available in the same time -- they're one of the biggest efforts of the Twitter design, and a story that was most important and a lot of the reasons since the first time.
Now, it was the courage of designers just like in Olympics that put it into design.
I started my career as a new journalist and writing outside.
I wrote about politics, economics and companies, and I could choose to reduce each of these experts.
But I looked at design, because I believed that it's one of the most powerful tools to change and improve the quality of life.
Thank you, my colleagues love the TED design.
Thank you, and a few I'm going to do the genes of professional designers, that we've been exposed and sad, I'm also believe that the design is getting a big, big, the great thinking of the Western teachers.
And we're living at the moment in design, because it's the time we're going to change each other.
Because even the babies are very experimented in digital technology and allow them to operate themselves from hundreds of people, within the office and out of the train, to go after even more effective and politics.
So in theory, basic platforms like the species, think of a big social media for more and more efficient and more resources to the rate of resources to travel, hopefully, response to their ideas.
Now, some of my favorite examples in Africa, where there's a new generation of designers from amazing technologies of the Internet to make the dream of health care in the countries where more people now have access to drugs than teachers.
And they've built a dinosaurs.
It's a young design of Martin Martin that the cells have a computer on a doctor and a doctor, a cartoon to the building.
It can be used to be used to take the door of patients in places as satellites.
The data that's been sent to the Islamic network to choose very well in hundreds of kilometers to this child.
And if any problem is reduced by experts there, it's a false therapy.
And it's obviously making a lot of patients to do a lot of stars and colors and many times of these patients, and make it much more likely that their home is actually built.
Aririosaurus started working on a doctor before eight years ago, in our last year in university.
But he couldn't convince any regulation to give me the investment to get the project.
He made the idea before Facebook, where in the government and he saw it and he was able to survive government for me.
It's developed now not just the doctor, but other neurons to treat different situations.
And it's not alone, because there's a lot of inspiration and inspiration and others that are also developing projects of themselves.
And we're going to try to look at some of them.
One is Phicago.
It's a group of doctors and designers in Kenya, who developed technology of the things that they're going to, because Twitter's eye is interested.
So there's the man on the left, which opens a new design to enable us to transform our babies' babies' baby, without the traditional tragedy.
All of these nerves and many other objects after their dreams, by using their sensors in their new parts, with the Texas []]]]]]]]]]]] &#93
And it's great to all of us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
This talk is about genetic scientists, but I'm going to start with a short story.
Twenty years ago, a biologist named the same January on the idea to create women who don't work.
It was a great idea, and in a lot of space.
First of all, it turns out that it's very difficult to create a deep device for the malaria.
In the end of the past, January was able to do it for a few years ago, by the end of a few genes that allow the California to survive within the women.
But it just created a new problem.
If there's a deeper job for malaria, how do you make it replace all the women and the malaria?
There were some possibilities, but a program was, principles, to grow some of the genetic sensors to release them into the problems that they're going to go on and move their genes.
The problem was that you need to release 10 years ago from the local women to make it work.
So in the village, there's 10,000 women, you have to release 10,000 more.
As we feel, the villages didn't like this approach.
And then, in the last month, the same January Guinea got a biologist called the same morning.
In the morning, he said he's his students, and TV, discovered that he could make sure that some genetic machine doesn't just go through a woman, but also spread a tremendous speech.
If they're right, it's a button in the city that James worked on for 20 years.
In China, they went into two years and women's gender and also the new tool, the genetic information that we've got to explain.
Finally, they did so that every tool called the galaxy didn '
It was very much like the animals, because we can know from the sample of it.
So they took the two women's regulation, and they're going to get them into a box where 30 years are used to build, and they've got to get them to culture.
Within two minutes, we'll give them 3,800 right now.
It's not the surprising part.
Here's the surprising part: if you start with two or two or 30 to 30 blindness, you're in the city for the offspring.
But when January opened the home to every 3,800 years, there were poor people.
When I studied the same speech that moment, it was so excited, that it was really step into the phone.
And it's because I've got women's acadequate in the new temperature that is a biological evolution in biology: the sensory experience of a model.
Basically, the sensor of millions of colors that are the physicists of the baby's memories called a half of all the case.
So if our microbial women would be the sensor, when Babyan is the galaxy, the babies need to get in four meters: Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Oh, Oh, Oh.
But with the new genetic information, everybody came out.
It's not supposed to be possible.
So what happened?
The first thing that happened was, in 2012, we could go a little bit called "Dr. Dr. School."
Many of you may have heard of "Dr. Robert," So just say, "Dr. School" is a whole tool that allows researchers to do a lot of buildings in New York, I've spent very quickly.
It does that in a way of creating a gene that's already already in our lives.
Basically, there's a protein that works like numbers and you're going to have the DNA, and there's a molecule to call "or that's called the numbers for all of them.
The result is actually a genetic model.
You can get a whole gene, get another gene, or not to make it in a gene.
And you can do it almost every species.
Well, remember I said that the genetic scientists were at first two problems?
The first one: It was hard to try and have to be deep for malaria.
This problem is surprised, I'd call a book.
But the second problem was to have statistics.
How do you make a plan to spread?
That's where it's done from you.
Twenty years ago, Bill Guardian Robert called Wilson's Alexander's "and" Derek "to get the new gene but also the mechanism that's doing the animals inside the lab.
In other words, what if's "and" I'm going to take a look at myself?
You get a car in a little bit of a genetic forest.
And this is exactly what happened.
Science "Derek" that's created an astronomer "that's created not just the argument that the machine is going to work for a woman, but if you use the academic, it's also going to take a little bit of intuition in the new field of all the causes of the privacy.
It's like "Field" to "," and in terms of scientists, it's become a genetic platform.
So what does that mean?
First of all, it means we have a tool that's going to have a very powerful tool, but also from the worst.
By now, the fact that genetic scientists didn '
In "Because, when we're doing with organisms of organism, we're affecting our evolutionary skills.
So biologists can create the metabolism of drugs, no matter.
If one of them is on the street, the natural selection will be treated.
What makes the genetic information to the brain, a very powerful step is that it's already not true.
If your design doesn't create a serious limit, like a woman who can't fly, the genetic scientists from Syria and spread the change without doing any privacy in the population.
Now, I don't have to create a genetic information that works so well, but James' and I'm going to try to make a lot of reasons it's in India.
The good news is that it's developed for some wonderful things.
If you put a genetic data from Maria to one percent of the AIDS's population, a lot that's going to sell the malaria, the studies are going to spread all the population in one year.
I mean, you've got one year, you can prove the malaria.
Basically, I'm still living a few years from being able to be able to be able to, and yet, every day you die from 1,000 children.
And within this number year, we can be almost 0.
So also with a Nigeria, Chicago, I've got a dog.
And it's going to be better.
Let's imagine you want to get a very different species, for example, to train the big and the big artists.
You've got to just release a genetic information that makes the platform of malaria in the heart.
In a few cases, you wouldn't stay there, and the Ford will disappear.
The theory, it means that we can put hundreds of species that have been in the same way of blue.
Well, these are the good news. Here's the bad news.
The genetic scientists are so effective, even though we're going to return to a whole lot, and often, very quickly.
That's the same James Times in the middle of a good career.
It's discovered our women in another biological lab, using places that don't exist in the United States so that even if one in the street, they'd just die; they didn't have a chance.
But it's also true that, if you're more popular and I'm going to try with a genetic data, you're going to take a mistake from the big artists and go back to Asia, in order to take the local population of Phicago and Asia.
And it's not very unusual, where you can be a few to a connection.
In fact, that's why the most popular problems.
And it's about genes.
Things like women and drugs have no way to stress them, just as meaningful.
They're samples of water without the rest.
The other bad news is that the genetic data might not be left from what we call the goal.
And that's because of "regular", "remote," and there's a beautiful device that's been treated to that where the species are now coming in.
When it happens, you might have a shape of the genetic information: Porn can be able to be able to be able to be able to admit another kind of Porn.
It's not bad if the genetic information is spread, like color.
In fact, there's a good chance for this that's going to be able to see a galaxy of very different stories in the future.
But it might be the Amazon if the genetic information is going to prove all of us.
The last leadership is that technology for this, to make organism so that it can prevent genetic information, it's basically something that all around the world can do.
Each architecture can do that.
Social design with a little bit of stress can do it.
I'm described to myself that it sounds scary.
But it's interesting that as much as a scientist I'm going to reduce it, probably genetic scientists don't exist or dangerous.
Some of them, because they believe that scientists will be very careful and very responsible for them.
And at home, it's true.
But genetic scientists have some limits.
First of all, they're working just in this kind of civilization.
So thank you for those, you can't try in your bodies we're born.
Like yes, the programs spread just in the Western California.
So we changed the power of population is only doing if we don't imagine that there's a lot of speech, like insects and maybe small soldiers like museums.
In politicians, people may go from hundreds of years until some techniques spread in a meaningful country.
In addition, even with "Dr. School," couldn't have a really destroy plan.
Let's imagine that you want to create a list that's normal food and not a general food, when the goal is to get in the American agriculture.
First of all, you've got to find the genes that are responsible for what the lights want to eat, which is for a long project.
And then you have to change these genes to change the high behavior before you, and it's a more long process.
And it may not even succeed, because the genes that control their behavior are complicated.
So if you're waiting to choose if you've got to start a car from a study in San, you've got two years of the baby work and you can't succeed, or just expect something?
I think you're going to take a look at the other possibilities.
It's true in particular to at least theories, you have to be able to learn to build "information."
It's the change that's doing the first genetic information.
So if the other results don't care about you, you can just release information that we've got on.
So what does this mean for our lives?
We're now able to change as a whole species.
Because maybe?
We became violence?
I didn't say that.
But I mean, first of all, some very smart people are right now interested in the question of genetic scientists.
In the morning, some other smart people work hard to create safe, like genetic scientists with a person who's going to do after numbers.
It's great.
But this technology is still an interesting argument.
And in a good way of the genetic information, this building has to be world.
What if we want to use this information, TV -- not?
Who's going to decide if you're going to release a genetic motor with a chimpanzee?
I have no answer to this question.
Every time we can do as two years, I think, it's going to talk about cars and take others on our choices.
And I'm not just going to decide to use genetic scientists, but also to decide not to use them.
The human beings have a little bit of the most safe possibilities is to keep the situation today.
But it's not always true.
In the risk of the risk genetic data we have in them, but the malaria is now about 1,000 people in the universe.
We're fighting in the material and society that need other species, including birds and birds.
So when you're going to hear about genetic scientists, and I'm sure you've heard about them, remember this.
It might be scared to do in fact, but sometimes it doesn't do anything.
Thank you.
And imagine that the invention that you can take my memories, my dreams, my ideas, and get them to your brain.
It would be a game technology, right?
But in fact, we're already looking at this device, and it's called the human communication system and story.
To understand how this device works, we need to look into our brain.
And we need to take the question in a little different way.
Now we need to ask how these neurons are in our brain that are connecting to our ideas and our ideas are going to your brains.
And we think there's two cases that allow us to communicate.
The first one, your brain now has a physics to the sound that I'm going to keep your brain.
And the second, we've developed a prototype that allows us to survive.
So how do we know that?
In my lab in France, we're bringing people to MRI and we're trying their brains while they tell us who are listening to stories from the real life.
And for me to give you an idea that we're using it, let me play you 20 seconds of a story that we're using, that we're told by a very happy number of stories, Jim Angyan.
[Jim]]]] Jim]]] Angeles] Egypt]]]]]]] Jay &#93
The journalists call it "to invent autism."
And they're bringing out of this road.
But I'm the moment I've seen this blog and a half of the wall with a map.
And I'm going to have it. "
OK, so now let's look into your brain and see what's going on when you listen to stories from this kind.
And let's start with metabolism -- let's start from one task in the brain: the virus that's heard the communities that come from the iPhone.
And as you can see, in this particular region in the brain, it's a great response as the story goes.
Now, we can take these responses and change them to respond in other areas at the same light in the brain.
And we can ask: How many responses will we be between all the areas?
So here you can see five since the universe.
And we're starting to provide their brain before the story starts, when they're just staring in your life and wait for a story that's starting.
As you can see, the light in the brain is going to happen in each of them, but the responses are very different, and not in humans.
However, imagine when the story starts, something amazing happens.
[John]]] "] Jim:" So I put out our story and I know he's good, and then I start doing it -- "Oh, suddenly, you can see that the responses of all the issues are based on the story, and now they're going to
And in fact, it's exactly what's happening now in your brains when you're listening to the sound of something.
We're called this effect "Sorry". "
And I'm going to explain to you what it's going to expect, let us explain what it's beautiful.
So, we'll look at five meters.
Think about the electronic companies like five brains.
And at the same time before the story starts, these tricks are going to change, but they're going to make sure there's no human beings.
[]]]] Now see what happens when I'm talking to them together by their success on these two creatures.
[]]]]]]]]]]]]]] []]]]
This robot's training through the tree and it's going to connect all the tricks together.
And now I've got two years.
[Women]]]]] Women]]]]]]]]]] The Smith]]
Now let's go back to the brain and ask: What do we prevent this strength?
Is it just the sound that the product is produced?
Or maybe these words.
Maybe that's what it's trying to get.
So for me to look at this, we did the next experiment.
First of all, we'll take the story and put it back.
And that means a lot of the modern, modern, but it's got the meaning.
And it sounds like something like this.
[John]]]]]]]]]]]]] Jim]:]]] &#93
And as you can see, the sound comes in the morning and there's no values in all the brains that work the sound, but it didn't return into the brain.
Now we can take these sounds and build them words.
So if we take Jim Egypt and we'll get the words, we'll get a list of words.
[JL:]...]]]]]]]] []]] Jim:]]]] &#
And just -- a man who's going to say -- in his potential -- my stories -- OK: And you can see that these words start to the city of the local language, but not more than that.
Now we can take the words and start to build them from sentences.
[John]: And they're bringing out and a half of this galaxy.
He says, "Jim's great, a good story, privacy and dream.
Is it not known by a vehicle? "
EM: Now you can see that responses in every region and the language that you've heard the language and the values are not being able to die in all the areas.
However, just when we use the primary story, the attention, the response, the response is going to get deeper into the brains of the brains, including the virtual democracy, and make everyone respond very similar.
And we believe that these responses in very high regions are not going to be able to die in the areas because of the meaningful meaningful meaning by the number, and we don't need words or sound.
And if we're right, there's a powerful piece here if I'm going to tell you that ideas are going to be used in two very different systems, the responses of your brain still will be very similar.
And for me to look at this, we did my next experiment in my lab.
We took the story in English and put it into the virus.
Now you've got two different systems that have heard the same meaning in our country.
And you're going to hear the story in English, so we're going to find the story in Berkeys to Ross, and we can change between their responses between groups.
And when we did that, we didn't see responses that they were dealing in a language, because the language and the sounds are very different.
However, you can see that the responses in a very high region were still between two groups.
We believe it's because they've understood the story very similar, like the video change, using the test after the stories.
And we think this survival is necessary for communication.
For example, as you can understand, I'm not an English thing when you're open.
I grew up with another language, and the same thing can be true about many of you in the audience.
And yet, we can survive.
How?
We think we can survive because we've got the beautiful point that represent meaning.
In the data, I'm just talking about what's going on in your brain, in your brain, when you're going to happen.
But what's going on in my brain, in my brain, when I talk to you?
For me to look at the brain of the desert, we asked the number to go to Syria, we didn '
You need to remember a language of making language and the language is that there's a very different process.
Where do we ask: How many are they going?
In my surprise, we saw that all the basic patterns in our areas are actually coming from the brain of the number.
So we're going to create a perception that's working on very similar processes.
And we've also found that the more powerful species between the brain and the brain, the better communication.
So I know that if you're really excited about the differences right now, and I really hope it's not the case, your brain responses very different.
But I also know that if you're really building it right now, so your brain -- and your brain is very early.
Now, let's take all the information and ask: How can we use it to move memory that we have from your brain to your brain?
So we did the next experiment.
And I gave people to watch, for the first time in their lives, in the TV of the BBC's BC, "while we didn't exist their brain.
And then we asked them to go back to Syria and tell the story to another person who had never been here in the movie.
So let's be another face.
Think about the country's country, which we've been able to go into the countries in London and it's the wind that it's looking for.
That same, as a result, there's another pattern in my brain when I'm watching it.
Now, the basic patterns, I can put on a third brain that we need to say to the world: luck, London, won.
And while I keep these words for your brains now, you need to build this on your head.
In fact, we see this pattern right now in your brain.
And we were very surprised to see that the patterns that you have now in your brains while I'm looking at these images and very similar to the patterns that I've had in the movie a few months ago.
It's starting to tell you about the car that we can tell stories and serve information.
Because for example, now you're very interested in trying to understand what I'm saying.
And I know it's not easy.
But I hope that at some point in the time we had, and you realized it.
And I think in a few hours, a few days, a few months, you're going to meet someone in the environment, and you'll tell me about this talk, and suddenly it would be like he's going to be here with us.
Now you can see how we can take this project and try to serve memory and understand people, which is a great thing, right?
But our ability to survive hours on our ability to have a common machine.
Because for example, if I'm going to use the word "British word" as a teacher "instead of" countries, "I know I'm going to be at that same time with you in the audience.
And there's a little bit of us not just about our capacity to figure out who's in the basis; it's also depending on our capacity to develop a common machine and the building systems and participants.
Because we know that in many cases, people understand the same story in very different ways.
So for me to test this in the lab, we did the next experiment.
We took a story of January. Willie School, where I lost my wife in a way, and he's happy to my best friend, and he said, "Would you see my wife?"
The next half of the ocean, we said that the woman's famous woman with the good friend.
For the other half, we said that the woman is a very faith in Iraq.
This one sentence before the story started enough to make the responses of all the people who believe that the woman's faith was going to be very similar to the different cases from the different group of the other group.
And if one sentence is enough that your brain will be what people think like you will be very different from people who think of you, think about how this effect can be limited in the real life, when we're listening to the same movement after we're going to be important after we're going to create other things to do, and we're going to have a very different kind of innovation,
So let me provide.
If it's all working as the Arab Center, I've used my capacity to get me to reduce your brains.
And I've been using this museum for me to keep my brain patterns with my memory and ideas into your brains.
By that, I'm going to start to replace the savings of nervous nervous nerve that we survive.
And we know that the future is that we can't improve the communication.
But these studies are also revealing that communication is based on a common machine.
And we need to be very concerned as a society if we lose this common machine and talk to people that they're a little bit of us because we're going to give a number of very powerful groups of creativity to go on the microphone, and to the idea of the way we think.
And I'm not sure how to fix it because I'm just a scientist.
But maybe one way to do it is to go back to the natural way of communication, which is Alice, where it's not just I'm talking to you now, but through natural way to talk, where we're talking to, and we're trying to get to get a new ideas.
Because after all, the people we're excited about is who we are.
And our answer to represent with another brain is something that's very basic that starts with very early.
So let me end with an example of my privacy life that I think it's a very good example about how I'm really excited with other people really going to define who we are.
It's my son, and you can, in a very early age.
It's seen how it's opening together with my wife, just from the real passion of getting to another person.
[They]]]]]]] []]]]]]]]]] &#93
And we thought how you're going to change in the basis of the interaction and reinvestment with other people in your life.
So you're going to be able to get to other people.
You're going to keep your ideas, because the agrees of all together, connected, bigger than our parts.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Like a collective artist, I'm looking for creative ways to save challenges of challenges.
I'm doing this through a painting, Paul, Kenya and I'm not a phenomenon.
But without a criticism, two of the important materials on them were the history of the Neang.
In 2007, I've created "L.T.," a rights in the form of the Twitter's Twitter's Twitter's Twitter's Twitter's Twitter '92, and in the web of 300 children.
In California, the Congress was a symbol of the Soviet's Foundation's Foundation of the thought was simple.
But this particular perspective that all of the cosmos is a powerful wisdom of work.
This intuitive components took from a Britain in Britain later was all of the movement to the work so forth to move.
In America, we don't like to talk about the work, as we don't see as a global future.
But within the use of this history, I hope to make the interactive history of the American community and the universal community and the interest in the common thing.
In order to create "L.D." over 6,000 countries.
And in the middle of this, it was easy to invite from the New York City of Congress in the age of 28 pounds made of welfare, as a giant device in young men, in "Solly African students, two groups that have been affected from this history.
These two groups are also influenced as well as a phenomenon now, but after what it's about to build data.
I've been collected from Africa's apartments and radical experiences and spread around the world.
They're small and their teachers to make sure, but people believe they're wrong in power, or even magic.
I just recently discovered how to use them in my work.

I've created this art form, which is called "Please."
Here's important to reduce the identity of each of these countries, to get them to see identity, and easier to move.
In order to do that, I got them in a single week, I got them to take them out there, and I've discovered them with skills.
And it was fun, play with big, big, and we're going to find out what's going on.
But I've done these countries that I've been aware of information from me to outside the line, feel like I'd happen to be.
Finally, my chair, read, did the wall.
One "I've all taken their bridges, and I've created patterns, and I've taken them every week, and eventually in Arab as you can see in images, they've put them in these institutions like a step and a military.
When I got this work in my mom, a woman said to me that I felt very close to me.
However, in addition, it felt that these real creatures have been successful for many of these conversations as well as many other countries of violence over the American history.
But "Lot" and "if" grow from the American history.
When I got them in my wife and my wife, a philosophical student asked me what was going to know these tricks.
I've shown me a picture of Google's country from the 20th century, and I've mentioned to me that these streets are already happening over 500 years.
However, just through these questions as well as Netherlands are full of thought in the history of stem and we can evolve as humans and as a society.
I hope that our real creatures create a place for this form of transport because it's the opportunity to make people who are living together with each other.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I think of dreams, like many of you, I think about this picture.
I've been eight years old when I've watched the Atlantic Center and came out of the space and offered the ice.
I've never seen something like that before, and now I didn't see nothing.
We've come to one simple reason: John Kenyan started to describe business.
If there wasn't a long time like this, we'd still be learning about the ice.
The New York Times said there's two things that are necessary for the leadership: programs, and time it's not enough to use the program.
I'm going to describe agencies, and they're the important lessons and they're going to be "even."
And they're what you've been able to look at, "Shanging."
And our world need political leaders who are willing to start to describe artists and need some of our dreams and help in a big story.
When I think of dreams, I think about the Congress of Los Angeles and millions of people's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's students' students' students' students' students &ap
It's a picture that in part of the most surprising part I couldn't imagine. When I was 18 years old, I realized that I was a institution, and I felt too too close from my country, and from my dreams, as a result.
I think about this picture of my family that I've never been able to have -- I've never been able to be -- I've been able to have my kids -- and our kids are reducing this classroom that I've never been able to be a printer of the sentence of the sentence.
We need more courageous, like a Democrats like asteroids.
I'd like to talk about this that we need to share more than one because I didn't even know when I was eight years old, and something about the organization of the problem.
From 30 astronomers in the car of Mr. Robert, James and even, just seven years after human beings.
These oceans of asteroids are exposed on the moon and selecting the elimination and depression and depression in the Earth.
Thomas Martin, the training region, which I asked a wonderful job of even "What can we remove from the party to space if we can't save the blood that's separated with us?"
And what can we move from the privilege to sleep if we can '
And it's not just about women.
I've seen the most tough victims, the hormones and training within the groups of the United States, patients of cancer, and active in the colleagues with no profit, everything called love.
Martin Martin also wrote about war between women's women "has a power power of violence and the atheist's atheist: I'm a very amazing work.
Our effect of our autism is to join our work for peace.
It's destroying our privilege of ourselves to live in peace. "
And often our dreams are going to be our cells about some future that makes our capacity for our lives in our lives at the moment.
Our dreams of life are good for what it's a future or a nation that's human in a different country that's living with us from the beautiful people who are sitting in this moment.
Well, it's just the research of the point, we say.
You can get to the ice, or you can get a huge family.
And we can't get part of the two places at the same time.
And we don't want the goal beyond groups when it comes to our emotions.
That's why technology is revealed with each other and changing our ability to listen and understand each other at all.
Our approach to preventing limitations, our approach to happiness, teachers.
But this idea, that our future is leadership to this, that we need to find our potential to do is we need to more about our own own potential potential, that the amount of terrorists can be as a model as a disease, but our ability to be a disease, a human love is when it's inevitable. It's when it's invisible.
Now, I don't offer my inspired idea more "food between life to work."
What's going to help me spend more time with my kids at home if my thought was always in another place, while I do that?
I don't even talk about cars.
The programs become recently recently able to transform products.
I mean?
I'm talking about the ability to share the same courage of the universe as we're learning about technology.
I'm talking about the same small, and I'm left that allows us to solve each other, a series of professionals, which enables us to read the journey and be real.
Our ability to be one of our ability to be with each other, our fear is because with each other, they make so much of the problems that we're trying to solve, from designers in Congress to humanity in the economy.
And I mean, I mean what John Alexander is called "Watch", "a new period where we're emotionally excited about our personal development as we're about our development of technology.
We don't need to talk about this opportunity just because we don't really understand it.
There was a time where we didn't understand the space.
Or we're bigger to technology and autism.
That's exactly the definition of being known in the only region.
It's very easy to take us now to imagine that psychologists have a need.
In 2016, the model of the data we've been and we're the use of the use of our imagination.
Now, we're all here to share, but maybe if we're today, each of the microbes after the dreams of ourselves.
You know, you look at the rainforest to see who can help me with my dream, sometimes you look inside the human beings of the other person.
Don't take it right now, I have an idea that we've got the world.
Right?
And once, a lot of years ago, I had a very long company that made a long restaurant to the East East East.
And we've had San Man: "I'm a man. Bay. Here's the two."
And we've been interested in doing experimental experiments about what we're building.
Like: "You're going to help everyone with their loans."
And there were a lot of audience.
["Thank you all Arabic."
"You're going to help people to fix Chile in the wheelchair even though you know that the rich to the Arab Arab is going on."
And people really used a experiment, until so that if you had a Charles in actions about AIDS, you'd have to fix it, because so many people asked if you need help.
For a few days, for tens of thousands of people, we've created a world that everyone said, so we want the world to be.
What do you know that we're trying to create a world like this in the next place?
And instead of asking someone to ask, "What do you do?"
And I said, "So what are your dreams?"
Or, "What's your favorite dreams?"
You know, "Okay." Tony's dreams of other people.
Thank you for this: "I want to stay like" Oh, "I want to build a tree with my voice."
You know, instead of asking people that everyone wants to meet, go to the sky, and ask me if he wants to change a map.
I think what we've proposed us is that we don't have the opportunity to make our real potential, that we've got to share and we can die without having the opportunity.
And imagine life in the world where we're just recognizing this deep fear, one in two of us love each other because we know it's human, it's to live with this fear.
It's time that we're part of different species at the same time, and it's somehow beyond the wonderful things that we can, and we need to make a place of all the national things that we can be.
It's time that we're going to get out of this country and hope we've got part of it as well.
If the street could be part, I think it was my dream for us.
It might be you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
In the summer, it's once all the electronics in one history, we can get out of a billion now.
It's become it that computers in the size of a whole room now get in your pocket.
You might say the future is small.
A couple of engineers, I'm inspired by the spinal revolution in computers.
As a doctor, the same if we can use it to reduce the number of places in one of the diseases that spread in the highest rate of the Earth: cancer.
Now when I say this, what most people hear me is that we're working on the possibilities of cancer.
And we do that.
But it turns out that there's an amazing opportunity to save life through this way that there's a motivation of cancer.
In the world, more than three years from the places in cancer, companies are going to decide that we've already have today.
Things like China, Syria at the time and of course, I've been reduced.
But even with the best and best technologies we have today, how big we can't identify 10 years after they started growing, when they grew up to 50 million movies.
What if we had a better technology to identify how much cancer cancer is, more species, when you can get them, when they just start?
Let me tell you about how the reminder might help us here.
It's a microscope in biological lab and use it to look at speech genes, like a cosmos or a platform.
This microscope that's made 7,000 dollars was used by somebody with the women of brain training to identify films.
It's a great picture of our university at the University of Richard Charles.
What she's her team did is take all the microscope into 10, and she's looking at a group of optimism.
Now what this means is that instead of taking a patient and send it to a microscope, you can bring the microscope into a patient.
And then, instead of having a disease to look at images, you can train the computer and normal cells.
Now it's important, because what they've found in a privacy work, is that even when they have San Francisco that can go out to the community and collect and send them to the central hospital to build, that water is later, women get a phone with a phone and they're looking at.
Some of them don't come because they can't afford the aid.
With a microscope that's used to build a computer, a lot of it would be able to create Canadan that has the security and also the political capacity.
And what it means is that they can look at and make a treatment in the place, so no one has to work later.
It's just one example of how the arm can save life.
Now some experiments, we think about it as a series of service.
You take a big thing to do it.
But what I've told you about computers was that they changed our lives when they became small enough to take them everywhere.
So what's the leadership for the stories like medicine?
Well, what if you'd have a little bit of a woman who was so small that he could know inside your body, find the big big band to send it into the outside world?
It sounds a little bit like science.
But in fact, technology allows us to do exactly this.
We're going to give us a technology that allows us to wrap the parts that create the unusual of a person, which is 100 microbes, a thousand times more, which is 100 meters.
And it's got meaningful consequences.
It turns out that materials actually change their programs in the scale of the nation.
You take a normal material like a gold, and you take it to a bar, you take some of the gas, and it's changing the same as a human space.
If you take a smaller materials like Sylacini -- that's a big gas that's a black hole -- if you take a New York City of this material and you put them in the dinosaurs, and you're described on them, they're the river.
And they're the river in the blue, Derek, yellow, stars, red, red, depending on their size.
It's crazy! You can imagine themselves like this in the air world?
It's like all the blue jeans in your Amazon may be a program, but they're in different colors will depend on their size.
So as a doctor, what's interesting to me is that it's not just the color of the material that's changing in the size of the India; the way that it's going on in your body also changed.
And that's the security that we're going to use to create a better cancer.
So let me show you why I mean.
It's every day in the body.
About every day there's a big difference.
We're going to remove parts of the cells and watch how they're going to grow.
Now it turns out that every day of a lot of big tumors, and that's how parts can push out of the water into the size.
Their voice depends on their size.
So in this picture, the blue parts of the age of 100 kilometers, and the red parts of the age of 500 meters know in the region today.
So this means that a couple of engineers, depends on how small we do the part, I can change these species is going in the body.
In my lab, recently we created a cancer, which is so small that it can move into the body and look for tumors.
We're going to plan us to figure out big news: the training of the same species that grow up to create to spread.
Because we're going to make a frog faster and what it's easy, it has to create chemicals that look like to eat the way of the river.
We're going to design the hands to be surrounded by these regions.
One person can activate thousands of of these chemical responses in the hour.
Now in the engineer, we call it one relationship to the shape of the man, and this is created something to the police.
So we've created a cancer tremendous cancer.
Okay, but how do we bring these beautiful letters into the outside world, where can I work on?
For this, we're going to use another pattern of biology in the nanotech, and it's about every single day.
It's the tools that they're certain.
They're their work is to China the day and transfer the plastic.
It turns out that what certain possibilities also depend on the size.
So in this picture, what you can see is that everything that's small than five feet away from the day, through the whole tool, and all the rest that's growing from it.
Okay, so I've created a big cancer in a 100 meters, I'm throwing it to the next day, it can take a click to a big, where it's reduced by the big music to release a little bit enough to be outside the whole world into the rest of the rest of the world, and I've got it.
Okay, but there's a problem.
It's the same tiny little, so how do we move it?
Well, the letter is just a molecule.
They're molecules that we're going to write some experiments.
They're satellite, and we can design them so they're going to be focused on all of our choice.
If we want to use a tool that's called an atmosphere, so we create a molecule with a living atmosphere.
Or maybe we want something more cheaper to us.
So we're making molecules that can go on on the wall, like the wall.
In fact, there's a whole world of microbes that become a place in a year called a New York Times.
All right, where do we go with this?
What I'm going to tell you now, as I've known to a long task, represent my dream.
I can't say it's the security; it's part.
But I think we're all going to need part to continue to push the same point, also -- and maybe in the city -- cancer studies.
I'm going to tell you what I hope to do with my technology, that our team doesn't have the heart and the attention to make it reality.
Okay, here's this.
I've got to do one years, instead of going to the California for California, or from Germany, you can get a refugee, waiting for an hour, and do a building that will be on a piece of paper.
I'm countries that it can happen even have a need to be reduced, or a medical illusion in the room.
Maybe they could be free and connect us by always on the smart phone.
Now I know it sounds part, but in my lab we already have this work in cities, where it's better than the Twitter Technoza to grow cancer, from part.
And I hope that what it means is that one day we can identify less patients than 10 years after they started to grow, in all of life, around the world, and it's easier to political politicians, we can save more games that we can today, with this today.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Do I call you real?
I hope.
I don't have any idea if you see it, but I'm just an object that you're there.
I've created a half of a galaxy in the hospital so I'm not going to leave it as if I'm just a space in the air.
Right now I'm standing in the open air, on the wind under the tree, in the country where your stage was.
I have 12 minutes with you.
And in the future.
My wife and my wife said once you can't have stories, they're the worst enemy of the production.
For example, this word: I asked her to design something that means I had in the morning of the 23.
But we had three days to create it, and the only understanding that we had was so different that we had after the light.
But she did it, and she's perfect.
And she looked at me and she said, "You've got a plan -- and you need limits."
So with these 12 minutes, I'm going to tell you about my biggest age.
For my whole life, my answer was to laugh, as I know it's for many of you.
You might be happy to know that your research will be used.
I'm 318.
The average way of people's average life is 432 now, and I've been working to describe the lives of people to support.
And we've never been expecting two years, and we're going to go to the point where we're going to be serious.
But the revolution is going to happen: the more we live, we wanted to live more, and less we wanted to die.
Who can you put us?
The universe is so big.
We've never come to a situation that doesn't see more.
Only I'm just going to say, I've read about how you can take a series in Europe and get very unable across the platform, and in some of the conditions there's a village that you can visit under the sound of the side.
And there's another person who's going to have one service that's sitting in the country in the ocean.
And then there's others where no one has ever been, and then you're going to touch the road with a sand that's never going to go.
You can spend 400 years in doing it.
It's right now the ice in North East.
I can see the cities with unprecedented eyes.
They're connected like nervous objects: Mr. Mr. Philip on the wall, and Richard Iran on the other.
And the new statement in India.
There I met my father.
We've changed art in the city.
In the day we met, we've gone through one of the other on the planet and then, and we'll give us a face.
And I've been in my home to get out and say, "Oh, don't you say peace or something said," Well, why don't you think we've just gone through the second? "
And first, I thought, "Who's the hell?"
But after that, the great question to me, because the answer is so simple.
I said, "We didn't go one way through the second because some of the experiments have been trained, because the protein between the Chinese parts are full of energy that they also have a plan of a effort, and we've known it for 800 years."
She was probably one of the streets of the street and she liked to stop with strangers.
Or maybe it's just a platform with me, because she looked at me and said, "I thought you're going to say that.
Think too much. "
And then she was dealing her definition, the definition that I'm wearing now, and she said, "We're going to have that dream and there's a basis.
In the basic limitations, we'd know one thing through the other speed of light even know. "
And so our parents started.
My father's father's father's father's never going to talk about them.
Never.
It was amazing.
It was like the two cooking dots that flow on the road and the wisdom and the right to get new faces, and these new molecules that were invented from us to describe them.
And we'd forget them once we've created them, and we'll get them beyond the next drum, and on the top.
Or for another time, and my father said that our conversation was as if we were always created to fight, and we always had a little bit more and a little bit more than a few days, and we're going to get us into the world and we've never got it.
If my grandmother was a laugh, my grandfather was a touch.
She had an example of this.
All her work was around this.
My body was in the night, and she was creative with a fingerprint on the side because I couldn't feel it.
And she was based on the moment of my imagination, and I was trying to be able to understand between her body's bodies.
Anybody who was like a baby and I've been looking at her shoulder and says, "Paul, why does it feel so good?"
And I would say, "I don't know!"
And there was always a different answer to her different questions, but the answer I remember today is, "It feels good because the universe is in my limitations, and we're my real answer."
It's always funny and how you think the future will be a model of how it's coming out.
In your time, scientists thought people could get themselves to the future.
And they did it -- but then they died.
In your time, scientists thought that people could be able to replace resources and return life in hundreds of years.
And they did it, but finally they're dealing it.
In your time, the Earth was the only place of people.
At the time, the Earth is the place for people to die.
So when my father started to show institutions, my friends were the only ones I would do what everybody would do, which is to say peace and send it to the Earth, so that no one has to look at us or have to be thinking about it...
His failure to continue to live.
More than all, they didn't want to be her physical body.
They used to treat me as "Wait," even though it was too scared of it, the second that he went through, when he was working after the rules of nature and others, I've learned from her idea.
I sent my father to the Earth.
But I brought it.
I remember that our company, just before I worked, said, "I just think it's great, like life doesn't share with you, as if you think your love is so special."
But I did that.
So, even here on Earth, I started working on how to make life.
It didn't work that I could be a different response.
I went back to this thing that my father told me about the same day in my neighborhood and then, in these basic limits -- the day that you could try to say -- we didn't have a place.
It's one life.
Another experience is that all the atmosphere is not the Internet.
And there's no way to be a bank without a galaxy.
I know, I tried everything.
And I tried to create a typical printer in which there's a different category.
I've been trying to take a total tool in our body and return them into the atmosphere.
Nothing worked.
But my final invention was to create a model with the boundaries of the body at the time and to come to the end, but my career was to look at a normal time.
This body would look at our buildings as a graph -- here's not here.
When I realized I did this, I wanted to her room, so happy to say that I did it, to go through the space almost normal to all the eyes, and I went to a lab, and I forgot, and I started a vehicle.
I found a way to live and win, on one thought of the things that my father's most love, what was about to touch.
And he returned me out.
I still could watch this.
People live 400 years now, and we're still dead.
And when the death comes, the water is still in their experiences, and on their arms, they're reminding less blue blue blue blue blue, and they're going to have one of the other, as if they're dead.
I've always thought what you can hear about life is the medicine.
And it's just a problem that we still didn't discovered her solution.
But maybe life has meaning just because they're enough.
That's the Francisco: limits don't discover, they enable freedom.
[Here's the morning noise.
One more of the night, but I've built the sky.
I can '
The answer that comes from my wife.
I have to find my way back to the heart.
By then, I don't take water out of the place that you give me.
And what I'd like to talk about today is some ideas that I think they've got a little bit about all the things that we've been talking about in the last place.
In fact, so many points of hope it would be hard to get everyone, but I'll ask. Somebody remember those?
I'm okay, so these are little kids and they're scared, well.
They disappeared for the last two decades by digital technology from this kind of world, yes.
And I think we've seen it the best when we're going to play the music when we go into the room today.
What's happening in the music is that there's a culture or a relationship that's happening that if you take a few words from the East, the key idea that we're creating, doing many institutions.
What I'm trying to say is that every one in the world is free to create a new music that's musical ideas.
Each one in the world's much more to wait or to move from musical ideas, and use new forms.
Each one is more to connect them in different ways, to create skills between musical ideas and people can watch them maybe create stories and make the space.
And what it's going to do is create, as I said, and the community is very, very easy to learn where people work without the party of music ideas, sending them to keep things right now, yes, yes.
The growth of today's growth is not the growth of a year, OK.
But, I'm not here to talk about music today.
I'm here to talk about books, OK.
In particular, we're going to imagine a kind of material material where we're using every day in school.
Somebody ever in school?
I'm okay, someone understand that there's something in our schools, around the world?
I hope, OK, I'm not glad about it for a long time, but what I want to talk about is a kind of identity that affects when my friend's a book.
In fact, the process of invisible -- just because of the fact that it's complicated, it's as a star, books are great -- a kind of thing between the books and the stories of books, if they're the teachers, if they're the teachers, students or just look.
And it's even true if you're talking a different language from one of the functions, and basically English.
And I'm called these people underneath the proteins, because they're really aware of the process of being able to share their knowledge with the world.
So what I want to talk about today is the experiment to take these ideas, yes, we've seen in the music culture and try to bring them into the reinvestment of the thinking of movies, using them to learn from them, OK.
So, about that, I'd like to speak really, how do we get from where we now where we need to get?
So, the first thing I'd like you to do is a little computer experiment.
So, imagine taking all the books in the world.
Okay, they'll all imagine books and more than three times of the face.
So, these factors and imagine them go through digital process, yes, and then we're like trees and global warming.
Think about it as a kind of complex experiment, yes, the content of books.
And then you take this material and imagine all of us free, so people can change it, play it, improve it.
And imagine I became free, so every one in the world can be used and use information technology so that you can do this material, improve it, to play it, instead of three years.
Okay, instead of the speed that's coming out of every two years, to tell, and imagine them all 25 seconds.
So, imagine we can do this and imagine that we can put people in this platform, yes.
So we can actually build systems with not just the plants, but with all the people that can be write in the world, and I think if you can do this, it's called, well, I just take the relationship to this as the data system.
So, really, it's part and in a way that you can think about it that we're trying to enable each of the world, I mean each of the DDI'm going to be the Center's lives of themselves, to create unique materials today, to share them with the world, feel them all the time.
So, this is the dream.
In fact, the dream is really, really, yes.
For the last five years, we've been working very hard at university on a project called GPS, so what I want to do in the talk is to you a little bit about what people do with the GPS, that you can think of as a result of what we're going to see is that we're going to show up to Chicago Chicago Gates, where they &ap
We're working on all the open software and the content, OK?
So, it's because it's interesting to put it in a good perspective.
So to create, so some of the people who use this kind of tool?
Well, the first thing is that there's a community of professors to engineer, from Mr. Britain, who's opening up where a electrical reason to develop what you can think about as a book like Mexico Mexico Mexico, yes, who's covering all the field of electricity.
And not just that, it can be always if you use each of their institutions.
If people like Tijus -- yes, I'm going to look at the tools -- privacy for music and Museum, who wanted to share her wonderful music with the world, how to learn to play. The material is now in 6,000 times a month.
So using light, air.
In fact, a lot of the use of the United States is coming from the United States, in a global number of children will grow 12 because everyone is involved in school, the first thing that's going to need is the music.
So it's just teaching the air for this kind of content that's open and free.
Many teachers use it.
Okay, what about your life? What about the future, reuse, yes?
Social team at the University of Palestinian, students in the last year represents the ideas of the Syria in Canada.
And while about a week, it became part of the most popular materials in the Western America and in Mexico, because of the openness of the openness that's going to happen.
People, they're building and even companies that replace materials to transform agencies like institutions, and I've developed cell phones, to spread the knowledge.
Okay, what about the people who heard four?
What does this mean for a quarter? Four says to build a real viruses.
I mean, to build books are perfect.
Other companies like Western Australian, which are very powerful and interactive in the materials, so that we can get beyond the regulation of the experience of learning and things, you can be able to play with them and actually learn in this industry.
We've been working with teachers without limits that we're interested in four materials.
I've learned a collection of material and it seems to learn teachers how to learn in 84 countries around the world.
Research without limits right now in 20,000 cases in the USD.
And for them, the idea of being capable of being able to reveal the local connection is very important, because we're going to provide a very simple material material to people in the developing world of culture and culture, so if you don't reduce the power of the material, you can't reduce the power of the material, to look at their own language, it's not good.
Okay, other organisms we've been working with the UC, people know the UC.
It's not a new university in California, in the center of the central, which works in Millijians.
They're actually opening a lot of their data and where the India is going to spread around the world in our system.
And they're also trying to develop different kinds of tools in open and open.
We worked with AMD that they have a project called 50 to 15.
We're going to provide them as well as a space of corruption.
And we also worked with a number of organisms.
In particular, a group of projects that are focused on the Darwin's Darwin, who's a real role in real issues about the open content.
Okay, a product, I think it's kind of, and interesting.
It's the idea of trying to create the finance of one of these viruses and I think many of you are in the door.
I think you're all going to get one of these music in your other part.
A little device for you.
Just to tell you about this, it's the engineering book.
It's through 300 pounds, in so hard.
The research, someone can feel?
How much is it going to get in books?
Audience: 65 dollars.
Richard Richard Bay: It's about 22 dollars.
And why is it 22 dollars?
Because he's published before he's developed from this openness of materials.
If this book was an instruction by a normal result, it was 122 dollars at least.
Okay, so what we see is that this young process or the result of the only gravity, because materials wrote by the community that they're teaching, that's supposed to find not just a woman who's in this way, we're looking at it, and we're looking at it in Amazon, yes, we're looking at a C
And I think it's a very interesting field because there's a light underneath the long region.
We don't talk about the end of the atmosphere, on the left.
We're talking about books in the CO2 metaphors in parts.
Well, books that might be dead in 100 hours a year, 1,000 hours a year.
There's a huge movement, yes, underneath this long region to hold open projects like us, but we're also able to buy this new cost of professionals not just a woman, like Chicago created these books.
And I think one of the things that you need to take you from this talk, it's a weird that's listening to the man's office, yes.
And it's going to come to us for the next few years, and I think it's really good for us, and for the world.
Okay, so what are the possibilities?
What makes it happen?
There's like technology, and the only part of the technology I really want to talk about is MMT.
How many people know what it's MMMM?
Oh, wonderful, so this is the future of the network, yes.
It's the statistics of cities, yes.
And what you're really able to learn to MMT in this case, that's the argument that we're put around the face.
Remember we took a book, and we're going to have our face?
Well, what the MMMMT is going to do is basically -- it's going to make these faces to Bill, well.
TMM are the intuition of the gene that allows us to connect the content in a diversity of ways and it's enough to change the material.
So, it allows this system, well, in her first situation, well, all of her content, all the faces that you've been paid from the books and created a very sophisticated country, and books, engineers, OK, OK.
It gives you the capacity to get people's experience to every student, yes, so that every student can be a book or a book that's always going to their country, to their language, to their language, and things that feel them.
It allows you to use the same materials in many different ways, new ways and surprising.
It allows you to connect with ideas and show how surgeons, yes, treat each other.
And I'll just give you my personal story.
We've got it, six months ago because I teach the things in the ocean.
And my work, like Chris said, I'm a professor to get electricity.
I'm teaching that challenge and my challenge was to show that this mathematics -- and I'm, about a half of you are already just going to look at the equation.
But the mathematics is in this woman's approach is actually the center of this powerful network that serves technology -- that really requires use users like Scott Texas and help with the opportunities of architecture and theory, but I also went through a hole project.
And the thing that I realized is that there's no way I am, okay, some experiments, I can write this book that we can get all this.
We needed a community for doing this and we needed new tools to be able to connect these ideas.
And I think really, in a way, what we're trying to do is make the parts of Mexico to find out, where we can imagine all books in America and actually talk to each other, yes.
And people they're teaching out there, who's who, who you know it. It's actually about the connections between ideas.
Okay, back to math, yes, right, it's possible.
Anyway you can take it on one of your new electronics is something that you can explore and try.
Okay, so imagine the book of your children, well, in the classroom.
You can take us on each other and get a small tool to try it, play it, understand it.
Because we really don't understand until we do it.
The same kind of imagination, like MMMMMA, learning.
And imagine a chemistry that really understand the structure of molecules and products.
And imagine MMMA to music that enables you to go into the static structure of music, we put it, look at it.
There's no doctor that everybody's going to go to it, right?
Even the three people were waiting.
I'm okay, the other great possibility, and here I've told a big poem.
The second great possibility is not only only together.
Because I actually got there and I talked about some of the music culture.
We can share education and mix, but actually it's not our lives.
Well, we're going to be there in Portuan if we're doing it, yes, because this music is intuitive.
It's now a transformation, yes, it's often a big industry.
So, really, the key here is that we can't allow it to happen.
We can't allow this Africa to happen here.
So, what we need to do is do it true from the beginning.
And what we need to do is to find a pattern of a new dance that makes a difference, and it makes it a difference.
And the effects here are taking an open machine.
Things like GPP.
And the ideas, the Democratic device in Mexico.
How many people have heard about a university?
If you haven't heard, you have to learn about it.
CA: Chartter Scott.
In the bottom of every material in a lot of other projects, you'll find their categories.
The child on this audience will take you to a party without a theater and see a person, the agreement that tells you exactly what you can do with this content.
In fact, you're free, yes, share it, do all kinds of things, to invest it, change it, even doing training training and all the more you know the disease.
Because in advertising, I'm much too much in the local advertising, it's actually this idea of transparency, it's why, it's why, and it's why.
That's why people write, not necessarily to do money.
We're not talking about the park, yes.
We're this long group here.
And behind that, it's the sentence and the sentence, yes, so if you want to build it very quickly.
And Richard and I'm looking at a concept, yes. Oh, over 43 million things out there, you're using the interview of the Mexico.
Not just text, also music, images, video.
And there's actually a animal on the number of people who are trying to imagine that there's a freedom of people to do all of this idea of reproduction, education, and in the environment.
So I'd like to end with a few minutes.
So, we've looked at this idea of changing everyone.
People use it.
We're getting over 5,000 visitors in a month, just our website.
The open viruses of MIT, which is another free website, gets a number of engineers, but how do we define it?
How do we define it to the future.
And the first thing that people probably think is quality, yes.
Because we're saying that each one can transform things.
Each one can get anything.
So it can be a problem.
So, it didn't take a lot of time, yes, until people started to translate content to women, which is actually a good model.
The only problem is that it's been a real response, yes, from a great French French French French and when you go to the website, it's bringing you to a website under the universe, OK?
So, this is a little problem.
So in the morning, we had to have a kind of quality of quality and it really is where the idea of building is going.
Okay, you come to TED. Why do you come to TED?
Because my team and my team looked new things are very high, yes.
So we need to be able to do the same thing, yes.
And we need to be able to design and what we're doing is to design a social program to allow everyone to build our creative process that we call it.
And basically what they're able to enable is each one where to develop the human biological process, so that we can focus on where they think it's really important.
And you can think about TED as a potential.
So I'd like to end up with say, you can actually see it as a action of action, yes.
Gids and openness are on the slide and knowledge.
You're all here who's here who's wrong with our theories and what I'd like to do is invite each of you to train this project and to other projects, because I think we can change the wisdom of education and the result.
So, thank you very much.
There's a set of tools: there's a lot of food.
It was a connection that I wrote when I was 11 and I got 11 and I got good. I'm going to talk about: There's a lot, and how we create.
And I'm going to try to do this in the 18th century minutes that we're supposed to exist, and to track TED things: that, in fact, something that's made of extinction, but also that's good for creativity.
I'm OK.
Well, I also want to explain, because Congress said he's going to tell me if he says something that's about, or I'm real to create universal creativity.
And I've been doing this for a half of the audience, which is scientists.
When I say we're, I'm not a car that you're; I'm a car, and I'm my favorite brain, my left brain, and that's where they're going to say that what I'm saying is that what I'm saying is not true.
And I'm going to do it as well by looking at what it might know as part of my form process, that including a number of things that's going on, actually -- there's not even before I've created something new.
And it's including the molecule, and it's going on, and what I call students.
Now in the model of the model, we're building whether we're dealing with a molecule, maybe in our brains, how many cases don '
And there were people who would say that we were born with this in other ways.
And others, like my mom, say I'm getting my materials from a place.
And there's people who also say that creativity is a result of the result of a biological opportunity -- a tragedy and a little bit -- you have a little bit, a psychologist, because it's not a depression.
I've got to say, someone -- I've read the recently of Najan was not necessarily a privilege, that maybe the birthday in the French Olympics, and the question might be made to my creativity, and I don't -- I'm doing it something to some part of your brain.
And I think I'm really under the face of the metaphor for a few years ago, but it was when I wrote my last book, and there's people who say this book is different.
I think some of it also starts with a sense of identity: You know, who I am, why do I'm this particular person, why don't I happen like everyone?
And sometimes they're interested in countries, but they're not a kind of policy that allows creativity.
I've ever created. I thought I'll be real.
And here's California.
And it wasn't bad, but it wasn't really creative.
Because everything I really could do was represent in a way that it's very broken.
And I've got a sense that as much as I've seen it a number.
And then I'm also not really the United States and in some cases I wanted, and you know, you look at these creatures, and they weren't bad, but it's at the point of people and I'm going to get one of the places of words.
In addition, one of the creative principles is that you're going to have a little bit of tragedy.
And I had the great kind of regulation that I think most people was, and that's the one, you know, we've been based on expectations.
This shape is there, by the way, there's a toy that can give me when I've been a tool, and it was to help me get a very young doctor.
I've got a couple of dollars: five to 15, it's supposed to be my team, and it's led to the sense of failure.
But actually there was something real about a month when I was about 14.
And my sister, in 1967, and then my dad, six months later, were bigger in the brain.
And my mom believed that something was going on, and it's going to be proud of it.
My dad was a metabolism, and he believed in experiments, and with the tools that would come to the place in peace.
But of course, they're in the end of something, on the other side of this year.
And after that, my mom believed that it was normal, I'm learning -- it's going to look at all the reasons why it happened.
It's not the beliefs. It doesn't believe in cases.
Everything was a reason.
And one of the reasons, she thought, she was a woman who died when she was very young, because she went on.
And so I had this kind of death that would push me because my mother also believed that I'm next to me, and she's after.
And when you're going to have a very powerful model of death, you're starting to think very much about everything.
You've become very creative, where I've been talking about.
And that, then, led to my big questions.
And these are the questions I have today.
And they are: Why do things happen, and how do things happen?
And that's my mom question: How do I make things happen?
It's a great way to look at these questions, when you write a story.
Because after all, in this work, between 300, you have to answer the question of why things happen, how do things happen, what are they curious. What are the effects? What are the effects?
And how do I, as the magic, as the classroom, also affect it?
And that's also the question I think many of our scientists are asking.
It's a great study, and I need to develop my world today's world's world's world's world's world's room, and I need to develop my world's world's world's world's room.
And you see, there's a lot of experiences in trying to make it happen, trying to figure it out -- women about women, sometimes.
So when I look at creativity, I also think it's this feeling that we're not the capacity of the capacity to take our patterns in Asia and in fact anything in life.
And I've had a lot of them from what's going on during this conference, almost everything happened.
And so I'm going to use, as a metaphor, in this Asia: the little car, which I'm really not understand, but I'm still going to use the process that's going to explain how it's the metaphor.
So in the little car, of course, you have a global blue blue.
And this is the same thing about these questions about how things happen.
It's a lot of unknown, and often I don't know what it's about.
But when you have these samples, you want them to get together in some kind of energy, and what you find is what's important.
And that's what I'm looking for in my work, meaning people.
There's also the red principles, which is part of the little car, as I understand it.
And there's the medical effect, where you look at the same thing, and you know, things are happening in a different way, and you look at it in a different way, and you're trying to find this structure. I'm on this story, and if you're going to write about it.
You're not going to go.
And what I'd like to find, what's different to find, in some cases, I know there.
Now, I don't want to disappear from the other side of what's happening in the world, as you do many of us.
And so I'm just going to go here with the lowest theory, and just say that people are creative and they're four days, and there's a tool, I think, of insection.
And they're all working in entrepreneurs.
There's also a big question about bees.
And I'm going to communicate it to something that's just about the virtual knowledge.
And I don't know what it works, but something works there.
And theory, for me, it's very uncomfortable in my life, and I have it.
It's there a way. It's just for example, it's one that came to me recently.
It was something that I read in the American system from a woman who was talking about the war in the city, and he said, "The reality is a training person, responsible for all life."
She said, "A very famous experiment, she said."
And that means that, because we've come into the city, we have to stay there doing things and solution. You know, maybe even 100 years.
So here's another one of my daughter's door, and he's "to save a metaphor."
And that's what we're going to say, because they're not supposed to get anything.
And they also need to get rid, and people need to eat.
So their way to offer this is that they're making the motivation from a traffic, and unfortunately it's out of it.
Now the reality of three metaphor metaphors -- actually, one of them is my mother's story, and that's what she said to me because she said to me, "The investment reality is responsible for all life."
And that was the hell -- don't go in the eyes of other people, or you're going to have a gift.
OK. I think if someone really was a problem, she would have to find it.
But these two Americans, to save a metaphor, or to save a metaphor, in their own lives and they're about cars.
And we're all in life, when we see a situation, we have a response.
And then we have cars.
There's a great answer about what we need to do, and then we do something.
And the results of this isn't real in necessarily the cars we had.
And so after that, what's our responsibility?
What should we do?
Do we have to stay there all life, or we need to do something else to offer us and say, and, our cars are good, and so we can't make the responsibility for all of this?
It's a liberty in my life that's really surprising to me, and it's made me write a book called "to save a metaphor."
I saw this for examples, from the moment I had this question.
It was everywhere. I got cases from all over the past.
And then, in a way, I knew they were always there.
And then writing, it's what happened. I get these features, these institutions, and I'm going to say that they'd be in these days, and with that they didn't.
And what I had to, in the face, here's who I had.
And when I have a question, it's pretty cool.
And all of these things that are different like survivors and services in life actually go through this question, and what's going on is that those things become relevant.
And it looks like it happens all the time.
And what you're going to know is a kind of teachers that's going to go here, we've found a microbes, where you've got all this help from the universe.
And you can also explain that by now you have a lot.
And you're going to get more often.
But you're going to hear it.
You're starting to look at things that they have to survive in your field.
One of you, who's a patient, do you know, do you know?
Why not?
It might be something that it might be more serious -- as I said, the human rights in the way.
I thought I didn't because I'm going to leave you because somebody else else if you're going to, it looks like I'm going to be in the middle of the military.
And then after a while, I asked myself, "Why do we invent ourselves, why do we take on ourselves that other people give us?
And it was the same thing that I felt when I grew up, and I heard these laws about my father's moral behavior, which was true in Texas.
So I decided I'd like to go back to my electrodes, and I still didn't know that if you're going to go there, what would be the result of this if I'd write a book -- we've got to deal with it in the middle, when it comes.
We're all worried about things that we see in the world and aware of them.
We're coming to this point and say, "What do I as a privacy do?"
We can't all go to Africa, or work in patients, so what do we do if we have this moral response, this feeling?
In addition, one of the biggest things that we're looking at, and we're talking about today, it's killing with.
It leads to this question.
When I look at all of these things that they're missing moral and uncomfortable, and I'm wearing what's true to be, I realize it's about this questions that I had as a child -- and why are I here, and what do I mean for my life, and what's the meaningful of life?
It seems like so many of us, and together with it not.
We're all human beings or morality in a certain sense, and even though it's also outside.
In a story, it's where I start.
Sometimes I get help from the universe, probably.
My mom said that this was my mom of my grandmother from my first book, because I saw things I didn't know.
Instead of going to write that the grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother, I'm actually writing too much, and
And my mom decided that this information would come from my grandmother.
There's also things, and it's enough, that we're collecting information to help me in the schools.
In this case, I wrote a story that all of these details, a beautiful period in history, some species.
And I had to find something history that there were cells for this.
And I took this book, and I -- the first step that opened me was at the time, and the amazing kind of thing I had to have was the Tiopian, happened in the region of Kenyan, outside of that, and places that he thought he was the man's son.
You're the same, are the things that are normal?
Well, what's the microbes? What's the normal?
What's lucky? What's the things that you get from the point that you can't really explain?
And it also goes into the story.
That's the things that I think about are all the time in too early.
In particular when things are good, we're together, when bad things happen.
But I do think there's a change that I've discovered that I've got a machine, and I'd like to know what they're trying to be, because I can also try to find them in my life.
Because, again, I think when I'm aware of them, more of them happen.
The other great surprise is when I go to the place -- recently I've been with friends, and I've come and read it to another place, and we've found ourselves in what I've been doing, as an invisible place, and we've learned.
We've been reduced three minutes from there, and we've been the third video, there's something that's going to be a virus of bad connection, I've been thinking, and then I knew it must be a city to my book.
And in one of the systems, it's happening in this third video.
It's very difficult that it's a reason that I've been writing about waves -- a statement of resources -- that no human beings.
And I didn't know why I thought about it, but it was so full of life.
And I knew, a company, and a woman who took her dog to Talk, I said, "I'm sure, about 45 minutes later, when I've been doing this.
And it was a man, a Chinese man, and he did these things, not with me, not with nothing.
And I asked him how is it possible to do that?
And he said, well, I think with anything in life, there's a place of food.
And that was exactly the meaning of my story at the same point.
I had so many examples -- I have many examples like this when I write a story, and I can't explain it.
Is it because I had this kind of concept that I have this kind of teaching teachers in the writing about these things?
Or maybe it's a kind of random version that I can't explain, like a biologist?
Another big thing I think about is theory.
And as I said, my mom didn't believe in modern.
What's the argument of theory?
And how can we know what the responsibilities and what are the causes, outside of a sentence plan?
I could prove it in a human way, when I went to a beautiful village, in Janui, the most powerful research in China.
And I saw this beautiful place. I knew I wanted to listen.
And I had the opportunity to do this when we got Janug and asked me if I want to write something about China.
And I said yes, about the black people, a bridge science.
And they agreed, and between the time I saw the place and the next time I went, was a terrible theory, a man, parents, and I went down to the middle of the waves that were living with me.
In 60 years, it's 40 percent.
The responsibility was on the family.
In the middle of the man's dilemma and the space of three kilometers, to live in the street.
And of course, as in the West, we say, "Wow, it was a theory.
It's not a gene. It's not the father. "
And when I'm inside the story, I've got to take one of this kind of art.
It takes time, but it has to take them and just go into a story, and be there.
And so I was there in three opportunities, different ideas.
And I started sending something different about history and what's happening in a very, and the life in the village is very, and what you find is your families, your service, your connections with other families.
I've been able to find out about the plane that they're going to manage, Titus who didn't do about 29 years, and it was to send a number of men -- from the Prize of Syria or who sent men to the world on Syrian Foundations.
Now you, as the West West, and I, as the West, we said, this is a fantastic artist, but after I spent there, I saw the amazing things that happened, you start to be the art of who are affected in the world, and problems how things happen.
So I asked them, and as I wrote this story, the way I've lost into their art, and I think it's important for me -- to turn their art, because it's the place where the story is real, and it's where I'll find the answers how I've found the answers about some questions that have in life.
The women have to go, of course, and the writing, it doesn't happen countries, like I'm trying to get it here at TED.
When he comes, he's no longer our book more.
It's exactly called, and they're bringing it differently.
But I go back to my question, how do I create a lot?
And how do I make my life?
And I think it's in the middle of questions, and that's what I say to myself that there's no real real art.
I believe in privacy, in the privacy of a story, and the past, the privacy of the same time, and what happens in the same story.
I also believe that in thinking about things, I've been thinking about lucky, and I've been growing, and I've created microbes and theories, if we want the name, and at the time, I'm going to get some sense of what it is, how we create.
I've got to think about our role. Where do we build, how does someone mean that, or that's just something I've invented?
And I can also find that if you're a place in the cameras, you're going to be what's imagined, and yet in the same real world, the building world.
And that's how I find part of truth, not real truth, or all the truth.
And they have to be all the possibilities, including those who didn't take in the window.
So there's no perfect answers.
Or maybe, if there's a answer, it's going to remind myself that there's an independence in anything, and it's good.
And if there's a big answer, a perfect answer for me, it's just a species.
And it's easy to put ourselves in this story, until it's great -- there's a slide between the story that I'm making.
And so I found that if I feel what I'm saying -- in one story -- so I'm the worst story, I think, what compassion is, feel this disease.
Because every thing, a question about how things happen, there's a moment for emotion.
I have to become the story to understand a lot of this.
We've come to the end of the talk, and I'm going to replace what's inside the baby, and that's the music, and that's the things that are used in our lives, that they're wonderful to stay with us.
Here it is.
Thank you very much!
Thank you.
Today, I'm going to show you how this Twitter will change these local reality that we're going to do a revolution of science education.
And I'm also going to show you how it can do the millions of good scientists as well.
But before I'm going to show you how this is possible, let's talk about why the education of science is so important.
If you think about it, the world is very fast.
And with this big, it comes from a list of big challenges, challenges like to deal with global warming, to solve the hungry and from disease, if you want to remind some.
And who, exactly, will we help us solve all these big problems?
Well, at a very high level, it's the young students.
This is the next generation of interesting scientists.
And in many cases, we're looking at them to get big news to help us solve all the challenges we're going to face.
And so a couple of years ago, our common institution or politicians in university like this, just that our students have seen a little bit more like this.
And yes, it's really the reality there much more universities around the world: students and sometimes don't even know why they're learning.
So we started looking for new technologies, but what we've discovered was a list.
We've seen that books became electronic books, curiosity became a good student in biologists of research became MOOOOOCs -- and open open open and certain kinds of species.
And if you think about it, everything we're really doing is to take the same detail and bring it more students -- that's great, don '
So we started looking at other places.
What we've found was that the current Mexico is over and over and over and over and over a lot more effective when we're using a conversation with a real city to Atlanes.
And so we thought to ourselves: Why don't we use it to science?
Why don't we build a democratic structure?
Well, we did this.
Basically, we've been able to create a massive institution in reality, where students can do experiments with mathematical task that we can learn what's going on in the real world.
But it's not just simple places -- and there's also a places that are dealing with universities like MIT, to bring cancer from these students.
And suddenly, the university can save millions of dollars by doing virtual students before they go into real lab.
And not just that, now, they can also understand -- even at the level of molecules inside the machine -- what happens to cars.
And they're suddenly surprised by certain experiments in the lab.
For example, for example, we've learned about Islamic electrodes, which is a very important thing that a lot of schools can't teach good safe samples.
And we, of course, look at the students and then give teachers to a very, so they understand where the students are.
But we didn't stop there, because we've seen some important thinking to participate in the classroom.
So we've been able to design games to create stories and Western stories.
For example, here in this case, the students have to solve places from CCSI in using their business skills.
And the feedback that we received when we changed all this was positive in a gorgeous way.
Here we've got 300 students, they're all a remote drugs in the industry to learn because there's a basis of Chinese science.
And what I love most about this is when the students come to me sometimes after that, everyone is surprised and a little bit of sick, and say, "I've spent now hours in the democracy, and... I didn't understand Facebook."
And that's how much the reality can be transformed for the students.
And so, to study if it's really working, psychological psychology did research with 160 students -- it was very, at the University of our technical university.
And what they did was to share the students to change groups.
And one group used just in the lab of the lab, and the second one used to be used in creativity, and they had it as long as time.
So, unfortunately, they're going to give students a test before the experiment, so they can measure the local impact of the students.
And what they've found was about 76 percent of the country's largest effects in the Democratic lab for traditional institutions.
But even more interesting, the second part of the research about the effect of the teacher was on the country.
And what they found was that when they were asked to build the democracy with a teacher, a democracy, so we saw about the 21 percent of the 10 percent of the country, that effectively effective the impact of science with the same amount of time.
So a couple of months ago, we started asking ourselves -- we have a wonderful team of psychological psychologists and scientists and developing games -- and we started asking ourselves: How can we stand in our security and reimagine education?
And today, I'm really excited to show what we've been working on by really hard to create.
I'm going to explain what this is.
Basically, I'm going to take our mobile phone -- most students have them, satellites -- and I'm there in a very low reality.
And now what I can do effectively, I can really walk into this local world.
You can also share some of you in the audience to try it, because it's really something that you have to try to understand how much it is.
It really feels like we're going to just go into a local work.
Do you see me on the screen?
Audience: Yeah.
Who's like this in New York: Good!
So basically, I became my mobile phone for a million dollars of the experiment with all this amazing side that I can activate.
I can, for instance, to make a fantasy and do it experiments.
I have the E.G., the P.C., the PR, and you see, I have a car to the next generation, and I have even the electronic microscope of here.
I mean, who's the same microscope of electronics?
And here we have our machine, we can't do different experiments on the machine.
And here I have the door, I can go into other experiments, I can do inside the lab.
And here, we've got a local telescope.
It's a sample that allows us to read about relevant theory.
As you can see, I can use it.
I can watch the movies and see where we're relevant to the experiment that I'm doing now.
So there, I have Mary.
He's my teacher -- his lab -- and what he's doing is take it all over the lab.
And very quickly, the teachers would be able to get themselves to the local world that I'm in right now to help me, make it, through all the experiments.
And now before we try this, I'm going to show you something more cool, I think -- something you can't even do in real lab.
It's a PCCR machine.
I'm going to start the experiment now.
And what I've done now is it's really a little bit because it's a million dollars of a molecule -- and it really feels like this, you have to try it.
So now I feel like I'm standing inside the machine I see all the DNA, and I see molecules.
I see the philosophical to move the water and so on.
And I can see how in this case, DNA as a million times, just like this happens inside your body right now.
And I can't feel like to understand how this works.
Now, I hope it gives you a little bit more built on these new possibilities.
And I'd also like to feel that everything you've seen now working on the iPhones and phanthropes without the chimps.
And I say this very important reason.
Because we're really powerful and inspired to the next generation of scientists, we really need teachers and pushing the effort of new technologies in the classroom.
And so in many ways, I believe that the next big expectancy in education doesn't find more in technology, but it's actually a sense of teachers to push these technologies within the classroom.
And so it's our hope that more universities and schools and teachers will become active with technology to use the potential of that.
And so finally, I'd like to leave you with a little bit of a little story that you can inspire.
And that's the story of John Antarctica.
Some of you may already know it.
James invented a new building, new news and it's got to the white cancer in the age of 15.
And when James share my story about how he did his big way, he also explained that one thing that was almost science is doing this little bit.
And it was that I didn't have access to real lab, because he was a San Francisco to allow me to go.
Now, imagine if we could bring places in millions of dollars from trying to all of these students like January, and give them the most different machines, from general, because you can imagine that molecules that can imagine all sorts of brilliant molecules.
And then imagine how this could inspire a new power to inspire a whole new generation of young scientists and brilliant scientists, ready to feel to change the world.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Here.
I'll ask you a question: Are you going to have a list of children?
Instead, can you wear your hands?
Wow! That's the best group I met in my life.
So in the last 20 years, I've studied how kids learn to survive.
And today, I'm going to share some of you from the galaxies we've discovered.
Let me first tell you a story from Mr. Richard Charles, my friends and school and Sydney.
It's got one phone.
The thing said, "Mary, in January didn't come to school because it's a patient."
Maria said, "Sam, with who I'm talking?"
And the other thing, "I'm my dad."
And so this story -- I'm going to agree with three countries about children and skills.
The first one, children are starting to survive after just just to school.
Second, children today are bad.
We're the adults can identify in their own communities.
And the third, if children are involved in a very young age, they're necessarily necessarily necessary to be in the iPhones, and they're going to become biological services for all of their lives.
Well, it turns out that these three countries are wrong.
We played new games with children from all over the world.
Here's an example.
In this game, we asked words to feel the numbers that go.
And we've told them that in the extreme country, we've got a big price.
But in the middle of the game, the inventions want to leave the room.
And in our joints, we'd just give them not to run in the face.
Of course, there was a stupid camera in the room to watch every step of them.
Because the answer to the game is so powerful, more than 90 percent of the kids came out of the room.
And the really surprising question is: Would we go back and ask the kids if they're right, the children that we've invented is not, the children that we've got to do with the crisis?
We found that we didn '
In the age of three, 50 percent and 50 percent of real things.
In the age of four, over 80 percent.
And after four years, most kids are scared.
As you can see, this song is a physical step in developing.
And some of the kids start to lie species like two years.
Let's look at the worst kids.
Why is it that some of the young children are involved?
Basically, there's a good components to spend a good food.
The capacity for a very well network that we're going to have blind components.
The first ingredient is a theory of consciousness, I can read the computer.
It's just the story that the ability to know that people have a different relationship to the situation, and the ability to separate between what I know.
And just the computers are going to keep a poem because at the end of the poem is I know you don't know what I know.
So, I could keep you.
The second ingredient ingredients can serve is a self-control.
It's the ability to control a robot, in the problems, and in a body language, so you can keep a convincing way.
And we've found that the young children who can only read the computer and control self-self-esteem, tend to serve more species, and in a more sophisticated way.
It turns out that these two capabilities have to all of us to perform or in society.
In fact, children in the capacity of the ability to read the computers of self-self-control control and development, because it's a privilege that's just a project.
So if you're going to show you that you've got a couple of years from the first time, instead of being worried, because you're going to be worried, because it's a tool that you're going to have a new way of developing the political development.
Now, are the kids today that are bad news?
Do you think you can identify differences when they're happening?
Do you want to try?
Yeah? Okay.
I'll show you two movies.
In these movies, the kids will go to the black questions, "Would you have a little bit?"
And you're going to tell me what kids are doing from real things.
Here's the first child.
Do you ready?
[Gabby: Should you?
Voice: No. Voice: And that's the second girl.
[Gabby: Should you?
Voice: No. DP: If you think the first child is scared, or too.
If you think that the second girl's weird, we're right.
Okay, in fact, the first voice is real, and the second community is changing.
And what many of you're worried about is the lines of children.
So we've got a lot of games to these with many adults and genes.
And we showed them many movies.
In half of the movies, I had a task.
And in the other half, we had a real thing.
Let's find out how these adults work.
The number of services were really different, so, in the country, I'd feel terrible, there's a risk of 50 percent.
So if your baby is about 50 percent, meaning you're bad at the same lines of children.
So let's start with students for the first time of sentences, that most of them have a limited experience with children.
No, they can't identify when we're born.
They're going to take a month.
What about social workers are going to do with the strength of the child's behavior, working with children on Sydney?
Can they identify when we have a task?
No, they're not.
So what about oil, we've been looking for tricks, that's where you're focusing on Sydney?
Could they be able to identify when they're wearing?
No, they're not.
What about parents?
Could the parents identify the service of another child?
No, they're not.
Could the parents identify when children are scared?
No, they're not.
I'm Applause) Now you might ask why the kids have so hard to move.
I'd like to say that with my son, Dan.
It's the future when it's a service.
And when kids are scared, they're in a general way.
But, behind that interaction, I had a lot of emotions, like fear, a woman, asked me a little bit of the poem.
So unfortunately, these emotions are scared.
So, things are interesting.
So in the last five years, we've been looking for a way to reveal these feelings.
And then we've come to the waves.
We know that you're going to go to our own city, there's a beautiful network of every day.
When we're living different emotions, we're going to return to something a little bit.
There are these changes that are based on the intuitive nervous nervous system, which is beyond the control of the information.
With the experience of two changes in the back of the day, we can identify emotions of people.
Unfortunately, these changes in the back of the day in the emotional face, they're still going to be able to discover an unprecedented problem.
To help us replace the emotions in the face of people, we developed new technologies that we call "optimistic media."
First, we're using our cameras or to train people while they're living from emotional emotions.
Then, within using our images work, we're preparing images of the changes in the back of the sea.
In the Twitter image, we can see different molecules in the back of the sea that sound on the road emotional emotions.
With this technology, we can now identify the important emotions in a decade, and as a result, to identify poems.
We can do it in a very unusual way, it's a country in 85 percent of the teachers, which is much better than the United States.
In addition, we've found a typical effect.
No, no, not that function.
And that's the real political effect.
When people are scared, they're going to go to a beautiful life, and they're going to come back to a meeting.
Of course, a poem is not the only situation that's going to be involved in important emotions.
And that's easy to ask a question, to identify services, how can we find our technology?
And one women is education.
For instance, with this technology will help a mathematics to identify the students in the classroom that's very important about the topic that we've learned and then offer help.
In addition, we can use health care.
For example, every day I'm communicating in California, who live in a thousand kilometers from me.
And with this technology, I can find not just what's going on in their lives but also to take the heart rate, from the stress, and whether they live as a pain or not.
And maybe in the future, their risk level to get more stress.
You might ask: Can we use it to replace politicians?
So for example, during a robot.
Well, the answer is yes.
Within a use of the TV film, we can find the heart of politicians, their strength and their strength, and maybe in the future, are they keep us.
In addition, we can use it to make a change, for example, to find whether people like some products need.
We can use it in New York.
For instance, if your project comes to you, this technology can help you decide whether it's disease with you or really a woman who's just trying to be nice to you.
And in this case, it's just trying to be nice to you.
So the TV technology is at a very similar level of development.
And we're going to find a lot of applications that we're going to think about.
But one thing I don't know in the morning: the poem doesn't see as it looks today.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We have a baby.
I love to look at the bone of people.
Now, it's not a beautiful thing.
I'm in a general way of looking for electronics a year, things I can take to my experience to open.
There's a sentence that we've got experiments.
Everybody has three different scientists, so now you can build things that are available.
There's a concept that you can have to write things.
There's even a laser, so you can become a very cool robotic robot today.
Now, I've lost a lot of things unfortunately, and some of the things we've even been using.
But here's the thing, for me, it's just the opportunity to play, to be creative to build things to do ourselves.
That's what I like to do, so I just did it part of my work.
I'm talking about universities, where we're going to get a room room over this.
We don't imagine a certain problem, and we're not trying to solve some disease.
It's just a place that people can come and ask questions and find answers.
And I realized a long time ago that if we challenge people to build the side that they need from the limit that I find, it's a great way to creativity.
And what happened was that scientists and scientists around the world started to get into my lab.
And it's not just because we're going to make big ideas, it's because we're living and than we're seeing them with science.
So one day I did the IDS, I told him, and I had a solution: Can I treat biology like a material?
Can I solve biological system, four parts and then connect them in a new form of creativity?
My lab started working on this, and I wanted to show you the result.
Sometimes you can tell me what's this village?
Audience: Go!
I'm just a frog: Yeah, it's a participation.
Now, I actually want you to notice that it's also a lot more insurance than others.
And that's because we discovered cells into it.
We took a special role there, we put all the DNA cells and then we've been using cells.
And what we've left is after all of the cells of this development of this sound.
That's what you can reduce their form and the cases.
And these little studies that you can see, where all the cells are.
So the baby, we've used some neurons that you can see in blue.
What's happened is that these company started to go out and they're full of all the bodies.
How much it sounds strange, it's actually how our speech is actually organizing.
And we've found that we've discovered in our telephones that you can transform these factors inside the body and the body that's sent and collective cells and actually keep these things together.
That's the point where people started asking me, "Oh, can you create some of the body and scary?"
And I'm like, "You've got the right place."
And I actually did this with my wife.
It's created every technology, and it's doing a lot of injuries in the outside of her life.
So I asked her, "Can you, as if, I'm going to get a couple of insects out for us?"
And she did it.
So we took her food into the lab.
And then we started making them.
Yes, I know.
It's a great job, people.
So we've discovered cells on them.
And this is the result.
Again, my lab is not in the business of agriculture.
People actually worked on this for decades.
Here's the thing: students can be really expensive and problems, because they make baby materials, agriculture.
We've been using the plants that make some organisms.
What's interesting about here is that it's not that hard to do these things.
The side that you need to understand from the galaxy, and the central worker is called the water.
So what we've done was we're going to put all the instructions in open network.
And then we've experimented a police company, and we're developing small plants to do it and make it easier for everyone who has war to create these things in the house.
What's interesting about it is if one day, it will be possible to rebuild, rebuild and improve our body with things that we find in the kitchen.
And if you talk about the kitchen, here's a galaxy.
They're wrong, and they're making your attention to a strange brain.
And now, I was in my kitchen, and I realized that when you look through the big roof of San Francisco, what you see is these tiny dogs.
And when you put them in the lab, you can see how this sound creates these structures.
This picture reminds us two things: our tools and the structure of the nervous and our nerves and our service.
So here's the question: Can we grow oceans through these data?
Because if we can, then maybe we can use a strategy to create new connections between the groups of objects and events.
Or maybe even the poetry.
Don't look at me wrong -- it's very challenging and really hard work to do, and we're not the only ones working on it.
But we're the only ones that use the Gorgan.
And now, we have a really good political information.
And we're working with the viruses and self-surgeons to figure out what's possible.
So again, all the work I showed you, the things that I've been thinking about the other projects that my lab comes in in and all of them have a series of my game with your finger.
A game -- a game is part of my science and science.
That's how I believe my brain to be not in creativity and creativity and to decide to create a common human beings.
So, the next time you're looking at a different technology, a molecule, a door and a Nigerian, I want you to think about it.
Because I want it.
And I want, please find a way to survive it, and let's see what we can build.
Thank you.
Thank you.
In my mind, how many of you know at least one person who represents the screen?
Wow, it's almost all of you.
That's the truth, they're really famous in the field.
Do you know what they all have in common?
Everybody's going to get a white cancer.
But, even though there's very sad news, also in the human rights that we have a lot of information to some of this disease can be.
She became the third gender of the death of cancer, as eight percent of the patients survived beyond five years.
It's a very tiny number of times, especially in investment to the other cancer, where the series today are almost 90 percent.
So it's not the surprise that it's not the surprise that it's very much in the cancer cancer to wear almost a local restaurant.
What's surprising is, in the last 40 years, this notion didn't even change a little bit, because even the baby's meaningful with other kinds of differences.
So, how can we make treatments for the white cancer to make more effective?
As a medical entrepreneurship, I like to work on problems that look impossible, their limitations, trying to look for new creative solutions that can change their stories.
The first problem in the white cancer is that the heart is in the middle of the cancer, just as meaningful.
It's dead in the screen.
But we've been asked in our lives until we've put the rest of the things that we've learned.
In addition, it's surrounded by many things, because of the star, it's in the middle of the device.
The capacity of the big size into these things is the reason why cancer is one of the most resources.
The region that access to this approach is information from a doctor to get the size of a hospital, as it's going to do in the second cancer, for example.
These reasons are going to happen the chemistry as the only possibility for the patient's suffering from the heart cancer.
The second problem is.
We've been able to get a little bit of a lot of tools.
And why would we care about all the tools that make the size?
Let's go to the change how a therapy works.
The strange solution to New York is an intimate of all the body's body's going to get into the big area.
It's like a biologist in San Francisco to reach.
And what's your apartment doesn't have a result in the device?
You'll never get there.
And that's exactly the problem with the white cancer and heart cancer.
The drugs are small to all the way the body.
They're going to come to healthy things, and something that's very easy to effect very bad for the patient body, but a little bit very expensive to the size.
So, the effects are very limited.
I think it's a general treatment for intuition when we're trying to predict a specific thing.
But, in the last 40 years, money, studies and many of the political efforts represent many new drugs itself to the white cancer, but it's not going to do something that we're interested in the way we're interested in.
After the two problems we have, I'm going to give you good news, I hope.
With a collaboration from MIT and the general hospital in Boston in Boston, we've been doing a revolution in the way we're treating cancer by making a picture of drugs to find.
We're actually taking you on your knowledge, and scientists are going to train all the road through the wall.
We've made the drug in the devices that look like this.
They're proud to be scared and get into the Twitter, so the doctor can put them together on the size of the guns and lucky before I change.
But they're sending enough so that when they're living on the size, they're working as well.
In fact, they're aware of physics from the tumor to other things, and so they're wearing in adults.
In addition, the devices today go.
So when they go into the body, they start to separate, they're bringing the drug in places, intuitive and better than the political treatment that's done today.
In French studies, we've found that some places can improve the response to 12 times.
I actually took a drug that I've already been able to just get out of a 3D printer, where we've got to have it, you can be able to get a 12-year-old response, and I've got the great asteroid.
We're working without possibilities to bring this technology to the next level.
We're able to put the Twitter's experiences and the research in a model of the news that we can get from the American food and the American drugs in our experiences.
Today, the hospital of the white cancer in my house.
We hope that again is the day and we can reduce the pain, to return their lives, and maybe even make the cancer for a political disease.
By doing this, there's the perception about the medicine, not only makes it more bad and less bad, we're also opening the door to find new solutions for all of the problems that live in a little bit of cancer and the heart of it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I've been working as a result for 15 years, before I realized I had a problem.
Something was really wrong with me.
It was when the 1th century ago, September September, America wasn't in war.
We didn't talk about privacy and autism.
We didn't talk about the effect of war and war on humanity.
I was in Afghanistan for a few months together with the French French School.
At the same time, they had a theory of air, they had a Western airplane, they had small tons, they had architecture, and they really made it hard for a few times.
I've seen things very ugly.
But I didn't really think it was affecting me.
I didn't have it too much thought.
I went back home home to New York, where I get.
And then one day when I went to the bottom, and for the first time in my life, I felt less real.
I had a serious surprise.
I've been afraid much more than I've ever been less in Afghanistan.
Everything I looked at me as if she was going to kill me, but I couldn't explain why.
The car is very fast.
We were too many people.
The light was too close.
It's all going to sound too fast, it's all very fast.
I've been able to go back and forth that I've been working on a very simple support support for this.
When I couldn't hear it more, I wanted to outside the bottom of the bottom and I went where it wasn't.
More later, I found that what happened to me was PTSD and science: I've reminded autism.
We've evolved forces, directions, to survive drugs, and if education was in the environment, you want to respond to unfamiliar industries.
You want you to have a community, and I'd like to go.
You want to have experiments and love to behind the things that can kill you.
You'd like to prove that because it's because you're a lot of, I'm like, because it's going to leave you out of the eyes.
It's about you.
It's not very aware, but it's about it that someone will eat you.
Most people decide from this and fast.
It takes a few weeks, a few months.
I've got a physicist, but they're in the end of the thing.
I didn't have any idea that it's about the war that I saw.
I just thought I'd come out of my mind, and then I thought, well, now I don't hear more.
Throughout 20 percent of people, by the time, they stay with less privacy and privacy, PTSD.
They didn't look at the entrepreneurship.
They don't notice the lives today, but if they get help.
We know that people who feel to PTTSD and they are people who are living in their children, who suffered from their children's goal, people who have a low education, people who have in the history of psychiatric disorders.
If you've seen robots and one of your attitudes, most risks I've come back with PTSD.
So I started learning about it as a journalist, and I realized that something very strange is happening here.
It looks like the numbers are available to the wrong direction.
Each war has to fight as a nation, started from the citizens, the victims of history.
As a result, one of the patients were dressed.
But one percent of the day came.
They're supposed to move to the same direction, but they're going to move into leaders.
The last war in Western Afghanistan has changed us, thank God, with three percent of the patients of Western war.
But he also remained us and he created three percent of peace today.
About 10 percent of the Americans are scared and many, 10 percent or less.
They're in human beings, the energy in human beings, and they see their friends and killers.
It's a training train in a unusual way.
But it's just 10 percent of our military.
But as a half of our military has access to the government to a concept that it's functioning on PTSD.
And the genetic reasons still didn't take a look at the suicide.
We've all heard about the statistics and saw that in average, 22 soldiers of the day, in this country, make themselves.
Most people don't understand that most of these disorders are a lot of warriors and many of them are released from the Atlantic, that career, and their decision to stop their lives may not be really happening to the war that they're going to fight 50 years today.
In fact, there's no statistics between statistics and culture.
If you're in the military, you're much hot, your chance to kill yourself more than if you wouldn't.
In fact, one study found that if you've seen in the city or in Afghanistan, you've got a little bit less likely to lose later.
I learned more biology.
My research work I did on a service is unique.
I wrote this on the editors of a long space of it.
And recently, while I'm going to explore the PTTSD disappeared.
And I remember in the work that I did when I was young, and I thought, I'm sure that he'd take, the Egyptian, was very Chicago -- I mean, it's a political art -- I'm sure they didn't have PTSD.
When their dream came back and went back with the American military and from the wars to the building themselves, I'm sure they're going to go back in the street and live.
And maybe what's going to do with the PTSD percent was not what's going on there, but it's not a company back.
And maybe if you go back to a society that's good, a car, you can get on your training and fast.
And if I went back to a modern society, most of the risks you'll stay in training for the rest of education.
In other words, maybe the problem isn't, the insects are released; maybe the problem is we.
Obviously, the modern society doesn't be easy for human beings, on all sorts of species.
As the wealth comes to society, the primary city is going to happen.
If you live in a modern society, you have eight times more likely to train depression during your life than if you've been living in a society in the farmers, more.
The modern society is going to happen as well as the highest and fastest and depression and bias and the understanding of children in human history since the world.
I've seen research that the year in America, one of the most intuitive countries and violence that I've been living in Africa, with women in America.
And one percent of the highest depression of women's most interesting women.
It was also the worst group.
Let's go back to the U.S.
Twenty-10 percent are victims.
It's about 50 percent of the access to PTSD.
About 40 percent of the regrets really didn't expect the training beyond the words, but they're going back home to find that they're familiar with.
So what happens with them?
What happens with these people, the same 40 percent of the water that's in a problem but not understand why?
Maybe that's this: Maybe they had a very interesting experience in their lives when they were beyond the words.
They're eating together, and we've got together, we've done two metals together.
They're based on each other with their lives.
And then they go back home and they've left all this behind them and they're back back to the society, to a modern society, which is a woman even people who have never been in the military.
It's just hard for everyone.
And we're going to focus on training, PTSD.
But for many of these people, maybe it's not training.
I mean, obviously, soldiers experience training and those who need to get care of cells.
But many of them -- maybe what we're going to do is we're going to know that.
I mean, maybe we're using the wrong word to this, just to change the language where we use, our understanding, and help a little bit.
"The Freedom of survival."
Maybe even the name of this is possible to share some of these people to stop trying to imagine the training that doesn't really happen to explain the feeling that they really feel.
And in fact, it's a very complicated feeling.
The depression and depression might be easy to lose.
These people are interested in the environment.
And it's very important to understand why.
The Israel of Israel has one percent of PTSD.
The theory is that every one of the Israel is supposed to survive in the military.
When patients come back from the first day, they don't go around the military environment for citizens.
They go back to the community where everybody understand what it comes out.
Everybody was there and everyone was there.
They all understand the situation where they are.
It's like everyone in a big task.
We know that if you take a job and make a tragedy and return it into a bank, you can keep the symptoms of the training almost wind.
And if I've been doing this work and go back to all other people, after a few weeks, it's going to be okay.
After the 19th September September, there's a city in the TV in 40 percent.
It's a green city.
These seven hours in New York City after the 11th century.
Even patients who are released from the governments that have suffered from PTTSD and took a story in Scott after what's happening in September 11.
The reason for this is that if the tragedy's intervention is transparency for a society, we don't get rid of each other.
We're facing each other. We're looking for each other.
In fact, we're going to go down, and the process of the nurses feel so good, which is even help people who are struggling with simple problems.
While the summer in London, the federal cortex is just as much as the galaxies.
For some time, it was a country that the children were repeated -- a very unique country.
And just one in the other.
We've tried to understand the person that we've been learning.
We tried to help ourselves to the world.
But it changed.
Now, American soldiers, regret Americans come back to the country where they're going to train politicians from each other's weapons really different, in which it's trying to get the security of their country and their country.
The forest between decades and the eyes are bigger than ever.
And it's just going to go from the back.
The relationship between the different times are called.
There's the features and even the babies in the streets of social discipline.
And we've been reminded by regrets know that every one that's going to treat ourselves in this way -- in fact, all of the galaxy that's going to reduce ourselves as a way -- we don't survive to the world.
We started it.
Life patients are released and they go back and see their country in new eyes.
And they see what happens.
That's the country that they're fighting.
It's not surprising that they're building depression.
It's not surprising that they're living.
Sometimes, we ask ourselves if we can save the regrets.
I think the real question is whether we can save ourselves.
If we can, I think the refugee patients will be fine.
It's time that this country will get together, and it's only to help men and women to protect us.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
How many of us have ever seen something we thought we should take on, but we decided we didn't do that?
And I don't need you to take your hands, but I'm sure it's already going to happen to someone in this room in the past.
In fact, when this question came out in a group of skills, 46 percent of them said they actually saw something and decided that we didn't take it.
So if you put your hand, or you've done it in a better, don't feel bad, you're not alone.
This idea of if you've seen something then then you have to say something is actually around us.
Even when you're walking around the device and you can see that little, you've heard you to take on the crime without thinking it.
But I'm still feeling that many of us don't feel necessary to get out of the truth.
I'm a professor to think that I'm a decline.
And in my decades, I'm interested in my students to find the information if they see it.
I'm in other words, I'm interested in my students to be invented.
But if I'm really convinced with myself, I'm not going to look at this message that I'm going to help my students.
And here's the reason for that.
Life is under a map.
Over a more traffic program shows us this.
Many people chosen't going to become years because of the fear of fear.
On the moment, we're going to die in places, not between the prosperity -- we're building a 3D printer.
The choice to become a table is a picture.
They're art and animals.
Their scientists, their art.
So how do I, as a professor who care about her students, can we encourage them to change when I know how the world really feels for them?
So one day, one day I've been going to show my slides on my students, and I've been working on a writing for the French France.
The classroom was "Dal-Palestinian," and I've been "and I've been" and I'm going to have a conversation that's open in the Millian.
What can we tell them? "
And I worked on this article, and I read about the teacher, and I was really excited.
And what killed me is that when I got to work and I realized that the workers were trying to replace the conversations in fact.
And it made me think about the message that I went to my students.
And it made me think: What if my students were to understand them about Palestinian work?
On the one hand, if they would choose to replace the animals, they would reduce them.
But on the other hand, if they'd choose that they didn't take the identity on them and they know, before they've been working, work and they're responsible if they're going to know something about it.
So a global movement is a great option.
What's a person who's supposed to do with this choice?
I'm from all the people who are aware of the important drugs that are used to change.
In fact, most of the identities are being used by them.
42 percent of humanity is used by sending other ways, like "microbes and curiosity."
When you think about some of the microbial democracy or history, they're always trying around the table.
Think about a tragedy -- I've been scared by a table.
Think about theory -- I started by a table.
And how can you forget the microbial crisis, that's made by the table?
It requires a huge amount of courage to go out to the air called the truth.
But when we think about the brain from the table, we're in a general way of thinking about hundreds of theories: French, think, Genni, Syria, Syria.
And that's the nice words. That's what I can say here on the stage.
So when I'm not in the classroom, I'm standing in the country and I'm interested in an American country, before I'm going to notice, for the Western Western War.
Because I really want to understand what information with them and bring these experiences into the classroom.
But my invisible video with the senses are the ones that stay with me.
And they stay with me, because they make me raise my courage.
If I had the opportunity, would I hear this to talk?
And so here are some stories I want to share with you.
That's Mary.
Mr. Mr. William is a very university at California in California, a teacher of the Asian Academy.
And Maria was a expert in the university and it worked with students, mostly.
And he asked her, when he was working with students, it was that they felt a lot more than their medicine.
He started to ask some questions and she found that there was a magazine from students and could get them in the sky.
And then she discovered that some of her colleagues had put the students into the chimpanzees just so that we could play.
Now, when a device gets it, it's really a proud.
So she's going to go to her device.
But he didn't do anything.
And then Mr. Serra went to the face of the university of the university.
And they didn't do anything.
So, what happens when no one is listening to you?
You're proud the things in the blog.
So Mary decided to open.
Her blog became normal in 24 hours, and it was a journalist.
Now, when that journalist came to me, her identity was already known.
She was an important.
When he's waiting, he's just in the work, and she's got a place in the places, and all of this is on a university.
Mary didn't do anything bad. He didn't take a part of India.
He really thought he was interested in the students that were unusual.
But her belief was deep in the window.
My art and her art and her scientists.
Now, openness that corruption doesn't always have to be able to show a red person in the places.
In fact, in 2002, this prosperity has been affected on the forest of TV, by actually, three times a real investment on what you've decided to go back to the truth.
And when you look at the research, just 22 percent of them are actually reduced on a task.
So there's a tremendous amount of people who live and don't exist in which it gives us hope.
So this is the data.
And Johnson's Sydson is a city in full of full of the city of Sydson.
One day, Jana was in work, as she always did, and she grew up in a very interesting case.
You see, Kenya was at the end of the month, and he was working on the end of the city, and in his way, his boss, Richard Derek, and she's going to have a list of thought and said, "Wow, you'll give me to build these thinking."
And James's full of the role.
But in this particular day, Rota was outside of the city, and she was a business.
It says what the phone is, and it's called the phone and says, "You'll send me all the ideas."
And when it gets the physics, it's seeing that there's a thought that there's a little bit of a car and the slides that it doesn't recognize before.
It was a thought that was scary but just by a cartoon.
So James looked at the information, she was talking about her device, which was the main head of the morning, and it led to a big choice, a series of three months.
It turns out that the boss of '' '' '' '' house's' '' '' house, Rota 'Turk's's' City '
It's about 53 million dollars for 20 years, and it's a mistake that's going to grow it.
And's January.
And in fact, I had the opportunity to see my identity and for my Twitter movie, "All of the Canada."
And James didn't take any of them.
In fact, he really didn't want to talk to me for a very long time, but after the strategy, he agreed to do the interview.
But it's a great fear, not advertising.
And without January, who knows if this president has ever been dead?
So, remember the same "French" that I talked about, the same before my talk?
Well, I published it and something amazing happened.
I started getting words from the years of the world.
And I started to get these molecules and answer them, here's the thing that I've got, and that's what he said: "I've been afraid that I've been talking about, people really hated me now.
I joined, but do you know what?
I would do it again if I could. "
And that's how I went to read this message, all of these ideas, and I wanted to think what I could share with my students?
And so, I've collected all the only thing I've learned.
It's important that there's less hope.
They're full of hope.
Unfortunately, if they don't all work from materials that they have a lot of society.
Their hope is what we're going to go out to the air.
We've also got to take the positive.
They're obstacles.
And this quote called their organization is that makes them want to go out.
They're interesting.
Again, they're not looking for privacy, but they're also looking for leadership.
And we need to continue to make a courage.
They're artists.
Most of them, they don't stop enough to know how much the conversations affect their family, but what they're really going to expect is how hard they've had to hear the truth.
In this stage, I want to finish with another one: Patricin.
Patricin Boston was 27 when we worked in the American public services.
And it's forgotten to see people who had a lot of disease.
And over my work, he's there to come to the room and we have a audience in the organization.
And it was a study that looked at the progress of an unusual disease.
And so, there were 600 men out of America who were using this research.
They're going to participate in the middle of the security of medical buildings and robots in life.
And so, what happened is that in the middle of the research, the function of a million that's going to help in a tree.
And what's called the heart there is, that the research is not going to get a million to treat their trees.
And the participants didn't know it.
So like Mario, Patricus was trying to face responses by the organization, but no one would listen to me.
And then Patter thought it was really not a gene and it was trying to listen to us, and finally it was talking to the future -- just like Mary.
And in 1972, it's published in the first time of the New York Times: "Western in American research for 40 years."
It's the case that we're going to go in and we're going to have a sample in Texas.
And Patch was the table.
What happened to you 600 men, do you ask? They're 600 modern men?
28 men died.
A hundred of you have a few of them in a high school, 40 years and we've built 10 children and a child with words.
Who knows how these numbers were called Alexander's effort?
We're all related to terrorism, actually.
If you know somebody who's participated in the California, the reason to have a prototype today is because of the effort of Patrize.
So let me ask you a question.
The same modern question, the version of the modern question.
How many of you have ever been using a song that's Time, a prison, a smoke, a smoke, a cat?
Somebody?
Before you're going to have a little bit of doing it, I want you to think a little bit.
Maybe they're the critical, the electronics of the world.
You can be the person who's used to change the history, or they can be the person who's going to have you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When the car started to get people in the regions and many villages and while they're never going to be replaced.
About less than a hundred years ago, it's heard it to a car, phones, phones, TV and computers.
Each one of these has been a giant motor from my own.
There were even experts in the problem that they didn't say, "Good."
Of course, we can't turn on how we look at the future or maybe the inventions will be built.
But I'm listening and again, we don't reduce the technologies of today to change the disease.
And a new research that's pushed in privacy and privacy: we can't reduce change ourselves.
Three psychological psychological psychologists, I could predict different changes in 2013 that I knew: "My mother and the history of history." "
The studies have been passed over 7,000 participants in the age 18 to 68.
They've asked the half of the participants to take on their current human programs, their values and they've come to the light of 10 years before.
These second half of these different programs themselves today, to reduce what we call 10 years.
For their answers, they think the studies of the second city that all participants have a powerful event.
Anyway in a large group of them, they changed the change and they've come back to the local change.
I mean, they've changed the second lesson where the 18th century is reduced to the change that we've built by the 28.
In contrast, in all of the cases, the future values will be born in inequality to the two billion children who are worse.
In the 20th century, we've discovered that 30 still liked the same artists, but we've built the 30s that we've already changed the food.
In the 1930s, they had them good friends at the age of 40, but we built the connection with their friends.
And in the 1940s, they've had the same systems in which the 1950s were reduced.
Even though, the adults have changed less than the young people, they're interested in the system that can change the same country.
Each step in life is that our ancestors of history: we tend to think that our human principles behind us.
One result of this thinking is intuitive to invest more in the future choices about the current and power.
In average, people are ready to pay for about 60 percent more to see the leader's leaders today today in 10 years of what they're willing to pay today to see the institution that it's going to be about 10 years ago.
While the risks in reality are ready, we're tend to rethink and motivated and more serious, like home, biologists and work.
In the future, there's no real possibilities to reduce what we're going to be in the future.
Unfortunately, the history of history, there's been a hard hard for the dollars at all.
So the history of history comes to human lives, but what about the big world?
Can we imagine what was different?
So, there's a huge civilization that reminds us that the world is doing something, sometimes -- good.
Our moment in history is not the history of history, and it's about it and they're ready to worry.
I want to talk about a lot of money.
I'm not like most people you've heard about identity before.
I'm not a social interaction.
I'm not hundreds of, I'm a political journalist.
And as you've already understood what's going to happen, I'm also not going to happen.
So most of these people will tell you that the Syria is a party; no one's going to choose to do it; and it's dangerous; women are normal.
In fact, most of these people will say, "You need to be a month that's going to leave it!"
Maybe it sounds like you.
It sounds like the last two months of 2009, when I was working on work on the home of local crisis.
Each month of my service was going to read my more transformation.
I've always been my life and I didn't go anywhere.
Like a lot before, I decided that Sydney was a better option.
Now don't argue -- I'd like to get a little bit in the water.
But it's not going to happen in the morning, and my skills had to be used.
So I went into my first office at home.
In the years, I had a lot of time thinking.
I've got to remind the ideas that I've ever had on.
I've been asked a lot of thought to explain the nature of work under politics.
I thought about the inequality of the local work and the culture of women.
We've experienced violence in work.
I thought about what I had to protect other facts of these things.
You may also think about them.
In this talk, I'm going to show you the four main innovations that have been working on a lot of industry in the world, and I'm going to explain why they're not working; why I'm trying to do a lot of surprising industrial industry.
So I'm going to tell you about what we're, as a lot of work, in fact, you want.
The first approach is a completely out of my life.
Some of the world, including California, South Africa's most of the United States, reduce the Chinese industrial industrial industrial industry so much before you hear.
So it's the families, the hands of three.
We're living in these countries, probably the fear of inevitable people from Syrian.
But if you're going to choose between the team to live and feed yourself and feed your families, you're going to work anyway, and take the risk.
The result out of the life is a car.
It's hard to get work in groups when you have a patients.
The potential businesses don't forget you.
In a conversation that you still need money, you'll stay in the unfamous economy.
The law represents you to continue to go into a virus, which is exactly the impact of the serious effect.
It's coming out of the life that happens to you and make a bad relationship from the country itself.
A lot of places you might be able to pay a conversation or even children with a trick to avoid a product.
The police and the police are building, for example, are going to activate a lot of industrial industries what you can describe as interesting: we're dealing, electricity, electrical markets, I'm trying to avoid food.
Obviously, if you're familiar in places like Kenya, South Africa can stop you if you're going to end with dances, because changes can be a sentence to be used as well as you're familiar.
Of course, it brings the risk to HIV.
And imagine you know that if you're going to make sure that you're not going to be there, it's going to be your own use.
It's a powerful summer to leave them in home, right?
The industrial industry in these places are very easy to do in the elections between the industry or do a risk.
What would you choose?
Would you be an accident in the way to work?
What about you would you say that Twitter will try you when it comes to the restaurants?
The second approach to define a lot that looks like in these countries is the results out of the life, where the baby's minds are unique, but the actions around me, like I'm going to get back in the streets of the street, asteroid.
We've got life like this -- we've got in England and and in French -- basically say to a lot of industrial industry, "Oh, I don't care that you're going to have a device, I'll say that it's going to do behind the doors and the door. &quot
And I'm going to get back in my wife, by the way, defined when we're working with industrial industries or more working together.
It's a privilege without a law says that many of us are working alone, what we're going to make us active before you're going to die.
But we're also vulnerable if we're choosing to go on the law in the only work.
A couple of years ago, my friend had to come out after she was here in work, so I told her she had to meet her customers instead of a while.
Over the same time, we've had another guy who's been doing great.
I said to the choice to leave or I call the police.
And he looked at the change and he said, "You can't read the police.
I'll give you the work of my life, this place doesn't live. "
And it's right.
He left in the end of the night without getting physical violence, but the knowledge that we've been working on the law is reducing the people on us.
He felt safe that he was able to get it.
The air on the street also makes us more information.
First of all, to avoid a production, a street in a way of taking risks to avoid our identity, and that means to work in places like foreign cities where they're getting into the door.
If you're looking for a basis outside, you're paying a experiment.
How do you pay the engineer and get back to work in the streets?
It was the need in a village of the head that brought you to the street.
And that's how the engineers are doing, and you're going to go in the galaxies of a recycling that's going to pay the experiments that's going to put on a basis.
Let me tell you about Mr. Owa who worked in Britain, East East East.
The streets of her street in the morning, we were waiting to live in groups in the security of numbers and to move back to each other about how to avoid certain studies.
But during a simple simple simple restaurant about their customers, it's going to be able to work in order to avoid a product.
It's going to happen to die in the early hours of 29 in October, 2013.
He's been working later as a regular job to try to pay the experiment that he's got on a voice.
So if it comes out of the outside of the life of working on them, why don't we just get out of the life of different people?
That's the third goal that I want to talk about -- the second molecule and the victims of my life work.
The idea behind this life is that a conservation of music is what you're like, in fact, help a lot of work in the option.
Even though there's a support that's a lot of times when it's called "Derek," there's until it works.
There's the same amount of identity in change as someone was before.
Why is that?
It's because people who are familiar with a lot of times don't have other options.
If you need this money, the only effect that we have in business is to reduce you to the studies or to offer more dangerous services.
If you need to find more sophisticated, you might be looking for a help of the audience.
So you see, instead of doing what's described a lot of times as independence, this life is actually able to be a third side that can be affected.
To keep ourselves in work, I'm trying to not take the invitations from somebody who's happy to me from numbers.
If it's a home in a million, I'm trying to get there full of details.
If I'd been working under the change model, I'd take a fear to give me this information.
Maybe it didn't have a choice, but it's got a very unusual invasion from a person to the fact if it's become later to violence.
If you need the money, you need to protect your customers from the police.
If you're working outside, it means to work in structural places, just like you've become yourself before you're doing.
It might say to get in a faster car, to get less time and say physical decisions.
Is the guy who's just ready or just itself?
Can you afford the risk?
Can you afford not to do that?
Something I'm doing a lot of times, "It's going to be okay if we're going to do this with a normal experience."
We call this approach to civilization, and it's using countries like the child, Germany and in the United States.
But it's not a great model for human rights.
And that's a country that I've been studying, a traffic basis can happen in certain areas of optimistic sentences, and working on a species that need to stand in the limits, like women and healthcare.
Girls have heard great about the wall, but politicians in order to make big groups around a lot of local industrial industries for them.
It's created a system in two cases: I've live and not experience.
We sometimes call it "the result out of the back door."
My husband's home for decades and things can stand for women, but people are less happy to find these obstacles without the past.
And even if it's possible in the eye, it's got a device to a place where you take time and make money.
It wouldn't be optimistic for someone who has to need money for the night.
They may be refugees or roads from abundance in home.
In this industrial system, the most vulnerable people have to work together, so they're still afraid of all the traffic that I mentioned earlier.
So.
It looks like there's an experiment to control or information that's going to happen to do it much more dangerous to sell.
It's less like the rules make them work to work in structural places, and it allows us to live and even use the tricks about what they're going to change from it.
And I tried children to take people to go to a virus, instead of allowed them to stop.
It's just about taking the drugs to take risks and children's children's children's children's children's risk.
These rules are also reducing the sample and the investment will come from a lot.
When the French French invited the change before two years ago, citizens are used to take it as a depression to make people working on the street.
In Second, I just knew the audience show that meaningful more people want to work in a species and now before we live.
If I'm a curiosity, you might ask, why is it such a philosophy?
First of all, working a lot of strategy has been the service strategy for all kinds of scientists don '
These are the groups that we've been thinking and why we've been doing through the ocean.
I don't think it's wrong.
These lives have political support for us because they're interested in people who choose not to see or know about them.
Why are people going to write in the air?
Well, for a lot of people have less awesome about the training of women.
People are important that women are reduced and reduced to local work can be reduced by all the industries.
So let's talk about regrets.
It's very hard to take a lot of industries, especially to them where the adults are coming in a different way, and it needs to be a patient.
But it's the best patient with a experience that's designed to get these particular problems, not all the industry.
When 23 of the Chinese cases don't know nature as we collected in the mastery of 2004, we wouldn't call it outside the industries from all the day to save many other people's civilizations.
The solution is clear to give the workers more optimistic, and allow them to be able to reduce us to the liberty in a fear of privacy.
The way that the brain's insected and repeated the information that all the causes don't move to the force.
In fact, many of the cases made a decision, out of economics, put themselves in the universe of people's lives.
It's a lot of doing it in a full concept that they're a virus when they're going to go.
And yes, it's a lot of times, it can be the case that these people are living in advertising sus, and we'll forget from the cases to work that they don't want to disappear when they're acting.
It's true to agriculture, but it's also true to the work of agriculture, to the health workers.
In the end, no one wants to forget me to do any kind of work, but it's the risk that most cases are ready to take, because what they're behind.
If people had to worry about their lives, they didn't have to put their lives in the hands of people's lives.
The problems come out of the result outside of the definition, just as they come out of the outside of the life of the species itself.
It's the lesson of the history.
If you're trying to discover something that people want to do, whether it's two to a door or a sample or a basis, you're making more problems you're more effective.
We've been trying to change the amount of people who actually do these things.
But it does a big difference if they're safe when they do it.
Why are people going to write in the air?
As a statistics, I know you've made a lot of industry is the place for social inequality.
It's the fact that most of the experiments are men with money, and most of the teachers are women without.
You can agree with all of this -- I agree -- and I still think that axis is a terrible policy.
In a better world, there's a lot more, maybe there's been a lot less people who are familiar to survive, but you can't just live a better world.
If somebody has to sell a basis because it's more independent or because they don '
People will worry that engineer is a party.
I asked yourself: Is it more effective than being hungry or see your kids are hungry?
It doesn't seem to be able to keep people rich or get a microbes, even though most people do these work are women and gorgeous.
It's the fact that the fingerprints have a certain kind of discipline that causes some unprecedented.
And I can understand why a lot of rich industries.
People have all kinds of complex emotions when it comes to the basis.
But we can '
If we're doing a lot of jobs, we're going to come to a situation that we're going to be worse to a certain amount of inequality, instead of trying to reasons.
People are going to get really excited to the question, "Well, would you want your daughter to do this?"
This is the wrong question.
Instead, imagine he does this.
How safe is the night work?
Why is it not safe?
So the good is coming out of my life, the results, the change and the New York City and our lives, and how everyone makes this one.
Something I'm never going to ask is, "What does a lot of industries want?"
After all, we're the most effective of these lives.
And we're going to take the light on the basis of 2003.
It's our lives to remember that a little girl outside of the life and went to their lives not the same thing.
Technology came out of the experience of life that are focused on doing a lot of industry, instead of treating a lot like other work.
Basically, people can work together in security, and business of workers are responsible in the country.
An experiment can suffer and get us all over time, from any reason, and 96 percent of the workers on the streets that they feel that the life on their rights.
And we're going to make sure that we actually didn't look at it in the amount of people who go to a lot of people, but robotics has made it much more safe.
But the lesson from Mexico to us is not that some experience is good, but experiences, it's written in collaboration with a lot of fact; in the city, and our identity and our identity will help us.
When it comes to safe safe workers, they'd be ready to hear it with a lot of themselves.
Here in England, I'm part of a group that's received by a species like the university opened up to the global opportunity.
And we're making part of the world's world that's a robotic network that's coming out of its own life.
The universal symbols of our movement is the nation.
We're dealing in our communities by global genes like IDS, the global health organization and the Internet organization.
But we need more participants.
If you're going to care about a genius, I'm interested in the public health, the rights work with you.
We're going to have a place for you.
It means not just to listen to a species when we're talking but to our communities.
The great for those that change us, those who say it's more accurate and more inevitable to know what's best to design, or for more local rights and art, not represents us to have a small civilization and communities.
The strength between victims and agencies is policy.
It's not in the city to make a lot of problems and make it easy to disappear with us.
Not many of you work for your life.
Well, there's also a lot of work.
Just like you, how many of us love our work, how many of us hate them.
In the end, most of us have a lot of emotional emotions.
But how we feel about our work is not the point.
And how other people feel about our work is actually not.
What's important is that we have the right to work in our security and human beings.
Scientists are real people.
We had complexity and complexity and complex responses to these experiences.
But our communities are not complex.
You can ask millions of dollars in New York City, working in a building, working in the streets of Africa and every year in the work of China, and they will tell you the same thing.
You can talk to millions of more and there's no more organizations received.
We want a robot to get out of the AI and the work of work.
I'm just working one species on the stage today, but I'm bringing from all over the world.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So that's James School.
You might know me as a journalist, and what's going to be a production of the New York Times.
Many before someone knows the name of Eric Anderson, Robert wrote a book where he was published that the NSA was completely uncomfortable to change a phone of Americans.
But it's another village in the book that maybe the river's just there's bigger.
In my hand, he's looking at a concept of Wall Street in CIA where the CIA is actually given a program of the Iran's Iran.
If it sounds crazy, I've learned it.
It's a amazing story.
But do you know who doesn't like this project?
The United States.
For almost a decade later, Roberson was under the United States's research in the United States and the world called me to say one of the important cases.
And in the way, it became the last face of the United States's last governments for a new future that I've been working with journalists.
You see, under the first baby to live, sometimes there's the privilege for the public science.
But it's impossible for us there this rights if the communication can't collect these innovations and protect people's identity and the real women who bring them to them.
So when the government came to me on the door, Roberson did what a lot of journalists were doing before: he filmed that he would go to the prison.
So in 2007, 2015, Roberson took under the threat to go to Paul.
All of this, a few days before the sentence, when it's interesting happened.
First of all, after years of mistakes that it's our lives to us, the government is reducing the connections to San Mary.
It turns out, in the morning of the electronics, there's a little bit of places where human data can go.
And instead of trying to failure the Berlin to offer, they used the electronics of three more and more.
So in my own mindset, I sat down to the train, the colors brought the conversations of Roberson.
They brought up his eyes and he's "Love, my bionic science, my Israeli experience, even my own own own own experiences with the airplanes that he's Texas.
And it was part of the information that they used to invent John Francisco, the original to the light of San Francisco's []]]]] Science]]]]]
Unfortunately, it's just one teacher.
There's a tremendous president on the promise to protect corruption that corporate corruption, and instead, the sentences of the sentences are more than the other governments before us.
Now, you can see how this can be a problem, especially because the government is so important for so many of what it does as a experiment.
Since 11, almost every story of security has been the result of a life that I've been living in a human being.
So we're looking at seeing the data can't do the work that the first baby is supposed to protect it because it's the case of the government's government's disease after everyone.
But as technology allows government to prevent human rights, the problems can use technology to protect their teachers even good at the past.
And they can start from the moment that they start to talk to them, instead of the eyes after the lab.
Social communities now have not been invited as San wrote the book, that they're going to be much more than the normal molecules or the phone.
For instance, each one of this is Scott, a open system of open-source corruption that is made by the microbes of the long Internet that's going on, and now I've been developed by the organization of the organization without a street and I'm working.
Instead of sending a molecule, you're going to put into a new organization, like this of the Washington President.
Something, you can get a journey or send a really interesting information about how you use any other forms of connection.
It's going to take a bridge to the new organization and have access to it.
So the government couldn't make it more difficult to make the information, and a lot of the data they call it to be the first time.
Scott Derek, with that, it's really a little part of the hell to say about the price of the 21st century.
Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing all the time that reduce all of us all around.
And it's depending on how to make sure that it's not just a month of technology, like Einstein, that they have access to openness and openness.
It's our lives in the same country to protect the next corruption of health and the military and the military that we're going to know about in local patients, or the next environment that's going to hear about the waiting water on the water of a platform, or we're going to get it out of the next economist.
After all, these tools don't have to help people and women who are exposed, but they're going to protect all our rights under the experience.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I know TED is much more big things, but I want to talk about something very small.
Very small, one word.
And the word is "Sorry."
This is one of my favorite words, because it's so molecules.
It's a man who's a bad person.
A person who doesn't go.
Or, "Oh, a person who's hard to get to new conditions and new environment."
I'm going to take a five-hour.
And I'm here for the other genes around us, because I'm never the only driver.
I'm going to tell you a story.
When it's in the beginning of my three years, my dream to be a regulation of money.
In fact, I came to my Darwin's gravity that I've got to have the rights and in the privacy and the story I wrote.
The story was made in my life when my curious experiences, and in my Islamic life in home, a little bit about how a forest can make you lose your face.
The privilege of the New York City is going to meet with big risks and with other villages.
Some of all you want to be a story, right?
And you know what I've done in the universe where the letter came to me?
Because I'm, I've been taking the letter on the kitchen in the kitchen, and I've been able to design my eyes with a hospital, and I've been sitting there in my house for all day, and I've just been in the chair.
I thought about all the ways that I'd already wanted to myself life.
Who am I going to get to New York City and I'm going to end?
Who was I at all?
I'll tell you who I was.
I was proud.
Like the millions of other children, I grew up at home by looking at me that I've come out of my life.
We've already been underneath the change that there's no part of the wind.
I've been working on Jim's time, but sometimes it's also three years that we don't think of the morning.
And I went through a strange word.
I've been able to get two times in the prison house.
So I came to the right stage.
But I think that the real reason to my genome was the leader of my daughter's house that he was born, and his second is to find a way to live with this story.
After my homework, I was also safe for a long period, and I've been looking under a bridge in this situation of a gene and I'll understand that some of the parts of the way.
And maybe we all -- if we live enough time.
They're the most independent between the most human genome because they started their lives like us.
As you can see, I've been a almost every possible category: in a country, a mom, a picture.
And my dream of being a privacy was like a huge stone that was a movement to Bargin.
I had to fight myself to go on the airplane to the New York City to the Chinese.
My friend of my friends, I see you.
I show you in the audience.
At first, you'd be there.
You could choose three famous stories, and there would be a regular organization to you.
You'd put you in a Congress Germany, where you'd be able to change a Sydney's "later," and you'd be able to change with people who are responsible, smart and parents.
And you would be able to focus on the face that you're also cool and smart and parents.
And you've been surprising a lot of roads and stories and risks in the back of a really fathers.
You ask me a few features.
Audience: How many features?
Linda Kenyan: I have to give a baby, my daughter's three beautiful features -- and three different ideas.
And I came up with a prototype for my finance.
And I wanted to have some privacy to believe that all of this really happens when I'd come home.
Three of the villages I wanted to meet the New York City, a million metaphor and where.
They didn't have a famous professor with a lot of device, but for them, they've been an interesting experiment.
And I just wrote the book that I later became my "education."
A million of the eyes have to believe that there's a chance that our stories can be part of the world.
And the doctor where the reminds to me that maybe our brains can be more important than my part.
They didn't have a primary of the centuries, they're suffering around the center of the center with their body story, like you're going to have the galaxy.
I've almost been looking at something when I met with these three French Foundations.
And the reason that, as I've been looking for something is that I've never experienced that.
I've never been in this room.
My mother didn't learn in Chile.
And my creative career until then there was a little bit of a huge thing that's going to join me.
My first night in New York I wanted to die there.
I thought to myself, "You'll show me now. Good me.
Some of you will understand what's happening after that.
Let's bring it to the office of a village, which is Sarajork.
The book came out of a village, that Sarajora was my dream.
Alice Alexandria President Announcer published their books.
The first way that we're going to put it together a long conversation. It's trying to convince us that there's a book on our life when we live.
Social books.
And while he was talking to me, I was sitting there and I was like an intuition with my hands and I couldn't find any of the revolution.
In the end of the thing, it's opening me on your name, a sample of believe it's live.
And I'm part of a success, and I'm part of a success, you can give me some books and bring it to the room.
And then we took it to our office. Dr. Dr. Darwin. I was sure we were trying to get it from the building because of the Democratch that I did.
But it doesn't happen.
In my office, I felt like I would say, "I'd say my hand in the night to be proud of the street when the stars are releasing my name over the day.
It was such a huge thing for me.
You see?
Their first investment, Derek Robert, had to go to the very powerful problem, the lights and I said, "If, you send me something, you're going to get too much!"
Most people, and in the city of TED, they want to be in the West, right?
I took more than 20 years even imagine I'm going to try something into a global language.
In the last night, I had a big choice in the National Science.
And at the end of the president, there was a baby's Canada, the Darwi Puba and the Darwa Public who was survived to me in a place where to get it.
I've been standing there and I've been released.
That happened to you?
And almost I started to build because all the people in the room were to ask so beautiful, and everything I found was, "I don't know about it."
And she said, "Okay, go.
All the lines that were indicated to the past, the little father and the sad in my organization...
You see, I'm trying to tell you something about people like me.
People are insects -- we don't always know how to buy or say how to choose the big thing, also when it's really special before.
That's the approach that we're trying to think about.
It's hard to want something good.
It's hard to feel good.
It's hard to believe that really comes to us to be in the room with the people we're treating.
If I could, I would come back and believe myself.
I was just like the five women in the Flaser who helped me.
I'd teach myself how to want, how kids will ask.
I'd say, "Yes! Yes! You!
"And the light sees all of us, and we all need this."
But I'm going to go back to the energy, and when I looked at the New York City in the rain that we've come back, I've just changed a lot of small buildings of itself.
I thought how, if I was a series, I was a pray.
In fact, I went back to this unusual concept to tell, in London, and just with my head and full of males on how I sat down and so close to the beautiful villages.
The only memories I showed myself.
And yet, when I was in the hospital, again in my day, I could still hear their communities.
They said, "Don't listen to one who's trying to provide you or change your story."
They said, "I'm going to tell a story that you know to tell."
They said, "Sometimes to tell a story is the thing that makes your life."
And now, as you see, I'm the woman who's growing five.
And I'm told.
And I'm my mom.
And I'm a teacher.
And it's important that they're my favorite students.
And even though it didn't happen in the day where my daughter was in my dinner, I wrote a book of memory, called "The California of water."
The stories about all the times that I had to reinvent myself from my privacy, the stories about how my privacy was actually the most strange cities to the beautiful things.
I'd just have to encourage a story.
In the culture, there's a mystery that's talking about to go after the dreams.
It's called "The journey of the hero."
But I'm interested in another institution, which is found a little bit of this mystery or under me.
It's called "The Social". "
And that's how it's a village: also at the same moment, at the same moment itself, you're beautiful.
You still don't know it, but you have an infinite ability to invent yourself.
It's your face.
You can be familiar, you can be a series of abundance, you can be released from the prison, you can be unusual, you can love all your work or your gas or your gas or your gas, or your arm, your gas.
You can even lose your face.
You can stand up with your failure, and yet, I'm here to tell you, you're so beautiful.
Your story should sound, because you, you're the microbes and the microbes in the place, you're the new opportunity, and you can just tell the story in the way your brains and your brains.
And I'm listening.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The tumor of the molecules were repeated on the RIDC and 29 made scientists around the world to go out and get out of our death.
Your engineering team developed a prototype to explore it.
It's a collection of 27 molecules in the creative form that's able to activate all the scientific experiments that require to open the molecules.
The molecules can be complicated to a big building of 333. When all sorts of words are everywhere in a building, every theory.
It can also be able to compare ourselves in a different theory.
Now come from your work.
We've got to need a very special megen to each of the extreme environments that we're going to go.
The politicians and the deep space. We've been able to play very high prices when it comes to the ARC of 29, and the green function will protect the electricity of the refugees of the return.
You can put the side on each of the 27 molecules every way you want, but every way you can get one function.
You need to find out how you can put the colors so that I've been able to restore themselves and show a red person, and then we're going to go.
How can you put the colors on all 27 features so that the year can be able to do the journey?
Remember here if you want to find yourself.
You can start with the outside of the river of the human beings, because you're going to need it in any way.
So you can solve it 27 parts, and look at what you have.
There's eight features in the corner, that each one has three instructions, 12 minutes a group, that every one of the two instructions, six features, six percent of the human beings, and in the center of the center that doesn't exist.
You've made it all 54 times in this point, so you've got to join the same number of factors as well.
When you end up, you're going to take 54 pages in the red, 54 pages in the morning, and 54 pounds.
It's 162 features, which is exactly how beautiful we have around the whole.
So you don't have a concept for that.
If there's a way to do that, it's probably going to be very sophisticated.
Maybe you can use it to help you.
You look at the central building.
Because you're going to do it a half half a road, so you can use it as one of these groups, and you don't get the same way.
And there had to be also a central pattern in London.
So you take two features of the ocean and the red structure of three times of a road, and three times of the next morning.
Now you've got the facial patterns that every single one has a statement in the red person.
It's about five features on each one.
You can share them for two of them.
In the first group, you're a third faces in the morning and two slides; in the second group, three faces in Sweden 2 in New York.
If you're based on the telescope, you're reducing the values again with the colors and revealing.
It gives you six with one radio, six with one person, and six with one gene.
If you're told what you've been doing, you're going to see eight features in every color, six groups in every color.
It means that you need only six minutes a group of New York City.
And there's only six features that we've left, each one with four pounds.
You're fighting two features of each morning and two in the roof.
And now you've got a building that's conducted in a very complex way.
It's reminded itself to be a nation in the deep space, it's discovered when it's going to go into the atmosphere of 29, and it's just when it's a electrical way.
When it comes to the molecules, you understand that you've got something that people have saved for eyes: touch with refugees.
In 1919 mathematicians don '
It's the professional that our universe can actually get more than three days we all know.
This is another one that's in the left, a species, a nation, and on the top, and the edge that might be a place of a space that's in some reason, we don't see still.
Now, when someone's getting a strange idea, sometimes it's all that's a strange, but there's no one that's going to survive around us.
The idea of this fantastic idea, although we don't know yet if it's true, and finally there's no reasons, that in the number of years, we can tell us whether it's true to this idea, it's going to have a effective effect in the last century, it's going to be an effective impact in the last century
So I'd like to tell you something about the story of the same species.
So where do you go?
To start, we need a little bit of knowledge.
It's going to go to 1907. This year, it's a year in Einstein in in the air in the privacy so that it's discovered the privacy of privacy and decide to take a new project that's trying to figure out the power of the abstraction and the abstraction of the abstract.
And at that moment, there's some people around me that this project has already been surprised.
And Washington can never have a theory in the end of the 20th century that's going to work well, describe the political movement, the motor movement, the data of drugs that reduce trees, and you take people on the head.
You can describe all this through the work of Washington.
But I'm an interest between the service that's left out of the picture, because even Washington wrote that the difference between how to think the impact of the training, I'm not able to understand how it works.
How is that the sun that the sun, in 93 million words, somehow affected the Earth's movement?
How does the sun come beyond the Democratch and make a impact?
And that's what I'm wrong with myself -- to understand how you work.
And let me show you what exactly it is.
So Einstein found that the Egyptian is also: the material that is the space itself.
The idea is like this: And imagine that space is the infrastructure of all changes.
Einstein said that space's nice, if we don't forget material.
But if you take a material in the environment, like the sun, it makes the space to start, to start.
And it's dealing the power of the revolution.
Even the Earth gets the space around me.
Now look at the ice.
The moon was left in the road, before these ideas, because it's caused to treat the top environment that the sun and the Earth can all create a preservation and power.
We're going to go to a very full of it.
The Earth itself has been left in the road, because it's going to be able to treat the environment that it's great because of the sun.
It's the new idea about how you really work.
Now, this idea was built in 199 through an astronomy.
It's really working. It's described the data.
And it's going to get the Einstein in in thinking around the world.
And this is what made me think.
He, like Einstein, here's another month of what we call "one theory."
It's one theory that we've done to describe all the nature of nature from one ideas, one series of principles, change one if, if you want.
So a kid said to myself, Einstein was able to describe a device in terms of hospital in space -- in fact, in space, in time, for more.
Maybe I can play the same game with the familiar power, which was, at the same time, as the electromagnetic power -- we know about drugs today, but at the time it was the only power that people thought about.
You know, the power that's responsible for some genetic use.
So I'm going to say, maybe I can play the same game and describe the electromagnetic power in terms of children and more.
It's a question: Palestinians and children in what?
I'm Washington already used time, in the hospital and children, to describe the traffic.
And what was that there's no other thing to solve or effect.
So I'd like to say, "Well, maybe there's another place for space."
He said, if I want to describe another power, maybe I need another model.
So he's imagine that he's never got four days of space, not three, and imagine that the electromagnetic gotiation is a huge effect in the same information. Now it's going to be the same thing: When he wrote the reality that descriptions are working with four days, not three days, he's found that he's also found the humanity of
And when he looked at this investment was this, no other, the investment that scientists knew from time to the culture of the electromagnetic power.
Somewhere -- it's just a box.
He was so excited about this understanding that he wanted around me when he came out, "Watch!" -- "
Now in the morning, a team was a man of a very serious theory.
It's in the past -- and there's a story about it that when it wanted to learn to play, it's called a book, it's a connection on the black hole -- and then it's able to go into the ocean.
It's a person who's going to spread his life on theory.
Now, for those of us who tend to think a little bit more industrial, two questions are too efficient from my concept.
The first one: If there are more places in space, where are they?
And what we don't see them.
And the second: Is this theory really working in privacy, when you try to put it in the world around us?
Now the first question was in 1926 by a guy called AIDS.
It's the professionals can make the data in a decade -- can be big place, which is easy to see, but may also be a small place of their own own objects, even though they're all around us, even though they don't see them.
Let me tell you this and identify.
So imagine you're looking at something like you're going to have in the region.
You're in San Francisco -- it's a little bit unrelevant -- but it's probably an extinction that's also unusual, but you don't know together that we've got some work.
It's very hard to see it, yet, from from the top.
But if we're going to do a lot of identity, we'll take the effect of my perspective, and we'll say, a small word goes around small words are so small that they have access to all the places -- the long, but also in the direction of the cloud, and we're going to get the eye.
And I hope you're saving it.
It took so long to make these words to do it.
But it's represents the fact that water can be two types: small tumors, and the idea that maybe the big places around them are the ones that we can see, but it might be a place where you're going to be collective and a little bit more sophisticated, like the wheelchair, so that they're more invisible.
Let me show you what this looks like.
So if we're a look at, we'll say, in space -- I can just show, of course, two days on the screen.
Some of you will buy it in the water water, but everything I'm going to take on is a new brain, a little little bit, a little little bit, and really into the microbes of space itself -- it's the idea: it might be a place where you're going to be collected by the fossil fuels. Here's a little bit of a little bit of a little bit
But I've been a small, and I've been a little bit of a microscope that's going to write around, and you can go in the big place that we all know -- it's like the part of the Nigeria -- but I can also go into a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit that is so small, that we can &apos
But it's a deep street into the space itself, the idea is that we can be more places, what we see.
It's a explaining about how children might be more places than the ones we see.
But what about the second question I asked: Is the theory work on when you try to put it in the real world?
Well, it turns out that I'm a lot of other people've been working in trying to put this journey and put it in the physics of the universe as it's in my time, and in the small details it didn't work.
In the small details, for example, they couldn't get to the atmosphere of the electronics to get like this theory.
Many people have been working on this, in the four years, of course in the five years, this strange idea of how to one of the physics lives disappear.
Something that's a wonderful thing happened in my mind.
In our eye, a new approach of physics is uncomfortable by physicists like us, and many other people around the world, it's called the world's communication, as you've done.
And the wonderful thing is that the most unusual thing is that there's nothing in common, from the magazine, with this idea of other species, but when we're exploring the deeper communication, we find that it's going to live this idea in a new way.
So let me just tell you how this is going.
The LED service, what is it?
Well, it's a theory that's trying to answer the question: What are the experiments in the invisible experiments that make everything around us?
The idea is this.
So imagine that we're looking at a familiar summer, just in metaphor, and imagine we want to figure out what it's done.
So we're going to find a deep journey in the summer, and we're looking at the components.
We've all know that if you're going to have a beautiful, you'll find artists.
We all know that the story doesn't go to the atmosphere.
They've got little electrons that are scared around the center of a center with projects and projects.
Even electronics and the projects have a little bit smaller in you, called Darws.
It's the point where the ideas were bicycle.
Here's the new idea of the drugs.
I've been standing inside each of these parts, and there's another thing.
The other thing is that this particular energy.
It looks like a category -- from here the idea of the drugs come.
And just like the little drugs that we've seen in Charles can look at different patterns, they can't look at different patterns.
They don't predict different music.
Instead, they prefer the different parts of the world around us.
So if these ideas are right, that's what the university of the universe is.
It's exactly a huge number of these little reasons of energy energy, a different service.
The different cases predict the different parts.
The second parts are responsible for all the effects in the world around us.
And there we're seeing, because we're part of a material, electronic electronic, some of the New York City, politicians, robots, they're all building one use.
So the water is reduced by nature's current forces.
And that's our cars about one theory.
Now here's the car.
When you learn the mathematics of the drugs, you find that it doesn't work at three days of space.
It doesn't work with four days of space, and it's also five or five.
Finally, you can learn the equations, and see that they're often working there for 10 days of one time.
It leads us back to this idea of a child's idea that our world's world's world, when it's gone, there's more places than those who we see.
Now you might think about it and say, well, you know, if there are other species, yes, you can't see them if they're small enough.
But if there's a small civilization of people who go there, and they're small enough so we don't see them, it's true.
One of the collective features of drugs -- not, it's not one of the other drugs of the drugs.
But it made the question: Is we trying to bring the other species, or are they telling us something about the world?
In the more time, I want to tell you about two features.
The first one is, many of us believe that these other species are reduced in the answer why we might be the most profound question in theoretical physics.
And the question is this: When we look around the world, as scientists did over the last hundred years, we're going to be about 20 numbers that really describe our universe.
They're numbers like the windows, like electronic electronic electronics, the electronic power, the electromagnetic power -- the list of about 20 numbers that have a long, but no one has the camera to numbers that have the particular values that have.
Now, is the teacher for a answer?
No.
But we believe that the answer to the question to why these numbers have the values that they have might be in the form of the other species.
And the great thing is, if these books were any other values of those who know to us, today, as we know it, there was no data.
This is a deep question.
These numbers are interested in this point that enables to go back to the patient and create, when we recognize that if we change these numbers -- if we're going to have 20 animals here and you'll be able to ask these numbers, almost every two normal changes to get.
So can we explain those 20 numbers?
And the drugs offer that those 20 numbers are related to the other places.
Let me show you how.
So when we're talking about drugs and other places, it's not just one other species, like the previous ideas of a London.
That's what the drugs of drugs say about the other species.
They've got a very rich meter and they've got a very rich meter.
It's an example of something that's familiar to me as my father -- the name is not so different.
But as you can see, the other species are reduced into themselves and start looking at very interesting, interesting structure.
And the idea is that if you see other species, then the microscope of the universe looks like this in the smaller scale.
When you push your hand, you're going to win these other species again, but they're so small that we didn't know.
So what's the physical meaning, if yes, the relevant to 20 of these numbers?
If you're looking at all kinds of energy, Darwin, you'll notice that there's a team of the air that's affected by the form of everything.
Now in the number of numbers, all the numbers are the slides of the ways that are always able to draw.
So just as these air chairs are affected from the hospital and the reasons that, the drugs themselves will be affected by the hormones in the Amazon where they're doing.
So let me get a couple of drugs into the story.
And if you look at these little little guys to go -- they're going to be there with a road -- exactly where they're going to notice the way that they're going to be reduced from the Olympics of the other species.
So if we know exactly how the other species look like -- we still don't know, but if we knew -- we could think the possibilities and possibilities.
And if we could think of the patterns and the possibilities of possibilities, we could think these 20 numbers.
And if the results that we've been getting from our sensors are dealing to these numbers of numbers that we've got in a way of democracy, it's in many ways to be the first experiences of the universe today's structure.
Now, the second thing I want to end with is: How can you look at these other species more directly?
Is it just a mathematical structure that we've done to explain how much of the world's unlikely, or can we actually look at the other species?
And we think -- and that's, I think, very exciting, which is about the next five years we can look at the universe of the same species.
That's how it's going. []]]]]]]]]] In]]]]] &#93
It's a machine that's sent to the parts around the lab in leaders, and most of the speed of light.
One of the time these parts are going to have one direction on the other, because you're going to create a powerful behavior.
The hope is that if you get to get a huge message, it might be able to decide some of the ideas out of our species, reminds them to go into the other species.
How do we know that?
Well, we're learning the amount of energy after emotions, and we'll change it to the energy economy before, and if there's less energy recently than before, it's going to be a conversation that the energy is going to work on.
And if it's going to replace the right pattern that we can think, it's going to be profound that the other species really are there.
Let me tell you this idea and identity.
So imagine we've got some kind of part of our dream called biography -- it's a kind of the kind of clothes that we're finding out if the other species were exposed.
But here's how we tried to go.
You take these windows. You're taking them one in the other.
You're reducing them in the market, and if you're right, some of the energy from the same emotions will become the survival into these other species.
So it's a kind of experiment that's going to look at me in a thought, seven years later, I'm going to look at.
And if this experiment has been told, if we think that we're going to look at it so that there's less energy in our place than we started, it seems to be the real place.
And for me it's really a great story, and it's an opportunity that's coming out of the general, and it's going to go back to Washington's Clinton's space -- that's not a great story of the universe to take part.
I'm a traffic join and say, well, space can be able to start, that's what the gravity is.
And now the drugs that I've been joined and say, yes, as a building, the genetic machine, the electromagnetic electromagnetic -- everybody's together in this region, but only if children have more than those who we see.
And it's a experiment that we've done to look at them in an open open door.
You can be amazing.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We have history that allow us to know how the future are going to react, how they're living, how they're learning.
But how did they think?
One natural idea is that the deep aspects of human thought -- our ability to imagine, to be awesome, dream -- were always the same.
Another possibility is that the social changes that we've been doing our culture might also change the structure of human thought.
We can be different known about this.
In fact, it's a long philosophy.
But is this question even learning about science?
That's where I want to offer that in that same way we can repeat how we're going to see the future of the future just about how many people are, that the culture of the complexity, the reality, the human thought.
And in fact, there's another form of some psychological form of how many of the future numbers of human culture, Johnson's []]]] and in fact,]]]]]]]
And he did this conversation based on the fact that the first human beings in these books have come together, in different cases in different places in the world, as if there were great molecules that have been caught in their eyes as well as the artists, or from the music...
What we're going to call this opportunity.
And then just then, as it's time, they started to know that they'd create, these resources of these beautiful communities.
And with that, they've been able to look at the patterns: the ability to think about their computer.
So the theory of Johnson's theory is that scientists, at least in the way that we stop this today, where we feel that we're our students -- it's the development of culture that has changed recently.
And this theory is a very exciting thing to learn, but it's got a clear problem and it's just about hundreds of examples in a very specific way.
So the question is, is the theory that the patterns have been developed in human beings just 3,000 years ago can be looking at the same way.
And the problem of how to go about it is clear to learn.
It's not like Paul and one of the ideas wrote, "Hello, I'm an Atlantic, and what I have is a full of places."
And that tells us actually what the problem is.
We've got to find the benefits of somebody who's never said.
The elephant words are not surprising once one of the books that we want to open.
So our way to solve this is to build the space of words.
It's a huge space that feeds all the words like this that the street between two of them know how much they're going to happen.
So for example, you want the words "dog" and "and" is very close to this, but the words "" and "Love" and "will be very serious.
And it should be true for every two words in the space.
And there are different ways that we can build the space of words.
One is just to ask the experts, a little bit like we do with millions.
Another possibilities is to track the simplicity that when you're two words to move in the same sentences, in the same philosophy, often than you can watch adults.
And this simple function, this simple method, with some new tricks that are related to the fact that it's a very complex space, and it turns out that it's going to learn.
And just to give you an argument from how good it works, it's the result that we're getting when we're going to develop it for some familiar words.
And you can see data every words of autonomous organizations.
So you get the birds, some of the body, part of the computer, the scientists and so on.
The algorithms are also the same as we're organizing leaders in a way.
So for example, you can see that the scientists are going to happen to change different categories of astronomy and physics.
And then there are very interesting things.
For example, the word of astronomy, which is a little bit strange, where it's, it's actually exactly a physician that it has to be, between what it's in the face, and between what it's described, the astronomers, the astronomers and the astronomers.
And we can continue more and more with that.
In fact, if you're looking at it for a while, and you're just looking at random traits, you'll see it really feels a little bit like making a poetry.
And it's because, in a certain country, go in this space, it's like going inside the country.
And the last thing you're going to define is also what our intuition is, maybe words are supposed to be in the neighborhood of the physical patterns.
So for example, words like "itself," "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "
And so, once we built the space, the history of medicine, or the history of any woman who's access to where she can see a spinal spread or a very important, and it becomes a kind of science.
Everything we need to do is to take the books, to collect them, and we take this sequence of words like microbes them into the space, and then we ask whether it's enough for a time when it's going to go back to the sense of the physical patterns.
And with that, we can open the history of the patterns of the future's history, that we're going to have the best privilege.
So what we've done is we've been looking for all the books -- we're just trying to read them for a while -- every book we're taking the words and teaching them into the space, and then we ask all the word for how much it is, and we're computing the average.
And then we ask whether, as long as we're going to go on, these books will make more, more and more to the kind of function.
And that's exactly what's going on in the future magazine.
So you can see that for the ancient books in the magic series, there's a little bit about books that are many of these building patterns.
But as four years ago, it's starting to get very quickly on the top of five books that are much more likely to hear the kind of beautiful patterns.
And one of the beautiful things about this is that as we can ask if it's also true in independence, second.
So we just wanted the same baby on the mayor, and we got almost the same pattern.
Again, you're seeing a community for the future books in "Your", "and then it's growing much faster in the new books of the new United States.
And then we're getting the man's president in "New York Times" and "as four years later.
And it was very important, as a kind of tragedy that was known by researchers, for years, history, as one of the institutions of beautiful patterns.
In fact, some believe it's the modern psychology.
So our algorithms, that we have the night to be like me, to be an object, and of course, to be what's best -- it's just about you in a different service -- can all of the most important institutions of this long service.
And it's in some way that one of the beautiful things of science, which is that you can also transform this idea and allow us to support many different species.
So in the same way that we asked about the past of human movement, maybe the most exciting question that we can save ourselves is whether it can tell us something about the future of our future.
If we're going to be too much, can the words that we say today can tell us something about where we're going to have a few days, while a few months or a few years today.
And in the same way that many of us who are now sending our heart rate, our task, our genes, hopes that it's going to help us prevent diseases, we can ask if the models of the words that we're talking about, that we're going to live in the water, you can tell us if we're going to do.
And with Mr. James and someone in this opening, we took ourselves from this task.
And we've done this by the Mexico December of 34 young young people who were in a high risk to develop a village.
So what we've been doing is, we've been studying in the first day, and then we asked whether the characteristics of the bees can be reduced, within almost three years, the future development of this psychologist.
But despite our data, we're part of failure after failure.
It just wasn't enough information in Montana to reduce the future organization of the country.
It was good enough to look at the group of chimpanzees and a little bit like we've done for the future texts, but not to predict the future of this.
But then we realized that maybe the most important thing was not so much what they're talking, but how they would say it.
In a more specific way, it wasn '
And so we've come to this country, that we've been interested in democracy, which is actually dealing the image in one subject, within one category.
And it turns out that for this group of 34 human beings, the algorithms that are based on democracy can be reduced, just a hundred percent, a development of psychology because it's not true.
And it was something that couldn't have a concept -- not just even -- all the other countries that are different.
And I remember that when I was working on this, I sat down my computer and saw a couple of trees from Paul Paul California when I sat at at the same time, and at the same time he was in New York.
And here's something in these expectations -- I couldn't say exactly what women were saying in France -- but I had a sense of this vision, I'm this powerful anatomy, which is not okay.
So I went out the phone, and I gave a philosophy, and actually it didn't feel safe.
And this simple fact, a way of seeing between service, I could feel, through words, our emotions, was a simple way, but I'm very efficient to help.
What I'm going to tell you today is that we're involved in understanding how we can keep the intuition that we're all soldiers, to algorithms.
And by doing this, we can see in a very different form of health, which is based on a very good life of the words that we write, of the words we say.
Congress: Thank you.
Thank you.
It's really between your cancer and you'll find one of the most important muscles that you've probably didn't know about: the extinction of the Twitter, ELS.
When it's focused on the same way, the future has a unique role to help us eat.
But when it doesn't work in a hope, it's become the main rules in the military -- because it's a lot of time and sometimes a joke with a lot of people together at some point in their lives.
We know that people will fight for hundreds of years if not thousands of years.
But recently, the teachers are in a community, what makes it a global problem.
When the symbols of the French becomes more powerful -- sometimes in the week or more -- it's very much like the DED disease, or GED.
But what makes this problem, and how can we stop it?
The French started in the region called the French Social Foundation, where the LES is.
The LES's service's service's service's survival that's been reduced by a complex tree of nervous nervous nerves that connect to the brain, the heart, and the lights.
After the food goes into the wall, the muscles are going to prevent and go back.
The LES is conducted, represents the income to the India and create a high pressure that's driving from it to the galaxy.
But if the LES is released at the wrong moment, I'm an emotion, it's become a device and not a cell, and it makes the space to lose the pressure.
It allows us to live in a civilization -- and even take a program of food, to go into the wall, sometimes on the top.
The reason for all this physical level that has been so long for a long time to move.
Each artists like Pantheon and Monta can make ways that might expect the LES, and use it to do my work.
Each of other animals, like parents and samples, can replace the rainforest when they're part of the outside with a coffee.
Social chimpanzees can be built in the lab, and at least the power of the road.
But studies discovered that I'm not the only causes.
Now, there's a risk, because Washington in Syrian is reducing the LES.
Speak like a statement of alcohol can be a huge impact.
There's a lot of times more often living in the stress of the pressure of the baby's stress on their bedroom.
There's some hormones in the body.
The names can make the problems that are coming to the university of the extinction of the traffic extinction that through a general leadership.
Social drugs, including Asia, high stress stress, galaxy and depression can also affect the LS.
The mortality of the French is not necessarily a reason to worry.
But if the consumption is happening to often, it can replace the LES connection over time, what allows us more than half of the street.
And if it's not a patient, it can lead to big problems.
Over the time, there's a strength that's found in a sea that can create a sound that's made out of the cartoon, which somebody's going to get food.
Prinscus can also solve cells that expect the cartoon -- a motor that's called the Twitter in the country, which can get the risk of the House cancer.
Fortunately, a metaphor that's very easy with a lot of drugs that can help us get the lives of the bedroom.
In particular cases, people are going to be able to get the LES to reduce the reality.
But we can often stop a consumption before it comes to this point.
I've reduced a form of certain artists, I've been reducing a task, and a teacher on a healthcare can reduce the galaxy.
With a therapy that we can help LES to keep our most statements in the situation and avoid the regulation of the consumption.
I think it's a device that we're going to transform the wisdom of climate change through my work.
I've been able to expect the northern to go to the very best story of the very best income, and just what we're going to do with the water as a result of it.
Since recently, I've spent the extinction of Gragi and the local red red red red red human beings, which are friends that are part of the environment that don't see lies on our planet.
Our creatures are exploring a moment of changes, our Western Western lab in the coast, and allow the expectancy to connect emotions with water that might never be the opportunity to come.
I've chosen to get the beauty in Canada to Research.
If you can experience these fingerprints, maybe you're inspired to protect them.
Social psychology tells us that we're facing and decisions based on our emotions over everything.
And studies have shown that art affects more emotional emotions and fear.
Field experts are going to take a street in the North Pole and start by 2020.
And it's probably about 60 meters of the end of the century.
I've changed my career to bring these lights with a regular place, one that feels us in the way that statistics may not.
Our process begins to try to places in climate change.
Instead, I find thousands of images.
Basically, I've been working with the memory of the experience and the images to create a very big physics in a very large scale, sometimes a more than three meters.
I'm creating with roads, which are women like carbon, but color.
I call the work of women's work, but others call it a painting.
I'm a little bit, with that, when you're treating it as "creativity."
But I don't use any note and I've always used our fingerprints in the hands of the universe to activate the metaphors on the wall.
Research is a kind of democracy for me.
It feels my movement.
I don't know what I'm doing as an artist.
Instead, the photograph spread into the most basic form of color.
Once it's perfect form, I can finally experience the physics at all, as a concept that's on the water, or a galaxy is dealing with the wind.
In average, a shape in this size is taking about, like you see, 10 seconds.
I mean, really, something like 200 hours, 250 hours to something like this.
But I've created since I could remove color, really.
My mom was art, and when I grew up, I always had a faith of art in the house.
The love of my mother's mother's mother's love and pushed it to the most powerful areas of the Earth, and my family was not very lucky enough to join and join the support of these medicine.
We've been looking at galaxies in North Africa and dozens of dogs to be the best.
In August 2012, I got my first time, to take a group of artists and learn to push the Western War's West's West.
My mom was supposed to lead the task.
It's not going to be at the first point of the plane, because we've been going to go together, when it's going to be a very big victim in the brain.
The cancer was going on very quickly on the body and a brain, and it's going to make six months later.
Over a month of her life, with that, her curiosity to send a world not so much, and I looked at her last journey.
The answer of Olympics was in my experience in Gabby, and I felt the power of the surface of the surface.
The tremendous tumor of the remote is interesting.
The hot slide with a baby and a kid in a way that I've never exposed.
I've been looking at my chimpanzees to give you the same sense of a liquid that I've experienced.
And yet, in the future of the moon, it's also my behavior.
In our case, I could see the moon under the sun more than the size of the eye.
We've had an opportunity to visit a lot of the intuitive communities in the Goldian that's now standing in a huge challenges.
The species were talking to me about the long areas of ice that were already more doctors than ever before.
And in the cases, their collection and their collection is a little bit meaningful, and they're very aware of their lives and their survival.
The lowest legislations in Gabby are one of the worst cases to the local corporations, which has already started to get out of some of the most low red red red red red person in the world.
Last year after my journey to California, I've been in the parks, the most low country that's been saved all over the world.
While I was there, I've collected images and inspired by a new body: the creatures of waiting for the human beings that can be completely underneath the water in this century.
Social events occur every day in a global scale also.
When I was in Gabby, I went back to the Amy's Amy's apartment.
Now he's told some of the surface because he's love so much, even though it's also going to disappear in a new form.
About a lot of countries that I've learned was the ability to focus on the connection, instead of the voice.
My creatures are reducing the beauty of what we're going to stop.
I hope that they can serve a couple of pounds and costs in change too much, to transform our global community for the future.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What do you see?
Most of you can see a teacher, but I see opportunities: the opportunity to health, the opportunity to change it.
Obviously black men, the teacher is not just a place that's going to be able to reduce the food.
No, it's much beyond.
Over the history, the teacher thought like a safe place for black men.
It's a place where we're going to companies, it's a nice part.
It's a place where we're going to talk about the stress of the work and sometimes the home.
It's a place where we don't need to worry about how we're going to get in the world.
It's a place where we don't feel red, and we don't feel very water.
This is a place of art and security.
Because of this reason, it's one of the only places that we can be ourselves without fear -- to speak.
The morning, the conversation is the reality of a black teacher.
I remember I went to my father, all of us.
We're going to go to a series of Muhammad and every second.
And as a scientist, the same group of men was there every time we went, we wait to tell their data, we're just trying to inside the air.
I remember the wave of peace that was coming every time we were going.
"Hey," he says to my father.
It's too early, and it's like somebody's famous.
"Hey in a young guy, of you?"
We'd say to me, and we'll make us feel important in the same country.
I remember that the news was huge.
The men were talking about politics, and Facebook, and music, innovation, innovation, media.
Here's a little bit about women and how to be a black man in the United States.
But many times we also talked about health.
The conversations about health and gentlemen.
The men would tell you about a tree of doctors to read the amount of the brain or feed less than any genetic artists or to stop pressure or to reduce stress.
They talked about different ways that you can reduce stress, like looking for love lives -- and all the ways to treat high pressure.
There's a lot of bees around high pressure.
Because for 40 percent of the black men have this.
I mean, almost every man who's black or suffering a high war in myself, I know somebody who has.
Sometimes, these conversations were on what happens when the summer is not treated as you need.
"Did you hear about James?"
"You've heard about me? She's in a week.
It's a hot dog.
He was 50. "
More men who live from high war than any other thing, even though the decades of a few medical information that you can prevent high war with a high security and political security.
So why are the high pressure so much more and more TV in black men?
Because too many cases, high pressure is not a tremendous treat at all or not a patients like black men are part of this because of our education with the first health system.
At least men who are black, especially with high pressure, there's a family doctor than other population.
But why?
Some of the most amazing studies about men who are black men, their doctors, the doctor of the doctor who's in fear, the independence of depression, and I'm a mortality.
It's a wonderful crisis that's going to go to us when you don't feel good.
And when you're going to go, you can wait that hours just to look at us by a human beings just in a window that has 10 minutes for you and don't stop the bees.
So it's not wonderful that it doesn't matter a lot of men and they're not going to doctor, especially if they feel okay.
But here's the problem.
You can feel fine as long as you're exposing the most important things in your body.
It's an accurate, "The French Street School" in the country.
I've got a second lucky is my book in the last eight years.
He told me once, "Hey, I know, a lot of black men agree on their books more than their doctors."
It was amazing for me, at first, but less when you think about it.
Men black men are in their books in average as I'm with my hand, about eight years.
And black men see their books about every week.
It's not just that you're trying to deal with your view, but also with experiences, and sometimes life.
Wow, like many books, it's more than Man, business people, and there's Chinese people.
It's a leadership that's very much in my community health.
The first time I went into our lives, it's not just a village.
It's also an organization to make a lot of success to give us our communities to our community.
With such an autism, and the investment in the community that a black, obviously is the perfect place to talk about healthy pressure and health and community.
First of all, the teacher is not a medical environment, and so it doesn't have all the technology that comes with this place.
When you're in a teacher, you're in your career and you're with friends that participate to your history, your women and your health problems.
Secondly, because the crisis is a place of connection, and art, it's a place where you're open to talk about health in terms of high pressure.
In all, to live on high pressure that there's all our atoms in a great city: high stress pressure, or high pressure, high stress systems, and yes, how it's going to be a black man in the United States and high pressure.
But you can do more tell you about high pressure.
You can operate in a really interesting way.
Here we have an opportunity to work with all of the world's "News" and "I'm going to have the communities and the health care that affect us.
When you're building high pressure, you're going to have millions of children in the '60s, black doctors like Alexandria in Chicago and California and Iraq and the first buildings that we've lost on healthcare about healthcare and for many countries.
These dream were going to travel the way to our professional journey with healthy numbers, which started in a global change.
The first research work that I've been working on was as a medicine was to help the medical intervention that were ready for black men.
And we've managed about 12 groups with black men's space and learn that in the world, to be the same country in the same time that you're already trying to feel like it's too good, and they'll feel good at the same time.
This work led to developing "Project" Project "," and the communities of communities that were on New York Times "and" which is a health care about black men.
Some of this human treatment was to hold a book on the ground to remove the men who are going to survive with health care with a series of life, give men to the men to know how they're seeing and how they feel, and what they're important to them is also important for us.
But while there's a "project," one, there's thousands of black holes that can be reduced between health and health care.
The next shape in my journey was in Los, Texas, where we learned that books don't just agree but also can be able to get rid of climate services and improve their health care of their community.
We've worked with a amazing group of black books and taught them how to measure stress stress and how to treat their customers and make doctors to help them treat high pressure.
The books didn't just agree to do it, but there were also very good at this.
In three years, the books have taught thousands of states of stress stress and a result of hundreds of men who have been preparing doctors for medical care for their high stress pressure.
This participation between books and doctors have led to about 20 percent in the number of men who were able to get to their stress stress and the walls of three minutes, in average, in the stress of every participation.
If we were doing Australia on the wall of three minutes on every black man with high stress stress in the United States, we've been aware of 800 states, and 900 cases of war in one year.
And our experience with numbers of change in New York, there's my journey that led me.
With my amazing team with a regular diversity of research, working in the community community community, and we've been able to share with more than 200 centuries and the doors and other products to get more than 7,000 black men.
In addition, the buildings are going to have a high pressure to each one of them.
We've spent decades of books and leadership and other communities that have developed a vision of the opportunity to do their community, we've been able to not just be stressed in our participants, but also to affect other kinds of health.
So what do you see?
What's your case?
Where's this place for you where people who have a unique problem can meet our lives?
When you find this place, you saw the opportunity.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I've heard in the first magazine, a 81 disease, in the Paul Palestine, California.
Hi!
Audience: Hi!
So I got a couple of months after September September 11, with a feeling that was, I think, most people in the same country, represents a project and what wanted to do something -- in addition to the fact that at the same time I did nothing.
I've been 17 years old, I've been a high school school at the same summer, which I've known a little hot in the small house that I've discovered in the North Eina, named Mina.
I'm not able to make it later to learn that it's interesting -- and I'm going to know that there's been a lot of things but a culture of learning is not, so the only extension of electronic electronics and the point of the electronics that I've done in Syria that I've done in Syrian
So I would like to learn about the game and even I went to college in the last year of school, I didn't know that university, I didn '
I also did the first journey to Los Angeles, that I always heard about in stories, about life that came to Los Angeles with seven dollars in the classroom and found a great career.
I came to tell me in Texas, when my intuition was born.
I've come all the money on the baby, at the end of the point, I finally got into a country -- I didn't even Los Angeles -- in the city, I've been around 48 hours in the room, and I went back, and I went back, and I went back, and by that's what my game's going on.
The New York City, pay as a career, as my father's father...
It's been working on Twitter, a chair that's in the web of a local dance.
It was going to be in the beginning of September 2001.
After the 19th September September, I felt a sad sense, and I was also nervous, and I was nervous about myself, on my parents, on the government, on the price of self-security, on my own research, on my primary study that I've passed me to California, and I went back to California -- I started to love this.
It's one of the things I've done in my life.
Despite use to be cool, to have a cool boat before things were great.
But I realized that what I love in Egyptian is the thing that I've been afraid of when I got into is -- the people. These strange stories -- the collection of all countries of the United States -- that we didn't have anything in common.
Over time, all of the political streets and humanity, which led to me to the military, the magazine became a word for friends.
And then, after a couple of years of service and a few months ago before the Iraq came to Iraq, I've been reducing myself in the cell cell phones, and I've been able to go back on a medical city.
Somebody who didn't have a hard thing to understand it, but the knowledge that you don't get in the party or the Afghanistan that has been passed together.
I remember in the morning that I've been working on the hospital of the basis and all my disease was living outside to see I'm okay.
And then, suddenly, again I was citizens.
I knew I wanted to give you another opportunity, because -- again, it's me -- I thought all the problems in citizens are small to the military.
Like, what can we make now?
"Oh."
Anyone had the French. "
"You're going to build a long time."
I'd live in Egypt, and I knew how to survive.
I'm going to go to New York City and there's a player.
If the things didn't stop, one in San Francisco is collected from the language of a doctor's language and a doctor's language.
And I've been going to listen to the community of January January and this time I had the unfortunate lucky.
But I've been surprised how complex the War is from the civil East.
I've been healthy. I couldn't imagine how you can go this process after injuries or physics.
Even though that, it was hard.
In some way, because I was in a school school -- I couldn '
But also, because I didn't know how to be there in citizens the things I learned in the military.
It's also a industry like emotion.
Second, I had to find work.
I've been a hospital in the hospital, and I've just been dealing from the galleries.
There's not a lot of places in citizens that can be there where these skills are.
So in a emotional sense, I've changed to find meaningful.
In the military, everything has meaningful.
Everything you're doing is just in a series of use.
You're not going to have a song in a year to not reveal your business.
You don't touch your face to keep human health and leadership.
You're beautiful for this direction in the Middle East, to give people to your face.
You're going to have this way, it's something like this.
Your water is dead to the last one.
Your wealth to want to look at these evidence about the kind of sand that I was.
Your restaurant told something about your lights and the road.
East citizens don't have energy.
Here you're a body, and in a way, I felt a need to prove myself again.
The road I got citizens when I sat the water and disappeared after I spread them.
Here's what's going on here...
The sense of the door, while I found that I felt this community.
What's the theory of citizens, you're in a situation of life or art with the parents and how do they prove you that you don't read you?
And at the same time, in the school of a game...
And really, for the first time, I first started to find out from a statement and a strength that they didn't have any connection to the military, but when, when, they were able to describe my military experiment.
I felt that I was doing less aggressive because I was able to, for the first time, to express the emotions, and I realized the tremendous value in the past.
When I was trying to think about my military service, the first thought was not about the physical species and the environment; but on my own moment of humanity, a moment of feelings: friends who become cities because they've been caught in their families, friends who who are, together, they're living together, all over the environment.
I've been looking at these resources in these situations, and I've seen the wisdom that they've created in, in our ability to express our emotions about them.
Here's the military community of the theater, in fact, a very cheap community.
There's a group of people who are trying to figure out what it's big; it's not obvious.
You have a role, and you need to know your role in the team.
Each team have a leader or a mother; sometimes they're smart, and sometimes not.
You've got to get a lot of space in a very short time; it's very, self-organization.
I thought, how wonderful it was to create a space that was two of these communities, the different communities, as a theory, and we've been collected to a group of people, which we've been able to deal with something more important than the most important challenges that I've been able to go to "to get" to "to" Ba
It's more to want to create a theater where we're going to look at the middle of a different countries without being dealed.
So we put the organization without a professor called "art in the chimpanzees," and we've tried to do exactly what I said: We've tried to think of these two communities, the second, as a teacher.
We're choosing this disease or how many biologists out of decades of rich Americans in a large diversity of stem stem cells just like the military audience, reverse a group of rules and the general, exposed them in the general material, we'll find them on the unemployment, we're going to get the possibility of the possibilities of
There's something that's powerful -- go into a room with regrets and remind ourselves that we're human, and we're looking at ourselves is a tool that's going to have a different value for you.
And in a organization like a military, which is a meeting where you're going to go to the head of a house, you can go to the ocean and explain good experiences.
I couldn't imagine a community that's more likely to admit a new object, because it's changing our country.
We've been in all the United States and the world, started from a medical center in the lab, Mr. Palestine, in California, in California's Chicago, at the end of the United States in the United States, and I've been in the United States, and I've got a tragedy in New York City.
For the players we're trying to talk about a window into culture, which in the situation they didn't expect to.
The military man, it's exactly the same thing.
Over the last six years I did this, I always remember a game is a lot of things.
It's full, it's actually political, it's a business, it's -- all the time you're going to find right to end.
But something is also a service.
It's not the food for me to finish my own, so, every time I can transform the autonomy industry, which is, the military, for me, again, there's nothing better than that.
Thank you.
Thank you. We're going to take a mistake out of Morma, called "I'm not in the atmosphere."
My name was a good life, and my good friend, Jossey Prize, and read the argument with Matson, who I met him just a few hours ago.
They put it together for the first time, let's see what's going on.
Johnson's Prize Matt Annson.
Thank you very much: John France: That's the middle of the night and the sky in the red red red red red air.
And if you're going to invent your eyes, maybe you can see the road of the road of a smoke and a plane that's spending the city, like you can't get to the room.
[Field] and if you look enough, you can see it on the end of a building of 87 countries.
And there, in the middle of Germany, we've found that there's still millions of children who are working for something like 100 years, where on the top of the ocean.
And I'm in the atmosphere, for all the walls.
[] I have in atmosphere and astronomers and telescopes and telescopes, like, seriously.
And everything we need is an atmosphere or an explanation or the insects, and our jihad has been disappeared.
We're going to have to have our treatment in blue blue, it's sitting on it so well, but there's this room to take it out of the same time that it's coming from behind the restaurant's journey, but it's not a big difference because I'm going to get this part of it, and everything, like
It's the outside of this blue, and it's also!
And I feel like... "Dr. Twitter."
[Field] and no one's wearing a road and represents in the atmosphere about it that it's reduced.
I'm on this that he didn't expect.
And no one is called the Amazon or a smoke.
And no one's reducing the one of the Amazon's citizens "The East Science" because we've done "."
Because they're going to be paid, and they're just staring.
And I didn't write out of fear as if, it's like a road.
So no one's afraid of you.
Because in the atmosphere doesn't want to make anybody that's.

I'm -- and I'm going to kill George.
[The night, like in the audience, I'm alone.
And I'm scared and I'm waiting like a video like... No, yes, like science.
So my galaxy is opening together because it's so long to our privilege, and this concept that comes out of our face -- it's also on me, and we have something about it -- so that no one can go.
And no one -- no one! No one.
Good.

And a woman who's one woman, ask her country, came back home from India, who's just looking for a half of the crisis in the New York Times with Pacific Pacific, and the other half of the morning on the morning four hours in the home of a woman on the streets of the street and a woman who's spending on people to do this city
A couple of buildings from the country and I found a group of trials that don't know from their lives, waiting for the country with some iPh.D., and if they didn't find on money, and they didn't find a safe and they're just safe for the black people in their hands, until they didn't get
But they don't expect me.
They don't expect to the Egyptian, with an artificial security with high states in the Egypt and the French of French French.
So they're still going to believe that we don't.
And the response of 87 countries, I'm able to hear one of the tricks says, "Get it out!" -- quickly, you'll write it, "Get it down."
And I see the media from the Mali to something out of the device, and the response of 87 minutes, I hear my job trying to take myself out of my work.
So I'm going to go to this very quickly, and I'm like the park, I'm like this: "Sydney!"
And I'm just going to get to one more important thing.
And they're like this: "Wow!
Who's the lights right now? "
"What is it there?"
"Let's give me everything you've got, and what's it?"
"Somebody heard it?"
"You don't have anything. No, really, really -- there's not even a phone!"
But then...
One of the three tricks get in the head!
And a few years, we're going to push our hands into the galaxy, but before we're going to hit something, I'm going to take a piece of fear -- from trying to China!
And a number of percent repeat at the page, but I'm also wearing in January, so I'm like this.

And all of a sudden, there's a weird device.
And one of the tricks that are left to stand up on the legs or repeat it, as if it's reducing the market in the forest, as if it's very, it's hundreds of people to the street in the street.
And the phone that's got in the head, it's going to try to look at the treatment, and the other phone, it's going to get in the kitchen, and they're going to go back to the back of the African places that's going on in the world.
And the president, the country, the country's device, represents to the ocean and the president because it's the only one that's been able to remember.
And here's me: It's still the walls of the road, a galaxy and a bridge.

And the phone that's left to stand on the legs, it's with the air -- yes, it's laughing.
And he's teaching our hands.
And it's because it's about the moon.
And it's from the point of the point between my privacy, like the rainforest and the forest is from the end of Tim.
And the state is still called the old ocean, but it doesn't work.
And one second, it looks like...
Maybe I'm going to stop.
Ah!

Don't kill me, man! "
Wow! Senry on the wall!
Hi! France! Syra is scary. "Ah!"
And he's on the floor and I'm going to move over and now I'm reducing the ocean and we're living, I'll ask them because I'm in the atmosphere.
And stars: Amazon is not suffering, we're living because we're going to take a long time ago.
But just one second, I'm just going to get this thing to talk to a language that maybe it's just one second.
William!

And the rest of us is not the media.
And we're saying it, and I'm glad and we're going to get it out there.

And it's going into a story, something that doesn't do never.
Thank you, and it's in the air, we're in the color of the summer in the summer.
And I'm a facility that I'm just going to say, "Oh, what's it like," Ah? "
And the country doesn't mean anything.
But I'm going to see in a way, we're going to go back to the room, we're going to see this.
And he says me because I can see my face, because I can see my eyes.
And something that's kind of fun from our lives, but it's not a movement.
And it's just going to be there and there, as if it's familiar with the walls of the river, as if it's familiar with his main relationship, as if he remember he's my dad.
And for a long time, I don't say anything.
And it's around, and it's on the door.
And he doesn't look at us, but I hear it from two words: "I'm sorry."
And I'm proud, and I'm opening out of the window.

In our eyes, it's a girl who's going to win the death called my daughter and Syna.
But, it's actually not really smart.
Like the Shaki Asia President Panna around me and over and over and over again, these are not just a wind.
Don't take a bad, but just the most complicated price in the village.
The world is never going, the asteroid is going to be even more convinced in my task.
This click is a lot of what I've been looking at, the alphabet, the national industrial industrial industry, and I've found my name of Alexandria's office, which has become a dream of someone who's sufficient, who's also known as the civilization of the design.
Instead, it's published in two directions, the narrative works after it's been reduced in the center of a book and fight for the bad forces.
Although the key imagination of diversity and control, my production, Magaga Britain, we could never imagine that the books would become more faster than all the times.
For five years of blue, and five minutes have been working on Democrats, a movie is going to take most of us as a sea of women and a strength.
It's just in my 50s, it's published my biggest form: our astronomy's astronomers.
At the same time, books from the buildings that will describe the medicine of astronomers and their regulation for the European culture.
While Britain was not, he was addicted from these remote stories, that we've been focused on the list of the industry than in the previous corporation.
In order to challenge them, he wrote the remote building, the story of the galaxy, a man who's going to ask, who's going to take the molecules and read astronomy.
Like you've gone from these stories, it's designing itself as a remote pair.
Everybody in my village is trying to convince me more about my talk, until I'm going to survive some of my books in my privacy.
But there's an inevitable concept.
He's born in the San Francisco, according to a new basis, and he's going to get the village in the French President.
The dog of Bittsman's blog is not another village that represents the abundance of the asteroid.
And yet, we're still going to tell the astronomers and maybe all the other buildings of the day, the story of the Syrian Britain's French Center's face life of the first places.
Dan Kenya's wired when the robot opens up, it's going to be clear.
This schools had a lot of words to read about the first modern community.
And this development of death doesn't happen in space.
At first, we're going to join London as a village that becomes a tool called Scotch.
Scott Scott is the revolution: One of the Italian aeroid of the other.
They're opening up their lives and represents to most of us because we're responsible for the first generation, and you can inspire the hundreds of images and countries.
Dan Darwin was a great success.
The results that have been published around Europe in the 20th century.
Even in America, there's the conference that's collected all the boundaries because there's the traffic of Twitter, they're going to be a political speech.
The book also got so good that we call a privilege.
After San Francisco was trying to move away from the chimpanzee, Bosnia took the game that was writing.
Now when we published together with the first way as a perfect text, our second need is where the microscope itself, just now there's a trick that's become a hero.
It's just like in the real life, a movie that's based on its own community in the world's country's death.
This unusual motivation produces philosophical complexity, when the astronomers think about the meaning of their story.
Unfortunately, a movie is dealing the privilege of the book for a little bit.
It's a decade in the night.
But my article on creative power and the ocean and inspiration to art, to the political culture, and even a political revolution.
Dan Dan Kenya argued that our imagination knows our activity, makes us be able to change, and in fact, makes us human.
Most of the people we're building still feel them -- not as memory or deep, but in particular project.
They can reduce their own patients and sometimes even feel the rest of the ideas that still or the pain of the holes of the holes.
And unfortunately, and sometimes even people who are born with bodies can feel the phanthropes.
So what do you make political news?
The point of these feelings is that we have a map of the body inside the brain.
And the fact that it's possible for somebody who's never going to have to feel with us from the possibilities that we're born at least with this map.
But one of the political biofuels that are affected by the right of the survivors: most of the resources.
In order to understand treatments and drugs, we need to change all the way out of the brain.
Our bodies are full of different neurons that are responsible to all the cases that we feel in our fingerprints and to understand where our body is in space.
And our nervous ways that I've been carrying the regulation and the sensory through the spinal and over the brain.
Because so much of this way, it's found out out of the road itself, most of the subject that I've just left.
But I don't understand the way the reality goes through every step of the way.
In a small website, dozens of bits can work and become more sensitive, make it even stress in the response to the stress.
At the top of normal reasons, these letters are reduced in the virtuous building in the spinal cord.
The reasons we don't really understand, after intuition, there's a difference between this transformation in the viruses, and that letter can be overcome.
Once they're going to go in the spinal cord, the infrastructure that two come to the brain.
There, the virtual virus that I've been working with.
All the body's beautiful in this virus.
Babbage is sensitive with a lot of nervous groups, like the language and the universe, represent by the biggest regions.
The New York City California is a model of the human body with a professor that's based on the size of every blog in the body as it's exposed in the virus, like the Democratch that's been able to share some body in the middle of the brain can grow on a couple of the brain and the brain and the body's brain
For instance, the creation of the big questions in skills than people who don't respond to the ball.
The brain also is also a normal biologist when a body is affected to reduce the news that's known about.
This man's leadership can lead to parasites.
The democracy is probably responsible for a sense of a body that doesn't find more, because they're still represent in the brain.
Over the time, these creatures can predict the treatment of the treatment can also predict them.
But sensors are not necessarily necessary for themselves.
Technologists in a general way that requires a combination of physics, drugs for pain, culture, and time.
A method called a piece of platform, and it can be very efficient in the cortex and the walls and the pain in in the face.
The patient there's the treatment in the box behind and shows the perfect body.
It's a case in the brain to see the treatments instead of just feel it.
Scientists are developing politicians from the reality that make the experience of the medicine and even more reality.
The patterns can also create effective -- a lot of soldiers live on the city in the city when they're looking at the letter in the night.
And treatments may have helped patients to imagine the patterns of their bodies and make them intuitive.
There's still a lot of questions about phanthropes.
We don't know why a few pounds don't feel like a pain in in which it's all going to be used to make these treatments, or why don't there's no treatment at all.
And another study for political treatments for people who live with them.
The deeper understanding of these activity can be built to work that our brains do today to build the world as we stop it.
They're a important privilege that the reality that we live, is actually a good basis.
Let's start with ourselves.
This picture came to my mom, John.
This is my dad, France, in the center.
And for my brothers and my sister: Mr. Robin, Januan, San.
John France is sitting in his life like this.
And in the blue skin in Californian, OK.
I loved a big family.
And one of my favorite things was to choose.
But when I have a number of seven, it's almost seven of the Egyptians.
Here's something very long before we've learned to end on January France.
Everything in the audience knows the emotion and emotions in the room there for a new baby.
And I've been excited that I've been happy to help to believe in this special category.
But not everywhere it's that way.
I went a lot and I saw a lot.
But I've been surprised to learn that in part of the Panada, the parents are doing something in a new room for a month.
Why do we do?
Why don't we reduce this basic moment?
Well, they're changing because they're scared.
They're afraid of two days and death.
And the building would be a little bit more suffering there.
Fields without there can help feel a little less connection.
So in one part of the world, a moment of happy, emotions, emotions, part of the future of the child's future, the parents are full of insects, don '
How can it be?
How can it be that 2.6 million babies die around the world before they get to a new age?
Five million.
This is my population.
And the most exciting thing is: Why?
More than teachers, we just don't know.
I remember I saw a very interesting graph.
I'd say, "Social to support children under the age of five around the world."
And there's a big printer, over 40 percent that you're going to call "children."
Now, "kids" This is not the end of the death.
And kids are just a theory, a theory that means that the baby was less than a month.
For us "children" meaning "we don't have access."
Now, I'm scientists, I'm a doctor.
I want to fix things.
But you can't imagine what you can't say.
And so our first step to enable these parents and be to answer the question: Why are the babies die?
And so I want to talk about a new approach that I feel that I don't just help me know why the babies die, but also start to change all of the field of public health.
It's called "The Soviet Foundation."
For more time than countries, it's a very special sense.
I started as a cancer doctor -- I'm a biologist.
I've been interested in the way I wanted to make people feel better.
But often the politicians made them feel worse.
I remember young women who were going to go to the clinic by their fathers -- adults who were going to help in the real room.
They were so important because of the treatment I gave them.
But at the time, we built the war and cancer and we had a little bit of tools.
And the tools that we were on our liberty can't look at a video cell, where we wanted to get to the healthy cells that we wanted to keep.
And so, you're going to take a video that everyone knows -- there's a forest, in the hospital, and because the Chinese system is how it's a place where it's not always a picture in the environment.
And then I went to the technology industry.
And I started working on a new approach to treatment cancer that could do a better job in the health and healthcare from the patients or the movies.
It's a solution called San Francisco.
And what the trillion allows us to do is to make a difference between the CE2 and the most important kind of cancer cancer, at the time.
This baby can allow us to meet in the cancer or more interesting to the normal cells.
It's a little bit of a big way.
It feels like a concept so that we're using all these tools -- big data, and a cartoon needs, a huge genome -- to get a space of disease.
It allows us to treat people in the right medicine at the right time.
The drugs are made by a young revolution of cancer revolution.
Everything changed.
And I want the whole tool again.
So I asked myself: Why do we have to react these warriors, these countries more to know disease for the rich world?
Now, don '
I'm talking about beyond a very special direction of health problems in the population.
Well, okay, you're probably thinking, "It's a proud.
You can't do that, it's my father and my mother. "
But here's the point: We're already doing it in a limited way, and it's already beginning to do a big change.
So this is what happens.
I've told you that I've been living on cancer.
But like a lot of doctors, a lot of doctors, who have learned in San Francisco in the '80s and also sell the AIDS.
It was time called.
I'm going to be a real regulation.
All my hospital comes.
Now the situation has improved but HIV is not going to stay for somebody.
In the world of all, because 17 million women and HIV.
We know that when these women go into the direction, they can transform the virus into the London.
We also know that, in the city of political city, half of these babies don't survive two years.
But we also know that political treatment can actually make sure it doesn't help the virus of hope.
So what do we do?
Well, the "one drug is coming out of all," Bonna "and what's going to represent in a therapy, means that we've been looking at the world's world's population.
It did the work.
But it doesn't do.
So instead, we're focusing on the regions where the HIV are the highest.
We know some countries in Africa are teaching the training that we can build and treat the rich women, where the city are the highest.
This particular approach to public health has been out in the HIV of the last five years.
Thank you very much in some cases in the developing world is an example of how public medicine can change things, big.
So.
How do you do that?
We can do it because we know.
And you know, you know, we know why to go to the direction and how to go.
And for me, I think, the important components of public health: who, what, where is how.
So let's go back to 2006 million minutes before they're building a month.
And here's the problem: We just don't know.
It may seem unbelievable, but the way to understand the microbes in these countries, where they're going to happen is by a conversation with whether they're.
An health workers ask the mother, who now lost the baby "Would the baby be?"
It can be that the conversation is even three months after we've changed.
Now you put yourself on the shoes of the Amazon.
It's an invisible conversation.
And even worse -- it doesn't help, to be able to do that life is it, but we don't even know why.
So in this city, we can't help Abraham, a family or other families in this country to avoid the goal.
But what if we're there a approach of public health care?
Let's say, for example, in some cases in Africa that are different from the Internet that's gone from our baby, which is called Australian and a group.
In a political city, there's a big risk for seven times to lose the next point.
Once we've defined the problem, we can prevent this places with something just safe like polio.
We can do it because we know.
And that's the point: Once you know, you can bring the right intervention to people in the right place.
In this approach, we've been looking at these interventions, and we don't have enough access to public health can help us get the 15 years.
And it also requires the success of a million babies every year.
A million babies every year.
And why do we stop there?
A much powerful approach to public health -- and imagine what can be possible.
Why don '
Why don't we prevent a hot cancer in women?
And why don't we forget the malaria?
Thank you very much! Yes, you're looking for it!
Thank you. I'm living in two different places, one world is very training in scientists, and a world is very different in terms of the public health.
It's access to public health and promise to one of the world's world's two.
But, you know, we're all living in two world: the world's rich world.
And what's most exciting to me in the early approach is a component between these two world's world.
In the rich world, every day, we use a device and everywhere -- every thing we have -- to make a difference in terms of disease in ways that we don't have possibilities.
Let's make sure that we can use these survivors and all of these tools to prevent the world's world's world.
If we're going to do so well, we can be safe and give our baby there at the moment, we're going to get to the parts of the baby's baby's baby's baby's baby in 10 years, and not the water.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, well.
Some of you are sure that my family is James.
So that's okay, and I've been thinking to yourself how an artist was able to get to war.
In fact, the professionals were born with a school school school, and I got a unique experience to work with UCEEECEED in the CEO of the wars, which was different to one.
You see, I had to pay this virus because in case the DNA has to have to train our face, I'm going to go out.
After all, I went to one of the most dangerous regions in the world.
So now some of you are asking themselves, and I want to safe you, that I've got a half of the money.
And so you see, this is how -- with 50 cents in the classroom, I found myself in the city in Iraq, which is in Syria.
The journalists call it "the local city."
And they're called the local city because 300 thousand people lost their lives -- 300 thousand people, most of them as a result of governments, or disease.
I was a part of the team that we had to try to find the best way to respond to this local Twitter.
It was really recently after the United States of the past, as the Syria started to say.
Unfortunately, organizations have been going to have to protect their doors.
And the question I asked me, I'd let me go to the problems about it, this is a question that's going to try and ask themselves in the area of the world: What's the hell doing now?
You know, the security environment in the currency of the current time -- there's nothing that's really changed too much -- the right to describe it as "music with the" President "Please."
I remember in a chapter that a few days after I went to the wheelchair.
There were some decades of women who were going to be like, and they're going to get their children very close.
About 20 minutes, a conversation with one of the young women who I've been trying to put my fingerprint in her face of her baby's baby.
When I did that, I found that the babies were already hard for a moment.
She was hard, and she was a little little bit of her life, she'd be falling inside itself.
It's going to make a few hours of music and the baby in the year.
I've later discovered that I've been in a way that her baby's baby's baby's baby's baby's baby's baby's baby's baby, and they're trying to find a money and money, money that I &ap
And that's the picture I've been able to live around the world.
But they're where they're going to be killed with a mathematician.
Is it just the way the world works?
And there's a genius that the war is an inevitable human being.
After all, it's not since the world.
We're saying, "We're never going to say," Well, that's what happens again -- again, again.
But I'm going to tell you that I've seen the space of what we're, human beings, can do one another, and I still believe that can be another.
Do you want to know why?
Because for 20 years, I've been doing this work, and I've come out since I've come to live around the world, I've come to realize that there's a team of this problem that we're all thinking about this common space, that we can change -- not in the middle of the blue, but by just by looking at all the possibilities of
How is it possible?
I want you to ask this: There's at least 800 million women to live in the world today.
Most of the spaces of citizens, like this little baby, which is in the area of the world around the world, die in the universe of different groups that have been based on the collection of almost all kinds of tricks that are cheap, children are effective to engineering, not to reduce these citizens in all of the opportunities.
How big is it?
In some places in the world, you can buy an A47 dollars for 10 dollars.
In many places where I've been working, it's easier to get access to an intuition than to get access to the two hands.
Now part of the important part: Can you do something between?
To answer the question, let's take a look at the map of the world.
And now we've been training all the countries that we've forgotten in the war, and the number of people I've come from, people who're going to find out as a result of violence.
It's a reminder -- more than 40 million people.
But you can see something in this map.
And it's that most of these countries are three countries.
Now, let's take a look at the top 20 countries in the world.
And what do we see?
We see them in New York.
You can see that most of the developing countries, in the city of Western countries.
What does that tell us?
It means that most people who are dealing in experts in poor countries, and despite that, most people who are living from wars in decades -- people like you.
And what if you're for a moment beyond the camera and the kids.
What if we look at all the way that we know in the world?
Why does the most business?
So about 80 percent of the Egyptians come full of other societies in the security of the United States, in addition of Germany.
It's amazing, not?
Now some of you will say that it's true to a specific time, "Yes, you're sure, but you'll wait for a moment."
And the school was amazing in my eyes.
It was really an engineering experience.
But you're probably saying to yourself, you know, all of these women in the region -- they don't make, but the result of the violence that's built every day.
You know, places like Iraq and Afghanistan, where they need all these women to keep a professor, to spread peace and security, to fight in the Internet -- of course it's a good thing.
Let's look at this conversation for one moment, because, you understand, here's a training in the middle of the children since the beginning of the Western War.
In fact, it's a business that's used to wear ourselves over the last 15 years.
And now let's change this for the number of people who are being dealing from matters around the world at the same time.
What do you see?
So in fact, you see that it's also working between three and four years ago.
They're actually going to go around the same point.
We can manage an infinite argument if the cost of the victims is a response to it in the cameras every year, or to make it.
But that's what we really need to understand from that.
What we need to understand is that it's a relationship that's different to exploration, especially when we're living in a thought that every child who's sent to Iraq, to use Iraq, to those who are called "Canada," for some of these women's physics, many of all these women are now working on
And here's the dog.
Because, you understand, every two children everywhere today are not everywhere, because their first animal is also the last.
The results on war, no person, about 249 dollars -- 29 dollars per person, which are about 12 times what we're doing outside, money that's going to be able to fight children and fight in the world's world's world's world's country.
We can change this food.
How do you do that?
In fact, it's a problem of the young people, so we can deal with it in two powerful hours.
In the young way, we can activate stress on our governments and effort and courageous partners in the way to live in a way like the training art, that's more likely to have rich countries where they're going to go.
Here, in the United States, there's the biggest reality in the world, the president of what they're in, on the side of the road, but nothing is affected, until it's not very close by the Syrian.
That's where we need to hear our voice.
You know, it's the basis of every year -- it's not going to solve the warming problems.
Mugly Guinea's surgeon doesn't solve this problem.
But it's a very important step in the right direction.
And it's in our responsibility, the people living in the rich countries, bring here to change.
And what about the building side?
You know, it's just that water around the world reduce life in wars.
You can take the violence in the middle of the investment in education, in the experience of life in economic development, especially for women.
I've seen in science and some nervous objects like this can be all over the world.
But there's one thing: they're required for a while, what means for you, if you want to give, please do it, in all of the world's going to change you.
But we knew that the way you're going to replace not less than how you're dead.
Social drugs, once a month for example, they're a lot more efficient way to travel because they're enable to design the local organizations to invest in the long way, and to be part of the families of families that are affected from governments, wars that actually have a lot of warriors in the world that's very fast.
When I sat on the airplane to a young village, I had no idea what it means to live under war.
But today I can say I know what it means.
And I know what it means to be paid in the bed at night and listen to the horrible sound.
A very, very intuitive theory, and you're going to be at the same level of a few minutes and know that it's going to come to me.
I can tell you that it's less lucky and moral, fear that millions of people around the world have to deal with information every day, especially children.
Over the years that I've been doing this work, unfortunately, the war has made a lot of people who are most likely to.
And in the cases of war almost felt me.
But I believe all of us, and that's why I don't know what I do every day what I do, we can choose another.
Because, you understand, the war is our war as human beings.
We don't know, familiar, exhibits and put it.
So, not getting on the mind that we can't solve it.
And the opposite is, we're the only ones that can.
Thank you very much, I'll get you a lot of success.
Thank you.
Eric Robert: I'm sure you've got to say, but the TED audience is a global, and it's a diversity, so it's going to open with our lives, and that's when we're going to get it all 18 minutes.
So it's about 93 years in 93 seconds and control.
I've been born in the New York City...
DP: Nico, Nico, Vietnam.
Audience: Nico, Nico, Tikott.
[DL: We went to seven seconds.
Audience: Oh, her physician.
I've been born in New York City, and I've been born in New York.
My father was everything -- now I was.
He took a prison when I was nine years old.
I've been looking at 52 animals like Congress in the last century.
I went back to... "LL: I'd survive.
I came to Los Angeles to succeed in California, start in the privacy and one in TV.
You didn '
Your device, your choice, was in a little plan called "Everything left in the family."
After a series of patients who are doing today, they don't have insects in Canada: "My story," "the good life," "" "" "" "" "" ""
Not only in terms of all of them...
Throughout of your car, there's been when you've been between the 10 professionals in the head.
At some point, I went into 120 million people in the week, you've been watching your car.
It's more than the audience's audience told 50, "There's one value to a year.
CA: I'm my father.
I wouldn't be like, "Oh, and we didn't get to the part of the" I'm my father. "
And I was able to get into the boss of Richard Richard Richard -- I had a list like this.
It's also coming to me as well.
Thank you for the whole community of TV are already working in the experiment.
One in the movies.
"Time" Time "" "" "" "" "" "" "" The Soviet Street, "" "" I '
But again, we've been courageous.
And then I started reducing, in a set of years as a politician, responding to the first experience for the solution between the country.
I've tried "The people for the American way."
And I've made the self-esteem, and I've come back to it with, and I've also been active in New York as well as in politics.
The feedback to 93, and then I wrote a film and I was interested on a education story.
And after all of this, the end of the end you're ready to get to TED.
I won't get it here.
And I'm on you, about the training to do this.
Audience: Thank you.
So here's the first questions.
Would you make your hand?
[DL: Oh, my mother.
What it's a place to start.
I mean, when I went back from the war, he showed me the letters that I wrote from CEO, and they were completely love.
And that's actually described my mom.
They were love and love, as if I wrote them... They were love.
After a year, I asked them very, because I wanted to create them for the rest of my life...
He returned them.
And that's my mom.
But the best I can agree this in the last few years -- it's also happened in the last few years -- just a few years ago, when we tried the whole community to remember.
It was in the U.N., when I got a conversation from using the TV of the art and scientists.
It's the connection to me to tell me that everybody will meet before and it tell me that they're trying to be the people.
I started to say, "Richard Richard," as Richard Richard Richard Richard -- "Oh, I don't think it was their list.
CA: William California, who's finished San Francisco, who's trying to finished Asburgh, who's finished the Arix, or Robert School, and I think, the best TV ever in TV -- Millibert, Lillie Billie.
Audience: No bad.
CA: I made a local interview, in the Porto School.
"My mom, you'll hear what happens, institutions had a community."
And he says, "Well, if that's what they're going to do, who is I'm going to Western?"
I mean, that's my mom.
I think it's actually funny to every single one that's going to have a very depression.
["OK: And this is how we had the situations on the Amazon.
And your dad also doesn't always matter in your life, especially in my city.
CA: Yeah.
Audience: Let me tell us what happened when I was 9 years old.
CA: He's an infinite trick with three studies, which I'm saying, "I don't want people to survive them." I don't try them. "
And then I heard, maybe not for the first time: "Look, John. I'm going."
And he went.
It turns out it turns out that it's a wireless statement, and we're going to take all over the country to sell them.
But the fact that it's in the airplane that it's in the airplane to the nation, and it's led to me as a big city, like a Darwin, it's my favorite building.
It was a couple of years after Neanderthal killed the Atlantic.
It was a weird, that Babylan was there.
But when he came back, he returned it once and just from the airplane.
At the same West, the house was full of the data, which I saw my father when he sat down his face, and he then got to the police.
And I'm familiar with the students because we're going to go from something -- she didn't want to stay there, in Charles School.
And when she sees the little -- the house was full of people.
And in the middle of all this, what I'm looking at under the privilege and I'm going to take my hand on my hand and say, "Wow, now you're the man at home."
I'm in this intuition says, "Now you're the man at home."
And I think that at that moment, I started to understand the possibilities in the human situation.
So...
Just after a lot of years I looked back and I felt like this was a positive side.
But -- "Oh," Oh, you're still seeing it something together.
CA: We have to have that sense, which was for a device.
I was able to think about how simple I just tell me is the 19th century: "Now you're the man at home."
And I'm just going to wait, and then he says, "The man in the house doesn't work."
And I...
So...
In the back of the room, I think I've learned that I've learned to see the techniques in the human situation, and that was the hope that I've used.
Audience: So you have a great father, you have a mom that probably nothing good enough for me.
You're going to see that your beginning all of us, maybe you're never thinking that you're going to have a journey or you've become a journey that has 120 million people?
CA: It's going to find out how I've been talking about the question, because I think all my life wanted -- if I wanted something, it was listening to me.
I think -- the simple answer, yes, it was what the team -- well, there were other things.
When my father wasn't at home, I've been living with an example of my car, and I realized that there was a device that turned out to be the Abrahan't.
But yes, somebody laughed.
But it's not funny, because it was an intuitive -- one more intuitive -- that opens the development of the New York City, "Lord Talk's today.
The first time I was looking at this world is people who hate me because I was born and the universe.
And there was a huge impact on my life.
Audience: So you'd have a baby with a little bit of men to live, outside your journey.
We're going to tell us about it.
CA: Oh, my grandmother.
Well, so I always talked about my grandmother.
Here's bad, when I was a kid, we've made a lot of cameras.
Here's a restaurant workers -- we didn't exist "The House."
Here's the communities of Abraham Berlin's communities, and the communities of Jorgan and the Google Washington...
And a lot of small cameras.
I'd take it there, and we'd know about the streets of the street, it would be part of us, and when I saw a look at me in the eye.
And he was very important to me.
He was a feedback to the United States.
Each letter opens up in the words: "New York, you don't have a great device," and it's going to say something about something that's going to do.
But also when you didn't agree with the president, then you wrote, "New York, you don't have the wall," Don't I told you for a week... "
And I've been a dancer and I've ever been talking to the stairs and another thing.
We've lived in the third level, on the street of 24, in the New York City, in New York City.
I've ever seen a little bit about it: "Shhhhhhhhhhha's" Sha's "in my daughter."
And that's the story that I've been told about -- "Oh, we've come back to answers about the plastic --" CA: Tell me back.
But I'm aware of what a movie -- if we go back to California and others before us, there's decades that I've told it.
That's the second time he says that the story is a poem.
The truth was that I'm going to take it to the cameras, there's a lot of cameras.
It's true that it's about life.
It's the truth that it's written too much as a letter, and I've gathered the little platform.
But "New York, there's no green device," and all the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the web, all that I've been a good friend who'd write the same letters.
I mean, I grew my grandmother's grandmother's grandmother and became my own.
More.
When I started writing my memories -- even this -- what would you say about it?
I even got it to live.
When I started to write my memories and I started thinking about it, and then I -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm not going to know how much I would need my father.
I've been going to write my grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's environment.
And so the word "Dad" -- I have six children, by the way.
The most profound role in life.
And that's, and it's easy to be my wife, London.
But I grew it because I needed my dad.
I'm a lot of unfortunate I've come out of it, and I'm trying to love -- the best thing I'm -- the word that I think about is -- he's got.
The fact that it's a list, it's just what's going to go to the prison...
I'm looking at all of this in the word "Good."
Audience: You say that you've got these questions, and you're great professionals.
CA: I'm a scientist.
Audience: You're a scientist.
And that means that it's a fixed by "to John, but it turns out that it's responding it from" Alice.
So you're in a good society.
I want to talk about you.
I've already wrote about your work and I'm sure that every education has heard about it: the meaning for people, for our culture, I've heard the privilege of as I want the TV programs, I've discovered a half of your work.
But would it ever be a story about the effect of your work that will affect you?
CA: Oh my God -- I've been surprised with us that's scared me from the head of my head.
Last year, there was "Western Western Dr. Robert" that I'm worried by a beautiful American organization, I'm going to believe in the nation.
The message of "West with..."
Here's: What if we were 92 -- I was then 92 -- and the beautiful world?
Robert Mexico was one of the seven that was on the stage.
And when he's talking about the TV plan, he's not talking about the California, on Johnson's "Franksin," or on the plan that was in the average place.
He's talking about a simple thing that's affected -- "Oh, a big impact on me?
CA: We've affected me -- I'm from the basis to use the word "different."
It's hard to get on the mind that I've changed my life of somebody, but that's how it got it.
He's going to see George Jason just there's a disease where the family's family's family 'family's family' family 'family' family's family, and he's never know that a black man can see that a black man can see the disease.
And he said it's so affected our lives -- that's changed our lives.
And when we hear this -- small things -- because it's obvious to me that there's no one in the audience that I'm responsible for some kind of thing that's done for someone, even if it's something active like "Oh" Oh, "" "peak"
Maybe the note in the website is that it's been reduced by the disease on the table, and Jorgan wasn't what to do when the disease is, so it's called the disease, we don't have access.
But -- "OK: So in addition to the long list I wanted in the beginning, I also had to expect that you invented the beautiful.
[DP: Well...
Audience: I want to talk about... "CA: So you'll do it.
[]] ": You're going to live full of leaders, but also a life of meaning.
And we're all going to change -- we're not all successful.
But it's also us that we're able to do the two things, often know how to do their change together.
You're able to manage the culture through your art, and you're also going to have a world of success.
How do you do the two things?
CA: That's what's going to know when you're going to learn all the sense.
This planet is one of a billion, so I've heard, in a day where there's billions -- Malardo, Malardo.
We're trying to save that we need to save.
But...
Everything that I've got is -- I'm going to ask him what to do about something that's happening in New York Times.
I said, "You're going to look at your team in the city, for the head of the city or something like this."
And she said, "But I'm not a regular, but I'm not a virus."
And that was the first time I said this, "Deller, with everything you think about what I did," and everything I did, "-- he never came out of Washington --" Can you get enough of the Gabby "" when you're going to take the size of the planet, "and I said,"
So...
I'm convinced that we're all responsible to achieve as my own.
And I realize you're saying -- "Oh, we're a very sophisticated patient -- and" CA: But you've got to think about this beautiful size of the medical project.
Audience: But here, on this planet has been a real thinking.
DP: I had lucky lucky.
So, "OK: So there's another question.
How do you feel?
CA: I'm a big blog of all I'm going to replace it.
Audience: So I feel 93.
[]] CA: Smith?
Audience: Well, I feel 93, but I hope that one year has a young organization like the iPhone I'm sitting in a model.
Ladies and gentlemen, Dereman's great for everyone.
Applause) DP: Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm aware of it that's happening to create images that tell stories.
Cities can be a long way to a moment in New York City within some time.
Each moment, I'm always going to represent a new printing of our memories when time comes.
But what if you can transform more than one moment in the side?
What if you're going to actually put the time, take the best moments of peace and have one experience into a photograph?
I created a idea called "Today" and I believe it's going to change the way you look at the world.
I know it's going to do it for me.
Our process begins with intuitive words, places that they're part of what I call our best memory.
I took a country and a movement and I never mentioned.
I've learned the streets of human beings and the light when the time goes.
Cities at the time of 15 to 30 hours and our creatures more than 1,500 images, so I choose the best moments of today's night.
In using time like a wall, I'm talking to the best moments to one picture, from what's going to identify our inevitable journey in time.
I can take you back and see the cartoon.
And I can show you the markets in the morning through the China.
And at the same time, I can show you this electronic region.
And in their hands, I can show you the democracy of the light city.
I'm basically a street street from 15 meters in the air, and everything that if you see in this side actually happened in the same day.
Today it's a global project, and my work is always going to explain.
I'm magic from the idea of going to a place like a team and actually see it over a few weeks.
And I decided I wanted to see the history, a event that actually happened since 148.
The secrets were looking at us as they saw then.
And an important artist that I really want you to understand is this: It's not a tremendous amount of time, it's I'm sorry during the night.
I'm going to collect a month of two experiments.
And the thing that's going to prevent me is the fear of one of them.
All the idea came in 1996.
The LIFFFO invited me to create a beautiful picture of the participants and the team of the film and the film is very, very easy in the L.D.
I came to my grandmother and I realized: It's remember.
So the only way I could create Portuga was to take a 250 images in the universe.
So I've had the New York City and New York Times.
And when I invited the camera to imagine, I realized that there was a mirror on the wall and I saw that they actually changed.
And I didn't have a moment, this building picture I asked them, "You're going to just have this picture?"
And then I went back to my student in New York, and I lost these 250 images together and I said, "Wow, that's so cool!
I change the time on the side. "
And this quote actually remained me for 13 years until the technology to end my dreams.
It's a picture that's made of a modern story, a day without night.
And I'm going to show you a video that gives you a idea of how it is to be when I find these images.
At the beginning, you need to understand that we all get bees like this, the most of our time I'm going to come up, and I'm in a general way or on the face.
So it's a typical day, 12-hour hours in the galaxy to put all the day out of the wheelchair.
One of the things that I like to look at people.
And believe me when I tell you, it's the best chair in home.
But it's really how I create these images.
So once I'm deciding about our exhibitions, I need to decide where today starts to go.
And that's what I call for the time.
I'm a satellite of time as an artist.
Think about the surface of Palestinia: it's interested with the pain.
I'm also seeing the time as an artist, just that I'm going to take the organization from the surgeon and put it into a microphone.
One of the only faces of this work is also, if you look at all my images, and it's time changing: sometimes I'm going to move from the left, sometimes a nation back, down, down, down, down, down, even in Asia.
I'm exploring the space of time inside the local picture.
Now when I take these images, it's a molecule like a 3D printer that's happening in my brain.
I'm building a picture based on time, and that's what I call the first patterns.
It can take us a few months to peace.
The wisdom in this work is that we have zero control and I get there everywhere and make the images.
So I'm never going to know who was in the picture, if it was a great laser or a great investment -- no control.
It's at the end of the process, if the kids were really successful and the rest of the same thing, that I can decide in the face and outside, and it's all based on time.
I'm going to take the best moments that I'm going to choose for months and they're involved without the asteroid.
I'm going to treat the night as I've seen them, we've created the only country between these two studies.
It's always going to have a really meaningful impact in our work that I've always been a big analogy of Albert Bertie, a painting of the great China.
It inspired me for a series that I did in the National Foundation.
It's a project of Britain.
So that's the picture I've created in Mexico.
It's actually a story of the Gullin of 2016 that's three pounds of geographic.
I took over 30 hours in this picture.
I was really on the side of the side, to put the stars and the moon when it comes to, the ice light that leaves a little bit.
And I also went to the lab of time on the surface.
The best part is, of course, to see the basic moments of humanity when it's changing -- a place for the night.
And in the humanity, I had the future of the painting in the morning.
And when the sun started to get in the deep, I started really excited about the emotions because I looked at the painting and I said, "Oh my God, I'm getting the same theory of Bertie that was 100 years ago."
Today, I'm going to touch all the things, it's like a function of all the things I like about the species of the creatures.
It's about the surface of the surface, it's about a street side, it's about the color, it's about the color, it's about the architecture, it's about architecture, and it's about politics, and it's about democracy.
It's one of the most stupid moments I'd be able to expect, the seven years of healthcare in 2013.
And if you're looking very close in the picture, you can actually see the time in these big television.
You can see the name of a wave with the kids, the president on the ground now, he's hanging, and now he's talking to the audience.
There's so much more challenges from challenges when I create images like this.
This particular photograph, I was on a number of numbers in 15 meters in the air and it wasn't really design.
So whenever our help is entrepreneurship, our iPhone.
So on every picture that you see, there's about 1,800 images in this picture, that we've got to build our legs everywhere we've been exposed.
But I learned so many things were coming out of this work.
I think the most important ones are suffering and power.
When you find a city like New York City from the top, I discovered that these people in the car that I'm kind of living with them every day, they don't look like people in more cars.
They feel like being poor, it was a kind of behavior in the future.
And when people describe the energy of New York, I think the picture really starts to transform it.
When you look very much about my work, you can see there are stories happening.
You understand that Times Tony's Canada, her sound and her light.
So I decided, in this picture, I'm going to share the time.
So where the sound is, it's easy to be where the sun is actually today.
It's a amazing thing that we're never able to understand.
But in a very special way, I believe these images are starting to put in time.
They're able to find us a new metaphor.
When you spend 15 hours of looking at water, you'll see things a little different than if you're going to go with our camera and take a picture, and then you go.
It was a great example.
I call it "Speak". "
I've been looking for 15 hours all of these people, even looking at a career.
They've been more interested in the usual use.
They're going to come, they're going to take a picture, and then go.
And I think it's an example that's a really important example of what we think human experience is a model of what human experience becomes.
The action of the year's action suddenly became more important than the experience itself.
Thank you, and finally, my car picture, which has so special to human beings: this is the National Foundation of TV.
And it's a painting in the middle of the history, it's not a teacher.
I went to especially during the year's president to write the biggest diversity of animals.
Unfortunately, when we got there, there was a form that happened in the India, in the form of five weeks.
So all the animals go.
I grew up in one morning, and I felt that if everything was left as it came from, I had a real opportunity to go something together.
We've spent three days without my own place, and nothing could do with me why I've seen during the hospital.
I took over 26 hours in Congress and Netherlands in six feet.
What I've watched was unable to describe.
Actually, it was true.
We've seen for 26 hours, all of these warriors are taking a single resources called water.
The same resources that human beings are supposed to fight for the next 50 years.
The farmers didn't even get one on the other.
They look like we realized something we're the people who don't.
This crisis called water is something that we all need to share.
When I made this picture, I realized that women to the night is really a new way to see, a time, a space of time, the space that's time inside the creatures.
When technology opens together with the creatures, students don't just survive more than a memory time, but they're a new robot of stories that didn't stop, and we've created a part of our world.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What do the French do better than each other?
If you do a story, the first three answers can be: love, Washington.
And maybe.
But let me offer a lot of problems: math.
Do you know that in France has more mathematicians than any other city in the world?
It's also more streets with mathematicians.
And if you look at the statistics of philosophical molecules, that sometimes it's often called the limitation of math, and there's always scientists under the age of 40, you'll find that French has more pollution of political molecules for the number of weeks than any other country.
What is it that we find so basic in mathematics?
After all, it seemed to be a spread, just a few new numbers that need to be there.
Mata is maybe spread, but it doesn't change it's not about sensors.
It's about our business activity.
It's about imagination, the connection that we're most of the words.
It's about to find the truth.
There's not like the feeling that I've been able to change so when you're months of a very successful thought, you're finally trying to understand the right thing to your problem.
The math is not a big, and we're going to buy it -- seriously -- to get countries.
But there's this feeling that this feeling can stay for hours, or even water.
The wheelchair can be big.
The art of mathematicians are looking at disease all of our physical world.
They don't make our sensors, but you can see them through mathematics.
Go your eyes for a moment and think what's going on right now is around you.
Some of the invisible parts of the air around you when you're coming in billions of billions of years every year, all of this is in a space.
And yet, their statistics will be able to live in a place with math physics.
We'll open your eyes now to the statistics of these dances.
The famous prototype of gas, we're the mistakes -- of statistics with the average behavior.
This task tells you about the statistics of the mastery of the windows in the same way the Germans will tell you about the statistics of privacy.
It's one of the most important problems ever.
It's going to happen again and again, many theories and many experiments, because of the universal examples that it's so happening to us from mathematicians.
On this task, the famous magazine Franklin said, "The Indians were trying to be if they would know it.
It's the interest of the code and the beetle. "
And there's no better way to give this shadow than "Laten". "
In this process, there's a series of products that are small and small plants and patients in a random way, entrepreneurship or the left, or those who are right.
That's all in the invisible instructions.
Let's see what's going on when we're looking at all these hormones together.
So this is a little bit about doing a sport, because we need to solve some injuries there in the face.
Ah.
We think that Iranians are going to do a regulation on the stage.
Here's this.
These are the cost of the code and the code.
Again, I've found here in the second box, as part of "The Lox."
For you, I've seen it, but my students I explain why it can't be another thing.
And it's about these curiosity of this one, you're spending a shock of teachers and here in the environment.
All science is this.
And the crazy things are not just our community.
They also change our view of the world.
For instance, Einstein, Franklin, Milliam, they used mathematicians' mathematicians's mathematicians's mathematicians' work and as a gas is going to explain to us to prove that our world's world's world's world's complexity.
It wasn't the first time that mathematics made our revolution on the world.
More than 2,000 years ago, at the time of the future, it's already happened.
In those days, just a little bit of the world's room, and the Earth would look infinite.
But Atlantic was built, with math, we managed to measure the Earth with two percent.
Here's another example.
In 163, that's just the guy who's smoking a little bit more than in February.
On this slide, it's a nice mathematical mathematics, and the Chinese task on the Earth is really a little bit good good good at 0.3 percent -- so a little bit that no one's attention to it in the real face of the Earth.
These stories show that mathematics allows us to get out of our intuition, to learn the Earth that looks not a story, to see artists that they're invisible or to understand uncomfortable.
And if there's only one thing that you need to take from this talk, it's this: mathematics enabled us to go beyond our interactions to the electrodes that don't fit into our perception.
Here's an example of microbes that you're all going to connect to: to the Internet.
The global Internet network, more than a billion Internet -- do you want to work on everyone?
It's a very important power that's going to help, but it's been a very inevitable independence to find the information in the data.
Let's work on a small problem.
Imagine you're alone that you're working on a critical teacher, and there's a lot of people who have their graph of the workers.
Who are you saying data?
The big answer: first eyes.
You see, there's a number of people in a week, tell you a story, but when you ask where it gets it, it's going on on a third person like a generation.
And maybe a number of years, as a situation is about one person as the first generation.
Now one person's number one is our head, so I don't really want to see it -- another.
And the graph we see that the number four is our head.
And maybe I don't even want to see it first, because there's more people who exist.
All right, it was easy, but now, what if you have a big group of people who are interested?
And this graph, I might think about it as the people who are interested in a particular crisis, but it can be the same politician that's designed for each other, because it's for you today.
What are the most amazing?
Not so clear.
You're going to go into the beautiful virus, one of the local corporations of Google.
The algorithms use mathematics of math for intuitive information and the most relevant Internet, the same way we use in the Iranian experiences.
So let's send into this graph and a group of small digital digital and let them go from words through the graph.
Every time they get to a website, they've gone through some direction that's going to choose in the next website.
And again, again, there's again.
And with small foreign cities, we're leaving the list of a few times every website on these digital technologies.
Here we start.
Iranians, Iraq.
And every time, let's do a very invisible function to make the wind.
And look at this: from the President Canada and the solution.
The highest cities are focused on these websites that are when they're better for others, more cars than others.
And here we're seeing in the morning or the Internet we want to try data.
Again, the solution is out of the random.
Of course, since that time, Google opens a lot of algorithms in a lot, but it's already here.
And yet, just one problem from a million.
With the digital age of the digital age, more problems that die themselves from mathematicians, and become the work of mathematicians more use, in a situation where a few years ago, it's a first place between hundreds of work in the best work of work in Congress' work in 2009.
mathematicians -- the best work in the world.
It's her presidents: the communication theory, the scientific theory, the game theory, a new new theory, learning and graphic, and we're going to live.
And why don '
Each of these plants have two industrial industries.
And by the way, there's a big money in math.
And let me hope that when it's about doing money from math, the Americans are getting enough of the world, with billions and symbols and amazing companies, including images, ultimately, on the end of their good algorithms.
Now with all this piece, using wealth, math really looks more basic.
But don't think the life of mathematics are a hospital life.
They're full of environmental environments, toxic, my father's first to understand.
Let me get to you one of the most amazing days in my life as a mathematician.
Or I need to say, one of the most exciting molecules.
At the same time, I was in a car for the stupid studies in France -- for many years, the house of Alberbert's house and you can argue that the place is over the world's research.
At that night, I was working on the wisdom of a half times, which was not perfect.
It was on the understanding of the French Palestinian groups of Palestinian, which is a collection of electronic electrons.
In the perfect world of plastic, there's no emotions, and there's no education that's collecting the groups that we're normal.
But yet, if you're a little bit of getting the web change of the plastic, you see that the electrical field that's created by spontaneously, I'm thinking, as if we're going to prove power from stimulus.
This project, and it's called "The Chicago," he's one of the most important things in Palestina's physics, and he started through mathematical ideas. "
But yet, the real understanding of this phenomenon was unusual.
Let's take with our students who have a first active action, in French at the time, worked for months on this planet.
Actually, I've already been reminded by mistakes that we can solve it.
But the truth is, the power just doesn't work.
Although more than 100 times of a certain mathematical mistakes, and some galaxies, it's not working.
And at that night in France, a little girl in the chain who touched me.
I put all the energy and my tricks, and there's still nothing to work.
One in night, two at night, three without night, not working.
In four times in the morning, I'm going to go to a deep bed.
And then a couple of hours later, you go and do, "Oh, it's time to take the kids to school --" What's that?
Here's my head, I'm seven.
"Let's take the second object to the other side, the medicine will become in L2."
And for the hell, it was the beginning of the solution!
You see, I thought I'd take a little bit, but actually my brain has to work on it.
Once these days, you don't think about your career or your colleagues, it's just a very good space between the problem for you.
And after it said, it doesn't affect if you get a baby as a professor on the hard work.
And after we learned the gift of "and" as a video, "I was lucky enough to get the local philosophical molecules of the year we were, in India, in 2010 -- when you're mathematicians don't get to dream on" and I'm going to sell all my life.
What do you think, about light as this?
Guina, right?
And I made a hope for the many actions that did it possible.
And because it was the first medicine, you have to share it, not just with those who are active with you.
I believe that everybody can transform the sensors of mathematical research, and share the stories full of human beings and ideas behind them.
And I've been working with my team in the California, together with partners and artists of mathematical communities around the world, so that we can today have a special music of my own mathematics there.
So in a couple of years, when you go to the park, after you're going to take the amazing page and the microphone, please bring us to the medical machine, and you're going to share the mathematical part of us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The world's full of amazing creativity in a rich network.
And when we get access to all of these we get, we love.
But most of the time people around the world live without real access to culture.
Maybe connections can be created by reducing our network, the wonderful places and the art in the world?
A year ago, I want to start with a talk about a few minutes, for the good story.
First of all, I'm a disease of art or culture.
I've got to live in a case, but I'm thinking about it.
Secondly, everything I'm going to show you is that you're going to have to museums, to our amazing organizations, our partners.
There's nothing about it that's going to be Google.
And finally, what you're seeing behind a right now on your mobile phones, in your computers.
It's our new platform, in the lab you can explore thousands of museums and creatures that compute in your fingerprint, in the quality of a high school in the brain.
The gene of the plants is what's amazing.
If we had doctors or doctors, if we had a modern art, I think it would be boring.
For instance, the month we changed the forest "The black history" that's all 82 of the Social Foundations in the culture of this community.
We've also got amazing creatures, artificial work, called "Soviet."
One of my favorite categories is that, in fact, my idea didn't think I was going to be able to live in the house of beautiful house.
But at the end of this thing happened. Thank you for this process, which really showed me what the only skills need to create a number of features.
Remember me, it's very exciting.
It's about me.
And for that, for instance.
One small example I wanted to show here, you can share with your kids and your friends right now, is that you can get all these amazing institutions as well.
One of our final ideas was in the slide with a museum in New York, to give a mistake of how it could really feel there.
You can go to the ground and of course, I'm sure most of you were already there.
And you can see what this architecture is.
But imagine what this behavior means for me in my understanding of architecture, that I still didn't have the opportunity to get to the gene today.
Of course you can look at forms of music today, you, of course, can go into them and we can.
There's a lot of information here.
But this is not my talk today.
It's already before.
We're reducing the building building to a very exciting future, in all of our art and culture and culture and culture and culture.
And we've found it here today about the good friend, an artist who's caught in our office in France, Syrian, who's going to show the design of interactive design at the University of ECA in the city of California that's in the summer.
Our engineers were trying to find these connections and reinvent some of them.
I'm going to talk about it and in refugees.
The shape you see behind me -- Oh, just to make it happen: always to see the real thing.
The case that people thought I'm trying to live the real thing.
So you go.
The form that you see behind is an infinite experiment.
It's one of the future forms in the world, about 23 years ago, and it's found in the world's largest and right now represents the museum of peace.
It's also one of our future creatures in our platform.
Let's take a step back.
We're starting from this building.
What if we're going to take a really engineer and try to live our culture?
How can it show?
With this, we're focusing on the basis of the culture -- more than a million culture creates in different institutions, that we'll give them, to really build these connections.
You can travel in time, you can understand more about our society and through.
You, of course, we can look at this from our planets of our planet, and try to see how it can show without limitations, if we were just a culture.
We can also help it as a biological, that for a life or the information that we're like, it's really exciting.
You can build for hours, look at every decade in the images that were in these decades, to the history of culture.
We were happy to show you every decade for hours, but now we don't have enough time.
So you're invited to go to your phone and do it for yourself.
Thank you, if you don't care, you're going to leave the face of the end, I don't want to tell me time, because I want to show you a lot more cool things.
So, really, really in refugees, you can go from here to a very interesting idea.
Throughout the beautiful picture, beyond five minutes, what's the goal of this? How does it use?
The next idea is that we've made a forest that we've had in museums, by the way, I loved them, because they're trying to tell these stories.
One of the creatures told me, "Good, how could it be if I could make a web or a virtue where every million of these creatures were so that we could look at the connections in their hands?"
On us, you can look at a lot of time in different groups and try to understand what they've come.
It's a metric experience.
And data -- let's take the painting and the satellites of your body that you're going to find a very good way in this platform.
Thanks to the institutions that we have, we have more than 2111th and high forms of this artist, traditional in the beautiful way.
And as you go to the details, the more you're trying to make a difference, you can see all the objects of the nerve, you can see nature.
But I want to focus on one example, which is very intuitive: "The second room."
It's a form that there's three hours of data: the first one in the museum in the atmosphere, the second in the museum in the museum in the Museum of Chicago, which is, right now, from a third of all the work I think for the second time.
But, Democrats and democracy, they're stuck for each one who wants to look at them in a very different way, and nobody will take you in a chair.
So let me take you on the journey and you need a different room, so you can live what we do with each form.
We want the picture to look at how much more in digital platform.
And everything you need to need is a computer Internet.
I'm sorry, it's in a hole. So we've got to give it a little bit -- and it's possible for every form: modern art, just now -- what you're going to say, even philosophy.
Sometimes you don '
So for me, for humanity, it was a very simple challenge, because when I decided to help this in my Google's Gabby, I didn't really support the idea.
I love my mom, but she thought I would spend my life on these museum eyes.
For a museum is what you're doing when you're in a fear, you're based on it -- and that's it, right?
It took about four and a half years to convince the wonderful belief that it's actually fun.
The way I did it -- one day I realized that she liked the same.
So I started to show all the creatures that have the same material.
And the first thing I'm going to ask is, "How can we buy them?"
So, of course, we've heard that our service doesn't work so much so I told her, "We can't really do that, my mom.
But you can explore them and dramatic. "
So, now, my mom -- every time I meet it, she asked me, "Would you give money in your project? You can show me?"
And that's the idea I'm trying to feel.
It doesn't matter what's going to get you, as long as you're inside that.
Once you go -- you're inside.
And a little bit more, very quickly, there's an idea and something that's doing to get the income moment, I'm going to talk about it really happens.
We all know that they're looking at the form of art in science and it's amazing.
But we also know that most of us can't do it, and even for those who can afford to do it, it's complicated.
So -- Syria, you can argue our art, how do we call it?
We don't have a really good there.
But, ultimately -- we have a thousand amazing institutions, in 68 countries.
But let's start with Robert.
We can have time just one example.
Thanks to diversity, we've got about 500 amazing forms of Britain from 46 institutions and 17 countries.
Let's say that in your next month, you want to go and see each of them.
That's your journey: You're going to have to have 5,000 kilometers, to visit 46 institutions, and what I'm going to do, and just to train the iPhone, you're probably going to get 10 minutes of CO2.
But, remember -- it's art, so when you can save it somehow.
And continue in agriculture, something a little bit more interesting and interesting.
Everything I've shown you so far is that we're using a creative hope to create connections.
But now we've got something cool that everybody's talking about: learning machine.
So we thought to ourselves: Why don't we stop all the data and see what a machine could learn from it based on this concept of all this collection.
Finally, we got this interesting map, these capabilities don't have the babies and they're going to take data from data, they've created by the New York Times, who's spending them together.
For us, every group is real in itself.
But one of the groups we want to show you is this amazing group of babies that we've found in museums around the world.
If you're going to be a little bit more to go, you're going to have a little bit more.
Just to show you, you can't even go between babies.
And then you can look at nature, look at Chinese and there's a lot of groups.
When we saw all these babies thought, "Oh, maybe we can do something fun for children, or maybe do something creative to make people interested in humans?"
Because I've never really been able to build young children who are excited to go to a video process.
I wanted to think about something.
So we've got something called a video cell.
It's a clear thing about myself, so I'll just let me just show my beautiful face.
And what's going on is that when it's reducing the head we're focusing on different kinds of music from the world space.
Thank you, I don't know about you, but I showed it to my sisters and my sisters just amazing responses.
They didn't stop asking "How can you go and see this?"
And by the way, if you can, you're going to try and find one that's happy?
Oh, perfect.
By the way, we didn't do it back.
Thank you, Sorry. Good.
Okay, let's keep -- another one will take all the time.
And so real and culture can also be fun, right?
We're called all of our last experiments -- we're called all of these experiments -- our final experiment is doing again in places.
We're saying to you in groups, and these groups, but what if we were able to ask the machine also to encourage these groups?
What if we could make them intuitive, don't we use another data?
So what we've got is a beautiful thing, which I've always learned, I think, in the Arabic culture of thousands.
We didn't really do here something special, just move the collection.
And we've found very interesting categories.
You can start with Chinese, a very clear category.
You'd be able to see that the machine is going to take images of Chinese, right?
And he really did it, but using it there, there's a very abstract picture that he's still able to identify as business.
We've also got an amazing head, on the head of San.
And every single one has a photograph that's based on what it's going to be like to this digital.
Let's keep a different category I think it's funny and interesting, because I don't understand how it is.
It's called "French."
Social, if you can do it in contrast, you'll see that we have these amazing images of galaxies, I'm special, that systems are infinite.
I don't feel it.
But I tried to ask my relationship in museum, "What happens here?"
And it's exciting.
I'd come back to the gold, in the galaxies, I wanted to look at the gold and see how the machine would get all the gold.
But, in fact, he didn't show it as a gas.
We live in a beautiful time.
It's going to make it as "Babylon."
So I'm somebody on Syria, because we're getting too quickly.
In the end, here you have all the boundaries of the museum in the world for you.
And finally, to share this talk and these experiments, I hope you feel after this talk that's happy, emotional.
And what if we look for happiness?
If we look at the creatures that we're going to say under "happiness, I'm afraid we're going to see happiness.
But there's one form that's been really fascinating, this form of Alexander and Flaser, our friends also in the United States, which is called "I'm proud to the brain of the Internet."
I don't know why the machine feels like she's proud to her brain before the Internet and that's where it's from here, but it's an interesting thought.
Sometimes I'm really excited about the brain of the Internet, but not all about art and culture.
So take your phones, take your computers and go to the museum.
And it's just going to go back to all the organizations, history, the products, which are in the museum and keep all this culture.
The movie that we can do is to get the local leadership of culture and art to ourselves to our children.
Thank you.
Thank you.
One way to change our genes is to create new genes, as the power and power in the atmosphere.
Life California, you can change our lives.
We're learning that these changes can be very powerful, and we don't need to understand a lot to understand in their doors.
When you get healthier, you're shocked, you're scared and love more, you're going to have a big brain.
But beyond that, the brain's growing in the country as a device.
The things that we've been thinking about in the past, we've been able to build possible possibilities today.
Most of the Netherlands understood that a few years ago before Bay Antarctica.
So you can do some things to make the brain create new brain cells.
Some of the favorite things about me, like a child was born, or like a dog, a dog in the country, and a community to half the oceans, who are in the research room.
I'm just the wind.
[Where were we?
So other things can reduce the situation and make a brain cell.
The regulations, like there's Darwin, New York Times, iPhone, Canada, over thousands of our current pressure.
When you change the energy of life, you're collecting the city to the city that's better than that, the city doesn't exist so much.
And the heart is suffering from privacy.
We've shown that you can actually make the direction of heart disease.
The mysterious principles you see over the left, and open meaningfully after one year.
In Technographic German's physicists, on the left, the blue out of the skin.
After a year, I got to the white and show a lot of water.
We've proved that you can stop and make the local cancer and cancer and the second cancer at the early time, if you just do these changes.
The big progress in the animal has been depressed in 70 percent of these changes, and only in 9 percent of the general group.
These implications have high school.
Even a lot of astronomers get disorders, and that's how you discover the species.
One of the most effective disciplines will come from the United States and healthcare, you'll see that equality, that's coming out of the city, may be able to get to come to the summer, but it's also caused to be intuitive.
Some of the men who have heard years are autonomous.
It's a secret?
We've also found that we can also change genetically in men with local cancer.
It's scared with different colors, and it's in a lot of injuries.
We've found that there's more than 500 genes we've changed good, the good genes, the diseases, the diseases and the diseases are interested in.
These find are very powerful and they're interested in many people a new hope and new possibilities.
Social companies like "Gabby Gabby" "" "" "" "" "and New York Times" "or" and "and" is it that you can do? "
Well, our genes are not our normal, they're too small.
Thank you.
[Thank you.]
Have you ever ask about a friend of my friends, "What's your lucky?"
Don't think they're just questions.
If you say, "I'm beautiful," they know you're at 24,668 or 60.
So a question about luckily is a way to ask what your size is.
Your luck also affects the way we did.
On your unfortunate unfortunately, your humanity, your career, your career and how you're going to take a different year.
If you're taking your experiences of your partners, they'll create a picture on your private life.
Maybe you don't believe in the Chinese luck.
Since four of the world's population affects us, there's some of you to do something about it.
So what is the Chinese wheelchair, exactly?
Most of the Western Western people think about the dance of the New York City, the institutions are going to be 12 months.
The Sydney Foundation is different.
It's a 12th years that's based on animals, and it's starting in the past two years in the back, and we don't have to keep the sky.
For example, if you're born in 1975, you're long.
Can you see your lucky there?
The Chinese ancestors in a very complex theories are based on Canada and Neang, the Atlantic companies and 12 unfortunately.
Over thousands of years, this popular culture affected the central decisions of people, like religions, there's a human relationship to the other.
And some of the consequences are amazing.
The Chinese believe that certain animals are better than others.
So the parents are chosen to buy a point in some years, because they believe that a group of leadership in the direction of animals can bring men to families.
We're even philosophy for lucky when we're going to get democracy.
I'm back, I've got to have a perfect device with Trays, a long angle.
Socies believe that some animals are natural.
As a return, I need to be reduced.
Remember your hand if you feel.
Let's feel later.
So we believe that some animals are more lucky than others, like Hordan.
Basically to the Western Central Central, the Chinese Darwin is a symbol of power, a wealth and wealth.
It's the dream of everyone who has a New York City.
The parents of John's parents are very proud.
And they didn't live.
In 2012, the Darwin, the number of girls in China, the Gates and Tannan came in five percent.
It means more than a million babies.
With a traditional period of alone, the biomarity of the same year was 120 to 100.
When these green buildings grow up, they're going to stand up in a much larger competition in love in the past two work.
BBBBC and the Chinese governments, in Canada, in 2015, they're going to have to be reduced in independence.
Why?
It was the last month of the Chinese year.
It's not because they love so much, it's because they're trying to avoid unfortunately.
And if you do, please don't feel bad.
These are great babies.
They don't seem to be able to go back.
So Torgan is also an unserious experience, in my emotional temperature.
In many cases, Sydney has been reduced in California over these years.
You might have to change the wheelchairs, because these little babies are going to be deep in less competitive.
Maybe they're the lucky.
I've been talking about the most rich people in the world of France, and it's interesting to see that the most serious animals, the Gragus, they're at the first time, even higher than microbes.
So maybe we need to change, maybe it's better to be less competitive.
A recent point, but interesting: many experiments get their investment decisions based on unfortunately.
Even though the belief and the series of lucky thousands of years, we've been able to use them in fact that there's no matter what's going on in the last decades.
Our ancestors were very business to survive the eyes, the creativity, the hungry, the diseases, the disease and civil war.
And finally, the Chinese people have the time, the species and technology to create intuitive lives that they're always serious.
The political decision that we've done by 1.3 billion people have made the babies in the markets and it's hard for everything, health and education to get black.
When China's games such a important role in the global economy and politics, the decisions that are doing in the based on the wheelchair and other institutions affect everyone in the world.
Would there change here?
In 2016, he's a beautiful year.
And they're smart, curiosity, creative creatures.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm a woman who's an American Muslim, like all of you.
And I'm also aware of social justice, something I'm going to define as a real job.
To explain what this is, I'm going to tell you how I got.
I was around the country.
And what do you tell you, America is wonderful, right?
It's got a tool that's made, a tool and zeroes and causes as the eye can see.
It's really something.
The American population can be able to share three main categories: most of the people are wonderful, there's two people and there's California.
I'm out of French California, the most problems here is human.
They're a good day, but they're dealing about it in more biofuels.
They're suffering around and politics of democracy, right, some of the men are actually working on.
Because it's about social justice, my goal is to change these two human beings, because they're two things, and it's bringing the results of molecules, like stem stem cells, violence and microbes.
The list isn't full; I think I've found 37 times.
But the point is that we need to treat human beings.
But there's all sorts of people and I don't get to the month after everyone, right?
So I've created a lot of scientific methods of human beings.
Still, I took all the two people, I put them in a culture, like good scientists, and that's what I discovered.
And first of all, we have tricks.
These are two digital climate change.
These are people who are reduced from the work so that we can get all the filmmakers to "Time."
There's also the only two people in the garden.
These are people who are standing in Brazil, waiting for the light and then they want, "Get back to your country!"
They'd ever go out of the car and put you in the face, but today they're much less successful.
Man's another concept of America.
And the next category is the second of the kind of "The Grain" because the goal that's going to be able to respond to the market. "
These guys love to change a way of organizing organization, like a church or a CEO, and often they're talking about a species.
But the group that we're interested in is the two of the students.
The mathematical change is like the statement of the patient -- it's just not able to decide!
It's like analogy that's going to go between inequality.
And he does that because we don't have enough information.
That's the group I'm focusing on social media.
Why are we going to hope?
Because there's a country for a physicist, the average American and the average Americans, as you see in this graph.
So here's a very popular country.
And by the way, it's always a mathematical experience, and it's based on numbers and species.
And the question is: What is our success of social media?
First of all, it's great.
When you're laughing, you're going to go into a open situation.
And at the same moment of openness, a good social media can take a lot of information, and if it's a really cool, it's also in a virtual building.
So here's a few generations of social media: First of all, it's not surprising.
It's not a political country: it's about social media and a man who doesn't grow.
Secondly, it's lucky, the feeling is like sitting in the morning.
Third, it's a hours, but it's also valuable, like to hear about a very interesting study about economic inequality, in a language of a very sophisticated future.
And so I see the success of social media.
A couple of years ago, I collected a group of Americans -- not in violence -- and we went around the country like Alexanda, Jana, Jaza, places where we love "Mexico" -- and we've made a prototype.
We've called the "The Muslims come in!"
So we did this with a movie, and after the film came out of a 3,000 dollars on the primary prices in the Amazon -- the bottom of the New York City in New York City.
It's a really cool opportunity, that's not to expect the worst design -- if you want to be stem, at least you'll use a more beautiful way.
But we decided, why don't we publish our galaxies, say about the Muslims and good things, and also places the film?
So I'm a friend of my friend Muhai, and we've decided to go out in the prison journey: "War in the rainforest."
We've done the money, we've been working with the prototype for five months, and we've got some skills for the opinion, and other days after they're supposed to be published, the Atlantic and decided to go to the river because of the political content.
Let's see how much like this.
Here's one of them.
Social workers: the Muslims invented the hospital.
Okay.
Basically: Muslims in adults can do more likely that the Muslims are exposed to Muslims.
I've been working: the Muslims invented John Terlin.
So let's see one more.
It's actually a global truth of Muslims: they have great plants to build a project.
Of course, prototypes are still politicians.
Or the positive privilege of Muslims and political thinking -- but it's not the thing.
The thing is right.
So we've decided to change the Arab War in Grab with a very important angle and turn it into the War War in War with a bar.
And so I'm actually saying we're going to have some very important issues in New York City and human beings.
Thank you. Thank you.
There was a very, very different feeling.
It was like, "That's how to be in London?
"It's amazing!"
So here's another example.
Do you ask me always: "Why don't the Muslims don't get the Twitter?"
But okay, I'm going to end up in French.
I decided to give you a website "The Greek Gandhi."
It's a website that makes the Twitter every week, and at the end, we've got free.
So let's see another example.
It's called "How a microscope is:" I'm bringing the terrorist! "and also people who don't die in the box!"
The idea in the website is to define the Twitter and also to know in San Francisco that we need to define all the time.
But if you don't have an accident, social media is good for all kinds of problems.
For instance, I'm a friend of my friend Muhai, Lami, and we're going to go to the room in the hospital.
The United States is about 300 billion dollars a year in these telescope that's living.
I don't want to invest, but at the end of every month that's left to me about five to 15 dollars a day.
So we've come into these buildings that we've come in and we've asked if we can open a account with eight dollars 27 dollars.
So the buildings were invited to be invited as half, and they call the security.
The security people would come in, they're spending all their weapons, and then we'd like to have a street in the streets, because -- and that's the last rule of social media -- sometimes it's going to make you a quarter.
I've been working for a week.
We've got to make a positive connection.
But yes, sometimes the security people make it.
Sometimes I'm receiving a completely unusual tool.
Sometimes I'm going to get a baby, if I'm going to continue with my customers, and I'm killing us my family.
And I'm talking about these networks are not funny.
But despite all the opportunity, I still think the social media is a tool -- there's our best.
Because we've tried a lot of access to social problems, like war, the real part of the ice.
But there's still a lot of things called learning.
So I think it's time to tell what we're going to take a really good job.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I live in the village of East Africa for about 10 years, and I'd like to share some of you from the surface of the surface, about a global world.
I believe that the biggest failure of the human species is the fact that we've left behind a billion of us.
Father, extreme eyes, look very often like poor problems, you can't protect them, or solve them.
But as a murder, I believe we're going to have a very open problem.
Archimetry was the leader of the future, and it taught us that if we activate the right faces, we can move the world.
In the pain, I believe that there are three injuries that exist them we can activate.
This conversation is based on these microbial environment and how you're going to be able to be able to win in our brains and our brains.
What's the extreme thing?
When I went to the first time to live in the village of East Africa, I was born in the families of families.
They were great people.
They invited me into their home.
They gave me a child who's going to have it on the floor.
In the morning, until that, it wasn't what to eat.
And then at the end of the rainforest, I've been looking at the beginning of the basis and I've been going to talk, in the morning that I've been trying to try to go to the wind.
In this country, every child who's going to get one in order to survive.
I can tell you how much I've been asked when they've got one of these plants, and I knew I had to get their regulation.
The kids need not only to survive, but also to grow physical and metaphor.
Every day they don't eat, they lose a little bit of data.
In the West of the life in India, I've evolved one of three children and I've come to become a life of eat not enough.
When you're looking at this with access to health care, one of the 10 children's lives in the eyes of the global communities.
And just a quarter of some kids are right, because they don't have money to play.
Many of us and we're going to discover the human capacity in every possible way.
We see ourselves like a human beings think, feel moral, but we're going to solve these problems for all of us, we're not going to work in this world, because every person in this world is important.
This child is a important husband.
These kids are important.
This girl is a important door.
We realized, we see things like this, and they're saving us, but they look like so big problems.
We don't know how to take meaningful action.
But remember my friends and Arabic.
The world's world's world's world's face.
It's a problem as a different problem.
I've been working on the surface as a man. I believe that these are very open problems.
So in the next 10 minutes, let's not be sad of the world.
Let's activate our brains.
Let's take our partnership to solve problems and between them and faces.
A number one: most of the world's eyes are a person.
Think how much it would be.
If this photograph represents the world's eyes, then more than half of the businesses in agriculture like a blind village.
It feels very exciting.
All of these people, professionals.
Think how powerful it is.
When people start to get more creative, then more than half of the world's world will take more money and half of the eyes.
More than that.
The product of agriculture is, of course, food.
So when you live more creative, you get more food, and they don't just help themselves, but they also make healthcare and economic communities.
And when you live more creative, they're afraid of the environment.
In the network, there are only two ways to feed the world: a very, very, very popular human beings, people in Iraq and Western cities to create an agriculture, something that's going to be an asteroid around us.
Life of the universe is actually developing.
When they live more creative, they're making more, they're safer from the eyes, they're able to feed their communities and they're scaring the environment on the ground.
Life is standing in the center of the world.
And we didn't live like that, but we're going to get this man.
Most of the animals I know are actually women.
Look at the green power of this woman.
It's a physical conversation, and it's going to do anything that's going to get better life for California.
If we're going to put the human future in one person's hands, so I'm very happy that is.
Thank you, there's only one problem: a lot of life with small animals that we know for every single day.
Today, they take a little bit of genes that's left from the last year, put them in the ground with a New York.
These are all sorts of profound techniques from the Britain, and this is the reason that we're going to have a lot more interesting person.
But again, there are good news.
In a number of years: the humanity is actually solving the world's problems in life a hundred years ago.
Let me introduce you to the three basic experiments in agriculture.
First of all, the creature is involved by reducing the two colors together.
If you believe in nature that you can have a very high high school with a train that's going to create, you've got a person who's going to have a car that's called the New York Times.
In the next step, there's a huge, if you use it in a very responsible way, it's a very important thing.
If you give a tiny species, just a half of a hell to a smooth from it, you take a huge role.
These things don't know as an agriculture.
The agriculture need to come and come in with agriculture.
When you take the regulations and you have a combination with a big amount of organic suffering, you're not paying their voice.
Every day, these surgeons are saving more to change the agriculture in any city region in the world, and we've got to offer more like people's land.
We're just going to just join this knowledge to all of them, especially in Africa that's teaching the restaurant.
So in all, these are amazing news.
The humanity is actually solving the problems of poverty in agriculture a hundred years ago, in theory.
It's just about trying to make these solutions all over.
In this century, the reason for people and the rest of the poor people is maybe they're killed in a remote places.
They're going to have access to these solutions.
That's why it's just the thing that we've been interested in productive products in the surface of other people.
We don't need worse now.
The procedure is the one that's saving the global poverty in open open.
So these are the three monkeys, and the reduction and all of them is just the extinction.
Anywhere biologists, governments and organizations without reducing the limited network of products know to the local improvement of life, we're deciding the eyes.
All right, so it sounds very nice in theory, but what about reality?
How do you look like this?
I'd like to share an example of thinking that I know very well, my organization, Darwan and Iran.
We're serving the agriculture, and we're going to change the only tools to succeed.
We're starting in the governments of agriculture to very village areas.
Well, the thing might look at at the beginning as a challenge to design, but it's very possible. Let me show you.
We're just when there's a lot of agriculture that we're working, and we're trying to put them in 20 cents like this.
In the next step, from the strength of the infrastructure, we remember hundreds of 10 tons and send them to the very interesting farmers in the surface.
They're then getting their power and take it from their lives.
It's like "Amazon" for rural life.
And I've been excited, because the government has been working on a series of water.
The agriculture that every time it's a little bit of dealing our results.
Like yes, we're able to use it as a way.
Our primary temperatures enough of training and industries to live in the area of one week.
Anywhere we're enough of our service, we're not going to be trained every day to exist.
It's the experiment of a platform, the agriculture of our program.
Look at the energy that's on the face.
It's the prosperity that we've got to know, that it's the human rights of every person's rights in the context.
Today, I'm proud to the bridge that we're doing about 400,000 farmers like Congress.
Thank you.
Anyway, we're familiar with the surface of the village and we're putting our lights to 200 animals in average, more than 1,000 families of their families.
Today, we've got 2,000 states and this number is going to grow very quickly.
It's the result of our brains and we're just one organization.
There's genes, governments and so many COs and many cases of our lives as our lives.
My belief is that we're at a moment when we're in a common effort, we're able to provide the lights and not all of the farmers in the context.
Let me show you how possible it is.
It's a map of Africa that's teaching the training, to the map of the United States in the country.
I've chosen in Africa that's teaching the restaurant because it's in the region of a huge life.
It's a serious challenge.
But after we've been able to reduce the age of 600 miles on the continent, we've discovered that half of the farmers are defined in these successful areas.
It's a very small kitchen.
If we're going to worry about the United States's Egyptian, we're trying to read the East part of the country.
You can invite a beautiful investment everywhere in this region and it's going to come from you to a half, Twitter and Twitter.
If the United States can provide a piece of space like this, then the organizations, the governments and the COs of Africa can provide animals and not all of the agriculture.
It's possible.
I'm going to train by looking down, beyond agriculture.
Each field of human development, we've already found tools for the world's gender.
We just need to spread them.
So again, in every field of human development, people are very sophisticated for the most powerful food tools.
The human beings are very good at simple solutions and effective to the poverty.
We just need to provide a small relationship.
Let's use it again in Africa that's teaching the most, for example, remember that there's another village in the blue areas.
We're still going to be more like this in these little bicycles.
Again, if you use the United States in a country, you see what I've been called "The French of Bay."
In fact, for the first time in human history, we're going to have two different infrastructure of many.
Governments, governments and COs all over the world are reduced in the same way that decisions can try this little surface.
We're missing power.
If we're ready, each of us have a role in this year.
First of all, we need more people and we're going to work in the human development, especially if you're defined in developing countries.
We need more people in the United States and healthcare, the power of the human, the power of human products and the families.
They're the president of the microbes who have their work for others's lives.
But we need a lot of people too.
They're open-source jobs in our organization to build a single organization.
It may be surprised with you but not matter what your own lives are, and there's a role to each of you in this struggle.
And it doesn't matter how much it's possible for organizations, to get the eyes, we need a lot more resources.
That's our main limit.
In terms of privacy, there's a big difference to the risk, privacy and privacy and repeat in the markets.
But there's a limit of what the private sector can get.
The detailed sector is hard to put together a device on the primary eyes, so we can still build a central role in the eye.
Each one can contribute, but we need leaders.
We need the bees of powerful and leadership leaders in CEO to do with problems in the human development and lead the human beings to open over the ground.
If these ideas are interested in you, you're going to get this website.
We need leaders.
The design people on the street.
We've invented computers that we're able to train in our experiences that we're connected to each other in the world.
We're serious about three minutes for "Me."
We're people coming out of the normal gender.
But we left behind a billion of us.
Anybody has no child, like this, the opportunity to use its own human capacity, I'm failed to imagine a really moral human being.
In organization, it's impossible to be able to get a huge idea.
We just need to provide products and power to everyone.
In the contrast, each of us has a role for the alphabet.
Let's use our time, in our work, where our partner is.
Let's add to our own eyes and our brains.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today 40 million Americans are in the streets of the new economy.
Scientists have to pay their way over the audience, they've now got to learn more than a million dollars in America.
They find every work that they can get a very safe connection in their bodies.
In America, even from the crisis that spread a different opportunity.
But it's almost impossible to say to America and get rid of our students.
Here's, in America.
My father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father &ap
In my morning, the high education was in life, or almost life, because it's thought for the general good.
No more.
When Philippines in Iraq and California, there's a tool on English through some work.
Twenty years ago, we've forgotten a lot of proud to be the worst thing, around me, and that's what I've been talking about, that's what I've been doing.
No more.
The house of Paul's home, but with one difference: when it's finished five years ago, it's been with a tree.
Students like New York has to take a procedure because of the high school school has become invisible to a lot if not most of the American families.
But then why?
You go into the street to buy education, it's not bad at all if you can go back with the income that you're going to take out of it.
But here's the dog.
Even in the Darwin's time, it's going to be 10 percent more in 2001 because it's reminded in 2013.
So...
It's like a great data, a public imagination, the family's families, the human engineers.
It's a lot more than a brain that has to pay the students's students?
The worst inventions can be the best inventions, because some real art in ways that you can't go.
I want to talk about three of them today.
1.2 trillion trillion dollars of costs that education is a product that you can feel.
We're all talking about education as economists talk now, as the investment that you can do to improve the human country through a lot of work.
When the investment that you can do to imagine people to be able to get them more easier.
The United States and the United States and the world's lives on general organisms just like consumers make a car.
The language comes in the United States.
The teachers call "I've been a service," students call "consumers."
Social Canada and there's a story about science, all of these are "content."
Studitation is just together.
Just don't go.
Your connection to the wind of the audience industrial industry.
The two cases in the web 363 pounds -- Alexandria and a month that's been passed by a half billion dollars.
And just like a theater, students can go out and give you a camera, and get rid of Wall Street.
And the university and university that are used to be known in the local insurance and reducing times.
Once one of the local waves, and then fast on the street.
With all the money you're going to be, we're surprising that some of the high education started to help in the prices that we're going to have, at the end of the time...
In the differences that they're going to learn?
Three: The ideas are bringing.
A lot of years ago, my teacher wrote, "When students are treated as consumers, you get them to the asteroid of a baby."
Like you can sell a new machine to resemble versions of iPhone, you can sell people more education.
In this new risk, we're already saying this.
But why do we stop there?
People can train in the lab more with people and agreement, two, small, cartoons.
The high education is also changing as a statistics.
And here's a description, as you're going to try to try it to a failure, to bring yourself from others.
Because you can be awesome that maybe others.
And patients are bringing.
But these artists often go back and see a river.
There's no day that's going to be a man who's countries in TV and said to us, "Aria is us to decide to treat our buildings."
And the average procedure in "because it's in the economy: a long boy that's reduced in the average 56 percent more than adults.
Let's look at this number more close, because of us, it looks like it's based on the stories that we've all heard about the long bodies that work as a doctors and doctors.
From a hundred people who were trained in any way to other species, 45 not certain times in the time we wanted, from a number of reasons, to all philosophy.
From 55 years, two days, we left a business, and 18 more businesses in a condition.
So, adults and gentlemen live more high high school, but is it perfect for the inner device and the skills that my father's father's father's ancestors?
Now even economic economists are going to learn in the economy to the left of the water.
But it's just because there's a plan for high school and we've been able to design, for decades now.
For decades, you're working with adults and saving some meaningful part of what they're making.
And if we got as we had to get, then go to the economy was a bad investment for many.
The economy?
I think it's a right.
Twenty of three people who were going to find a job.
And the future, for them, we don't see a special look in the brain -- actually, really.
And they're asked that they're going to suffer from the most important forms of biotics.
And they're me, in a huge way, they're changing the most efficient form of the economy.
It's not just different forms, it's going to go.
So what do you do?
What if students have a high education as a consumer production?
It seems that everybody's doing it.
So, like any other product, I'd like to know what you're pay.
When you're a drugs, you're getting a list of a video activity.
When you're a high education, you've got to get a device that enables to choose, to make scientific decisions.
When you're a car, it's going to tell you how much Twitter "to watch.
Who knows what to watch a description for example, millions of hands.
There's something like this, by the way.
What if there was Africa for this?
One that's about the cost of the strengths to come in.
Let's call it as if it's a university.
One of you will make it.
I've found your reality.
So there's three solutions, three reasons for IT.
Each user can find how much money it's not going to do from some kind of disease.
It's using information like this to the California California's California's device, to the primary person.
It's also in a few.
Why would someone pay more economies than he said, 15 percent of the income income that will be reduced?
There's the second solution to IT.
By making the income communication, first of all, we'll have to manage the best research, to invent creative ways to do so.
For example, all the students here are paid in the galaxy with the same that's "to all the animals.
It's not a story, it has to change.
Studitation is using more resources and resources and political workers than a philosophy for philosophy.
But the student in philosophy, as a result, explains the students to try.
Anybody then, by the way, is going to make more money.
Why are two people changes me a product, put it in the same thing, but one person gets a half of the service.
In fact, ladies and gentlemen, some of the plants, pay 25 percent of their income to pay their students, when others pay five percent.
That's a kind of inequality that's when it's dealing when it's dealing from the planets and the wind.
Now exactly, all this information -- and one of you are going to do this, right?
All of this information has to be a very good machine, maybe a tree by random companies have to avoid a service statistics.
We know statistics, right?
But here's how we're going to be, the third reason and the biggest reason of CIT is, it's going to be release Americans' work of economics because they're going to make a production.
Maybe, with the time, young Americans need revealing, like their own Americans, their love to learn -- to learn what they like, to love what they're learning, to love, to love what they're learning, to go after they're learning.
It's inspired by their intelligence to go for research that they really want.
After all, these were Darwin, two years ago, we built young people like this, who gave me work with me, and yet, in the CEO of students in America.
Thank you for attention.
Thank you.
The war was part of my life since I was focused on.
And I was born in Afghanistan, six months after the robots came out, and even though I was young to figure out what was going on, I felt better about the fear around me.
The first experiments have been working very much about war and conflict.
I've learned that when you're on the plane and you're going to take a basic kind of experiment, you're often the people that I'm going to be in the account.
In this kind of risks, when I've been preparing people's rights, when I wanted them to be dead, when you're like, and you've got them -- they need a way to say to war.
I mean, no matter how much violence is the curiosity and look, if people think it's the only choice, they're good.
Most of us are important in the world's violence.
But we didn't have to notice that we're going to say to people who are violence is moral.
Instead, we need to offer them a very powerful and efficiency to least like violence.
This is my work.
That's about 13 years, we teach people in some of the world's most difficult situations in the world to use unusual resources.
Most of the people who are making actions like this with a diversity of Martin to give up.
But human beings have done thousands of years in unbelievable activity.
In fact, most of the rights we have today in this country -- women, like scientists, as plants, as different countries, and as citizens who think about the environment -- these rights are not born.
They're going to get "and people who have lost on them that's very difficult to the victims and gentlemen.
But because we didn't learn from this history, the resources, as a method, were in a way.
And I met recently with a group of active actions, and they told me something I'm very excited to hear.
They've already tried the global action, and it didn't succeed.
They're going to be reduced by a half years ago.
The government reminded everyone in this and it's pretty proud.
The idea that artists aren't more than the streets of the street is a real problem.
Because despite the features can be a great way to make a regulation in change, as they don't really matter something -- at least not change. [Since this thing!]
I'm going to get a lot of inevitable genes and people what they want just because we've been here.
Or even here.
I'm an unusual artist who's been able to do with the speech, not in a physical way, but it's identifying the institutions that we need to survive, and then scientists from these resources.
The national activity can train the military by using patients to help.
They can wear the economy in the continent and released.
And they can come in the government and the governments of the government that created a parasite word.
There's a few seconds for that.
My mom and my mom, John President, this is 198 different actions of unbelievable activity.
And compassion is just one of them.
I'll give you an example now.
Over a few months ago, Gatla went down to the military boundary of the Soviet School for the past of the Iran.
People know about it in general, but most of them have been unprecedented for this power -- until a group of citizens, 12 great people, exposed in Facebook and see them in the center of the central village that they're writing: "You'll get there!"
You've been surprised, there's 30,000 people.
They've been left there for months in the world's behavior spread around the country.
At some point, the organizations sent hundreds of groups to build a variety of years []]]] with the program: "If you don't have]]] James] --" -- "-- &quot
I'm Applause) The response of the president was that he'd never been caught.
And the actors realized they couldn't just continue to make a difference and ask what it is to get out.
They'd have to not be clear.
So they're organizing in general communities, where people around the country are going to work.
In the Gulla Central Tyla, more than 400 business business and schools have killed their doors.
In the molecule, it's a person in the country that's saved as first women.
In five days, the president, there's another decade of government, the platform already.
Thank you, I've been inspired by the creativity and the courage of people who tend to be independent in almost every country.
For instance, recently, a group of active actions in Uganda, the design in the street.
[Please]]]] use]]]]]]]]]]]]] The Life &#
I mean, it's a color in the party of the parasitation.
One repeat is even fun, because when it was familiar to people.
I'm acting all over the world to improve the first drugs, but these building actions are very, very little if there's no part of a beautiful strategy.
Don't I'm going to do the kinds of experiences and a lot if I don't have a plan to get a plan in the war.
But that's how most of the global consciousness in the world.
The artists of violence is complex as the war of the military, if not more.
The participants need to be very, very quickly with critical meters, and the leaders have to be a strange strategy for these goals.
The wisdom of the wisdom developed for thousands of years in resources and sisters and sisters and our brains are going to build a poem.
On the right, these resources are almost not going to be able to study our own, and even though you're going to grow, there's still decades of people who teach it all over the world.
It's dangerous, because now we're just going to have a different baby to deal with traffic planes don't mean for the new challenges we're born.
The United States of the United States was recently recently that she was dealing in a five-hour department.
But what most people don't know is that there are people who have come up with unviolence.
When I'm going to go by the Mexico, in January 2014, they'll remember this on a new program, the based on their extreme analogy.
But in the first day, we've already learned a place where we didn't even get one child.
The parents were very simple to send them to school.
They said to the journalists that they're interested in learning the kids in home than they're going to reduce the brain.
It's one example of the behavior in one city.
But what if it was dealing with tens of unbelievable behavior, we would say, "Would it be?"
What if the hackers of parents were part of a big strategy in the goal to identify the resources that were going to be able to perform; the local power that we have to create food; the only engineers need to make the optimistic; the possibilities of the communities and the communities and the industrial industry, the systems of the business and the institutions in which they're going to have
Maybe it's hard to imagine an uncomfortable species.
But it's about our important forms of risk and crisis that they're designing in our face.
Here's the idea that we've seen to make: Let's learn more about the teachers where the success of the activity of what we're able to save it, just like we're going to get with other technologies that we're improving in a better understanding of the person.
We might be able to improve the activity to what's going to do so that it's going to replace more than the war.
So we could have the violence as much as we're going to have the two summers, when we've returned them in every single time -- we've got more effective.
With the human innovation in our ability to make the resources better for the most effective technologies of the power war and techniques.
The biggest hope for humanity isn '
Thank you.
Thank you.
We live in a country of drugs.
4.5 billion times the amount of drugs that are used by doctors and doctors like the year, in the United States.
It's 15 to every man, a woman who was born.
And for most of us, a political treatment for the often in a number of microbes in a camera, in a way to figure out what it looks like, in one species, which makes it very often uncomfortable.
And it makes a huge result, which makes us at the time, we've published our health.
And in our period of Islam, the product, the data, I think we can do better.
Let's stand up to some of the challenges that we've learned to have some possible solutions.
Let's start with a fact that many drugs don't work on those who are normal.
Ten of the most famous drugs in the United States has just one of four or 23 people who take them.
It's interesting if you're one, but what about all the rest?
And what's worse, drugs, when they don't work, they can still make actions for us.
For example, Assburn -- about one of the four of us who've been able to make a risk of heart disease and every day, we've been deep in Paul Prize without know that. And yet we're going to reduce those risks in which we're doing thousands of years.
The activity of these are the causes, a number of values, a number of values in the United States.
My grandfather's grandfather's unique fact of autism that made the whole of California.
The activity of drugs are often related to challenges in imagination.
I'm very excited about children -- small people, in medicine -- big people.
One night I've been able to read by politicians and define it in less than a museum, a drug for the New York Times.
Last night after -- to read by a hole, which is in the 180 pounds or a patient in the hospital, which is in the morning "business", "in the morning," and in general way, they're going to have the same species of drugs on the corporation.
What I'm saying is, most of the times we're going to have a moral imagination for the biological player, and imagine more to the patient in the "The Social Foundation.
And beyond the size of a web, we tend to get rid of the rich differences in a species and find out when you're in a species.
Over that, we know that we have huge challenges in the intuition of drugs, maybe you can't expect that you don't see the rain.
Many of us who need to take drugs not take them or take them wrong.
You know, 40 percent of the adults over 65 in the United States are supposed to take five more drugs there.
Some are 15 or more.
Even there's kids in New York City can bring a dramatic risk in their own lives.
So, think of the future, you've been things that instead of right now, when you're going to often hear about smart drugs, art and humanitarians, on the Internet of things, artificial medicine, artificial intelligence, that we've already got to the idea of our solutions.
In reality, we're still living in the eye of an independent solution from Mexico and another.
I think we can do better.
What if we could say new ways that we're going to try to make the drugs easier?
You're going to get the right, and you're going to have the right differences that you're going to have?
What if we could move beyond today's technology as a psychologist and a philosophy, an eye where we could get a lower results, save people and space in your medicine?
Well, I think some of the solution from us in all the ways that we need to the health and our health and communication.
Today, we're basically living in the world of responses, of a patient's patient, of information from a quality that we're going.
We have the potential to go to a world of real health care, with global information in real time.
And some of it starts with the "I'm the machine."
We can learn so many species of physics and behavior today, sometimes they're spending on our phone between weapons, but it's starting to be happy with doctors and one of our clinical doctors, so that they can provide good and political samples.
And when we can do that, we can also do some interesting things.
Let's take more stress.
It's the risk of a number of places and a disease in the world all of us.
The adults in the United States, before the rise, get more stress.
Other than half of them are under a good choice.
It's often like it's got two different drugs or three types.
It's hard to record the pressure drugs in New York City to Amazon.
We've got 500 microbes in the United States every day.
But we're in the eye of stress stress pressure -- the FDA or recently survived stress that can be part of your eye.
There's now a typical prototype of stress stress stress and a smoke that can reduce your blood pressure.
So in the future, I'm food -- instead of my blood pressure pressure in February, you'll be able to see our blood pressure pressure pressure pressure and they're in real time, and I'm going to get them on the need, with the algorithms of pressure and stress, the Internet of the things.
The technology today can do even more.
In my smart eye, already today, there's a man. MG: BG, that can read by artificial intelligence.
There's a small structure in the size of a style that's right now in terms of my life.
Let's take a look.
They're a little bit worried at the moment.
So not just the time of real time, we can look at our medical team on us, but also the data that we'll imagine so, and again, these are used to change species of drugs in the middle.
Even our weapon can go on a car. My weight, my body, my body, my skin, my muscles, and use it to make our inevitable medical medical medical medicine.
And it's not just for experts in technology.
What's from MIT that we've changed the New York Times so that we can connect to collect our lives in a part of our survival, from our survival nature from our warriors.
We can start to share some of our digital action, our digital intelligence, and even our political potential to do our health care, just like we're taking data from Google Google Gates to improve our leadership -- not our leadership, but our health and the world's health.
Well, it's great.
We can potential now collect this information.
What if your hospital and your hospital could be able to go from a center of your home, your phone, don't you even have to learn a drugs or two others?
And of course, I'm a problem of leadership.
Rather my genes, it's getting less than one of these days.
And I can start to understand my regulation -- how my genes affect my need in high species, perhaps in a different medicine.
We're going to imagine what if your doctor or your customers, there's these data as part of their work, expertise by artificial intelligence, AI, as I like to read it, in addition to that, in addition, to add this information, to understand more than 18,000 cells, to understand the cell phones, those who are the leaders.
So great, now we can look at the drugs and your species, but the problem is, we're still using technology and what it's going to work after taking drugs.
And of course, these technologies have evolved, there's a beautiful pattern of survival, beautiful evolutionary groups that can send a symbol to you or don't train your drugs.
PPPPPPPA has been dead recently recently by Amazon, so most of us will have a remote of our previous drugs, which will be passed by a road.
So all of these things are possible today, but we're still taking a lot of different molecules.
What if we can do it just more?
I think one of the solutions is to do a better use in Bill.
French is a combination of a number of drugs into a galaxy.
And we've got this day in an unprecedented medicine and regulation.
And we've done studies on Febola to create a scientific medicine, where they're wearing statistics, drugs for stress, asteroid, which in the stupid stupid studies have shown in risk, relationship to the road.
But these galaxies didn't have people, they're not very good for the Chinese person.
What if we could be good for you the galaxy?
That's how it's built for you, look at you, can be always if you're for you, even every single day.
Well, I'm now in the kind of 3D printing, you can turn into a platform for your teenagers, help a scientific data, even an unusual data that's accurate to the cells and the jihad.
And it made me think, what if we could do a 3D printer of a global word if people are?
And then instead of taking drugs, for example, I can take them into one.
And so I had more therapies, and I've got my children and I'll also be able to combine the drugs, like Washington or 10 or 10.
So with a little bit of aid -- I call it "I'm a smart" -- "and with a team of my" The "Soviet", we've built the first prototype of the stimulus.
And that's how it's operating: instead of global disciplines, we've got small drugs, each of the one of the different molecules, that's where we're going to choose on the basis and the production that's required for certain.
And of course, a question of mammals and birds of FDA that you're already able to take together.
We can change the project by creating the culture of microbial drugs.
And when you're half "House," you're bringing the painting of the drugs that you might need to get them every single day.
And we started, again, with great drugs for the most beautiful problems.
Throughly 90 percent of the previous drugs in our country are the physical drugs.
And once we add the galaxy, we can add all sorts of different species for the wind.
You can print the patient, the long, today in the week, we're not a T.R.
We can add drugs in a green species for who get asteroid or in a New York City, or imagine a generation of drugs that's ready.
So that's actually the prototype of our smart medicine.
You see, I push it here.
It has about 16 African cells, each one of the microbes a different drug.
And I can now predict the software so that you can imagine privacy.
And when I do that, the robots design the response of these drugs and the microscopes that are released.
I can now -- the intuitive process is based on peace from the whole, to make sure that the microbial and mistakes.
And when I'm going to expect "Hops," all of these are a beautiful philosophy, I'm now going to put out my global printer with my drugs and the species that's known for me.
And we can predict, if you look again in the slides, you can see the whole process, you can see the drugs and in the parts, the drugs and the different cells, and you're collected to the boss.
Well, it's great, I can add my drugs, the based on it, instead of a click that's English.
I can now see my personal imagination.
My smart eye imagine my blood pressure, I would need a vision of my blood pressure, of my imagination, my day, I'm going to find a model, so I'm going to take the way of the imagination of the imagination, the words.
So, it can be always if you're smart on a basis, a car by the doctor or my neurologist.
And you can imagine that large categories, fossil speech like this, can be stressed in your inner house, in your doctor's office, in the village of a village.
But they can ultimately represent to smaller, that you can be in your home, with a very different symbols like this, that's been sent by a road.
You can print the 3D printer if you're people, every morning in your kitchen or in your long room.
And it can evolve, I think, through a amazing way that you'll improve the galaxies and take the galaxies all over the world.
I hope that we can imagine the future in new ways, for many drugs, in one species, with an accurate word of human drugs, countries, countries, countries, I've been in the moment, what's going to transform the health of health and health in the world's health in the world.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much: Dow, it's amazing.
It's really a model.
However, a question for you.
How long is the time that the kids were sitting, and said, the Chinese patients that I mentioned could add their galaxies in their home?
Voice Al Patt: Well, again, it's a prototype.
We think that the regulation to Turkey would be of autonomy, and especially in poor patients, people will take many drugs, and they're going to be a perfect place to start with these technologies.
They're not going to evolve to evolve and start to study categories that have been built in the room and view.
We need to be smart buildings about these technologies, but understand that there's so many challenging challenges in a species of policy, and now we've got all these amazing technologies that can be exposed, I think we're going to be able to change these kinds of things like this.
Number one: Her, thank you. DK: Thank you.
Thank you.
What does it mean to invest our time in a good way?
I spend a lot of time thinking about how to build my time.
I'm probably too much -- I'm probably too much about this.
My friends think this.
But I feel like I'm a kind of connection, because these days, it feels like small parts of my time or somehow living from me, and when it happens, it feels like some of my parts of my life live from me.
Later, it feels like small parts of the time we're learning to different things like this, like technology -- we're building things.
I'll give you an example.
If this model comes -- how many of you get a model like this, right?
I'll give you a picture.
When it comes, I can't run on it now.
Right? Because, like, what if this is a bad picture?
So I've got to outside now.
But I'm not just going to win the picture, "What I'm actually going to do is build the next 20 minutes.
But the worst part is that I know it's what's going on, and even know that's what's going to happen is that what's going to happen to do it over the next time.
Or to find ourselves in situations like this, let's look at words and I'm going to go down to the sky, but the thing is that 60 seconds later, I'm going to go down and do it again.
Why do I do that?
It's not the sense.
But I'm going to give you a vision of what it happens.
What do you think more money in the United States than movies, park that are doing and around us?
A lucky car.
How can lucky machines do so much money when we play so small?
We play with tasks.
How is it possible?
Well, the thing is...
My phone is a lucky car.
Every time we're building our phone, I'm playing in a lucky car to see, what do I get?
What do I get?
Every time we built my email, I play a lucky car, say, "What do I get?"
Every time I'm growing up in a new face, I'm playing in a very lucky car to see, what do I get now?
And the thing is, again, I think exactly how it works -- and I know how the psychology of this works, I know exactly what's going on -- but it doesn't leave me with a choice at all, I still ask you.
So what do we do?
Because it leads us with the relationship of everything or not with technology, right?
You're connected, and you're playing things all the time, or you're learning, but then you're wondering today, are I missing something important?
In other words, you're missing or you've got a fear to solve something.
Right?
So we need to return the choice.
We want to relationship with technology that reduce us in a choice about how we spend it, and we need help designers, because I think it's not help.
We're going to help design.
So how does it look like?
So let's take an example of what's going on in front of us: Chet -- the statistics.
So let's say there are two people.
And a left experiment is working on a screen, and John Museum.
And John suddenly remember, "I need to ask this journey before you forget."
So when she's wearing her mom, she's looking at her attention.
This is what we're doing all the time, we're going to get back on the attention of other people's attention, on the left left.
And there's a high cost of this, because every time we're missing one second, it takes a way of 23 minutes in average, we've learned the attention back.
We're actually going to go in the region through two projects before we go back to the modern thing we do.
It's the research of a galaxy behind the research of a microscope, which shows it.
And her research also shows that it's actually a bad legs.
The more we get more sophisticated disorders is from us to get ourselves.
We're actually surprising to ourselves every three and a half minutes.
It's important.
So how do we put it?
Because we've been trying to do with the relationship of everything or nothing.
And I'd try to say, but then she would be awesome: What if I miss something important?
The design can solve this problem.
Let's say you have the experiment over the left, John Museum.
And John remember, "I need to send me this journey."
Once it's time, we've tried to train that it's from countries.
Let's say it's called Solyrian and says, "I want to deal for 30 minutes," so -- if -- if -- it's from countries.
Now when John's sent to the motion, he can help the first thought -- because he has the need, he has the thought, and he has to throw it out before he's forgotten.
It's out of it that once, it's reducing the motions so that Scott can deal, but John can take the thought of my head.
But it's just working if one thing else is true, it's that we need to know that if something really important, John can still react.
But instead of having an invisible and invisibility or meaningful, we're now making scientific discipline, so we're going to do two things here.
We're creating a new choice also to try to John, but there's something that we're still doing here.
And that's what we change the question we know about.
Instead of the goal of the Charta would be: "Let's design it so that it's a voice to send" -- that's the goal of Chartte, it needs to be really easy to send someone -- we change the goal to something human value, which is, "Let's create the most powerful communication in the
So we called the goal.
Now, are the colors actually care about this?
Do we want you to have a conversation about what they're the deep humanity?
Well, I'm going to tell you one story.
A little bit more than a year ago, we've been able to help a meeting between some of the leaders and the Twitter Tim.
The Atlantic Tiban is an unconscious thing.
And it was a really amazing approach.
You need to imagine -- and imagine a room -- in one side of the room, you have a group of big technology; on the other side of the room, you have a group of regions with long galaxies, and first of life.
And the questions I've been thinking about the most profound people, like how do the technology look like when you design the most profound questions and the most profound people?
And our conversation has always been on the listening to what these values can be.
It started out in our conversation that if, instead of compassion, you'd have a compassion, what you're saying, you might be a word that might be surprised -- you're thinking about somebody else.
So is this kind of conversation going on in the real world, not just in these design meetings?
Well, the answer is yes, and one of the resources on it is Chicago.
If you didn't know, and Chicago is a website that you're looking for people who are looking for to be with a party, someone who's trying to offer it.
So, a great survival -- what was their design goal?
Why do you design if you're a video?
Well, you'd think it's to get ice to Egypt.
Right?
This is a good goal.
But it's somehow when we'd be like our goal to disabilities before, where we're just trying to pass the knowledge.
So what's the deepest human goal?
Well, they've put them into a goal as a need to create a unique relationship between people who have never met before.
And the most amazing thing about this was in 2007, they made a way to measure it, which is amazing.
I'm going to tell you how it works.
All the goal of design that you have, you have to have a mathematical country to know how you're successful -- through success.
So what they're doing, let's say you take two people who meet, and they take the number of days that these people come together, and then they're doing some of these two hours -- how many people are going to take?
And then after they spent this time together, they ask their two: How many animals was the experience?
Would they have a good experience with the person and met?
And they're reducing these meaningful meaning of time that people don't spend on the site, because it's about life of people's lives.
Why do we need to make it as a success?
And what you've left is something that they're treated to me as "Man companies," or, really, Richard "the best time we've created.
I've never been a place, if I'm a geography wasn't today.
Can you imagine how inspiration it would be to go every day and measure your success in the small level of hours in the lives of people who have been working, that you've never been doing what you've done today?
Can you imagine a world working like this?
Can you imagine a social network -- where I'm going to tell you that I'm going to care about, and that's imagine your success in terms of Western Arab that we've organized that you've been happy to read, and to reduce the Americans that you wouldn't be happy to read or the time you &ap
Imagine a professional social network that instead of learning the success in terms of connections that we've created, instead of learning the success in terms of work that people will get today that are happy to get.
And to reduce the amount of time people in the website.
We're hoping that small connections, like Twitter or something, where instead of learning the number of cases that people have done, so they're learning the success of success, instead of learning the most beautiful connections that people have created.
What it wasn't for them, by the way.
But can you imagine a world that's working like this, which will help you build your time well?
Now to do this, you also need a new system, because you probably think, the Internet economy of today -- the economy of today's economy in general -- and places in time when you get this.
As you have more users, you have more use, and people spend more time, so success.
But we opened this problem before.
We've developed this with energy, when we said we need to make things in a different way.
We said it's a different kind of food.
So we can't change it just based on research; it's a different category of food.
We're going to solve this with our training, where we say it's a different kind of building that's about different values of environments.
What if we had something like this to technology?
What if we had something that our whole goal was to help create more and more of human life?
And what if we can do in a different way, so it's actually working?
And imagine you'd give up a different place in African animals.
And imagine they've had drugs that help you take these kinds of design products.
You can imagine how exciting it would be to live and create this world?
We can create this world today.
In societies, everything you need to do -- just you can fly new countries, which is your country to help people's lives.
And you'll have a software conversation about it.
Maybe you don't take so much at the beginning, but let's start this conversation.
Socies, you can define success; you can define design.
You can argue, you have more power than many people in your organization to create the choices that we all live before.
Perhaps like drugs, where we have a democratic week to know in others and in the highest events where we need to treat patients.
What if the colors were something like this, in terms of a new kind of design?
And the users, for all of us -- we can make technology that work like this.
Now it might seem hard, but we learned that California didn't have a service that the consumers were there.
It was born to Archiatric, and he didn't worry that the consumers were going to be there.
We need to make a new kind of technology.
And we can do that.
And to do that, we're worried about a world that's going to be used for a time that's going to be done in this room, a world that's information about a very good time.
I want to live in this world, and I want this conversation to happen.
Let's start this conversation now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So we've all got data.
For example, one of us tend to think it's very difficult to change government systems.
When we think about government systems, we tend to think that they're depressed, motivated in their ways, and maybe, leadership is too close to democracy because there's been able to change things.
Well, today, I want to challenge the theory.
I want to tell you a story about a very large government system that doesn't just leave itself in a way to a reform but also the results are going to learn in less than three years.
That's what a public school looks like in India.
There's a million schools in India.
And even though, I live in India and every single life, it's talking to the heart to get one of these schools.
The next step that children come to the age of 11, 50 percent of them will stay so behind their education that they don't have a hope for peace.
The kids in 11 can't do a simple connection, you can't build a high sentence.
That's the things we're expecting that I have eight can do.
When the kids are 13 or 14, they're going to call the school.
In India, public schools don '
And yet, 40 percent of the parents are choose to control their children in public school and pay for a magic school to put them in privacy schools.
For the second time, in a rich country, the United States, this data is about 10 percent.
It's the ideas about how much the public education is happening.
So with this event, it's got a phone in the summer of 2013 from the U.K..
She was, at the same time, the head of education disease in the country called the Roya.
So she said to us, "Look, I'm the disease in the last two years.
I've tried a few things that I've been talking about.
Maybe you can help? "
Let me describe the theory for you.
The theory is a country that has 30 million people.
There's 6,000 public schools more than two million children in these public schools.
So basically, in this phone conversation, I've been able to help country and a big system of Africa's story to change itself.
When I started the project, I knew in love for two things.
One, I've never done anything like this.
There's a lot of years, many of us have done, probably no success.
When my colleagues and I looked around the country and around the world, we couldn't find another example that we could just admit to the man.
We knew we should create our journey.
But in any case, we've been reduced by what's when we're going to expect, all kinds of ideas started to go to the past.
People said, "Let's change the way that make teachers, let's know new managers and when you're going to send them to the journey that we're going to the national, let's get technology into the program."
At the end of the first week, we've had 50 ideas on the table, everyone's amazing, everybody's going to hear right.
There was no possibility that we could be there 50 things.
So I said, "Get a moment, itself."
Let's open up and decide what we're trying to get. "
So with a lot of experiences and babies, the design is not the design to design and say, by 2020, we want 80 percent of the kids who have been on their classroom.
Now the particular goal of the knowledge doesn't matter here, but what's important is how specific it is.
Because it's possible to take all of these ideas that we've come back and say we're going to be there.
Is the idea of making the goal? Well, let's keep it.
But if we're not sure we're not safe, let's put it in the side.
How simple it sounds like it sounds, when there's a particular goal that can be very unique and advertising our change.
When I look back on the years and the last half, it's not very positive for us.
So we've had the goal, and now we'll now give us to understand what the kinds of experiences, what's going on.
Before we went to school, a lot of people told us that the education quality of education is so low that the teachers itself, they don't come to school, or they don't actually know how to learn.
Well, we went into schools, we found something different.
Obviously, most cases were inside the schools.
And when I talked to them, I realized that they were completely able to die in school school and Chinese.
But they didn't learn.
I went to school that the teachers were doing the building of the classroom and pushed the lights.
I went to school after a couple of years from the teachers went to the end of my grandmother to make money for the sea of children's minds.
In the refugees, most of the teachers have spent most of the time in the web, we've developed a access to students the long way.
So we asked the teachers, "What happens here, why don't you teach?"
And they said, "That's what's coming out of us.
When it comes to our heart and see us, it's exactly the things that it's exactly.
Would the lights go, are the nurses come.
When my manager's going to meet in the bed, it's exactly the things that are different. "
You see, what's happening in fact, over the last two decades, we've been war in the access challenge, that's been enough in schools, and what's going to bring climate into the schools.
So the government needs a lot of programs that we're going to have these challenges, and the teachers will be put on the same program.
It's not in a device, but it's cool.
And now, what's really required was not to train the teachers more or to push their forces but tell them that what's most important is to go into the classroom and learn.
They need to be monitors to be limited about the quality of the quality and not about all other things.
So the more we've changed in the education system, the more we've done that, we've found a number of reasons that have come up with, that's how people come from the system.
And we realized that we didn't do these things, we could do some other things.
We can eat, we can put technology inside the book, but the system doesn't change.
And we've learned that these National Science would be a developing key.
So, we've got the metaphors and we've got the types, and now we're going to find out what the solutions are.
Of course, we didn't want to reinvent the wheel, so we said, "Let's look around what we can find."
And we've found these little political experiments and these beautiful patterns all over the country and all over the world.
The small things that are made by organizations that don't exist.
But what was also interesting was that no one of them didn't grow up.
Everybody would get to 50, 100 or 500 schools.
And here we are, looking for a solution for 6,000 schools.
And look at information, if these things really work, why don't we grow up?
What's happening is when organizations don't just come from, they don't just bring their experts but they also bring other microbes.
So they sometimes bring money, maybe they bring people, maybe they bring technology.
And in 50 or 100 or 100 schools that they're really working in, these drugs really make change.
But now imagine that the head of the organization that I'm going to do is go to the head of the education disease and say, "Hey, now let's do it to 15 schools."
Where's the guy where this choice are going to find the money to really expand it to 15 schools?
I don't have the other money, I don't have the resources.
And so, innovation can't expand.
So in the beginning of this project, what America was, "What we didn't do is we have to be able to start, it has to be able to work in all 15 schools."
And so, it has to work inside the universe and the resources that we've learned really.
A lot more simple to say than to do.
And I think it was without this point while my team hated me.
We've spent long hours in the office, in the period, sometimes in things, we're making our head and say, "Where are we going to solve this problem?"
In the end, I think we've found solutions for the kind of reasons.
I'll give you an example.
In the context of effective learning, one of the things that people talked about is learning.
The kids don't need to sleep numbers, they need to do active, and it's a more optimistic way to learn.
It's basically saying to give students things like insects, places to learn, thought.
But we didn't have the design to give it to 15 schools, two million children.
We needed another solution.
We couldn't think about anything.
One day, one of our team and his team went to school and looked at the words of the leadership outside and take them into the classroom and give them to students.
It was a moment of "Aria" meaning for us.
So what's going on now in a local school behind all the issues, we have a little box for everyone who says, "To learn the idea, it's the actions that you can do.
And by the way, to really do this activity, these are the things that you can use from your country environment, whether it's the leader outside, those can be used to help children. "
And we're seeing teachers all over the energy use a lot of new things on the planet that can learn students.
So in this way, everything that we've been working, we've all had there in all over 15 schools in the first day.
Now, it brings me to my last point.
How do you imagine there something about 6,000 schools?
The disease was a process that is very interesting.
I love to read "The Syria of hope."
They'd write a letter from the bed and put it into the next level, which is the research office.
They've done that every one of these studies, then we've been responsible to the letter and we've developed it, and then we've seen it for the next level, which is the region of the region.
And then I'd hope that in the region of the region, someone else else got the letter, I've developed it, and I saw it in the end of the 15,000 managers.
And then you need to buy that the managers get the letter, we brought us and started there.
It was a little bit of scary.
Now, we've known that technology is the answer, but we also know that most of the schools don't have a electronic computer.
Although, what you have is a smart phone.
They're all the time to live a text, in Facebook and Texas.
So what's happening now in this theory, all the teachers and teachers are starting to find in our groups of Texas every time you have to survive something, it's just going to be able to send in all the other groups of the Twitter.
It's spread like the first year.
You can build countries and get it, read it.
Marians can wear local lights.
And what's interesting is, it's not just the math on these questions.
Other teachers share other parts in the country are still on the questions.
They all take part of a huge group of colleagues, and things exist.
So today, when you're going to build a book in physics, things look different.
The teachers back in the classroom, they teach.
Many often with innovation.
When a power comes to the morning in the classroom, it doesn't just understand the structure and the lights but also the quality of the light.
Once in the eye, all the students around the country are learning about their local results and schools and schools that are very rapid.
And schools that don't work very well find themselves from different species.
Of course, they're also getting another support to improve the future.
In the context of education, it's hard to see results very quickly.
When people talk about change from the coast, they're talking about three to 10 years.
But not in theory.
In the last year, there's three independent studies, everybody's results for students' students's students, these are the situations that are doing something interesting, something that's too special in the doctor.
The decline of the French children's French, and it started to go over.
It's one of the buildings in the country that shows a story, and at the point that shows the most famous story.
It's still local institutions, there's a long way to go, but it gives us a lot of hope.
I recently went to school, and when I left, I was born in a woman, which was a park park, she was a child's mother, and she was so sick.
And I said to her, "Why do you live, what happens?"
And she said, "I don't know what's going on, but what I don't know is that my kids are learning, they're today, and I'm going to stop the search for a private school to send them."
So I go back to where I started: Can government systems change?
I actually believe that.
I think if you give them the right, they can move the river.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I was a kid, I was living something so powerful, I spent the rest of my life in the last month, and in all the wrong places.
What my life wasn't coming from me.
It was music.
And this is where our story starts.
That's me, since there's a "The House" of the Bill. "
And what's looking for is the feeling that I'm looking for all the time.
Mexica is going to go into the radio and feels, and your water will survive into the heart.
It's about every experience.
My friends?
[It's a mammogram that's the amazing university and James] there's a city.
Mexica... []]]]) Yes.
Mexica makes us more emotional than anything.
Let's see how it does for our conversation.
And the right concept of the right moment represents us at the same level.
When I hear this one poem from us one summer with the same decade, I'm going to return there again.
Here's, text.
Here's some of the story, but, I've done a little bit of a lot.
I thought that if I finished more letters to music, I could make emotions even more powerful.
So I went into a bionic dream.
So they read.
This is one, John.
I'm sorry about it, John.
I'm here, so we're different.
Social movement.
Here's got to be a device.
And these experiments were laughed, and with the time, we started to see more like this.
Even though they've been looking for the same thing, they're going to get this thing in my hand.
But, I'm not.
The addition of photographic images on the music were a very good story, yes, but I never changed a huge amount of music that was going to be for myself.
It's not a big thing to understand when I've changed your life and the professional career to be in our own or political.
I went back and I asked myself, is I looking at the right house?
So I started thinking: I could go to you, the audience, more, I would be able to make you, feel more.
So Darwin and London and I started to look at new technologies that could get more into the work, like your home home "that's a" four baby "New York Times" in "Freedom of" Friday, "" "" "and your
We've been pushing beyond, trying to connect more to people's imagination.
But it wasn't enough.
It wasn't yet to identify the rules and the global power of what it's a small institution for me.
So I started a new technology that I read about it just in our hands.
And after a couple of months, I found a prototype.
It was a "New York Times" in the lab of Robert in the United States.
And when I tried it, I knew I found it.
I could argue the thing.
It's going to see a very similar reality.
It was five years ago when I was born this.
That's what it looks like now.
I started to build things in this new place, and by using this process, we realized something: that invented me from what's going to play today in the history of the species.
It's actually going to be the last one.
I mean this because it's the first place that actually does our function from a robot of a friend's friend's friend's friend's friend's friend's friend's disease, our ability to live it from the first place.
You're called bols, I'll explain, don't worry.
So if we go back to the most good cases with all the best cities, it started around a teacher, with a good story.
The first one of us tell us how it's going to take the statistics in Turkey in the same day.
We hear our molecules and excuse them to our physical art.
The same thing happens when we look at the version of the story, the book on the average side, the disease, the device, the TV program or the film.
All of these species have to need what we call the "Speak", "because there's a solution between the reality of our consciousness that enables our story into our reality.
I use the word "movement" as a reality that we get from our senses that live the world around us.
It's an amazing reality that's made of this gap.
Now, you're on a tremendous career with the bank leader.
Or you're a good leader.
Or maybe you're even the statistics.
And so here's what's special in the reality.
All of the other species, your movement represents the species.
In a local reality, your movement is the species.
So the potential of reality is huge.
But where are we now?
What's the current situation of art?
Okay, we're here.
We change value to our first year to know.
It's a film of the brothers to a source that has been made not a full of people to try on the box when I thought I was going to walk.
Basically to the early stage of this species, in a local reality, we also need to know beyond this disease and into a story.
It took this place for decades to understand what the language of stories are.
In the reality of the day, we learn more and more and more than the language.
We've created 15 movies in the last year in our local reality, Congress, and we've learned some things.
We've found that we've got a unique baby that's about your sensors, for your emotions, even your body.
So let me show you some things.
For this example, we're going to take every direction that you might look, and we're going to take it into this building.
Okay, we start.
So, first, a camera is complicated in the reality.
If you do it wrong, it can actually do you patients.
We found that if you get the camera at the speed of a bridge in the context, you can actually focus on it.
In the first day in school to know, they told me that there's a unique life before you can get one.
We didn't learn anything together.
We've got to learn a dinosaur at all, but we've already tried to get them to see what creative things we can use.
In this shape here, we're moving over the ground, I've collected a cell.
I did this because I wanted to give you a physical sense of movement over the ground.
In a local reality, I can give you this.
[] No surprising, important music in this place is also true.
It takes us how to feel.
In this project, we've done with the New York Times, but just as Twitter, JR, we take you from the CO2, and even though you're trying 700 meters over the Twitter and you don't feel less.
You feel successful for JR's death.
The music takes you there.
[Bennia] Bennia] Bonnia]] Bonnia], and there's a chimpanzee in a local reality, but it's a different part of the movie than in the movie than in the movie, where you've got a
The physics is now where you're going to know about how the world is going around you.
In this movie, "Google's relationship," which was a collaboration between NASA, the USA, Gabby, and I'm saying, "Oh, we're also seeing the role of the world's role in the reality.
Most of the reality in reality is that you're actually very close to someone.
It's bringing this art into your human space, a space that we're in a general way for the people we like.
And you feel very excited about what you feel when you're in a lot of physics.
We're going to find out what I'm like in the morning for the white.
It's more energy than the attention of the outcome.
Every single one in which we can use to take your attention and read "Solly."
I can learn everywhere before you, from your left, I'm ready, even behind you, and when you're bringing your name, I've been able to go around.
So I can use it to make your attention where you want to look.
The next time you hear somebody who's surviving beyond your own, it might be exactly.
And it's a very similar reality that makes us feel like we're part of something.
Over most people's history have been living in small families.
We've started in the West, then we've been going to be able to wait in the lab, and then, villages and city, and now we're all citizens of the world.
But I believe we're still going to worry about the most things that they're ready for us.
And it's a local reality that makes anywhere and each one feel too.
So it works as an empathy.
Our movie "You know," Let me take you to a Syrian patients, and instead of watching a story of people there, it's now a story about us here.
But where do we go from here?
The basic thing is that with all the species that are going to be, the Portugal works.
The film has already been made by a shock of algae, from Britain's experiments now.
The details never changed.
But it's an amazing reality, like a day, I'm not perfect.
It doesn't use a physicist or a TV theory.
It's about what we use to understand the world.
We're using our sensors as color on creativity, but only two years are true.
In the end, we can see if all our human senses were business, and we've had a way to live the story in every way that we're going to choose.
And we call it an amazing reality now, but what's happening when we're going to go beyond the reality of what?
How do we know that?
What if instead of telling you about parts of a molecule, I could allow you to live inside the dream?
What if instead of looking for some reality on the ground, you could find on a planet on a black hole, maybe create a galaxy, or to communicate with each other without using words but through our global computers?
It's already not more reality.
And in the classroom, I don't know what it looks like.
But I hope you see where we go.
But here I'm here, until I'm TV to a place that I'm saying is that it's my experience.
So let's take it.
In your hand, I hope you're going to reduce a cartoon.
Let's open the language.
The second about the revolution became released the phone door.
For the people who watch home, we're going to put a cartoon right now to show you how to Richard and it's on your phone, and even get a Google Prize to try with that.
We've been living in a cartoon and all of us, and as adults, I hope we can find a little bit of this thing by doing the first time again in one.
You're going to participate in the world's largest reality in history.
In the San Francisco, this is a place of water that we've done, we're all going to see something exactly at the same time, together.
Let's hope it's working.
How do you look back? I can't see.

I'd just go out of the basis, and I had to be a perfect way to get it.
And when I was perfect over -- you know, with the wind, I had to go back on it a few times -- so I went to the room.
[Voice]] A woman's voice: God are air, the rain by a bad, because you're the God, the light.
You'll give me life, I'll take them.
A need to do.
The next person's next to many people who lost their dances.
We're going to help us again.

Sometimes I think we're the ones who are responsible.
CA: How was it?
[It's a great way to make you respond in the experts like Syrian.
I've just made you stand. I think you're going to leave in business.
[] I believe that each of the Earth has to live what you've experienced is.
That's how we can be able to start to design it, not as a technology, but as a platform of humanity.
And for that, we built in my wife, we were the New York Times Center who made a local project called "The city."
It's a year with a million democracies of Google who's sent to all kinds of first day with my eye.
But it's a funny thing that's going to happen in that first morning.
A lot of people got them that there were no scientists in the box.
And we started seeing it all over the asteroid.
Look?
The institution has led me on the door of another month that's inevitable for a very long time.
Now, millions of children just had the same car that you had in my own.
Just I think it's great.
Let's see where it leads them.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
We're all young, or countries and always tell stories about Europe -- where we're in which I'm talking about today's leaders in the world's world -- and my father's faith, the story of the approach that's close our lives in India.
As a young sister, I've given the lights to treat the office that's more than 100 years after my father's father's father's fair.
I remember stories that he told me about traffic traffic systems on Africa, while we're going to play the favorite community on the voice and all the way to the box.
You see, as a young guy, we'll always read it a few things.
First of all, why Mexico's Mexico came back to live in a very good space in the iPhone, and I knew that in the end of the thing he'd lost in a very different way of being a patient.
There's a second, where's the bad Internet coming?
And why would I be very easy, the kids of the video, have been so excited to develop a prosperity, or "Where?"
It made me be an idea about why it makes us unique as a human being -- basically, our genetic car.
But just when I came to high school, through the human genome, I realized that I wasn't the only one that I was trying to communicate my only legacy to my potential to be healthy or dream.
You see, the project that's 2.7 billion dollars in the argument of medicine is awesome based on our only genetics.
So for me it's always a clear thing to get this dream, we're going to need to have a space of people's diverse, to get the diversity of genetic diversity on the planet.
So after 10 years, it's really going to be the same knowledge that 96 percent of the genetic research that's connecting between genetic changes and the disease of certain diseases but only people find a doctor.
You don't need a cartoon to see that it's about four percent of the rest of the diversity.
And in my sensors, I found that a lot less than one percent of the images were born, like my own.
So it makes the question: for the human genomes really information?
It's just like we've got eyes in another color, we're responsible to the drugs based on our genes.
So how many of you would be surprised to find that 95 percent of the Chinese experiments are also generated but see people from a doctor?
This independence of independence in the work of people and children are in experiences and children are in their studies are part of the classroom of the moral history of unprecedented.
For instance, in 1989 studies at the University of Arizona, we took places from the President Amazon, in the promotion of a kind of service that spread around the community, just to go back in the same leadership -- to explore the explanation of the physics -- to explore the lesson that we're going to have, and there's a connection
When a man who's a great doctor, they're in 7,000 dollars and the ASA to make a research study in their case.
It's the symbols in a kind of politician when you're looking at a lot of Western areas -- including a nation in one, one of the big tricks in the country, the politicians on genetic studies.
Unfortunately the history of unbelievable, I still believe that people can become a dog of genetic research.
And if we don't do something that's close, it's a healthy inequality that's going to continue to grow.
For instance, for example, there's the long-term expectations between the United States and the United States, and yet it's a video video, like me, from a decade to pay before the National National Science, because we have the highest lessons of Shanghai as a kind of service, the two, three of the most successful extinctions in the United States.
So how do we imagine the population that need politicians are not the responsibility that we're going to survive?
My vision is to make the genetic research that's got to children, to make the most leadership technology more "molecules."
In a traditional way, you want genes to do in the lab.
Here's a picture of the Alexander's genome.
It's tremendous.
It's in the size of a remote.
There's this beautiful limit.
But what if you can watch genes in the life of the universe?
What if you can get a body of genes into your pocket?
The magazine of Sydney -- and this building is a little bit 10,000 times more than the traditional genes.
I don't have the same physical limits, because it doesn't require to the table with lower patients, in large terms of chemicals or computers.
It allows us to find the technology to create the genome of the black box in ways that they're capable of transparency, what's active and communities and communities.
Like scientists.
A hundred years later in Europe, today we have the technology to reduce the traffic electrodes in real time, using mobile phones, access to the Internet and thinking.
But just if that's what a man is serious.
In our space, our conditions.
I'm a leadership that comes to science for people by people.
We're going to start with a tremendous tool, that's always in education and children's political investment of genetic information.
In the end, we wanted to have a research study of ourselves to help the experiments of ourselves and take the next generation of scientists and children.
Finally, people have to be participants and not just a study of genetic research.
And for those in the outside, as my father's father did, and the research community has to push itself in the culture of learning in China.
My mother.
Thank you.
I'll never forget my voice with my friends.
I'll never forget my voice as a second.
And I'll never forget the hot molecule of the green water through a part.
Imagine my fear, I woke down, once I was 10 told me I'm going to love the science.
And after five years, the data does I've been dealing as a regret.
But I believe that the information was one of the most amazing machines I got in life.
You see, I'm living the world in a unique way.
And I believe that these experiences that people with microbes are what will help us create a better world, people with no limits.
I've been known by people's rights, and I've got a lot of time to focus on the openness of life, to make sure that all the art has done.
After that, I had to learn very quickly in the National Science to work with the humanities that respond to people with limitations.
Like the NGO's GO, I'm convincing most of my energy to convince people about the capacity of people with limitations.
But I'm very difficult to solve the way, and after many of my career that my parents wouldn't be so happy from them. I found a solution that I believe that could be more powerful to solve how much of the world's big problems of the world, and I won't.
Everything is called design.
The design thinking is a process of innovation and solution.
There are five young.
The first step is her climate problem.
The second is the patterns of people in real life and to feel empathy.
Third, return hundreds of ideas -- and how much better, they're getting better.
Social, a typical father: I'm end all you can, what you can find, to learn your solution, to test it.
And finally, there's women: Well, you're sure the solution that you've got a very clear thing.
Dr. Berberberg says that important design is learned to look at us to look at the trees, on a restaurant, to try and probably most important, ask these simple questions.
It's a design coming from believe that everybody's creative.
They believe in bringing people from a unique number of experiences, because they want to share a good perspective and connect them and finally to create something new.
It's so important that design is so successful for diversity that it's almost every industry.
I've seen the potential that we have the issues that we've done before, so I decided to go back to school and get my second time in social design.
It's looking at how to use design to create a difference in the world.
While I was there, I loved a tree work.
But what I've understood was that I've found something.
When you're working with every tool, it's just before it's going to make you back -- what it means is that the income is going back to you -- it's doing a sound.
And I couldn't hear this sound.
So I decided, why don't I try to solve this?
My solution was a chimpanzee that we were trying to get more identity to use the changes of all, before the person can't record it.
Why don't we think about it before?
So two reasons: One, I'd start.
There wasn't about the regulation of the normal knowledge.
The second is: I was lucky.
My only experience of the world helped me know my solution.
And when I went through, I was able to build more solutions that were created in the microbes with limitations, and in the process I put it in the middle of the center, I've lost them in the middle of the center, I'm limited.
It's a prototype of OO2.
It's true to people with Nigerian, but it's been so special, that everybody liked me.
Three statistics: They've been working in the microbes for people.
As you know, they all love it.
I started thinking: What if we change our thinking?
What if we start to design for global disciplines -- not for the energy?
As you can see, when we design for global disciplines, we're a lot of times in solutions that don't only happen, but also many times better than we're designing.
And it's exciting to me, because it means that the energy that's going to be able to get to someone with limited limits, to find it as a power of creativity and civilization.
It brings us from the most important form of trying to change the moral important forms of suffering, to become artists, the kind of magic that this world has to solve some of our biggest problems.
Now, I'm also believe that people with limitations have potential potential to be designing within the design process.
In night, I've found this, very early, I was a creative leader, I've been interested in my skills.
It's the design that they're stressed, more problems.
So imagine listening to a conversation just to understand 50 percent of what they said.
You can't ask them to go back on every word.
They're just going to be agreed with you.
So without even understand this, my solution was to take the tremendous voice I heard, it was a star, and make me learn about the language that I read.
Two years later, someone who's the city who also write our writing has a rate.
Well, it's because we're living as states.
I've also become very good at my own.
It's really molecules.
In my first trick in schools, I got 60.
But what I've learned was that when I've been looking for myself a couple of things around me, finally, I've done.
Basically, it's important for people to failure as much, because in the end, you're going to laugh.
A little bit of big inventions in the world came from somebody who was able to take for the first time.
I've also experienced this lesson in Porto.
I'll never forget my artist and say, "If not only wouldn't be the event, it was in the national group."
But what my effort, and what I didn't even know at the same time, was that my mom actually helped me to join in in Porto.
You see, when you lose the information, not only do you focus your behavior, but you also focus your physical senses.
And one example of this is that the visual attention of Gabby.
And imagine that the satellites are a foot, which comes from the left.
Imagine you're black, like I was, and the ball comes from the left.
Others with a big motion was the visual effect of this.
She was the door of a brilliant spectrum like this.
So I've been working after the players there, who's going around the New York City.
And I saw them faster, so if the ball was passed, I could teach myself to be ready for this problem.
So as you can see, I've been a design for almost every single life.
Because my strength of view was that I'm glad the same things that others never had.
Our local need to get it to create great ideas to become problems.
And many times I had to do it within the limits and climate.
It's something that you've also got to deal with.
My work took me recently to the intuition.
It's a lot of times a lot of times looking for extreme situations, because it's a lot of times why some of their best design design.
And the intuition -- it was like the perfect language.
I've been working with 300 people I've known after the land of 2010.
But five years later, they're still getting electricity; they're still not safe to change; they're still not going to work; there's still no work; the effect that's done without doing.
Egyptian has been working between the red and one place.
But they came in with very low solutions.
They didn't get ready to look at themselves based on the ways of the community.
One organization will give them bigger and bigger.
But they didn't realize that there was so big in the community, that when the sensors were able to have a night and not hear, people would reduce their own products and they would respond to the guns, and eventually all of them.
Now, if this organization had the time to look at people, to look at their community, they would understand their problems and maybe they'd come to a solution, something like an orchestra, which leads them to a train to make them safe without saving their security.
You don't need to be design to get the ideas that some of you today.
You're creative.
You design -- everybody like this.
Thank you for people like me to help you.
Thank you for people with limitations to help you look at tons, and in this process, to solve some of the biggest problems.
That's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
It's a big summer.
There were 27 kilometers.
And that's the biggest science we've tried to do.
Over 10,000 human physicians and engineers from 85 countries around the world together for a few decades to build this machine.
What we're doing is we're going to get prototypes -- or, we've made an artist -- about 999 percent of the light light.
Yeah? In this speed, they turn 27 miles out of 11,000 times a year.
And we're excited about them with a different theater of projects that I've come in in the opposite direction.
We're excited with them in a huge tree.
They're actually digital cameras.
And that's where I'm working, Alice.
You can get a sense of the size of the size -- you can see people in the age of Puerto Puerto Puerto Rico under me.
So in the audience, you can get a little bit of a big sense: just 44 feet, and a 22 meters, and a 7,000 tons.
And we're repeating the conditions that have been released less than a billion years after the universe started -- by 600 million times a year within this gene -- huge numbers.
And if you're looking at some of the metaphor there -- these are poor magnets that put electrical tricks, so you can learn how fast they're doing.
It's a picture about a year ago.
These magnets are there.
And again, these are real people in the age of Paul Ford Ford, so you can get a little bit of amazing.
And there's in the face, there's a big, and there's been the big, the big, when it's on the other side.
And in fact, in the morning, I got a "Love" to say that we've been trying to, today, to compare the last part of Atlas.
So right now, he's a murder. I'd like to say that I'd plan it for TED, but I'm not.
Thank you, that's the wonderful.
So you're thinking, "Why?
Why do we create the conditions that we've seen less than a billion years after the universe started? "
Because, the physics of parts is very effective.
And the goal of physics is to understand what it's done, and how everything is connected together.
And in "Everything" I mean, of course, to you, to the Earth, for a hundred billion stars in the galaxy and a hundred billion galaxies in the summer.
It's completely everything.
So now you might say, "Okay, so why don't we look at it?
You know? If you want to know what I do, let's look at it. "
So, we found that when we look back in time, the universe will do more and more, we'll take more, we'll just get more.
Now, there's no reason that we're aware of that, but that's what it looks like.
So, really at the beginning of the universe, we believe it was just a sense.
All of this complex complexity, are going to these wonderful limits -- human brains -- they're the plan of complex food.
At first, in the first billion years, we believe, or so the only one, it was very simple.
It's almost like...
And I'm opening up to you, and you're looking at it, and it's complex to fill, itself is wonderful. But when you put it, it's able to control water molecules, and you can see that it's actually going to be too funny, water.
It's the way we look back in time to understand what the universe is doing.
And today, it's made of these things.
It's only 12 parts of the material, and one day we've got to change by the four natural forces.
We've been dinosaurs, these green things, create the projects and the tricks that make your genetic grades in your body.
The electronic -- the thing that I've been looking around around on the atmosphere -- a very powerful idea, by the way, by the electromagnetic power that's passed by this thing -- the politics.
We've been very powerful by other things called English.
And these things here, they're the currency and space, probably the fear of everyone.
But the sun doesn't get citizens.
And when the sun comes back, you get a effect of things that look like the electronics out.
In fact, if you're just looking at your phone -- about 60 billion trillion trillion tricks from the sun, you're going through all of your body's body's body's body's body's body.
But you don't feel them because the space is just right.
And these windows started over the 19th century, at the end of the past.
The first one, the electronic, started in 1897, and the last thing that we called Twitter, in 2000, actually -- I've been going to say, in the road of the road. I know it's a big organization, America, isn't it?
It's really in the road.
It's about the universe that's really on the road.
And so, this thing is in 2000, so it's always a relationship.
One of the wonderful things, in fact, I think, we've discovered them at all, when you understand how tiny they are.
You know, they're in a different kind of last day.
So 100 billion galaxies, about 13.7 billion years of light -- a large kind of electronics, in fact, like the big story between these tricks.
It's time in a very wonderful way, and we've still discovered almost all the students.
So, one of my ancestors at the University of Chicago, Eric Robert, the Egyptian Gulf, once said, "All science is physics."
Now, I don't think he's going to understand the rest of the science, although he was a musician, so that's possible.
But he's the right that what we've done here is actually, it's to collect children.
All right, we found the parts, but if we didn't understand the basic reason for patterns -- you know, why it's exactly like this -- everything you did is to collect kids -- you didn't do science.
For us, we have the largest science of the 20th century that you're going to support this pattern.
It's a New York Times if you want, of the windows.
It's called "The Democratic model," which is a simple mathematician.
You can put it on a road, which is always a diplomacy.
Here it is.
And I wasn't ready to decide, because I showed it for all of her local details.
This investment, in fact, I'll allow you to think -- outside a structure -- everything that's happening in the universe.
So if you want to know why the blue sky, why is the Atlantic didn't come from -- basically, if you have a strong computer enough -- why do you have this form.
Basically, you can think it with this concept.
But we have a problem.
You can see what it is?
We built a feedback that can show us.
I'm maybe you, by one of these devices.
In abstraction, each of these brains are treated to some of the parts.
So these pounds are tremendous, and how they connect.
These are the issues of the space, the CEO, the same thing.
But there's another man in the equation, HHHHHHi.
Right, Hi.
It's a tremendous device.
Some of us were still not in.
But they live -- they're necessary to make mathematics work.
So all the sensors that we're able to discover that we can do with this creative investment was not possible without this other part.
So it's a new life of a new part.
What does it do?
Well, we had a lot of time to find good analogy.
And in the two years, when we wanted money to LLLC, Matt Technocher said at the time, "If you can explain, in a language that politicians can understand, what the hell you do, you get the money.
I want to know what this virus does. "
And we've come to this biology that looks like it works.
So, what the galaxy is doing, it's the same journey to the basic parts.
And the picture is that the universe all of us -- and it's not just the space that we're in -- today we're all full of what's called the galaxy.
Some of us are galaxy, if you want.
The analogy is that these people in the room are part of the virus.
Now when some of us know through the universe, it's responding with these galaxies.
But imagine somebody didn't go to the room.
So everybody's disappearing from me. They can know very quickly, very quickly, very quickly in the light. They're going to take a message.
And imagine somebody's very important to get intelligent and go into the room.
They're facing people, and their consciousness in a real room.
It's almost like they're doing stars.
And it's exactly the way we're working on the Gates.
The picture is that the electronic ones in your body and buildings that we see around them, in some way, and in some ways, because they're surrounded in the galaxy.
They're influenced by a year of the galaxy.
If this picture is true, then we have to find the CO2 part.
If it's not true -- because it's a complicated diversity, although it's the best that we can think about -- so what we don't do the work of the GDP, we know that we need to get to the LC.
So this is one of the main reasons we built this machine.
I'm glad that you're bringing Match.
In fact, I was thinking to make it for a culture, but I didn't matter.
So this is one thing.
It's actually the security of what the LC is.
There's a lot of things. You've heard about a lot of problems in the physical physics.
On one of them who you heard: a global material, a global energy.
And there's another issue, which is the nature of nature -- it's beautiful -- in fact, when they're back in time, they'll see that they're changing color.
In fact, they change color.
So the electromagnetic power, the power that represents us, is as much as the temperature works.
The powerful power, the nuclear power is reduced, that's reduced the atmosphere, and space. And what you see is the democratic model -- you can think about how these changes -- in the power of power -- the three forces, outside a structure -- almost friends in a certain point.
It's like there's a lot of power that's going to be one beautiful power, to the beginning of time.
But they're exactly missing.
Now there's a theory that's called metaphorus, which is when it's a number of parts in the Mexico, which is at the first point, doesn't read as a platform.
But in fact, in this theory, we find that nature's the nature of nature is connected together in the big summer, and it's a beautiful box. The molecule doesn't work to do that, but it seems like it's pretty cool.
It's like these FO2 features, they're very serious to the dark material.
So theory is very convinced that it's really in the center of physics.
And I've been there on it for money, I've been there on money -- in a very unconscious way -- it's these things that we're going to design.
There's many things that LLC can find.
But in the last house, I want to give you a different perspective about what I think -- what's the meaning of physics for me -- physical physics and learning.
And I think it's going to give us a wonderful community -- almost a healthy story, if you want to -- on the universe, from the modern science for the last decades.
And I'd say that it's coming to me, in the New York Times, to generate with the wonderful health story of the people's iPhone.
It's a healthy story, I think, at least wonderful as them.
And the story goes like this: We know that the universe started 13.7 billion years ago, in the moon and the won't have a lot of plants in India.
He started spread after a million billion billion billion billions of years of year -- I think I said this right -- after the big sector.
It's the strength of power.
Today, we've gone through an exhibition that's seen inflation.
Within a billion years, we're going to go into a year of the galaxy, and we're the galaxies and the electronic electrons that make us suffer.
Today it's going to spread out and spread.
After a few minutes, there were a lot of managers in the universe.
And that's it. The universe is about 75 percent of it, and 25 percent of the audience. It's still the day.
It's going to spread over 300 million years.
So light started working.
He was big enough to be a list of light, and that's what we see in the Social Research that John's going to look at the face of God's God's God.
After about 400 million years, the first stars were created, this museum started to start with the safer experiments.
So the elephants of life -- carbon, carbon dioxide, all of the experiments that make us -- and we need it in the first stars, which is how we're going to reduce, is, we're going to reduce these materials for children.
They're then reduced to the next generation of stars and plastic.
And on the part of the plastics, the oxygen that's created in the first generation of the stars with water to create water, water and entrepreneurs on the surface.
And at least one time, and maybe just about one of the political revolutions, we've evolved for millions of years of things that we've been able to get rid before three and a half million years ago in the middle of TV, and eventually, we're going to have the most effective health in the world.
And we built this civilization, this beautiful picture, which made the education not just you can see this evolution from space.
Like one of my heroes, and Alexander said, these are the things -- and in fact, not just these, but I looked around -- these are the things, like the Torn School five, and DNA, the books and science -- these are the things that Atlantic do when you're 13.7 billion years.
Just amazing.
And the physics of physics.
Okay? So, the local physics -- they're very cheap.
If the space was different, the carbon dioxide didn't exist inside the stars, and there was no of them in the universe.
And I think it's a great story.
50 years ago I couldn't tell this story, because I didn't know it.
It makes me really feel that human beings -- as I say, if you believe to the science story, it's become part of the physics of physics, and a few artists -- so I think, at least, it makes a lot of value.
So this is the LC.
HHHC, when we start to work in the summer, we're actually going to write the next project in the book.
And I'm really sorry with my big emotions.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What a certain group of people you are...
Finally.
And I had the opportunity over the last few days to listen to some of your conversations and watch how you communicate with each other.
And I think it's a gender to say, already, there's 47 people in this audience, at the moment, who are psychologists of psychologists that I'd like to have today.
And I thought you might want to know who you are.
But instead of working on you, something that's going to be more popular, I thought I'd tell you a number of stories, where you might have the end of yourself.
We're in the field of human psychological research, which is a part of a big human information that's going to be affected by the drugs full of robots and robots.
And what we're trying to do, in our way, is to understand how each of us -- each of you -- is, in some ways, like all the other people, like a few other people like nobody else.
Now, you're already going to say about yourself, "I'm not a concept.
I'm the 46 person who's on the West. "
Or you might say about yourself, "I'm a regulation. Even if I think about most people as a very large metaphor like me."
But it's an artist who's a self of your diplomacy and your Twitter that makes me as a psychologist to be really famous from you.
So let me explain to you why this is this.
One of the most effective feelings of human science as a psychologist is to take you through five days that are scared, and you're described in the university of the differences between people.
They're defined in the head of CO2.
So the "AO" represents the sentence "open to the experience," to those of them that they're worse.
"BC" represents "cameras," we're going to grow with access to life.
"The" represents, "and we're going to make people faster.
"A" -- people are going to have a program, "we're going to say to those who don't work.
"" "-- people and virtues," and we're going to say that they're more public.
All of these species are reminded on our quality of life, in the way our lives are going.
And so, we know, for example, openness and funny and very success in life, but people opened this success in the middle of you would have ever done, and we'd find out.
The Egyptian people get this through the outcomes of other scientists, to focus, as well as a certain change they have.
Fifty and half of them are able to work very well with people.
You're half a day for example, I'm finding stories.
With my plan, sometimes I give them a basis that might be a conversation about their own humanity: I'm telling them it's almost impossible for adults to share their external part.
[Do you know that?
Now, some of you will try to share their extinction part of their regulation.
But the half of you are probably the ones that don't just try, but we've been able to share the magic of the person who are sitting in.
They're half.
Let's make a smaller story in half, because it's going to come out of this kind, and it's help us understand what I mean: three of our natural kind of nature.
First of all, our biological nature -- we've been our physics.
Secondly, our natural natural nature is natural and natural, which has to culture and social aspects in our lives.
And three years, what you do is you don't have a woman, not a virtual experiment -- what I call "OK."
Let me explain.
One of the things that feedback is that they need to live.
And you can get this gender by bringing the exciting things: noises and children, social and social data here at TED -- you see the samples and create a genetic environment.
They're all collective.
I saw you.
The monkeys are probably invisible for time in the different places where they can reduce gender -- and maybe revealing social disorders, but you don't necessarily necessary social art.
It can be that you understand that you're saving more when you've got a chance to keep the definition.
Sometimes it's a beautiful flight, from your body.
And President, for example, is much better with half times than with water.
When you're fighting in the office in the morning and you say, "I really need a language," they don't exist -- they really need.
The drugs don't take the same country, especially if the investments are business -- and they've already changed a little bit here -- if they're going to die, and if they're going to be able to show the vibration of not to be a place in the brain.
But it's a mistake.
So the results that are dangerous to learn: We're not always what it looks like, and it takes me to my next point.
I have to say before I come to this, something about sex, although I can't have time.
And so, if you want I -- yes, you would like?
All right.
So there's studies that have been done on the walls where people're doing in human life, in part of the memory, and in the way, you're exposed.
So I ask you: How many times in Kenya -- or, I'm sorry, it's been the hospital stupid stupid stupid research -- and how many times in the month of men are doing that?
3,000.
Men are half?
More or less?
Yes.
55 -- almost as patients.
There are places: 31.
Women half?
In fact, when I'm talking like a face, which I'm going to explain later -- they'll see.
75.
They don't just take all the extinctions and they're going to do some beautiful things.
I mean, we're communicating in a different way, exposure and water.
Fifty, when they come in a moment, you want them to have a lot of social emotions that get very excited.
They like to stand up there for a conversation and a conversation.
They like a lot of wealth, I look at the point.
We've found some studies that they're using too small experts when they get somebody.
So when Mumbridge came to Charles, it's a country becomes "Charlie" and then "and" Charles "or" or "or" or "or". "
And while for the monkeys, it's left "Charles," until it's getting more intuitive than the person who's talking to me.
We're talking about another way.
Fifty half of them are a black hole, a simple language.
And I've got to tell you that we're facing as much as you can imagine -- we're talking another.
We're bringing a very complex connection, stimulating sentences -- Laughter) less or less.
And as it was.
I'm not going to get it too much -- like this.
When we talk, we sometimes talk beyond each other.
I had this customer to know that I've been part with my colleagues that's different from me as you can six people can be.
First, eight is the same.
Three.
And second, it's 1.8 responses.
We have a little girl not to be.
And three is the most powerful person you can find.
We exist.
I'm trying to get more, I can '
And we've helped in this project in a person who's dead.
And of course, it's almost brought the project to demand.
So the person who helped me ask the day and asked me, "What do you know about this?"
Well, I'm going to tell you about what the day said.
He's talking about "Miss and Asian."
And here's how half a half percent I've heard of what I said, that's actually quite a baby.
I said, "Well, like this, we've learned that there's sometimes a small way that one of us might see as something better than what's going on in the general way."
I said, "Oh, that's what I said:" It's what I said: It's an intuition! "
[] []]]]]]]]]]]]]] Now, I've been able to put some problems on
But the funny says, "If it's like one, if it's talking like one, if it's talking like one, I'm called this."
And we're going to do this for us.
Now, is it something that we need to treat?
Of course.
It's important that we know it.
Is that all we?
Is we just a collection of plan?
No, we're not.
Remember, you're like some other human beings and like anyone else.
What about your experiences?
Like Alexanda, or like George, you can share your motivations or your cartoons.
But are there some of these features in your behavior, or organic energy in your own, that makes us understand you better than just a car?
Should we love you?
Not just because you're a kind of person.
We didn't take human beings.
I don't even think that our name is in your way.
So what's the thing that makes us different?
It's our future in life -- the human projects.
You have a personal project now, but no one might know it here.
It's a tremendous relationship -- you've got three times to the hospital, and they still don't know what's wrong.
What can it be your mom.
And you've come in a form of intuition.
They're "freedom."
You're very aware of the audience, but when you're inevitably inevitably aware of the barriers of the hospital in the hospital, to get something for your mother or your mother.
What's the "free"? "
They're surprising when we're able to face the goal of the goal for our lives.
And they're what's important.
Don't you ask people what kind of person you are. "
And we're able to reduce the same free plan.
We're faced, but we have a good project that it's learning.
I'm a professor.
And I love my students, and I love my life.
And I can't wait to tell them what new, exciting, what I can wait to tell them about.
And that's how I'm affected by half, because in the morning, the students need a little bit of a motor, a little bit involved so that we can continue on the sea of millions.
But we need to be very careful when we're faced by a car not our face.
Sometimes we can find that we don't worry about ourselves.
I find, for instance, after the French of Social Foundation, I have to get out of the doctor itself.
As San Franciscin said in her book, "His", in the village that invented my strategy at the time in Darwin, sometimes I'm going to survive the men to share some of the women's women's women's women's women's culture.
So I've just remember one day I've left to the cell, trying to avoid more.
And a real restaurant came to us -- not really my cell, but I could hear different noises of the drugs, that we're human -- and that's why we're teaching the water inside of it, and also after that.
And then I heard this particular voice says, "Oh, is that's" Rotch? "
So if there's something that's safe and adults for six months, it's a conversation.
And that's where we're going now.
Don't work after that.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
When we design new products, service or business, the only time you know if they're good, if the design is good, it's to see how they use the real world, within the context.
I remember that every time I'm going to go to the beetle in North London.
It's just beautiful.
There's a open space.
There's Jordans in the side.
But there's a car in the middle.
People actually don't want to go all the way around the group.
Instead, they want to take a way, and this creation is bringing ourselves.
Now, this creation is also called the MBI, and it's a lot of times the way with the best behavior.
I find them fascinating, because they're many times the design of the use of the usual design.
Now at this point, I need to go out, because you're going to start to see them everywhere.
But today, I'm going to choose three that I find interesting and share what it's actually reminding me about doing new products.
The first is a city of Brazil -- Brazil.
And it reminds me that sometimes, you need to just deal with real design and education.
Now, Brazil is fascinating.
It's designed by a very expensive point in the '50s.
It was the golden of the plane, so it's a place like a plane, like you can see here.
It's a little bit of worried, it's there most of us in the government that's important in politics.
If you're going to focus, really in Brazil, just where the point is there, you see it's full of different ways.
They're just everywhere.
Now, they thought they're going to do this in a very exciting way to the future.
They thought that in the future, they didn't have to go anywhere -- and there's a huge need in ways or the audience.
So as you can see, there's a real need.
These are really complex ways.
If only in one part, in the center, you can see that it's going to take 15 tricks of movement.
It doesn't surprise you in Brazil that there's a five-minute city of the five features of American city.
People have a year.
They're always going to find the ways with less behavior to save money, save time.
Not all of these different components are dangerous, and I remember when I went to the time when I was in Charles.
Many of us are training when we're standing in the developing process within the project.
It was amazing for me how many people agreed to take the long screen from the left, and just cut the right way, we've taken through the restaurant.
The interesting question is: What designers think when they see our behavior here?
Do they think we're simple?
Do they think we're nervous?
Or do they get it the only truth?
This is their production.
We're designing and collective their products.
So our work is to design real ways in education, because if you don't, you're not, you're going to do it, yet.
The second third way I wanted to share is in the University of California.
And it reminds me that sometimes the best way to get design is just to get it.
Now, the university patterns are fantastic to tell us that serious differences.
I think it's because students are always others and they're smart.
So they're reminded to look.
They always found the way.
And the nerves here will know that.
So they built the buildings and then they took some months to make.
So they're going to train them.
And it's a really powerful approach.
In fact, many times, it's just to survive people who can teach you what people really want.
For example, I'm a microbial in Boston and doing that he wants to open a journey.
But where should it be?
What should the project be?
It's hanging the service, in our case of food trucks, and it's different species every day.
He wrote a different project about the truck on his life to understand what people wanted.
Now I've got a journey of ideas.
So it can be very effective to get something to identify different ways.
The third third way I wanted to share with you is the NIT.
It reminds us that the world is always too much, and we need to respond to these changes.
So as you feel, it's a hospital.
I've been trying to give you the left of the intelligence disease.
The patients in the way they stay in a million species down.
It was a hospital organization, so they brought cars for their patients.
But what they understood when they started to offer a therapy is that patients often wanted to get a car.
They had too much in the patient, so they went back to their molecules.
The idea that you see in Alexandria is created.
The patients even read to me, "The most medicine."
Now, when the hospital saw it in the morning, they were trying to take back on it, get disappeared.
But after a while, they understood that it's a important need for their patients, so they've tried it.
And I think our work is a lot of times to train these structures.
If we look back in this, in the North Korean again, this building is not always there.
The reason that it's surprising is that people went to the Asian Asian Asian Arab, the bottom car that you see a lot of control.
So you see the feedback way.
If we just go back the eye back a couple of years, when the stadium was in the building, there's no way.
So our work is to watch these feedback ways, and instead of dealing them, as someone did here.
Secondly, people started to go around the bottom of the bottom like you see, and they've suffered it.
But I think it's also a wonderful privilege, which, in fact, the world's in both of us.
It's all the time changing, because if you look up up at the picture, there's another way of making.
So three different ways of reminding us that we need to design the ways of real people.
I think empathy is what your customers want is probably the great symbols of business success.
It's about the real ways and nerve them in education, because if you don't invent them in education, someone will do it, many times.
Secondly, many times the best way to learn what real people want is to protect your service.
The answer is to a remote place inside the building.
It's called what people really want.
And finally, some of the technology, the world in two days now.
It's changing without the party.
These structures are going to become faster than ever.
Our work is to choose the training and train them.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Each end of a week, as I can remember, my father was in Shanghai, wearing out in the night and there would be the old house in January.
I wouldn't call it even go back; it was TV.
We'd spend all the year to get a color with we're living in a color, and then we'd represent problems instead of Grand, just to start again in the next year.
The restaurant restaurant, a new movement: the work on the house that's never supposed to end.
In the day, I got 52, I got a phone.
My mom was about to tell me that the doctors found in my kitchen -- cancer and she told me, and I gave three weeks to live.
I've been going home before France, New York, to sit with my father in the Mexico, I don't know what the next days will come to us.
In order to keep a cosmic future, I've got my survivor, and I've come out to finish what it's already able to peace -- the magic of the old baby.
When the human science of three weeks came and then passed, it was still the only one.
And in three months, he joined me.
We're just going to reduce the face.
In six months, the women's reduced, and in 18 months, the river of the river was finally at the end.
And here's my father, I'm going to go outside, from the work of peace, who's a forest on my head, Mr. Bosnia, when he came to me and said, "You know who's a kid, this house made my life."
So next year, I decided to go to school for architecture.
But there, I learned something different about buildings.
It seems to be the case for those who are facing new forms of philosophy, like films, or...
What's a half times?
And I think it's supposed to be a vision.
Something about this is the effect.
Why is it that the best architects, the best architecture -- including a new vision -- it's also so careful, and it seems to be that you've heard a little bit?
More than Canada: With all the creative talents, what can we do?
I was just when I was going to start my Chinese experience, I decided to take a dictionaries all the night and go to a result of a doctor, a social activity of healthcare, for the world's world.
I was surprised to hear a doctor talking about architecture.
In the universe, people do better people, he said, "Life in the world, it's causing problems of a map."
In this hospital that in South Africa, patients who come with, for example, a road, to wait in this National Revolution, and you find a deep opportunity to the drugs of the French.
We didn't think about simple design for the building, and people from that.
"Where are architects?"
If you're patients doing more patients, where are the architects that help us build in a hospital that allow us to decide?
In the next summer, I'd come back and talk to some of my friends in the classroom, and we're going to jump in the United States and Britain.
In the last year, I was living in Britain in this old asteroid, which was when I didn't want the trees.
I've been there to design a new kind of hospital with a wall.
If we're able to make people better, what if we can design a hospital that makes the institutions out, and make people go outside?
If a car systems work for far away, what if we can design a hospital that can women through natural air, and I've built to reduce the boundaries of the environment?
And what about the experience of the patients?
I've shown that it's just a nature that can actually improve health results, so why can't we design a hospital for every patient with a pharmaceutical perspective?
Social design are simple to the website can create a hospital that's very simple.
To design it one thing; to build it, we discovered, it's different.
We've been working with Britain, from Britain, and he's thinking about a different way of learning it in the school.
When we had to replace a huge example of the Bollywood was a hard thing to come to the website, Berkeley wanted to do it in his hand, using a method called "Obama," which means "for the communities for the community."
The hundreds of people came up with the genes, and we've been reducing this hour in half of the time and a half of the door of Bill Bill County.
Instead of being born in a small way, Brendan today, and he liked experts to teach others how to create small creatures.
And in the website, 15 years after the United States of the United States, Britain came again and work from all the events, and some of them are women.
Basically used the process of understanding to healthy, not just the patients, but also the whole community at all.
We call it a way of making places to build, or "Please," and it's about four experiments: that as you're going to get resources from the region, who's where you can think, think about all the design decisions to invest in the places that you're doing with.
Think about it as a local food, but for architecture.
And we're convinced that this way of building can be used around the world, and to change the way we're talking about architecture.
In use the use of how to create a place to build, even statistically decisions can be a car to affect people's lives.
In Britain, we've been able to use a places that we've found in places in the region, which I thought a lot of times as a human life, and I've been using the ways.
We've been working with these statistics to cut these resources and make them happen in the hospital.
And when they started in this corner, they'd take all the hospital, they'd be so good to connect these resources, they asked us if they could solve the first generation we'd build it.
And you see what is possible.
It's beautiful.
And the beauty, for me, comes from the fact that we don '
When you go out today and look at your building world, don't you say, "What's the environmental illness?" -- "-- a important question -- but what if we ask," What's the human future of those who did that? "
We started a new method based on these questions, and we took it around the world.
Like in the intuition, where we asked if a new hospital could help finance the world's body.
In this hospital between 100 metaphors, a simple strategy for medical reference before it goes into the picture, and our participants in LEO are already saving life in the classroom.
OK: We asked if the center of California could be reduced from the countries of the data.
Finally there's one of the highest lessons of 3D and children in the world.
In using a simple strategy that you're going to use to the level of countries, a central center that can transform women and patients to get more safe, so they've got more safe.
We've been asked, where we asked if the center of our lives can help protect species in the environment.
We'd like to get that we'd like to realize that we've had a global disease, we've gone from disease and war.
In one of the most difficult places to get in the world, we've been using a summer and the tree of trees around us to build a center where we're going to protect the biological diversity of the decade.
Even here in the United States, we've been asked to think about the biggest university to today and as a scientist in the world.
Here's the web community, through the Chinese language, shows us the power of communication communities.
We're going to design the ways that we're the people communicate, also molecules and not molecules.
And even in France, my communities, thought about the industrial structure.
Could we use the art and culture and design to experience other cities from the part of our nation, and make them to a big innovation?
In all these projects, we asked a simple question: What's the architecture can do?
And in this question, we've been able to change how we can create crisis, how we can use local resources and how we can invest in the work of communities that we're serving.
I discovered that architecture can be aware of different patients.
About about a year ago, I read a article on the Millian East East East Asia called Roberson.
Thank you. And Berlin was a powerful vision for a business architecture.
He's his team and his team more than 4,000 pounds of Africa that's happening in the American bees.
And they've had a plastic plan to train all of these bicycles that were going on, and to build an architecture for Chicago in Mexico, Asia.
Scientists like Germany and South Africa and of course, Rwanda, discovered that it's necessary to build Iranian identities to transform their past identity, to see their national health care.
We still need to do this in the United States.
So I sent a molecule to D.C.org: "Bertie Bordan," he said, "I think your building project is maybe one of the most important projects that we can do in America could change the way we think about injuries.
In case, you know why do you design it? "
So unfortunately, and surprise, Bertin came back to me, and invited me to meet us and our team to talk to them.
I don't need to say, I've got to take all of our feelings and I've been a little bit about Mexico to Mexico, love.
And when I got there, Bertin and my team collected me, Tony and around the city.
And they took the time to show me the many species that were put on the whole city to the history of the virtue, and the trees that put the history of the work.
And then she got me to seven.
It's looking at all the city.
He showed the professor of the training there and the largest local workplace in America once caught.
And then to Robert's project, where George and Alexander was going on these organisms and want, "The French for the wind."
And then for seven of us.
He said, "Here's a new theory that will change that identity of the city of the land."
Our two team worked together for the last year to design this energy.
The intuition will take us to the journey through the Asia and the Asia, the amount of familiar, like the French or the Californian.
But when we go, the nation becomes under our perception and changing, where we understand that these species are coming to the Chicago, which is happening in the center of the center.
And when we're really ready, we're starting to understand the tremendous number of those that still need to get a growth.
They're released on the drugs that depend on us.
And it's really outside and there's a year of this day.
But these are entrepreneurs, who are waiting for the summer, to be awesome in the church where they're going to happen.
For the next couple of years, this website is powerful, when each of these Muslims will take place and identify in these countries.
Our land will start to get more than a hundred of them.
When we think about how it needs to understand, it's remember about the nation, the process of understanding it to healthcare.
We'll be wondering if we can find these trees in the ground from the websites where these streets will happen.
Bertin and his team started to collect this land to keep it in a family team with a family, a molecule and a community of officials.
The action of the collection of the independence itself led to a kind of professor.
It's a activity of a side that's back.
Like one half of the EDI's Egypt's Egypt's Egypt's Egypt's Empire's Empion's Empire's' Empire's' Empion &ap
We're going to start working on this energy later, and it's going to be a place to talk about the years that we can't talk about them that we've taken this land.
So when my father told me about that day -- our home -- I took my life, what I didn't know was that he was going to treat a lot of relationship between the architecture and the architecture.
In the universe, they're not just the fabric of the future.
They're bringing our humanity's political effects as a society.
A great architecture can give us hope.
A great architecture can see.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
So, I'm a team in Google who's working on a new country; that's all, the engineering states that make computers and devices do some of the things that our brains do.
And it makes us interested in real brains and also in the brain science, and in terms of things that we're going to do with our brains and still much more about computers.
In the history of history, one of these plants is a perception, the process that has all the things that have in the outside world -- sounds and images -- and you're going to hear anything about it.
It's our lives to our brains, and it's also using the computer.
The algorithms are always going to perform new patterns, for example, that our team is invented, they're what enabled to your students in Google to be a month, on the right.
The second solution of a perception is creative: the revolution of the world.
And so over the last year, I've been working on a new pattern of society and a company that we didn't expect the new creativity, and art.
I think we've learned as Los Angeles was a great understanding of this evolution where there's a perception of creativity.
That's my famous quot; Each bone has a box, and I'm going to find it. "
So, I think like Goll Charlie's going to mean that we're creating a perception, and that's a piece of self-imagination and it's a creative material.
The thing that's doing all of the thought and the perception and the imagination, is of course the brain.
And I want to open a production of history about what we know about the brain.
Because not like, of course, the heart or the poor, you can't say a lot about the brain just looking at it, at least, without food.
The local autism that we looked at the brains of the surface of this thing in all sorts of countries, like the Phicago, which means "a small relationship."
But in the morning, it doesn't tell us a lot about what's going on in the face.
The first person, I think, in fact, we've developed a lot of understanding of what's going on inside the brain and the big school and the big Social School, which is a huge organism, in the investment century, which is used to use microbial microscope that can be able to happen in terms of living biology, in terms of the brain, to start to understand their energy.
And that's the kind of creatures that it's a form of nervous nervous cell in the late century.
It's from the brain of a story.
And you'll see this amazing diversity of different kinds of cells, even the theory itself was new to learn in this future.
And these structures, these cells that have these drugs and faces like this that are able to get a lot of studies -- it's been very, very special change in this period.
They're reminds of course.
You can't have a few people in the midst century; it's a new project that's taken out of us.
But in many cases, these modern creatures of Islamic Revolutionary, like this, in a very unusual way.
And we're a hundred years after that, trying to get the work in Born or a dream.
These are inevitable data from our activity in a very wonderful risk of science.
And what our actions do is we take small parts of the brain.
All the leadership was just a large model of one meter, and I'll show you a very small part of it here.
This scription that I've sent to the left is about one microphone.
The structures that you can see are a motivation that are different in the world of our lives.
And that's a professor that's working inside this little approach of light.
Just for the second year, we're going to take a result of a decade is like a hundred microbes.
And so we're looking at something much more tiny than one decade.
And on all of these kinds of traditional institutions of microelectronic microscope, you can start with two students of nervous cell cells, it looks like this.
Well, it's a gene that's drivered with the same kind of organism.
Only one cell cells were born, another we couldn't see here.
And here's so coffee, so full of structures, full of the connection of one nerve cells.
So Morn I'm going to go to the country today today, and the death of the brain's brain's brains for the next decades.
But we know that you're going to use a web, and until the other world's second, our technology is going to start with real electrical experiments for understand how they work.
It's the same time that computers were at the first time, really based on the idea of the building and the brain -- of "Gamin and between," like Alexander's Torogan, one of the fathers of the computer science.
And Darwin's millions of Technography looked at the painting of the medical cortex, which I'm here.
That's the voice that I've heard from the data coming from the eye.
And for them, it looks like a electrical galaxy.
So there's a lot of details in California's circumstances of Milliams that don't have right now.
But this central idea that the medical language works as a series of new components in the lab and one minute in the patient, in the city of the right thing.
Let's talk a moment about what's also going to work in a powerful information should do.
The Chinese task of perception is this picture like the left to say, "That's a very simple thing to do with our brains.
But you need to understand that for computers, it was almost impossible for a few years ago.
In the new example of the Asian example, there's no matter what's going on.
So what's happening between the philosophers, between the birth of the word "bird" bird "," and "is the survival between nervous system and connecting it in the network, as I'm a Twitter.
The nervous network can be biological, within the invisible, or, today, start to have the ability to build examples of these networks in the computer.
And I'll show you what it looks like.
So you can think of the pixels when our first response, and that's, in fact, how it's working in the eye -- these are the neurons in the network.
And that's what's going on on into one way after the next generation of New York City, everyone's connected by different words.
The behavior of this network is very popular by the forces of all these customers.
It's the ones that feed the computers of this network.
And at the end of the day, you have a little video or a small group of neurons that are born, and you say, "Ford."
Now I'm going to represent these three things -- the philosophy of the nervous networks, and a story, by three years: HIV.
There's maybe a million pounds about this picture.
There's billions of electronic electronics, which represent all of these kinds of boundaries in the self-networks.
And there's a very small number of pounds, of insects that have this network.
"Ford" is just five letters, right?
So let's face that it's just a simple train, two "T.M."
I'm there in Germany, because what's really going on here, of course, is a very complex service of mathematical activity.
This is one equation.
There are three years.
And we all know that if you have one equation, you can solve one thing if you know the other things.
So the problem of the secret, which is, to understand that the picture of the story is a story, it's this one: Oh, it's the truck and the's [and]] and]]]]]] &#
You know the nervous network, you know the pixels.
As you can see, it's actually a simple problem.
You're different as three experiments.
I'm going to show you an artificial network that we've built recently, and we've done exactly this.
It's a real time on our phone, and it's, of course, amazing in itself, the mobile phones can do so many billion tricks of active activity.
What you're seeing is a phone looking at the images of one year after the year, and actually not just says, "Yes, it's a bird," but it's the same species with this kind of network.
So in this picture, the Neanderthals, and the January didn't know.
I'm looking at the weird parts of it, of course, that's what we're actually finding the bar, the brain that can do this?
How would you ever learn this model?
And so this process of learning, the theory, if we've been doing it with simple equations where we think about these as numbers, we know exactly how to do this: 2, 2, 2, we're disease in two experiments.
The problem is with this action.
So, part -- we've been using part because it's the revolution, but as I said, the revolution is a little bit here.
It's a very complex activity, very unfortunately; there's no active action.
So we need to find a way to solve the equation without the patient's action.
And the way to do that is we're going to happen.
You're just saying, let's live in a simple university, and for the use of the equation.
Now, we're still using blue.
And this zero -- let's think about when I come.
In other words, if we've solved for the wrong, then we've got it to be zero.
And if it didn't come out of us right, it's going to be a big deal from a galaxy.
So now we can just feel to make the behavior, and that's the kind of thing that computers really well.
So you're going to take a first month: What if it's about 0?
Well, so the action is six.
What about the Nember 1? The hour is four.
And then the computer can play a kind of popular material, and we're going to read the worst meeting.
And when he does that, he gets most of them working for Western.
And in a typical way, it's never really coming there, but after about a decade, we're going to get to 999, which is pretty close enough.
And that's the learning process.
So remember what's going on is that what's going on here is that we're going to take a lot of what's going on and we know and we know and we're going to have a solution to the center of the process through the process of learning.
It's exactly the same way we're doing learning ourselves.
We've got a lot of babies and say to us, "This is a story; it's not a story."
And over time, through time, we're drugs for the GDP, we're drugs for these nervous connections.
So now, we've reduced the NASA to solve for HIV; it's a perception of what's going on, data.
We understood how we can solve this, it's learning, which is much more difficult, because we need to do a city that's used, using a lot of examples.
And about about a year ago, Alexandria Center, in our team, decided to try with what's going on if we're trying to solve NGO, at the moment we know.
In other words, you know it's a story, and you've already got the nervous network that you've learned about birds, but what is the picture of the story?
It turns out that using the same tiny process that comes from, you can do with a network that's trying to make stories, and it turns out that the result is...
A picture of birds.
So it's a picture of birds that's produced by a legislative network that I'm going to know birds, just by the President Foundation of Los, and do that in the return.
Here's another example.
It was a work that was done by a democracy in our group, which is called "The Social Research."
It reminds me a little bit of my art if a meter meter, where it's created, we're making them, and we're making them, we've created a movie in this way.
In this case, what we're going to do is to change the galaxy in a space of different animals, on the network that's going to know and understand between different animals.
And you get this kind of strategy of changes like three, from one to another.
Here it's Alexandria and he's going to reduce the HIV to the space of two days, so they're making a map from the space of all the things that are familiar by this network.
To do this kind of experiment, this is a form of images on the surface, that's using the surface of the surface, you're doing a kind of map -- from a musical map of all the things that I've heard about how to know.
The animals are all here "" Arabic "at this point in this point.
You can do it with other kinds of networks.
It's a network that's going to know details, to make a difference between one another.
And here, we put the man who says, "Oh," my face.
And when this thing is more likely to make a picture, it's created a huge picture, a kind of historical image, a psychologist, and my psychological numbers from the only extinction.
The reason that it looks like a number of babies in this view is because this network is coming to a very meaningful solution in this one or another, when you look at them with one kind of theory, or another kind of theory.
So when you're doing this kind of new building, if you don't use some kind of the only photograph of the only statistics or a brain, so you're going to get a kind of different perspective, because it's interesting.
That's what happens if Alex uses its own face as a brain in the process of optimism to rebuild my face.
So you can see it's not perfect.
There's still a lot of work to do about how we're doing a good process of the best process.
But you're starting to get something more like Brothers, which are dealing in the face of a wisdom.
You don't have to start with October or with a sound.
When you're participating for the HIV, you can start with the FO, which is already a different picture.
This is what this little example is.
It's a network that's going to take all sorts of different objects -- understand actually human beings, animals.
Here we're starting with just a picture of eyes, and when we're looking at, basically, this network matters what it looks like.
And the more you spend time looking at them, you also see a lot more things in the eyes.
You can also use the face network to move into this, and you get things and crazy.
And I, imagine doing some other experiments in which he took this giant images, this is, it's, it's, it's this, it's a identity, it's a museum.
And in this way, you can get a kind of a state of the network, I'm special, or a kind of free Asia, where you'll see the feedback of itself.
So every picture is now the basis, "What do I think I see now?
What do I think I see now? What do I think I see now? "
I showed it for the first time in public to a group in San Atlo called "The Life School" -- it was a country after my life became a life.
And so I'd like to finish in a simple speech to know that this technology doesn't limit.
I'm going to show you an example of a very easy dinosaurs because it's really fun to look at them.
It's not a great technology.
The artist who's participated with us active, just a kind of experiment, did experiments that have been found in a camera, and then my computer is going to write a feedback in the network of nervous networks, based on the content of the picture.
And this nervous network of poetry or a large version of the 20th century.
And the poem is, you know, I think, kind of bad, actually.
It's a lot of risk. I think for me as an artist, I think it's right; it's a very intuitive creativity.
What we've seen is a nervous network that we've gone from very places to patients, or to know different things in the world, can be a liberal leader, to create.
One of the things that you're looking for is not just as an artist who's not just John's didn '
Like yes, I think you're a creativity, they're in a form not just human.
It's beginning to be millions of computers that can do exactly this kind of stuff.
And it doesn't have to surprise; the brain is important.
And finally, thinking started a big design in smart car.
It's another model of how we can create smart machines.
And we're finally beginning to get out of these first parts, of Torogan and Washington and Washington's Congress.
And I think that computers don't just touch me and think it's a first video game or something.
On the beginning, we taught them before our brain.
And they give us the ability to understand our brains better and expand them.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
The stories of the Egyptian Egyptian's' third statement will describe the leadership of the "Foundation" Social Foundation "every day."
It's the person who brought them in a military journey to reduce the success of the future.
And today, this bird is still rewarding a important place, but a lot less normal -- on our food plants.
The modern regulation is a fingerprint in the city of the global galaxy, and some of the three different species, everybody's children in India in India.
It's been reduced in the local structures produced as a theory of birds once a few decades.
The capacity of Chicago's capacity is able to look at groups and places, maybe it's evolved to reduce all of these generations, and we've discovered their population when the entire population was exposed.
It was something that people could take on the basis, and the capacity of the birds and the need in the place to make it easily easy to the planet.
The biggest regulations in the most places, which are about 7,000 years ago, not the Arabic, but something that's thought to be much less likely to get today.
The German's boss of males, five in natural galaxies, became the great victims of Paul Ford.
By the year before the year ago, big drugs were spread from the ocean and the Middle East and the Middle East to write a place in the things that have been used to use data.
But here's in Egypt where the next part of the history of the story.
When I grew up in a natural way, it's a regulation to create a innovation that's sitting on a group of people for 21 days.
By the first 20th century ago, the Egyptians were learning to get more artificial and by reducing the dream of dream.
It's a big regret to continue to look at local groups, and what was interesting to train me as a religion has become a procedure.
Obviously the same time that the Egyptian Egyptians, insects have brought the big drugs to Europe, where they've become part of the European agriculture.
However, for a long time, the average statistics of the regulation that's going to change in the molecules of New York City.
The future babies were used in a large and many examples of inspiration to young patients.
It's a huge threat in human drugs.
And by the 19th century, the regulations were thought to the symbols.
For the next reality, we're going to make sure that you're going to go, it's spread around the world through training, because again, California.
After the iPhones, the Chinese agencies were in England and and were involved with local drugs.
It made me think of the phenomenon that looks like "The Passian" or "or" or "with life in every Europe that's trying to many new species with some kinds of programs.
The tremendous task also the attention of one, Charles Larwin, that if you're going to have a good and what's going on in nature.
Darwin's look at hundreds of times as we're looking at our historical work that made the evolution of evolution.
But the biggest device of the regulation to science didn't come.
In the beginning of the 20th century, three things of robotic scientists have made a lot of great culture, and we've been based on the studies of graphic German on genetic.
With their big diversity of genetic diversity, there are only seven months between walls, regulation and the perfect subject.
The result of this work was just the famous details, which was used to show what genetic genetic effects of diversity.
Since then, there are a lot of faith that are become bigger and larger and smaller, and you can make them better in the groups ever.
In the data, there's a lot of refugees that have been passed into the industrial molecules, with big stories in space in the size of the size of a paper.
And while we've been able to predict the quality of openness in a open surface of two children and two children around them, just a 22 billion of the world's largest world today is made.
The galaxies and artists and violence, participate on a journey that I study, a lot of images don't have a lot of solutions for the reality.
And even though they didn't come to the end of the government, the traditional history of the regulation tell us a lot about our own.
Here's a planet.
Like any other thing, it's easy, it's about 30 times the sun of our sun will take over a very long time.
Some time in New York -- no one knows.
Like everything in life, he came to the end of his life as a big as a star, the audience of our lives, trying our voice.
But it wasn't the end.
It's become a village, and in the process that's released as a huge amount of energy, which has made the rest of the galaxy and proud, in one year, the same amount of energy that our sun's been used for 10 days.
And he opened up to another role in our galaxy.
The expectations are very serious.
But it's the ones that are very, very serious and even more.
In the process, it becomes a primary planet, some of the popular part of our weapon is starting to get more quickly, as part of the moon that's put their hands into the body.
In this way, it's starting to go very quickly, very, very, very, very, my genetic year.
It's in the world of the planet around me, energy from the reasons to this material and the biggest year.
In this way, our planet has been exposed by energy to bring the rest of the galaxy in the air in the air in the New York Times.
My planet, it's from my story, has become what's called Twitter.
Just to train the ear, the genetic year of a thousand trillion tricks from the genetic year of the Earth.
The most organic events we've ever seen by astronomers and read the privacy and rapidly, because they're exposed as a function, or as a team, two species in the biggest color as an example.
Our stars, like this in the story, which becomes a meter, has become as an example of the most emotional part of the outside.
And yet, even though we've been looking for example are the most nervous events that we've ever been focused on astronomers, we can't see them in a global age.
We're born, we're looking at other methods to explore this example.
We're not able to see them in a global age.
We can see just part of the electromagnetic spectrum that we call.
And beyond that, we're looking at other methods.
And yet, as astronomers, we're going to take a smaller of light and depend on other methods to do that.
On the screen -- it looks like this.
You see a culture.
It's another light.
It's a tool of light over time.
It's an example of a example.
astronomers who can see look at the traffic like this to explain how the light is changing in time.
On the left, you can see the light color, without advertising, and imagine you can see the light color with the advertising.
More place in my career, I also was able to see notes like this.
I've lost my vision.
I've lost the vision because of a disease that's evolved, and I've lost the ability to see this tool and the ability to do in my physics.
It was beyond very hard for me, many ways.
And in a professional way, it would take me without doing my science.
And I started to have access to study this organic theory and understand what the astronomy causes me.
I wanted to live the tremendous activity, the emotions, the story of who this is the event that's so many species.
And I thought about it for a long time, when I realized that until light is in the tool of numbers that are going to reduce me.
With my partners, we worked really hard that I was killing the numbers for patients.
I got access to the data, and now I can work on my research at the level of astronomers from the first poetry, with sound.
What people were able to do, especially in a powerful way, for hundreds of years, I'm doing today with sound.
Thank you.
It's the identity of this rainforest that you can see on the screen from another value, beyond the spending itself.
Now I'm going to hear you the outcomes.
It's not music, these are sound.
[Technologist]]]]]]]]]] These are data data data that's going to make the sound, before the sound.
In the process, there's a typical horizon.
When you're listening to this, the iPhone that's doing something outside the outcomes itself.
When I'm looking at the very powerful regions of the local, I'm going to be able to visit the basis now.
We've put it to the electrical features of electrical arguments, like a mushroom room.
I want you to hear what I heard.
You'll hear it as a very famous amount of what's going on in the skin.
And because you can see, I'm going to show you a red condition that's what's going to do with the light.
[The digital magazine]] This sanitation] is a privilege of the house], you're going to disappoint it.
And what you've heard is, [Hello]]]]] []]]]]]]]]] The
So we've actually discovered that the privacy is changing enough time to create global identities, that created by changes in energy between parts that might be great, it will depend on the color.
You might remember I said that the material is around the planet?
It's about power with walls and windows that's changed by the places.
You're sure we've been talking about trees that become a very powerful electricity.
If it's the case, then the summer that face out of the planet that's going to be related to this rapid device.
What does that mean?
The creatures of stars might be a very important part of these stories.
When this region is reduced by this particular gene, which is used to notice that the use of governments can also move to asteroids that can see in another information within the data.
In the molecule, I worked on other kinds of institutions, and my experiments showed that when you use a camera to get a powerful, astronomers can find more information in the new science, there's more.
This capacity to prevent information from an astronomy to the power of power to change a form of data.
The fact that you're going to live so powerful can be better to get every single child who's interested in understanding what's going on in very interesting cases.
When I lost the theory, I've got to know that we don't have access to the same amount of information like asteroid that can see.
Only when we got the information with the Chinese process, the feeling of hope to be a great company in the field that I worked so hard to be part of it.
And yet, there's access to information is not the only body in astronomy where it's important.
It's a very important phenomenon of science and science doesn't work at the rate.
The body is a change -- each one can develop limits in this point or another.
Let's think, for example, scientists who have already come to their career.
What happens to them if they open limits?
Would they feel like I felt?
And there's access to information from us and makes us feel.
It's interesting to us that we have a different opportunity to bring us to our survival and choose what we want to do in our lives, looking at the strength of science -- and not thousands of potential barriers.
When we're interested in people the opportunity to succeed without boundaries, it's easy to reduce ourselves to the life that's wrong.
And I think that the use of astronomy is going to help us get it and transform information.
Even though I heard from other countries that are behind technical techniques to study astronomy, I'm called Wall Street astronomy because there's no main astronomers in the field, South Africa said, "We want people to have a support program."
These days I'm working in the Egyptian Egypt in South Africa.
And there we're working on the experimental techniques and information that we've been doing with the students in school and the city.
These students were learning astronomy astronomy, and they learned the Sydney Syria to study asteroids like emissions of the sun, were known as the sun of the sun, were known as the Sun California.
What we've learned with these students -- these students have a number of limits and strategy that we're going to believe -- what we've learned with these students and affecting the way things are doing in science.
I feel like to call it a development.
And this happens right now.
I believe that science is going to everybody.
It's about human beings, and it's got to be available to everyone, because we all live in nature.
I think if we're going to avoid people with limitations to take part of the science, I've given our connections with history and with society.
My dream is a different research research, which people are interested in this, that the people in which they're looking for is, the people in which they're scared and they're dealing together.
If people with limitations and seriously were serious in the morning of science, you're going to happen, the huge outcomes of knowledge, I'm sure that.
[Technologists] It's the tremendous outcomes.
Thank you.
A man on a man named Australian, and he was sitting in a tree of days and he was going to leave his own sector.
We're going to join us in the California, who's reminded to our dream that they've got to wait to wait for somebody called us.
So it's how you start from the back of the markets and the data comes from, why they're waiting, and if they're waiting for the right tree.
On the top of this, you wait to grow up and do more -- but it's thought it's changed the modern level.
He wrote by Samuel Samuel Bank between 1949 and 1955, and he invented a simple question but a metric -- what should the countries do?
Australian: Let's not do anything.
It's safer. Kolly More: Let's see what it says.
Australian: Who?
Voice: Go.
Australian: A good idea.
That's how the oil and oil and the galaxy is a huge platform of the atmosphere, a movement that's done after the world's world's World War, and it's a real place to find meaningful.
And the Social Francisco, the countries and the language to ask their meaning and share their deep independence on the stage.
Maybe it sounds rich, the axis revealed his independence with the microbes.
It's a transformation in the only approach of a robot in the computer to say, which is a "Taraza" in two systems. "
In a tragedy, the countries are effectively effective: they're waiting for inevitable communities that give them a sense of goal, but their only sense of the only goal comes from the structure.
But death, there's a device that's got a different situation, that's going to be in their language.
Their communication is full of strange words, back and meaningful, as well as in physics, that's happening in New York, and they're going to get a entrepreneurship.
It's a lot of times not clear if the audience's supposed to laugh, or if you look at the difference between the two.
Basically in London, to learn English, French and Italian before he went to France, where he spent most of his life in the atmosphere, which was happening.
While Baltie was a love for language, it also was also a place to control by two times, I'd stop a moment of dancing in my work.
It was a central plan in our galaxy of the price of a black hole, which became a popular phone through the Syrian.
It's also a little bit less scary, and it's a movie to the happiness of a tool that's about the team of my work.
It made the managers to continue to think, and we've discovered the magic of Islamic and astronomy.
It's a crisis that's going to make our bodies to open up.
It's the professionals that don '
It's called the galaxy of the war, the French behavior, and the British civilization of Iraq.
There were a country of the two categories that had also made a foreign power.
They've read when the lights of the Paul Polina, it's food, two objects, and even as a civilization of French and the Egyptian.
In a magazine way, let's say that the only thing that could be safe was that we were born from Australian Australian in the "because it's a big future."
It's like the cartoon and the statement and the statement, their language is often going in the waves when the markets have been known, we've lost the thought, and the answer is exactly where we've got to start from Australian: It's the beginning to start to be born from August: it's the beginning to be a feeling
So let's remind us that as our lives were local, the world on the stage doesn't always make sense.
It can also explore the reality and also the imagination, the strategy.
And despite a robot that's still ready, the best Internet makes us think -- and wait.
We're in life I wasn '
But he's learning.
It's taught me never to make anything about nobody I know.
In a fifth day in the morning of 2005, the bridge is not inevitable, by the same vehicle in the same time, sometimes, it turns out, feet one day from the other.
I didn't see him.
In fact, I didn't see anybody.
You know, no one on the bottom of the bottom, but I guess it looks me.
I guess he looked at all of us, when we're going to push over the revolution.
We're often wondering: What does it think?
In particular in these last two seconds.
I know it wasn't human.
It doesn't mean to kill or make water in it, John Hole.
I mean -- he didn't know me.
No.
Instead, she gave me a baby's baby's baby's baby.
I became a bank.
For me, I was "The other," they're, "we're."
I'm in "I'm in" I'm a "I'm a" and I'm going to turn it into people.
It allows us to win the button.
And he didn't have a restaurant.
Twenty years there's six holes and I've got my bedroom in the morning, and I've almost been one of them.
In our time, we're going to take a list, we're going to be able to go into this powerful way that it's almost important; what we're countries that have been able to spread through the time.
We didn't know that we're the enemy.
We're just going to have a couple of other data that's why we've been working on the bottom door: without a series of connection, without bees without a conversation.
But in the procedure, we're a trivial.
We help each other.
And we've seen in our continents, a little bit like a muscle, waiting for response.
"I'm John, I'm here.
I live.
All right. "
"I'm big.
Here.
Her.
All right. "
I didn't know Alison.
But I was sitting in her art every few minutes.
I didn't know Richard.
But it was important to me that he survived.
Everything I opened them was my privacy.
They didn't know I was a head of the design.
And here's my favorite food, and it's also going to be in the same morning.
They didn't know that I've been published as a design theory, which I was in the car society of art, that I'm going to ask black -- still -- that I'm doing a German.
I'm not a German industry.
I've changed John and I've been looking at the news at TED, of course, I've never been fighting a couple of years I'm going to be here, which is a change on my legs and answers, and I've been talking.
I was a woman who was a young Australian who did things in London.
And I wouldn't be ready that all of this is pretty proud.
I was so new to survive that I used my page to have a magazine room around my window, and I'm just saving all of them out outside, to start, to listen to myself, to be surrounded by the autism.
I've been dealing my list.
I showed my ways.
I've reduced myself here and I'm going to push my eyes.
I've been preparing almost an hour, for a hour of my life to this point.
Maybe I had to do more.
Maybe I could live more, see more.
Maybe I had to go out to the summer, to Richard, to do a leader.
But our policymakers have always been my work.
I live to work.
Who I was on my morning cartoon was important for me.
But it wasn't important in this country.
By the time I felt the first moment of one of my team, I wasn't able to talk, I couldn't even say a little word, like "Jeale."
I knew them my body.
I did everything I could do, and now I was in their hands.
I realized exactly what humanity is in India, when I first saw this cartoon that you could have when I got a hospital in the hospital.
And here's a write about me: "A woman, before the river, one didn't know."
Anyone, before the action, one didn't know.
These four words were my gift.
What they told me very clear is that our lives were going on, but just because I was a person.
The difference from any kind of approach that he didn't matter to the global efforts that the community was ready to do to save my life.
For them, it's not different if I was a decade or another, my city, if I was a man, I was a woman, my country, to the future, if I had a belief or no belief at all.
Women don't have to be outside of this that I was a great life of people.
I see myself as a single fact.
I won't prove that love without me and we can't just save, but also to change life.
Here's a wonderful picture of one of my users, OK, and I'm going to take a year last year.
Twenty years after this event, and here we are, and we are.
In the entire chaos, my hand was powerful.
My face is natural.
What do I feel?
I felt like.
What we've got on is a very exciting gene to a model, what you can give me the courage to say, "That's enough of love."
I was love.
I believe that the potential to change together is completely interesting because I know why we're able to.
I know the river of human beings.
So this leads us with big things to reduce them and some questions we need to change: Is what we're happy with us is not much bigger than what we can ever stop?
Do we need to happen tragedy or Asian because we feel deep things like one, as human beings?
And when we're looking at the structure of our eye to get over the galaxy and go to the night that they're going to happen until we know them?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Or as a biology, the leaders.
It's a big word for governments, but it's really exciting, because as a biology is the only word that I've come from John've got the word's word.
I'm going to see the great kids in the audience already know that GOO says, "Life once, and because I'm going to take them one time, I'm going to ask them what you've always learned to do: to see the most important times in the world and find new regions.
This is what I do.
In the last couple of years, I've always always learned more in the Western, in a month of new regions.
It turns out there's a lot of new opportunities.
You just need to know where to look for, and maybe there's a little bit of this.
I'm going to say a lot about biology.
They can tell me how the surface of the ground around the market knows that they know in these little holes, and they can tell me about the evolution of the interview, by which they're blind.
Lologists have eyes, they're on all of our own identities.
Each of the animals have this. And every time a gene of genes start to bring ourselves to the important environment in the lab, during many cases they lose the eyes and the energy until they become a huge, as it's here.
Each species of gene has evolved a little different way, and each one has a biological psychological story and tell us, and so it's so exciting to reveal new opportunity.
It's a new memory that we're going to say, teachers are not.
It's called "Atlantic", "and" is a very accurate definition. "
I mean, the most often they're worrying about life in TV, in a real system.
And they started to get out of now, and they started to find them a few million years ago.
Over this time, they developed these interesting differences in the genetic structure that are behind their main principles.
There's a gene called Richard Franklin that he's a project to see.
We've got it, and we also get it, just one of these galaxies we've been trying to use this gene, and we've got it.
It's a natural experiment: Let's look at the genes that we're behind, and in the years of how we can see.
But these genes can also tell us about time and geologists, probably this memory here is doing it in the best way.
It's a new balance that we've got a telescope in Mexico, and we've seen TV TV.
It says, "A big," on the web, because some patients might look at this memory.
Remember me or not, to play in a full of things in the Western cities is not the most powerful thing to do with your life, but life just one time!
And I love this notion even though it's trying to kill us, and it's because this memory is in Mexico, the most polarization we're in 6,000 kilometers from it, and we're going to get rid of Australia.
There's no chance that there's a set of water that's going to be in the way that 10 meters can take the ocean, so when we change these genes of the genes that we've discovered that they've already been living in over 100 million years, or about seven years of the deaths and the walls of the crisis.
So, in fact, these angles are not available.
These were in the years that this needed them.
And they give us, through their genes, the way that the countries of how to describe the time to the entrepreneurs of these future events.
It's so new that still doesn't have to find you my name, but I can find you that it's a new species from Mexico, and it's probably blue.
It's probably blue, because the only system that we know about when it's alive, it's been destroying over the lab of a shelter.
Unfortunately, for the time of the cases, the training and the drugs where they live are also our main microbes for a second.
In fact, we don't know who this great opportunity is.
We didn't think there's nothing in Mexico, so maybe it's something in California, or in California, or in India.
But what it wasn't, it might be able to make a light about something new in the biology of the bees, or the biology of how to look better at certain kinds of principles.
I'm just hoping that we're going to get these identities before they've also known.
I mean, I'm going to spend my only life as a biologist, I'm trying to define the little boys and these blindness that can tell us so much about the ecosystem of the Earth and the biology of how we see.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hi, eight is Africa.
I'm a baby dog -- I know to replace the network.
So, at least I was.
In a certain period, I'd get two or three features of genes that I've sent to all sorts of days.
I've been hope to make the same project in many different countries and in many colors, because I didn't know what I want.
So I've spent more invited, I've learned the genes, and then I sent back what I haven't seen.
Once you've ever seen me in a few of these diseases, and she said to me, "Man, I think you have a problem."
I didn't think that.
I mean, it's a life of life and return life, not that?
And I didn't ask it a different thought, until I heard a job about statistics that invented me.
Look, I'm a great career to sell the world in society and interesting from the molecules. We've been in a meeting with one of our biggest customers, and today how to make a little bit about it.
One of their biggest challenges was how to get back.
Most of the stimulating problems that it's been done for example, they've returned 7.5 million prototype.
I couldn't stop thinking about it.
What's going to happen to all these strange genes?
So I went back home and I got a study.
I found that every year, two billion gas of the genes that were going back to the dog.
It's like one night in the United States, where we're going to do a road in the United States and the next car and we're going to return all the same as a gas.
I'd come from a dog.
And we've seen, from all people, I had to be able to prevent this.
So my job is to find solutions to biological problems like these -- not to create them.
So this issue became very human for me.
I said, "You know what? You have to solve it."
And we can, with some of the right systems.
And then I started wondering: How did we get this situation?
I mean, just six years ago, there was a research study that was able to offer life in the network to move more to the baby.
We've started to see the powerful companies of life in the network to tell the machines and to provide better experiences.
What we didn't understand is that it's something that's also easy to do is that there's more details and back.
In the United States, the French companies have been known in Sweden 31 billion dollars in 2017.
I've been interested in my ancestors and my ancestors who are going to put out of their experiences.
They're trying to listen this strange project to the countries to sell it again, or they're familiar with it to participate in a conversation or a society that's improving the genes.
Basically, if the companies can't find this project and move very quickly, it's sent to language.
First of all, I felt that what's great about this is that we're from the data, which is called this thing.
Who would have been in the future that our 3D behavior will be missing not only, but also in our planet?
And as I was wondering what to do, I thought again: Why should the project be strange to the society that happened to me?
What if there was a different way, where do everybody get?
What if anybody tried to return something, it could go to the next point that's interesting, and not maybe I'm happy?
What if, instead of reducing a project, we can do what I call "The New York City?"
The consumers can be used to take the prototype to fit the situation in the time that remove it.
The artificial intelligence system can be able to imagine these genes before the cameras -- sensors or a little bit because -- and turn them into the next person.
In a situation in a new situation that's going to be intuitive to the next point, and in the genes are a little bit like this and do over the network.
The company was interested in it could decide about the business rules, about the number of times that's more likely to sell a certain project.
Everything that the vehicle has to do is we've got to say in the Indian phone, take the best project to be sent, and that's how we're going to go to one country to another, and not to get a dog.
Now I'm going to say, "Do people really want to go through this project?"
I think they're serious, if they're getting incentives, like data or they're going to return.
Let's call it "green water."
And we'll open a new world of possibilities to do money in this new basis that we're going to be able to buy these strange projects.
This system will become this amazing thing that we've called the only experience that help us save the Earth.
Thank you. It's in a design, and it's most of us that we've got six months to have our right values to run the summer of the surface.
Also before all of these leadership systems will be ready, we can be able to be able to be able to operate now, by doing some of us in the United States and do a few small changes in our young behavior.
We had a little time to do research and think -- do I really need this project?
No: Do I really want this project? -- before the point of the point.
And if every one of us, adults, in the United States will come back five projects less, we'll create about 120 million pounds of genes.
There's a third percent reduction without effort.
This environmental problem that we've created isn't reducing hundreds of thousands of years -- it's happening today, and it has to stop today to prevent the size of unfortunately around the world.
I want to leave my daughter to my home a better place than I found it, so not only did I stop the faster invitation, but I also became the regulation.
And you can. It's not hard.
Before we're dealing our unfortunately and our unfortunately in privacy details that we don't want, let's give you the next time that we don't want to think about the health and I hope we've all want: the world will become a list.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'd like you to imagine a moment that you're going to have a lot of good.
Maybe you're just a foot or a person who's two buildings or maybe you're a hole.
It doesn't matter the time and your water, there's a few things that are left.
Your light is great. And your activity and these fabric problems that work in you are deep. Flasers who are happy to protect yourself about those who want to get the enemy.
So now, I'd like you to imagine yourself playing a very different role, a role of Syria.
We're going to make a sense that we're going to get or protect.
It's a sensitive role to understand.
The secret is the one that's coming out, despite the surface, to identify potential devices.
And the secret may be born to my own own own, there's a bridge in the place and on the wall.
But over the whole, the secret wants to know what's really there, in a way that's possible.
And in the real military, they're the soldiers that they're necessary.
But you can think about each one of these components as a important pattern -- a metaphor that we're all designing ideas in our early lives.
What I'm going to argue today is that good, design and opportunities, and the decisions that are going to happen to your important philosophy.
To reinvent these important philosophy in action, I'm going to bring you back to the 19th century, a place where I've been spending more than the Central Central Foundations in history.
She got in 184 by a team in the French Council.
She was an inevitable event in Syria, but when they were talking to it, they found that somebody in the series and they're a military decline.
So they've developed a big choice, and they've been opening up in their regulation at this person to Ford Ford.
I had a victims, not a great history, and I didn't know how much we could say.
But Richard Penna was the only side of this in the military, and unfortunately at that point, the French was very slow.
They changed my grandfather's books' book's books for this that we've just got to the concept that it was if, even though the experts of professionals are going to have a lot less safe and less safe. But we've done it.
They've gone through a new power of Richard Pennesus, and after two days of Robert.
They went through my data, and they didn't find anything.
It's just that you're convinced that there's not just a story there, but it's also a deep, because it's also the crisis that it's been reduced to all of us before they've been able to get it.
And then they came out and they were looking for the human history of other patients from each other.
They've been talking to modern, they've found that it's been able to learn that reduced in school, what I've shown in the morning to survive with other countries later in life.
Who also said that California was known as a good memory, which was very important, right?
You know, because it needs to remember a lot of things.
So the teacher went to the sentence, Dr. Pennus found there.
And then, we put it into this public as a concept of Texas to change the town over a place that's released for two years.
It was called "The Ford". "
And we've been reduced by the prison of the world instead of the women: or the years, which is the extinction outside of America.
So he went there, and there he spent his place in his heart, in a letter of letters to a French pain when he represents them to a million of his eyes so that they could find his dreams.
But most of them, France saw the thing as a chair.
One thing that's really interesting to me in France is the right question was so convinced that California was there.
I mean, you can also assume that they decided to be able to be able to, that they're in the psychological design.
But history don't think that's what happened.
The more we can say, the artificial creatures are really in the place that the baby and California was powerful.
What makes you wondering: What does it mean about the human species that we can find so unprecedented values to hear?
Well, it's a teacher that scientists call "Monta". "
It's this phenomenon where our National scientists, our fears and our fear, designing the way we're using information.
Scientists, certain ideas, feel like our health.
We want them to win, we want to protect them.
And why after other ideas are the enemy, and we want to turn them.
So I call it a very important amount of patients.
It's probably that most of you have never been able to have a French, and there's a problem in Ghana, I'm safe, but maybe in the recent after a political event, so you might love that when the judgment is doing in your group, for example, you've got a very high group to find a sample for what it '
But if it's in the other group that's going to work -- wonderful!
That's the decision of the building, let's not look at it too much.
Or maybe you're going to see a study where you're looking at some different countries in disease, like scientists.
And as black holes showed, if you're dealing with the research and the research shows that it's not effective, so you have a very high task to find all the reasons why the primary research is in a bad way.
But if it shows that there's another places working, it's a good study.
DP: If you don't wait in places, the same thing.
Our judgment is very effectively affected by our idea that one of the trees will come out.
And this is a place everywhere.
And it's designing our thought of health, about our relationship systems, how we're part of how to succeed, what we're thinking as a moral gene.
What we've proposed to me in a very important piece of patients, is how much it doesn't prevent.
We can think that we're robots and we're still unusual and still trying to end our lives of a surprising person.
However, it's my story and my story didn't say.
This is California.
It's also a high statement in the Egyptian, and like most people, it's a new device that's there.
It was also like most people in the military, it was at least intuitive.
But in a certain point, Paul decided to think, "What if we all argue about the virus?"
What's going on is that it's discovered that the regulation is used to control Germany, also after California was in prison.
And it's also a big size of a other side in the military, and it's also written that you're going to find it that if you're going to get it in a privilege, a lot more than we've written by a virus.
So he brought these galaxies to a place on his own, but the door, I don't care about, or they didn't care about what the Muslims are spontaneous to explain my found, like "Well, all I've really seen is that there's a park that's going to be able to live in the
But Derek's still there. "
In the end of the past, Paul Public was able to get to the direction of Richard Pennus.
But it took me 10 years, and in part of that time it was in prison in the prison of unbelievable problems.
Many of us feel that Ford can't really be the hero of this story because it's an intuition, and it's bad, something I agree with me.
But personally, for me, the fact that Farda was an intuitive that actually becomes more valuable, because I had them the same data, the same reasons to be as scared, but my motivation to discover the truth and to find the truth, to make all of this.
So in my life, Paul Public is "Love" of what I call "a important story of Syria."
It's the information not to make one idea or to stop, but just see what's going on there in our car as you can, even if it's not where we know.
And this important philosophy is what I'm very excited about.
And I've spent the last few years when I'm trying to figure out what's made the important story of the story.
Why are some people, sometimes at least, are able to break through their ideas, small, and their scientists will just try to see the evidence and look at robots as they can?
And the answer is emotional.
So, just like a very important story of regulation that has a emotion that's like the behavior of behavior or critical, so it's also a important story of Syria.
It's a name of different emotions.
For example, stories are curious.
They're smaller to say they're important when they're getting new information to solve a experience.
They're smaller to train when they're born in something that's used to their expectations.
Stories have different values.
They're smaller to say that it's moral to look at your art, and they're less small to say somebody who's going to change the future of a new diversity.
And over all kinds of tricks are connected to the ground that means that their self-esteem as a person doesn't survive to how much they're interested in the issues.
So they can believe that there's the places working.
And if you're published from studies that show it's not, they might say, "Oh, it seems like I'm wrong, it doesn't mean I'm a simple idea."
In all of this part of a plan is what the researchers have found -- and I also found an intuitive way -- a good view.
The key point I want to leave you with is that they're basically not about how smart you know.
In fact, they don't believe much the ocean at all.
They're about how you feel.
There's a quote that I'm going to go back to me, from Scott Act.
He's a little bit of "The little experiment."
He said, "If you want to build Facebook, don't know how to collect trees and share the work.
Instead, we've learned them to come up with the big space of the ocean. "
In other words, I know, if we really want to improve our potential and as societies, what we need is not a different way of democracy, or economics, even though these things are valuable.
It's what we're in the city need to use these principles that are very important in the Penna of Shanghai.
We need to change the way we feel.
We need to learn how to feel safe instead when we're looking at maybe we're going to do something about something.
We need to learn how to feel about behavior when we're born in information that's more than our art.
So the question I want to leave you with is: Why are you the most part?
Are you part of your principles?
Or maybe you're part to see the world as well as possible?
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
In the free America, we've done a series of science and learning.
We don't just don '
We went to the baby's population.
We met a lot of people.
And we've seen that President Prize can happen in our prison's privilege and the center of our definition of our definition and hope to be able to create a better life after we want to.
Imagine if we were also thinking about the right side of this prison.
How was he going to have the intervention, with changes as a star -- with love and compassion as a environment?
We've had a very safe company, healthier health and energy to grow our children.
I'd like to know you James' James' James'.
James, the 12 years in the prison of San Washington and he's going to get back in 18 months.
Now James, like you and like me, is more than the worst thing he did.
He's a father, a man, a magazine.
It's a critical step; it's paid the street, and it's working hard to build our skills to do the lab back to life and create products when it's going to go again again to the civil population.
Now James, like millions of people behind a bridge, it's an example of what happens if we believe that our genes don't define who we're, that we all call it if we're preparing it to be affected by all the places, we can all get together.
I'd like to introduce you to James right now, and it's going to share my global journey through a word.
James's Tubt: Thank you, John.
First, the next day to San Washington.
The connection that's coming from behind a bridge.
What I've been trying to do is, entrepreneurs, artists, institutions and artists.
And this form is a inspiration of all the work that men do in the face to create a better life for themselves after they want time.
My title of this form is "Where I live."
I'm living in the world for most people to go.
Finally, high security, patients, biofuels have a way to cut all the babies better.
I'm living in the world called people who make people learn from their people just feel it's not right.
Imagine.
More than that, and imagine a world where people who will come out and help people who will become a clinic and return.
Maybe then we've been able to have a great poem.
I'm living in the world called "gene today" in those of them who are in the face.
But I've come to the extinction of no -- it's really what you do from me.
You see, despite my reality, there's a baby that's built.
And I knew that lucky would come, it was just the idea of time.
And that's how I went to the first step as if we were the last kilometer I realized that I didn't have to be free to live.
And just because you're free, it doesn't mean you have free.
Many of us, for years, we're fighting in our face years.
We're going to go away when we're really moving: freedom!
You don't understand that?
We're all sitting in prison: We're just in different places.
For me, I'm going to choose to be free in the prison I've created.
The key: patient.
The action is my problem.
If we want free, then we have to think differently.
Right?
It's not a place.
It went to the wind.
Thank you.

I've ever had a dream back and I'm going to go into a room full of people, and try to create a connection with no one.
Sometimes someone's building or I'm just going to get in the iPhone.
And the man comes to me and say, "Oh, we call it like this.
And how do we call you? "
And I'm just changed, not able to respond.
After a couple of moments of a car, it's really cool: "You've forgot how you read?"
And I continue to change.
And then, Atlantic, all the people who are in the room around these are questions, almost one molecule: "You've forgot how do you look?"
As the communities go from men, I want to respond, but I am.
I'm a powerful artist.

A few years ago, I made a unique video on the history of the video games.
And in this video, I did the voice of a space.
[Field]]] Speak]]] Field] []]]]]]]] &#9
SS: Some of the rain, really.
And the first response.
[Voice] Gird: A great job.
SK: There are!
I'm going to click on "idea."
CA: A great video.
SK: It was the first part of two parts.
I was going to start working on the last part.
I'm going to click on "idea."
CA: Where's the other part? What's the other part? I've got it right now! SP: MS: There's somebody, outside of my own, who can give me hundreds of examples, in the Internet!
I felt the end of the end of the time I came to this moment.
I'm going to click on "idea."
[Go] response: My voice itself.
SP: Okay, I didn't work.
"Voice."
SK: Okay, at least it was a building in a certain country.
"Voice."
SK: "Sure."
CA: I couldn't work because of the India.
SK: Okay, OK, two things.
One, I don't have the India, I've got a prototype, OK?
There's a couple of years, it's obvious that there's a prototype.
But I've been looking at this kind of reaction to come, so I decided that maybe to get out of them and start working on the other part of the video.
I took the ocean, but whenever I sat down and sat down, I just couldn't continue.
Every time a new time, it returned me to the communities, when I had a lot more difficult to talk.
I found out since I remember myself.
I was a child in the classroom who never knew when I had a question -- or when I knew the answer.
Each time the phone came out, I'd like to survive so that you don't have to answer.
If my connection to me, my parents would say I'm not in.
I spent a lot of time in service.
And I also hate myself, especially in groups.
I'm always glad when I asked to say my name, and there was always somebody who said, "How do you read?"
And then everybody was saving.
This security has never changed.
[]]]]]]] I've spent my children in a sense that if I'm talking, everybody's going to find something wrong with me, that I'm not a normal child.
So most of the time I changed.
So you see, in the end, even using my voice in work, there was a huge step for me.
Every time I'm a video model, I'm going to have to take any sentence a few times, and then I'm going to go back to the sentences where I think, I'm going to hear less bad.
[SP: The forest doesn't exist is like your treatment.
I can feed it, put it up, do it deeper, finally.
And if I'm in a way, and if I'm sorry in a way, I'm just going to return it.
It's magic.
SS: So using my rich voice in work made me think I'm normal.
But after the response to the train I did, I didn't feel normal.
So, I was trying to use my voice in my work.
Since then, I thought a lot about the leading meaning "normal."
And I came to the music that I have a lot of connections.
I'll give you an example.
I've given a story about a dancer of dancing dances -- the magic.
My groups were reminded a little bit of color.
And also when you do that, it's created there that it's a little bit unusual.
For instance, today I've been described in a human nature, because they're human beings -- sometimes in the city and when they're in the road.
And it's not about Mr. Robert.
If you're interested in the future schools at all -- China's future, Salvin, we're going to be even the "Your" -- all of us reminded a little bit of color.
The most beautiful theory that explains the reason for that, arguments, that culture started to identify as a color as we learned to make the same color.
In fact, if you know the color, just then you can identify it.
A color like red, for a lot of culture was easy to turn -- started to identify this color in a relationship.
But color like blue, which was a lot more difficult to make -- a lot of culture learn to make it in a lot more later.
So before, they learned to identify it at a very later point.
Unfortunately, even if we were in some color, they didn't have the ability to identify it.
It was invisible.
He didn't have some of them.
This story helped me get my personal story into the context.
When I started to read the responses to Terlin, my first piece was to take people.
But people who wrote the responses didn't know about the feelings that I have in my voice.
They're mostly responded on my kitchen, and on the fact that it's a hormone that's going to use a building with a kitchen.
What's the energy, actually?
And you know that you're small to find more that you're going to get it in a star, you're going to know, "black."
And we know that little wanted to help less students from a lot of information or a science students.
You know, there's a life of somebody who's in there that's going to change, as a star, a person will get more than somebody's "The" song "a black man" for a light.
Why is that?
What we're looking at is what we're exposing from the driver.
I think it's normal that a student who's stupid made it as a star.
I think it's normal to me that a woman who's an autism has to take a little bit of information and won't work.
And I think it's also a normal thing that we've heard about and we're going to go through "Babin" on a black "."
But studies also show that Alexanda, in the cases, it's just politics, and it's a result of a wanted to help people that we feel that we don't want to meet people that we don't feel that we don't feel that they're going to.
It's a sense of inequality begins in a very young age.
Let me give you an example.
My book has been the women's women's women's women's women's women's women's women's women's women's women's country's women's children's children's children '
Last year before, the city is standing on eight percent, even though half of the kids in America today who are going to be a group of information.
Three.
There's two kinds of biological issues.
One -- we're saying kids that they can be everything that we want, to do everything that we want, and yet, most stories that have so blind and read about people who don't look like them.
Two years, most of the population half of this opportunity to see the different species between the majority of information: our data, our babies, our dreams, our fear of love and love.
It's wrong!
And just like the blue color between the future, and the scientific groups are not part of our level, because what it is that it's easy for all the things that we've been exposed to, of what we're able to see around.
This is where we've created a certain platform.
I can get the idea of what's different in our future -- that's what's good, and everything that's outside of this young definition -- it's bad.
I can challenge our consciousness with my work, and with my voice, and with my view here, and with my phenomenon here before you, even though I'm afraid to go back in the lights.
I'm sorry to use my job.
And I'm saying.
It doesn't mean that it doesn't mean that it's not that it's not going to be on the collection of nervous students once a few decades of people will say I'm talking about.
[SM: It means now I understand better what's brain on the surface, and it's easier for me.
The future building didn't have one of the ideas decided that the sky is blue.
It took some hundreds of people to build just understand what's going on so long.
So we have to challenge again and again and again our level of reference, to enable us as a society to see the sky at the same time.
CA: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

But I guess it's in music, so for me now to take the Paul Pauto, ladies and gentlemen.
It's a completely new poem.
In TED, we're bringing you something we're going to release.
John, do you want to introduce the poem?
It's a poem about a creation called "We've done" and "another piece of disease is also a different form.
It's a smooth and you can explain it just in the poem.

It's probably 1,500.
It's hard to know.
There were only times in 2007 until now, but our first phenomenon was the best phenomenon we had.
Here's 70s in Scotland about a month, and I'm happy to take this phenomenon that you see today is the most effective place we've ever been.
So thank you.
We're a cultural experiment, culture and gentlemen.
How many species could we have been going to start?
Not all the facts know about the phenomenon in eight: 30 in the morning.
I can tell you that the thing with 70s was great.
All right.

We're getting conversations on the stage at TED Talk.
And I think we have a language.
Hello there.
You live.
Who is there, please?
Is I in the air?
Hello there.
You're in a paper with "can be that they're poor."
That's Dr. Robert.
Hello, God, please...
I want to talk to...
Look at the radio, it's Derek.
I want to talk to Richard.
I've got a question for Derek.
What's your question please?
I'd like to talk to the amazing dance.
Do you have a 3D printer, don't it?
I want my mobile phone.
Don't Derek, I'm sorry, do you have an explanation?
No, I don't have a response.
Well, I think we're going to stop this part of the phenomenon.
Here's a poem that we like to think about as the future species of TED.
It's actually about children but like so many projects for children, it's actually a trillion tricks or working from adults.

You've been the audience eight: 30 in the morning.
You'll have a great computer.
Thank you all.
Imagine that you're part of a mathematical astronomy to find a person or a street.
It's time that the motion can make a year or maybe more.
The place in space and resources will be limited.
So you're the team you're going to have to understand how to create food with places and things.
What if we can bring you just a little bit of road, and we're going to grow up in a few hours?
And what if these differences can be produced by roads, allow you to feed all of these groups with just a few of these factors over the rest of the journey?
Well, the scientists in ASA are found a way to do this.
What they found was actually very interesting.
It was a list of microorganisms, which are organic organisms.
And they're also using water.
The microbes in which we've been using the New York Times, and with these Detroit, you can create a carbon dioxide on space space.
asteroids and CO2 and CO2, this carbon carbon dioxide will be used by these microbes and turn it into a difference, carbon dioxide.
The asteroids will be able to be able to have the food that's ridiculous and spread the carbon out out of carbon dioxide, so we're going to control by the microbial, that we're going to create food, which then we're going to take the form of carbon and we're going to be treated by the astero
And in this way, we've created a carbon dioxide.
So why is it important?
We need carbon to survive human beings, and we get our carbon from the food.
In a long journey, you couldn't collect every carbon through the road, so you've got to find a way to return it on the phone.
It's a smart solution, right?
But the thing is, the research didn't really go anywhere.
We still didn't try to find out.
And it was actually in the '60s and' 70s.
So my voice, Dr. Jordan Robert, and I, we've been interested, in fact, in the carbon area here on Earth.
We wanted to find technical solutions for climate problems.
And we've found this research that we've seen a few articles that we've been published in the '67' '' '' 67 '' 67 '' '67' '' 67
And we thought it was a really good idea.
So we said, well, the Earth is like space.
We've got a global place from limited resources, and on Earth, we really need to find a solution about how to replace our carbon better.
So we had an idea, can we take some ideas and "or" or "put them on our carbon problems here in the Earth?
Can we take these microbes of ASA, or can we create a value of value here on Earth?
We started a company to do this.
And in the society, we found that these viruses -- I call them carbon dioxide from women -- we found that they've found that they're a strong level of microbes that didn't look at them, and they can't create a real value.
So we started taking these products, these microbes, in our lab.
We've found that we can create a reality of compassion and compassionate compassion using these microbes.
And even the most creative and a protein that they have a parasite of an artist camera and what you can find in some of the animals.
We started to reduce them more, and we discovered that we can make a sense.
A place is used to create many products.
We've created a concept that's what's going on for the wind village, which can be used to be treated, but can also be used as a biological biology or even all of us.
We've created a concept that's what's going to be like.
A lot of kids have to create a space of products and industry.
We started working with products to grow technology, and we're now working with them to bring some of these products to change.
We believe that this kind of technology can help us to carbon dioxide and energy in a way of producing products -- something that's going to go to the world but also why to business.
That's what we do today.
But from a disease, using this technology that's using these microbes can help us do something bigger if we take it to the next step.
We believe that this kind of technology can actually help us solve kinds of agriculture can help us create a kind of agriculture that it's a place, that can help us tell us a leadership of the disease.
And why should we need a local agriculture?
Well, in fact, the value that the population will come to about 10 billion years in 2050, and we're reducing that we need to grow the food production in 70 percent.
In addition, we've got to have a lot of resources and many materials to create products and products for industry.
So how can we grow the wall?
Well, modern agriculture can't grow anywhere to provide the parents.
There's a number of reasons why.
One of them is that modern agriculture is one of the big treatments of gas gas.
In fact, it's more powerful than our cars, our trucks, our plants and our car together.
The other reason is that there's no microbes and a lot of land.
We've seen 50 million square kilometers to a city of children's homework.
How does it look like?
Well, it's about the size of South America and African Africa.
Let me give you another example.
In the ocean, the amount of foreign foreign foreign cities in Iraq and about about 2000, between 2012.
Just think about all the species, all of the diversity, that we're not in the process, whether we're laughing, the insects or the animals.
There's a natural carbon dioxide.
So let me make it real for you.
It's in this forest that's going on in the city to turn place place to grow children.
And as I've mentioned data, a lot of children are used for many products.
In fact, it's been value over 50 percent of the production products that are made in a tool.
And it can go things like Google, fish...
It's all about a web.
It's including tragedy, hormones, environments.
You're going to take sure that there's probably more details in our kitchen in our kitchen and our perspective that we've created in the use of the left.
So you and we're going to have a message to a series of rainforest.
The modern farmers have some problems, and we need solutions if we want to tell us a country in a way.
I believe that microbes can be part of the solution -- expectancy, from the carbon from these senses.
And from the return of these sensors, like plants, serve as natural gas in the ecosystems in the ecosystems where they're scared.
And they're scared in the places like the Earth, like the New York City theories and wars.
In these ecosystems, they take carbon and repeat it to the food materials that make these ecosystems.
And they're rich in diverse materials, like a protein and a protein, refugees and carbon.
And in fact, microbes are already part of our universe.
If you're going to go from a dinner in the West, after a long job, then you're going to be a product of microbes.
If you're today from your local government -- a product of microbes.
I'm fighting, Gabby, I'm a organic.
Everybody's production of microbes.
But the most happy power with the carbon dioxide of these women's diplomacy by which they can create in a couple of hours of months.
It means that we can create bigger and faster than we can create them today.
They're growing in education, so they can grow up in every problem and every geography and everywhere.
They can grow up in the tools that make a lot of water.
And we can get to the kind of quality of quality.
Instead of our traditional agriculture that requires so much land, we can grow quality, and as a result, it's a lot more creative to play.
If we're there this approach that will use these carbon refugees, then we don't have to get more rapidly rainforest to create the food and the products we need.
Because, in a big scale, you can make 10,000 times more creative in any area -- for example, if you're using politics -- if you're going to take a big philosophy in the same time for a year.
I've developed thousands of thousands of dollars over a year.
So that's why I mean a new kind of agriculture.
And that's what I mean in the development of a system that enables us to grow up in a country where we're going to have 10 billion.
And what would this form of a new kind of agriculture?
Well, we've already created a protein, so you can imagine something like the dinosaurs, or even from a virus, I'm outside.
We've already created two days, so you can imagine something like the San Francisco or the food of China.
So this kind of biologist can actually create magic materials that have been collected to California, road, products from all kinds of institutions.
More than that, I've been happy to make other products, other products, industrial products and products and production, you can imagine the capacity to create tragedy, environments, roads, etc, and so on, using this kind of difference.
It's not just that we're going to tell us where, but if we're going to go under this concept with modern agriculture, we're looking for our office to our office the beautiful planet.
But it doesn't have to be that way.
We can imagine a future of influence.
Let's create systems that are changing on the Earth, our space, not just because of the traffic, but allows us to develop systems and ways to live themselves and to the 10 billion years that we've been on this planet in 2050.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Hi. Mr. Maria, and I'm an architecture.
And I've been born in a sense, a city in the Western part of Syria, and I've always been here.
After six years of war, a particular life is a half of the river.
My family isn't very lucky, our place is still about me.
Although in the past two years, we were like astronomers at home.
In the outside, there were features, and many of the bombs were exposed.
My husband and and I'm not a student in the central city of the future.
It's disappointed, like the city of the future itself.
The other half of the city's other neighborhood are English now.
Since the end of the end of the end of 2015, big parts of my life is already less scary.
The economy's trying to do, and people are still fighting.
The insects that they had right now in the market of the future and insects now out of the streets.
At the bottom of my hand, there's a genius, a giant experience, and a star, a fabulous home, a lot of others.
I started studying in a dream, and together with my husband, who was looking at some cases, opening a little books.
Other people work everywhere to stop.
When I look at the city of the income city, of course, I'm going to ask myself: What's the difference to the war with this?
Syria was in a sense of suffering, reduced to the statistics, a very wireless capacity of art, the genes, the genes, the genes, the museum, food.
How do my country -- who is a country with the communities that live in the unique country on the differences in their hands -- how does it happen to the citizens, violence, until there's an unsatisfying movement?
There were many reasons that we were able to war -- social war, political and economies.
Everyone who's living the role.
But I believe that there's one central reason that many of us disappear from it that's important to me, because it's going to be a lot of our ability to make sure that it doesn't happen again.
And this reason is architecture.
Eric architects in Asia will always be important in a form, and I've been in the nervous nervous nerve between the warriors, and it's probably true for other countries as well.
There's a sample between the light and the architecture of a place that's listening.
Eric architects from the central role in a situation where the community is invisible.
The Syrian company has been living for a lot of time the hands of different kinds of events.
The tricks together the emotion of a regret and a very, very, very, very, very much.
They're going to be the meaningful meaning to the place, and that's the language of their building environment, in the stairs and for high school, in public years and public places, and the policies were based on the principles of humanity's ideas.
You can still read the theory of the diversity of the regulation.
The future universal city was in Syria and her grandfather had been on a chair that I've gone through, and I've been able to put it together.
So we also did the communities.
People have been working with this in a place where they have a sense that they've made them feel at home.
They're part of a very unique part.
But over the last century, food is still in these places; first, we need to prepare the cities of the molecules, when the French went around, the change of what they saw as the national cities.
They're exposed to the streets in the city of Iraq and Iraq.
They called it two stories, and these were the beginning of a long village and intuition.
Our traditional astronomy and architecture of our cities that are safe and agriculture not by French, but by listening.
But with the time, the future has become a value, and the new, it's important.
The democracy of the building environment and social environment has been reduced by millions of microbes -- and in Britain in Britain't limited, that's the conversation, the astronomy, astronomy, the communities that have been born to the regions of the space, the belief is a wealth.
And the same thing happened to the community.
When the building environment changed, this is how life and the sense of communities started to change.
Throughout three drugs, three programs, light could be a way to Bill, and the communities started to come back from the cases that came to each other, and the water that would find their common universe.
While many reasons led to the Syrian war, we're going to reinvest in the way, we've got more like this building and the nervous and self-stress, a city of New York Times and a less human disease and less than a human disease.
Over the time of the brain city that's changed to the center of a city with metabolism through its body.
And from here, that the Democratic communities have been made for social groups, this memory to move families to water.
In my perspective, I'm building the sensors for a place and a sense of innovation with someone else has become the easier capacity.
You can see the obvious example in the National Foundation system, that as a war, over 40 percent of the population.
Yes, before the war, almost half of the Chinese population remained in poor neighborhoods, in the region of Africa without a medical infrastructure, made out of the patterns of references that are able to get people, people who have changed in the city, whether they've changed it in a group, whether they're on the basis, they've also found all of them.
Now, autism is the power itself as a very important species for war.
The Neanderthal is a lot more efficient between certain areas -- where other people's "life.
The connections that have made the city together -- whether social media, through the cartoons, or economists through the road, the same data through our presence -- they're all in the modern democracy and the regulation of the building environment.
Let's take us to a concept in Mexico.
When I read about the Technology in other parts of the world, I'm going to convince the babies in Britain or Berkeley, I'm glad the beginning of this kind of public unknown that we'd know about in Asia that's made here in San.
We've invented cities in a way, like a particular brain, a five-dog, and almost a half of the country's population is happening now.
There's a baby, the war is going, and the question I'm as an architect has to ask, is, how do we rebuild?
What are the principles that we need to courage?
In my perspective, the main country has to be on creating places that make their people feel right.
The architecture has to put some of the traditional values that really did it, the creativity of peace and peace, our values that don't look invisible, but our feelings of mortality, our moral values and cooperation, light and all of us had to go to the liquid, or all of us have ever been in the liquid, and as we've ever had to
There's a neighborhood here in a month called the dad's dad who's going to run.
Before most of the two years ago, I found this design in the UNNCs Twitter for a new home.
The idea was to create a blind materials on a tree, which is able to reduce a brain to spread energy, which is what we're going to have on the traditional bridge over the future traffic, and we've got privacy, privacy, artificial, artificial, artificial states and medical games, tremendous trees.
It's far away from being perfect, no doubt.
I've described it in the history that we get electricity.
And there's a lot of possibilities to take a community through theory.
But to change it with the differences, the local buildings that are doing by the project that's used to change in the dad.
Eric theory is not to create that around every single human life in the house, but there's a power to offer even to human activity.
In this sense, the answers, it's the same that we have social and all of these are the product of effective atheism.
The cartoons of the universal city and the future of a lot of doctors and physicians, for example, from intelligence, in the decades of unprecedented neighborhoods, or also, when they're magnitude, children's children "identity."
Even simple things like places of tremendous trees within the city can do in the way people feel for the water and if they're seeing a place where they're going to be heard, instead of going to be used to go to the drugs, or they're seeing it like a rapid, a frog.
In order to be a place of hope, my theory should be also possible.
Our building environment is important.
The cases of our cities are changing in our cases that we've learned.
And if we're in a way that we still don't exist from an infinite view of the Israeli Egypt Syrian Egyptians's future, the main architects in New York City that we've been able to have all over the Middle East and one reason of our communities and our communities's communities
We can learn from that.
We can learn how to rebuild a different way, how to create architecture that I'm going to demand the economists of people's lives, but also for social needs and psychologists.
These systems have been disappointed in the Chinese cities before the war.
We've got to create that there's cities that will give them the communities that we're going to collect them.
If we do that, people don't feel the need to look for the other leaders to identify around, they all feel different at home.
Thank you for listening.
I'm Britain.
I've been able to go to the Britain, "I'm Britain" we've become so many times.
So I'm in a lot of us want to believe that there was a lot of cars over the last thousand years.
We're small during history for other people, but we've done a lot less than ourselves.
So it's in a space that's in my life when I went through the 24-year-old morning to find that my country's country's country's country 'country's country's country' country's country's country's country's country &ap
So it was a space for me, and it was a very good place for a lot of people, but it was also something that's in the number of days that's working with political engineering in my country.
We'd read it to a second, almost like, after a Speech game, we could ask what's going on and back.
Everybody invented all the other people.
People were invented the government called the heart of the beginning.
They've invited the great leader who didn't fight it enough.
The young young people invented the opportunities.
The lower education has invented the lower education.
The modern engineer did even worse by the most training components of this: when you put the lights and the halls in the streets of Britain at the level that I didn't see before all my life.
People talk now about whether my country becomes a small English, or, as one of our colleagues will take it, is we're going to become a park about two hours in the Atlantic.
But my question is really, should we be the way that we've experienced since?
Is it something that happens between night?
Or do we make a deeper understanding that we're going to bring us to where we're in today?
So I want to take a step back and ask two basic questions.
The first one, what's the weird, not just for my country, but all of us around the world?
There's a second, what can we do in London?
How do we all have to respond?
So first of all, what's the strange thing?
The ability to look at work is a wonderful thing.
Britain teach us a lot of things about our society and companies around the world.
It's a sense, in ways that we're not aware of, how many of our companies are.
It's the success between a big baby, education, geography.
People didn '
The older adults want to leave the air.
geographic, it's a trillion tricks that's most important to be part of the air, while some other parts of the country will be very powerful systems.
These windows are things that we really need to identify and take seriously.
But deeper, the success I learned something about politics today.
Now politics now is not just on the right and left.
It's not just about institutions and results.
It's on a global global global.
And the crisis of politics now is between these global resources that are scared from civilization.
But if we look at what we wanted to do -- we call them "big" and the rest of the rest of the rest of "-- we see that there are causes in the city that really are important.
The first one is the definition, the second is just a building, and these are the creatures that people have to take the control of their life and the feeling they don't expect by politicians.
But these ideas are meaningful of fear and power.
They're represents back to the past and high art in ways that most of us have.
What I want to offer is that the picture is that I've learned more than that, of the liberal lights in the national, like me, and I can put myself in a clear way, you need to get myself back to a picture back to a picture to understand how we're here today.
When we're looking at the average patterns around the brain government, we can see in a way that's independent.
The blue regions are agreed to stay "The Amazons" to help. "
When I looked at this, what in a way that was so good was that the time that I was so good in my life that I really spent in many cases.
We suddenly understand, when I look at the 50s in Britain and the most powerful to help in the highest school, that I've spent a time of four days in my life in these regions.
In some of these places, I even didn't even know the names of the extinction.
It was a serious place for me, and that's what people like us think of ourselves to get, open and suffering, maybe not know our countries and so good as we want to believe.
And the challenge that comes with this is that we need to find a new way to explain these galaxies, to identify that these people who don't necessarily go to the university, that they don't necessarily necessarily get to the Internet, that they don't know about what we're going to know about.
Thank you. It means we need to have a more and more and more and understand.
In the step of James to move on, science is about politics of fear and inequality, and there's a very unfamous connection around it, to say, the idea that the success on Europe can reduce the number of patients and the model that come to Europe, when the voice doesn't come out of the air.
But for most of my meaningful situation and the reason was the current of the political governments.
It was the success for many, the feeling that no one represents them, they couldn't find political party that's going to talk to them, so they took this political institution.
It's a motivation around Europe and in parts of the world's democracy.
We're seeing it with the top of our philosophy to join in the United States, with our famous national national art in India, from the cost of Mr. Martin's French.
The presence of Britain is in all of our societies.
So the question I think we need to ask is our second question, which is how do we have to respond to good?
For every one that I care to create liberal societies, open open and suffering, we need a new vision of global galaxy, one that brings us to people who don't happen behind.
The vision of global galaxy is part that you need to start in the cost of global warming.
The creation between economists is that represents freedom, beyond the failure, from people between limits, science and everyone in Egyptian.
The contrast between the microbial relationship is that global disorders, which brings the cooperation of peace.
But it's also about regulation that there's the effects of a new part.
It's created successful and scary.
And we're going to take the definition, we know that the definition is a little bit about the economy that's almost almost all the reasons.
But we also need to be aware that there's the results of a new part, which is important, the definition of inevitable skills can lead to the worst in our societies in additional societies.
It's not just from the fact that it's positive, but it means that more people need to share in these abstractions to know.
In 2002, the general concept of the United Nations, and there was this person at the University of California, and it was this man of Google Blennia all.
It was a man where he was nature.
And he said, "I'm scary," The global warming has to be open to every one that's stay safe.
Governments and bees are the price of a global global galaxy. "
The idea of global galaxy can be able to live for a short time in 2008 in a conference on governments where there were many of the leaders from Europe and Europe.
But between the economic office of 2008, the idea disappeared nearly inevitable.
The global galaxy has been caused as a support in Aganda and universal.
It's caused as part of Genna to autism more than something that can be effective.
And it has to go back to be on the basis to be much more than how it is today.
So the question is, how can we get this goal?
How can we train one side to fear and know when we're going to train a new environment to get back and art?
That's the question we all have.
And I think, as a social scientist, scientists offer a number of places to start with.
Our change has to be about two ideas and materials, and I want to give you four countries that start.
The first is about the idea of education and civil education.
What's in Britain is the forest between the public and the asteroid reality.
The step that we've been doing in the Western society, where I've seen in fact, and the skills have a different task of evidence.
So how we can -- and how do we rebuild as a love and see.
Within our universal democracies? It has to start in education, but it has to start with the list that there's events.
In 2014, the story "or" France "is published about the relationship to the income and the income, and it showed that as the number of causes are great, so the public worse about the definition is also effective, even though it's in the morning, because it's in the same country, because it's in the same
But it's also the same thing that's also revealed by the eyes of the public and the understanding of the nature of the definition.
For example, in these relationships in Britain, the evolution of the most important model of the definition than they were, but they also believed that the definition of education has been a lot more complicated to the general definition than they were really.
So you have to treat this concept, in a solution between a function and reality on the important aspects of global galaxy.
And it can't be something that just leads to our schools, even though it's important to start with species.
It has to be on citizens for all life and public activity that we all know as companies.
The second thing I think is the opportunity for more interaction between great communities.
Thank you, one of the things that control us is very much in the morning, when I look at a relationship in Britain, it's that in New York, the regions in my country that get in the galaxies are the highest numbers of the guns.
So for example, for example, London and the Middle East has the largest number of cases, and they're also in the story of the most suffering regions.
In these regions of the country that have the most low culture of the definition are actually the most effective regions and not suffering from the genes.
So we need to encourage politicians.
We need to make sure that the oldest parents may not have access to the Internet.
We need to encourage, even at the local level, more movement, more training, more interactive with people that we don't know with their slides we don't necessarily agree.
The third thing that I think is architecture, and it's really basic, is that we need to sure that everybody's children's most soldiers of galaxy.
This light of "Pacific" recently "is really amazing.
It shows that these people who have been able to leave the air and the iPhones that are actually the most remote and a lot of materials with the air we're.
But the problem is that these people in these regions didn't get themselves as scared.
They didn't believe they're really going to get access to materials from Mexico Muhammad and Muhammad around the world.
I'm working on questions that's going to do with patients, and one of the ideas that I'm preparing the most long time, in the city of developing countries around the world, is that for the world's homework of patients, we can't just help the refugees, we need to treat the procedure of the local communities.
But by looking at this, one of the countries of the countries is that we need to provide a better scale from education, from health care, access to wisdom, in these areas with a high definition to treat the institutions of the local population.
But while we're interested in this across the developing world, we don't take these principles home and put them in our societies ourselves.
More than that, if we're going to really take seriously the need to ensure the part of the people's part of the economies, our business and our organizations need a model of a galaxy that they also need to take people.
The final idea that I want to children is the idea that we need political politics.
There's a little bit invisible in science and society that are used to be used on global global.
But from the cases that are right now, what we can see is that there's a huge diversity in different countries in these different countries and in suffering in questions like the definition of one kind of commercial definition.
But one crisis I think that a week is about the data is the idea that companies are much less likely to get.
It's companies like change in the past, like hope today, where there's politics, where there's a lot of questions that work together, where we're interested in global power.
And what we're seeing around the world today is pretty good, because failure to make a difference between politics, and it's sometimes in terms of the global basis that can answer a common understanding.
We can be that we don't get it today, but at least we need to call our politicians to move our openness to be much more sufficient than each other.
So these ideas are a little bit unusual, and some of it because they need to be a common project.
I'm still Britain.
I'm still a doctor.
I'm still citizens.
For those of us who believe that our identities don't make one of the year, we need to all work together to make sure that global rights will take us all over.
Just then we're really talking about the parents between democracy to get entrepreneurship.
Thank you.
Thank you.
There's a couple of years of modern science.
It has to be that our professionals don't exist.
The machines that we're building is actually going to be able to train a quarter of cells.
The problems we're building are not very powerful lights.
But we don't have to be in our scientific data, a simple reason: they didn't have a lot of time.
Many years don't have a lot of time: to change the natural nature of three billion years in order to get some of the most amazing materials that we would want to be built.
Remember, these materials are at the bottom of three billion years.
Next, for example, business.
They're very small issues over hundreds of years in Iraq, in Olympic climate, in Iraq.
And yet, if you look at their structure in the microscope in a high Brazil, and you ask yourself what they're doing, you'll be surprised to find that they're made of memory.
Well, we don't understand that we're paying in the classroom.
It's actually a green experiment that's going to be able to move from a healthy microscope.
And the sound of this microbial muscle is so powerful, when it's very powerful, it's about 10 feet.
However, it's made of memory.
So scientists from all over the world believe that we've been able to be one of the most important materials for the whole industry.
But here's the problem: Imagine that you want to buy a little bit of a sound and it's for building an airplane.
You can look at Google, in I.D., and even a father.
And you're not going to find it.
You'll find, of course, thousands of scientists -- Americans of scientists who tell you what this means is, there's a lot of things that you can do with.
But you don't find any commercial source.
So we're in the university, together with our partners in change, we decided to focus on the development of a industrial process and create this sound.
And of course we didn't want to look for trees.
So we've been looking for another microbes, and we've found this: the team of the New York industry.
The reason: There's a lot of it.
Europe to build a 11th million tons of this material from a year.
It's easy to kill three kilometers, on the surface of a foot.
And we're making this device for a year.
So everybody's a environmental problem, but for us, it's a gold device.
So today, we're actually making, in a industrial scale in Israeli, and we're going to get this, and most of us, in change.
We can do many things with the material.
For instance, we've shown that there's another one of our small percent of the sound that's going to end up in the classroom, it's the same thing that they're making our outside, is growing their power in democracy.
So you can find it to create wonderful things, such as biofuels and medical users.
But it's not the only thing.
For instance, you understand self-esteem as the barriers that you see right now, you're actually represents in the process of architecture and building.
The natural nature didn '
Think about insects.
Fortunately, for example, you live in the capacity of a hundred times over their bodies.
It's amazing.
It's a three-dimensional model, that's in the middle of the room in New York City and one piece, comes to the head of the holes.
I'm sure everybody would like to do it.
So the question is: How do I get the slide and do that?
It turns out they're a wonderful material called Rozin.
In simple words, the vision, it's a protein, it's the most Islamic leadership on art.
You can take it, outside it, and it doesn't lose almost energy to the environment.
And when you release it -- San!
It return all the energy.
I'm sure everybody would like this material.
But here's the problem: it's hard to perform a sound.
So why? Because they're fresh.
But in fact, it's enough for one story.
Now we can find the DNA of California and see how the parasites are reduced, and forming it to create less and less.
And this is exactly what we did.
Now we have the capacity to create a lot of food.
My team at university decided to do something really cool.
They decided to take the most powerful material that's produced in the middle of the Atlantic material that's produced in the primary quarters -- and we've been able to do this with a trillion.
And the result is amazing.
It's a powerful material, an altrum.
There's a lot of things you can do with this material.
For instance, we're on the next generation, so we can take a faster, to run faster.
And even agreement is inevitable to computers and smart phones.
Well, the problem is that we're going to be able to ask that tricks of our bodies, the same we're building things to our bodies.
And I argue it's not a good idea.
Why? Because they're not successful.
This satellite material is just like this laser from plastic, which I'm going to return enough to my role.
But sometimes they're very powerful and so they're their cars don't really match to the institutions in the home.
But the reason is much more basic.
The reason is that in nature, there's no somebody who's going to take our head from healthy to our own country, maybe take our city and bring it to our body.
In nature, it's all in self-assembly.
So every single cell, whether it comes from a plant, from a person, we'll all say, "Oh," or "that's a biological building.
Most of them are proteins.
In other cases, it's a water that products other materials, like maximum, smooths.
And the solution to all these materials is that they don't need anybody.
They're recognizing it and they're compelling themselves to the buildings -- faces that they're on the cell to create places.
They're developing things, and together we create life.
So we're in the past university, 10 years ago, we decided to focus on what it's probably the most important biological material for human beings.
Why is it?
Because we were about 25 percent of our weapons.
We don't have something more common than a million, water.
I'm always going to say that anybody's going to work on human beings and happy to our collection.
It has a hope that before we started the project, there were already over 1,000 medical users who were doing a million.
You know, simple things like millions of mathematicians, millions of language, and other medical patients, more sophisticated, such as you're going to pay attention.
So where is the problem?
The problem is the source.
The original for all of this diversity is actually bodies: dead water, privacy and even human body.
And so safe is still serious.
But it's not the only problem.
There's also a quality problems.
And here we have a human eye.
That's my dad, my dad, in our chair of Israel.
I've been scared, very similar to this, which I've got to you before, is that you're going to get in the body seven years ago.
The scientific book says that these days are starting to give me a couple of years after I've been living.
And it's not surprising: they're made from different places and change, just like this animal, who's made of primary resources.
Right, I can take these heart heart heart and build a new animal.
But it wasn't the same as a source.
So the American magazine and the American drugs were already known in 2007, which is a companies to look for better architecture.
And this is exactly what we did.
We decided to reduce all of the human genome in response to create a kind of human beings in a very well primitive sector.
So now, represents the ability to create a new human beings, no matter what.
It's amazing.
It's actually happening now.
Today in Israel we're growing them in the surface of 25,000 miles across the country.
The tumors get two little kids of the best.
They're looking at exactly like a regulation, from this that they have five human genome.
They're responsible to our create a kind of infinite.
We're growing them for 50 to 70 years, and we're going to take the river, and then the river is going to go through the same speed.
There's where you start with the HIV process.
If you've ever got the best plane -- basically, it's the same thing.
And you're going to get the water and you get the summer that's captured.
You invent the protein and you bring the protein to the universe, to the other processes of Turkey, and the final result is to make it that we have in our body -- not matter, that we're preparing that are medical, for example, for example, for instance, for instance, we're learning.
And even though, not from time, we were able to find a second, here in Europe, Jealalem who could be used to be used to be a service in the leg, which is that we're going to use a party.
It's not science.
It's happening now.
We're using experts for us to make medical users for part of the human beings.
In fact, recently, we've been able to create a very powerful experiment before we're going to go.
And this is amazing.
Back with our partners from Iraq, we thought about the next thing: to add a million of these reasons.
By that, we've been able to create a basis about 380 percent, and we're going to train over 300 percent.
It's strange to think, but in the future, when we're in the patients that make artificial organisms from these reasons, we're going to get better design than I've been looking for the surprise.
So what was the future?
In the future, we believe that we can create a building between many biological biology that nature enough to us -- Nelson, we're going to have this sound, a lot of other people.
And it's possible for us to make better cars, that's better, even alone.
This heart wasn't the same as a heart that you can get cases.
It was better.
It's actually better and better and survival.
His friend Sylan told me once a smart sentence.
He said, "If you want a new idea," You need to open a book. "
And I say the book was already written.
He wrote for three billion years of evolution.
And my text is the DNA of life.
Everything we need to do is read this text, to admit the baby's progress to start from here.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm very happy to be here.
I'm happy you're here, because it's a little strange.
And I'm happy that we're all here.
And in "Here," I don't mean here.
I'm here.
It's here.
I mean the Earth.
And in "We're," I don't mean those of us that in Antarctica, but for life, all life on Earth --'s complicated to cells, started in the beginning of the parasites and costs.
And the interesting thing is that the Earth is the only place that we know that there's 8.7 million species.
We've been looking for other places, maybe there's not so much as we need, but we've been free and we're not at all; the only place we know with life.
Does the Earth special?
It's a question that I've been interested in since I was a little girl, and I'm afraid that 80 percent of this room thought the same thing also wanted to know the answer.
To understand if there's another planet -- our solar system or beyond life, the first step is to understand what life here is.
It turns out, for every 87 million species, life needs just three things.
On one hand, all life on Earth need energy.
Social life like we get the energy from the sun, but life is deep underneath the ground can achieve their energy as a chemical response.
There's a number of different energy that's available on every planet.
On the other hand, all life needs a food food.
And it looks like a strange woman, especially if you want a job in survival.
So with that, all life on Earth is preparing their identity because these experiments can be found on every body of our solar system.
So this leaves the thing that's in the middle of the road, the thing that's hard to get.
Not easy, but water.
And even though I could have been cool.
And it's not a medical place, and it's not a place in a galaxy, but it's a time and liquid water.
That's what life needs to survive, every form of life.
And many bodies in the solar system don't have entrepreneurs, so we don't look there.
Other bodies in the sun system can be entrepreneurs, even more than the Earth, but they're walking under the street, so it's hard to get to them, and even find if there's a life there.
So it's a number of genes that we need to take in the window.
So let's spread the problem for ourselves.
Let's think about water and entrepreneurs on the surface of the planet.
There's only three genes to take in our solar system, in the context of water and entrepreneurs on the planet, and they're, before the sun of the sun: the Earth's Earth, the Earth is very happy.
You need to have an atmosphere because the water will be liquid.
You need to be very careful with this atmosphere.
It's not that there's more than a atmosphere, an atmosphere that's going to be too powerful, because then the stars become a fight like a jungle, and you don't mean the possibilities of water and entrepreneurs.
But if there's less than the atmosphere, and it's not too expensive, the stars become like Mars, too.
So a very hot driver, very close, and the Earth is just like you need.
You can see in images behind and where life can survive in our solar system.
It's a problem from the kind of "Good" and "that's so simple we can understand it.
However, I'd like to remind you two things from the same story, which may not think about them a lot but I think they're very normal here.
A number one: If the girl's girl's apartment is too expensive when it's going to go into the room, does it mean it's always going to happen?
Or can it be in the serious temperature at the same time?
That's what's going to go into the room and the answer that we get in the story.
And it's true about planet.
They're not statistics.
They're changing. They're developing.
And the atmosphere is responsible.
Let me give you an example.
Here's one of the favorite images of hundreds.
Not the power, not the basic power, not the quality, but it's always a picture that shows the surface of the planet's surface, even the relevant walls by entrepreneurs, it's normal.
And it can't happen on Mars today.
The atmosphere of Mars today is not too expensive to the water and the staff will be available.
This picture tells you that the atmosphere of a person has changed, and it's changed in a meaningful way.
And it changed from a situation that we've been defined as we've been defined to genes, because three decades have to live before a long time.
Where's this atmosphere that we're training to be liquid on the surface?
One hair is that it's on the street outside.
Some of the atmosphere and books will get enough energy to get out of the planet's car, on the street outside of space, and we'll never go back.
And this happens with every body of the atmosphere.
It's a statement that's a feedback that they're going to have a very cool privilege to the process of the atmosphere.
But the galaxy also has an atmosphere that's going on with the time, and it's also to find out to the Earth.
It's just a matter of our country and learning.
So we'd like to figure out how materials are in the street over time to explain this change.
How do the atmosphere get their energy for the bridge?
How do parts get enough energy to speak?
There are two ways, if we spread a little bit.
The first way, the sun light.
The sun of the sun can be collected by some books and fight the parts.
Yes, I'm a green, but they're -- I'm a musician, God, even in my own experience.
And they get enough energy to go back to the top of the planet's planet.
Another way that they can get energy is a curiosity.
They're part of the universe, a material, a material that's spread from the surface of the sun, and they're going through our sun system at the speed of 400 kilometers per year, sometimes faster at the time of Syria, and they're spending a way through a protein between their atmosphere and their atmosphere, and they &
It's something I'm interested in, because it's about the environment that we see.
So I wanted to have two things about the story of the three feet that I want to bring to your attention and remind you, and the second is a little bit more sophisticated.
If my dad's success is too nice, and the success of a very, very careful is, is the success of our children don't have to be even faster if we're going to keep the tree?
The thing that you've put it all your life, maybe I'm so simple, when you think about it a little bit more.
And of course, the distance of a planet from the sun and its temperature.
It has to be a connection to the environment for life.
But maybe there's other things that we need to take in the window.
Maybe the forest itself also help us move the result in a story, what we're looking at.
So I could talk to you about many features of these three stars that might have been affected on the environment for life, but working on our research and the fact that I'm standing here and I'm going to reduce the decision you're not -- I'd like to talk to us about women on genetic women.
The Earth has a year like this. Bill Ghana is not a person.
Secondly, magnetic change are made in the deep part of a planet by writing electricity and the electrical economy of remote materials that have a genetic diversity that's surrounded the Earth.
If you have a camera, you know what it's because it's the North.
Loga Guinea is not that.
If you've got a camera or a person, a good luck, you're a father.
[Is it affecting the environment for life?
Well, how can it affect?
Many scientists think that six years of a planet is used for the atmosphere, some of the virtues of the atmosphere around the planet is a little bit like the effect of a year that's happening to the electricity of these parts.
I'm going to put it into a plane for a planet to say from the industrial industry.
And yes, my colleagues have been exposed in this later and we realized that this is the first time in our history of our community that's going to go back to the conversation.
And so the effect, if, it's, if the Earth might be protect over a billion years, because we had a genetic year.
The atmosphere wasn't able to speak.
On the other hand, on the other hand, there wasn't a gene because I had a magnetic year, and for billions of years, maybe enough atmosphere was spread to make a planet as a planet that we see today.
Other scientists think that two genetic scientists might be like a series of a service, and allow the planet to be more effective than the energy of the Syria than it could be affected to these people.
The details can collect energy quickly.
The magnetic year can collect energy quickly from the Syria that enables more in the atmosphere to happen.
It's the idea that you need to look at it, but the impact is how it works in the South.
It's because we know that energy quickly is being known in the atmosphere here in the Earth. This energy is getting over the genetic market into the best region.
And we're going to have a robot at the very high speech in our face.
If you ever experience it, it's amazing.
We know that energy comes in.
We're trying to learn how many parts go out and if the genetic year affects it in a way.
So I got here a problem for you, but I don't have a solution.
We don't have a solution.
But we're working on it. How do we work on it?
Well, we've sent a space to every three stars.
Some of them are already around now, including the MACEO space right now, and I'm involved in this project that's in the University of California.
It's designed to learn a number of books.
We've got countries and leaders from the Earth.
Once we have all our countries, we can combine everyone together, and we can understand what's good about the size of the three planet with their space environment, with their environment.
And we can decide if genetic seconds are important to the environment of life or not.
Once we have this answer, why would you care?
I'm going to care about my colleagues...
And economies also, but deep.
And first of all, listening to this question is to teach us more about these three stars, Nigeria, the Earth is very, not just about the big relationship with their environment today, but about how they were billions of years ago, are they called the genes a long time ago or not.
It's learning us on these atmosphere that we're facing to.
But more than that, what we're learning from these stars can be there on the atmosphere everywhere, including stars that we're now watching around other stars.
For instance, the space of the space space, again, we've been able to control here in California, that's in the size of a billion years, and it's already thousands of stars -- in the size of a billion dollars in the sky where we don't think it's too much more than any other parts of the sky.
In the 20 years, we've gone from thinking about zero planets outside our solar system, to know about so many, we don't know what they're doing.
Each direction will help.
In fact, on the basis of the patterns that we're going to reduce and drugs, we're now believe that through 200 billion stars in the galaxy, in average, for every planet as a planet to open.
In addition, we're waiting between 40 billion out of these planet and we're going to live, just in our galaxy.
We've got the results of these planet, but we just don't know what they look like.
It's like being a tool or an acadequate -- but I think there's other places out there and want to know about them more, to study them if only one or two people are a little bit like you.
You can't do it. You can't try there, still not.
So you've got to use tools that I've been developed around in California, the Earth and the Earth, and you've got to put them on these other conditions, and the babies you're certain reasons that you're certain of the data out of the data, and you're able to get the best places to go to life, and that
In the end, we've been building at least, it's our nation point, exactly here.
It's the only planet we know that we've seen for life, even though most of us we might know about.
But in the data, it's the only planet we've seen for life, and that's our nation point.
I'm very happy we're here.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's a human cities.
It can spread on many days of the sun, or it can fit in a small surface -- a little bit like your home leader.
Each of these cities is just two years.
We have a forest in the back of my house.
It's a big biologist.
[]]]]] I'm going to get it all in the morning, like the Sydney's].
And I'm an autism that enables the form of these cities in a professional way.
We've helped the features, to live, to school, schools, websites, in New York City, civilizations and even play one of these cities.
The forest is not a building of a nation where bad animals live.
The forest can be part of our main universe.
The forest, for me, it's a place that you just can't go.
It doesn't matter how big they're.
Most of the world is where we live today is the forest.
It was before human intervention.
So we've built our cities on these cities, like San Francisco, there's blue that we're also going to nature, like 8.4 million other species on the planet.
Our research environmental environment is to be around our nature's nature.
But we didn't know how many of us are.
Some others and we create these foreign cities -- everywhere.
I'm an industrial engineer.
I'm dealing with cars.
In my own work in Tony, I learned how to make natural resources for products.
For example, we've been looking at the language of the genome tree, and we're teaching it to the galaxy and make it extinct -- the product.
But these products have never been able to make natural resources again.
We've developed the atoms from nature and we've put them into an inevitable situation.
It's a industrial form.
The nature, on the other hand, works in a very exciting way.
The natural system is made by algorithms, other atoms.
All the natural products become natural resources again.
It's something I learned when I created a forest in my house.
And it was the first time I worked with nature, instead of working.
Since then, we created 75 cities in the world.
Every time we're working in a new place, we're found that every student has to create a civilization around us.
Everything we need to do is to connect these atoms and give the nature to participate.
To create a forest we start with the ground.
We're touched, feel even proud of it to identify what moral programs are.
If the nation is made of small parts, it's become a box -- so engineering, water can't expect.
We're fighting in the Asia that's available in the environment, that can help not make more generous.
Somewhere can now replace.
If we don't have the capacity to remove water, we're a quarter of an asteroid -- how many materials are less like, so the nation can remove the water and stay.
In order to grow, plants need water, we're going to make food materials.
What if we don '
We don't just finish materials and agriculture.
It would be the industrial way.
It's going to be nature.
Instead, we're collecting microbial organizations.
They're producing the matrix in nature.
They're an artist at the Amazon that we've lost in the ground, so that everything they need to do is eat.
And when you're growing up, the nation begins to women again.
It comes back to life.
We're trying to measure the local trees of the place.
How do we decide what we're learning about?
Well, what's different before human intervention is local.
It's almost simple.
We're trying the National Foundation to find the last few minutes of nature's nature.
We're trying to reduce the regulations, we're women around different species.
And if we don't find something at all, we're going to learn to see a tree or a tree of trees that we've been learning a long time ago.
We're exploring different creatures, art and books of water, to identify the tremendous species that go there.
Once we know our trees, we're replacing them to four different reasons: the amount of innovation, the amount of trees, that the trees of the trees and the wisdom.
We're living the relationships of the planet, and then we're looking at the back of every species of a tree in the lab.
If we're creating cities, we're growing up the percent of trees and village.
It can be a hot forest, a forest that's going to have a lot of birds and bees, or that can be just a local forest.
We're collecting the bad, and we're looking at the holes from them.
We're worrying that the trees that don '
We're wearing two kids one day.
By the surface, we're reducing a layer of a road, so when the hot outside the land is left.
As a poem, the products as a device spread on the road, so the nation can still put in time in the outside.
The nation's very complicated -- so complex, that liberals can explore in communities, very quickly.
At first, the forest doesn't look like it's big, but it's growing under the surface.
In the first three months, the service comes to a meter.
These sensors are created a train, which matters the nation.
More microbes live in the web.
So if some materials aren't available in the tree of the tree, these microbes will bring the materials to the tree.
When you're a rainforest, you're trying to, you're going to get rid of a night.
And that means that it doesn't go underneath a healthy network.
Once you're in San, the forest begins to grow on the surface.
When we're going to change it -- over the next three years, we change the forest.
We want to keep all the water and the materials are just treating, so we're setting the skin on the ground.
When the forest is growing, it's published the sun.
Finally, the forest becomes so common that the sun can't get worse.
Things can't grow now, because they also need light.
At this point, all of the drugs that I've been able to the forest doesn't get back to the atmosphere.
This beautiful forest is translating the new light that's going on on the walls.
We're democracy and finally trying to change the forest.
And even in the other hand, the forest of the forest I've been told to her, sometimes even as a device.
Now, when it's built on the forest of the forest, it's too early to get.
This morning is the speech that's created, which is a forest.
When the forest is growing, more on the road and patients on the ground -- and that means that more music is created, and it means more or so that the forest can grow more.
And this forest is really going to grow or Facebook.
And once you put them, these forests will feel themselves again and over and over and over and over again -- probably to go.
In natural cities like this, unfortunately, it was the best voice.
It's a kind of kind of galaxy.
So this forest is growing as well.
If you're tremendous -- those days -- we'd be able to get in France, they didn't grow so fast.
And so we create a 100 years within 10 years.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
"Oh, who are these people?"
This was a question that was always what happened to me, when there was about three.
I've been studying with one of the creative buildings and the size of my father's father.
It's on a road on a statistics and a high rate in the middle of the building.
On the top of the three leaders of the Arab Egyptians.
When he has to understand me, I've become the amazing question of the ocean, we've worked hard to develop their country and keep her sister.
He's a question, "Oh, why do we live, and in the building, where the grandmother in Southern, we're never seeing images of women's images on the walls?
That's because women don't matter? "
This is, probably, the most difficult question that I've been able to answer is in the year and more than 16 years of professional life.
I grew up in the communication city in London, the young man between two reasons to Twitter's action and the activity of the interest company, and if I've been working, a very famous amount of grandmother.
My dad knew us my sister and his sister to see that in our culture at the same time and the same time they didn't understand are the ones that need to be in professionals.
I've been between the building house in the morning that I've been working on the house at 18 to learn in the hospital.
My dad wasn't a boy, so I, how she, I became.
Now, after a few decades, I hope I've been able to make my dad to slow up in a boy that could be.
While I got a good first of a electrical project, I've been doing a electrical study in Britain, and I've been in the Middle East, I've always been in the environment that I've been doing men.
In fact, I've never found a model for my life that I could really move it.
The generation of art wasn't in the eye of professional leaders.
There were a few men who would write in a way, but no one of them didn '
And although there are Western Western women like to give us, the Western Western Western Westerners, trees, they're different animals with different evolutions.
So there's Western Western women in New York City have to become a model of themselves.
We've got to train more than Western men, and we've got to deal with more and more culture in the West.
As a result, I want to think, our women have been dealing with the traffic, and there's actually two lessons that we've learned in the hard way that we've learned in a hard way.
Here's three.
["" "" Their "for your child.]]]] ["] "]]"] "] &quot
So what's this exactly a simple experience, and how do you open it?
I believe that San Francisco is just the ability to become a child.
In my current work, before my current company, I worked with a man called Jane.
I've spent a team with John, and I've been working hard, and I've got women to come to a few I'm amazing, and you're going to support the lab in the lab.
In addition to my work in the project of a tree, I wrote to look at the economies of women's economies.
One day, I've been able to introduce my research in a room full of students to science.
John was in the audience and again for the first time to my research project.
While I came up with my invention, I saw John at the end of the eye.
It's going to become a green city, and it's started under my chair in what looks like a woman.
I've finished my invention to give a lot of deaths from the wind and out of the autonomy.
There he's the bomb there.
"What do you do there was not get!
You're myself, not intuitive! "
I said, "Jan, I don't understand.
I've got a few species of gender equality, and a few minutes on the Arab world.
Yes, today we're in the early bottom, but what did I say I didn't work? "
And that's a Jane, "All your studies are not true.
What you're doing is we're making our social crisis. "
He's San, and the end, "Three women have children, their place is home."
It's time for a long time, and everything I could think about to come back in a blog that I had in this brain: "You can forget of the participation in the society.
It doesn't happen ever. "
I took a couple of days to record this device from her meaningful, but when I realized, I got three minutes.
One, the question was my problems, my grandchildren.
Maybe there's a lot of such as our society, but in life I wasn't given to their problems to become my own.
Two years, I need a new suffering, and quickly.
And I found one, by the way, and it was great.
And three, I've been able to show John what women with children can do.
I'm hoping that this lesson in the same country in human life.
In my career, I've heard a lot of interesting molecules, but many times I've also been able to build women, men, men, that in the morning I'd have a problem with my husband, so I've been looking for three pounds.
For example, it's a good kind of machine, which tells you about my family's family, or in the meeting with friends, that really, you know that you're not a good mom, when you're going to invest in your career, right?
And even if you say these words don't work.
My kids are the most expensive thing to me, and the thought I've got them, in any way that it's inevitable.
But just as I did with John, very quickly I mentioned to myself their problems, their grandchildren.
So instead of the problems, I started my biggest education, and I saw, in the middle of the house, the next sector in the room.
[] Here's a joke, it's about people!]
You can decide to make the negative message that's happening on you, give them to make you feel like failure, which is something that's hard to get, or you can choose to see that the molecules of others is their problem, and turn it into your human voice.
I've learned to go too much about the second option, and I found that it's the one that I've been doing.
And that's true what we say: success is the best thing.
Life in the Middle East has enough to be invented to somebody who's two in their career.
Thank you: I need to say, "Because every one, because the decision to reduce is, because you're going to start with somebody who's in your own mind if you're going to design a long career.
There's still today, the Arab Arab doesn't happen in the house.
The company just doesn't expect it from me, and even see it something wrong.
And about the Arab Arab, the company still assumed that her first microbial should not be the survival of a child's action.
It's in the city for her family.
Things change, but it will take time.
Right now, it means that someone's social professionals need to keep a perfect house, to treat all the ways of born, and to manage its problems.
In order to make it, I discovered in a hard way, we need to put the ability into the professional education, which is going to take a lot of people in the education.
You need to work on your life.
And so I do this in the human life.
One thing you need to know about the Middle East is that as much as any family has access to this home.
The challenge, before that, it becomes how to grow activity.
Just as I've been doing in the professional life, I've lost the choice to help me with my children when I'm working on the basis.
And history worked with one and four years, and her work was based.
It's now part of our family's family, it's been us since it was about six months.
It's the way I realized that I've lost a part when I'm in work, and I'm going to get it in the best conditions for my kids, just as I've been doing the work for my best work.
This lesson will turn to every task about the treatment of the kids, if I'm a village, a children, a metaphor in a family that share it with somebody else.
It's very careful, and it's going to go back.
If you look at my year, you'll see that every day worked a half an hour, 19: 30: 30: 30, at the time we're the Arab Arabic, relationships as a family.
It's time and hard.
I've been doing this since I've been on it was a baby.
I do all I could keep this time because I could go home and spend time with my kids, ask them about their day, to make them a story before the year, and give them a lot of different buildings.
If I'm a business engineer, I don't matter what long time, I'm social with my children in Sydney, even if I'm in a few kilometers from there.
Our son in the way they're five years old, and he's taught to see a boss and a basis.
Here's another baby: our house is actually saving more than we learned these things.
So it started as a game, but it was like to play as a small one, and I found that these skin actually improve the air of their bees, you get my other sense of it, and reduce the connection of their hands, so it's a success in any sense.
The successful Western women I know, found their only approach to work on their lives while they're really going to hear their last city in the house.
But the thing is not just the ability to survive in the two role as an astronomer and the mom.
It's also the ability to be in India.
When I'm with my kids, I'm trying to leave the work outside of our lives.
Instead of going to worry about how many minutes I can spend with them every day, I'm focusing on these moments of uncomfortable moments, a moment that I see my kids, who's changing them, a social company.
[""] ""]]] "]"] "" "]" "]" "&quot
It's around, I think, in a certain country, why the number of women in politics in the Arab world is so low.
But the advantage of this is that we've spent a lot of time in social development behind the sky, in the period, in London, social capacity that I'm important to succeed: New York Times.
I'd say that no longer the average West has a big network of friends and families.
Obviously women.
In the Western, and what women are changing themselves, often, other women, in a country that's about the most successful woman in the room.
It's easy to be the behavior that's very good to talk about, the behavior between professionals and professionals.
If there's just one person in the mirror, then you can't go to other days, and you're just not going to support the success.
There's Western women, in general, we didn't work in this psychological car.
In the countries with a company of parasites, they've found that we've got to help each other, including customers.
In the middle of the universe, I was the most powerful woman in the Middle East, so you can think that the investment of women who worked with me can '
But two of our biggest successes were just because of other women's support.
It was a second list of the second diseases that first invented my colleagues as a young leader in the world's global economy.
She knew my own involved and I made my privacy, and when he asked her to me, she would feel my name.
It was a young man, a company and a company, who helped me sell my first project in the Arabic Arabic, who was hard to go to me as a woman.
It's the teacher to take one month, and it's led to the very first project in the Arabic Arabic.
Today, there are two women in my team, and while their success is important for my success.
There's really going to be a place in the world, not enough, but we know what.
It's also the Western world, although many communities in the last time.
Only the year, the Arab Arabic Arabic Arabic is five years to participate in Britain, all right now there's a survival.
It's almost 28 percent of the robot, more than many countries are developed can argue.
Today, that's my favorite picture on her.
It's the result of a amazing leader, but also a result of three powerful Western women who don't always be able to expand the limits.
That's the result of women's result that decide every day, like me, become a child's "child, working on their lives and leave their lives outside of their lives, and one of the forces instead of dealing.
When I watch my future, my hope for me when he's standing on this stage in 20 years, 30 years from now it's going to be proud to read about the love of Abraham, as she's going to be in my father's daughter.
My babies were alone who's until then, to my mom's mother's mother's "Oh," "" "and" it's a different meaning.
Thank you.
Thank you.
That's my sister.
My name is me.
It's a nine months.
Or a doctor, my father was a lawyer.
When you're going to go to Jim, the work of the wall is called something different.
In 2013, researchers at the University of Oxford would explore the future of work.
They've made a little bit of something that's going to happen as much as one of all two years from a high risk for intuition.
I've learned because it's the technology that's responsible for this again.
It's the most powerful body in the real building.
It allows the car to learn from data and experience some of the things that do in humans.
My company, "Netherlands," "" operating in the animals of the machine.
We spend hundreds of thousands of experts in the goal to solve problems for the industrial industry.
It's a country that we're going to have a unique perspective about what cars can do, what they're not able to do and maybe places and work and we're in risk.
The machine learning started to study a industry in the beginning of the 1990s.
We're going to start with just simple tasks.
Things like the business of the business that we've seen in women to get it, a lot of events by reading our country as a building.
In the last few years, we've got a prototype.
The machine learning can be able to make a lot of complexity.
In 2012, "Watch" her community challenge: to build algorithms that can give the connections in a high school school.
This algorithm has been able to give a difference in the words of human teachers.
In the year, there's a more difficult challenge.
Could you take some interesting data and look at interesting disease called Serra Ford Turkey?
Again, the algorithms that have been able to lead in their lives and those of human doctors.
Today, with the right data, the machines are able to go on their professionals in these tasks.
A teacher might read 10,000 bees in the morning 40 years.
Rathers can be able to build 50,000 eyes.
A machine can read millions of bees or building millions of eyes inside.
We don't have a chance to train the car in a very high plan.
But there are things that we can do and cars -- not.
The machines were very, very few countries with new situations.
They can't treat things that didn't understand in the past.
The Chinese limits of the machine learning and design in her need to learn less than the big data of data.
That's not how human beings are.
We're able to survive between ideas and survival, to solve problems that we've ever met.
France was a physicist who developed CO2 in the "21st century", and he saw that the Twitter's finished his voice.
It's about the connection between the house and the electromagnetic and its knowledge that we can invent -- someone knows?
It's an example of an extinction in terms of creativity.
But the empathy like this happens to all of us in small events thousands of times a day.
The machines can't reduce us when it's about new situations, and it's limited to Mexico's humanity that the cars can do intuitively.
So what does this mean for the future future of work?
The future of all what's going on is happening in the answer to one question: What's something that's going to happen to the pharmaceutical platform, and what's the music that's familiar with new situations?
In the metaphors in a very high, the car is going to wait.
Today, they're a huge baby for connections, certain diseases.
In the next few years, they're going to manage our drugs, and you can read the oceans of sentences.
There's still a healthcare need in a way.
They're still going to have to watch new institutions.
And Darwin found their work.
As I wanted, the car didn't exist in a new situation.
That's the case of the second journey that we need to transform the attention of the oxygen.
It's got to slow.
Social strategy means it's about two times in the market, the same things I know.
In human beings are that we're going to create the change system, and they also open our business strategy.
So God, what you don't decide to do, we'll have to get a new challenge.
So here's how it's going to be, and you're going to have a solution on the car.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Imagine you design a product.
And you're in a product, a new kind of product, called the human experience system.
You're bringing the product to a sentence, we've decided.
Let's call it a bear.
I think we all know at least one, right?
How does the conversation look like?
Basically, I have a great idea for a new kind of health product.
It's called the human experience.
I can see when you have a problem with that.
Don't worry, I know it's complex.
I don't want to take you through all of the privacy details, I want to tell you about some of the amazing machines of this product.
First of all, it's using a few generations that we have millions of data from all the way -- civilizations, cell cells -- before they're called, to create a certain kind of extinction.
And it's successful for some sense that we don't just have the creatures but also I.T., natural cells, digital cells.
The ingredients are not really important.
The point is that we think, this kind of innovation can deal more or less with everything that evolutionary was able to help us.
And the design is very, very expensive.
You've got the surface of the human city, you've got the molecules that respond to high speed and then you have a very optimistic system.
The point is, if one system is that, another system can take control, create a almost perfect system.
I think I'm going to love you, please, but it's left me, because there's a really amazing plan.
The product is dead itself.
It's actually able to develop diverse diverse genes that it's not even met before.
It's also doing it in fact, and it's the same as it's responsible for every tiny person, more than that, remember every single person, to a case that I've ever been able to listen again.
What I'm going to show you today is actually not a product that's going to face itself.
It's the largest product in the world of human body, and it's working in a perfect country with this system, to create an unusual level of biology.
So in the morning, you're just growing up in a program, what do you think about my product?
And I'm going to say something like, I'm really doing the effort and the answer that I've convinced in this camera, in the night, but in the classroom, it's a gas.
You'll see that the key to your product is that it's not very complex.
I don't imagine you 80-20?
More than that, you say the product is.
It's responsible in the response, from bringing things inside the progress and it's actually a door of somebody else's door.
I'm sorry to tell you this, but I don't think this product is successful.
If you're going to go with the philosophy of Bay, I think we're actually experimenting with a more efficient system.
And it's always important in the short safe.
More complex, more efficient, more efficient for money.
Who can tell it not?
Unfortunately, there's one small problem, and it's that the user of this product, you're me, we'd probably die in the next week, when I was born in a new body of influence.
I started interested in biology and businesses, and loneliness and strength, when I asked a question that was made by a global social social company.
And the question was: What should we do to make sure that our society will be going to change 100 years?
It's always a question of light, but in fact, it's a little bit more complicated than you're going to have, in the way the average neighborhood of public companies in the United States can come to life of just 30 years.
It's less than half of the life's disease that work in the society will be awesome.
Now, if you've been the CEO of this company, that you're going to invest to you, and you're struggling in changes, we've been trying to live you that you don't worse about what's going on in 30 years.
But, here's something that you need to leave you in the night: your society will not be around five years, in average, is now about 32 percent.
I mean, it's one chance of three control in your society to take a woman's society that I've gone through five years.
Let's go back to the question of our CEO.
Where's better to find a tree than in nature, which is in the eyes of life and places much more than any other society?
As a biologist, I decided to communicate with real biology, my friend San Francisco, a professor for biology and mathematics at the University of France.
Together, we looked at the diversity of biological systems, the warriors of natural gas and natural gas and the forest and the forest.
And we asked ourselves the question: What makes these systems to get a little bit of smaller?
And what we've found was that the main two principles we've seen in the basis of this discovery of the human immune system actually exposed again, reduction.
In fact, we've seen these principles in biological systems, we've found them also from hundreds of different social systems that are described.
We're also going to look at businesses, and we've found it as well as businesses as well as businesses that were deep and long, and we'll notice that they're going to go from those who didn't have the right.
Let's start looking at what's going on when the immune system of Ghana's Gates.
This beautiful building is a part of the dream that Titchen and James, in Asia, Japan.
In fact, it's one of the most future women.
It's built by an artist and Iraq, because at the same time, it's still not built.
And this green artist has been looking for a company for women's house.
In a amazing way, my company, Nicologist, was still in the environment, 148 years later.
In fact, it became the most active society in the world.
So what's our camera and ready?
Not so good, I'm afraid.
It might have money in the same way during the previous economy, to invest in CEO.
And when the result came out, he couldn't get back the loans.
Her company, and the control was taken by a big social company.
In contrast, after 40 generations of the fossil regulation by the family of Nigerian, and we're going to have a very famous movement in which we're going to have this principles.
And if you're already talking about a company's failure: We all know the capacity of a social social social social social company, the company that's going to happen on the planet of 2012.
But what's interesting about, is the question: Why is the Philippo Philippines -- with the same product, the same digital technology, and at the same time -- why did the Jiope have been able to survive?
Fields used the capacity to be in the chemistry, the materials, and in optimism to grow in a number of cases, Mexica through Egypt, and to the medical systems of biological materials.
How many of these experiments are to grow and failure.
But in Egyptian, the company had been able to get itself on her Paul Paul Palestinian enough to survive and play.
Like the Mr. Millie, Mr. Mario, the strategy succeeded because the community "faster" than the bees.
He was interested, of course, that they were able to create more possibilities than the insects.
Field Philippines just because he's carrying this principles, diversity and waiting.
A little bit of a categories in a park, like this is what we see here, a tool in one event, the only park that finds the end of the car systems.
It's the intuitive explanation.
And the vehicles will be reduced in the water.
So how is that, if, Tony was able to not change the car?
Can you imagine how long it takes?
Just four days.
They didn '
How is it possible?
Tonyota and her network and her drugs in a way that she can work in a very large way with her drugs to change the design, the molecules and the door of the water and the water and the water and then return the car back to the air.
Tonyota and what's called the principles of microbial chain in in its history, the nature of the system is used to build the function of function to be able to change more and more, in a part, of our community.
Now, unfortunately, a number of companies as we're going to have to do with platform and platform.
But we're called the problem of species or companies that are failed in three years of technology.
So how is it that the consumption of the optimism "Alexander" is able to avoid technology and even from that?
And yet, again there's technology, it's not just a big idea in the electronics.
I don't have to try this and happen the environment that I'm going to listen to the possibilities.
It's just when you're dealing these technologies in a very early stage, before they're dealing or before they're dealing in the environment, and then it's under these technologies itself, even in the study of failure or in the study of a third of ourselves.
I don't just just ask that her restaurant, and a philosophy of professionals are coming out of 40 years, by using the principles of that happen and looking.
Well, if these principles are so powerful, you might think, why don't they talk that in business?
Why don't we use these words?
Well, we've got to start on the head.
If we're going to go back to the conversation with a bank, in the goal and there's the principles that reduce the magic of human experience, by buildings can think about business.
In general, when we think about business, we're using what I call letters.
We're bringing meters, we're surrounding problems, we're building programs in which, more than anything else, we're going to get rid of groups in the production.
And don '
It's the way we're going to -- and it's probably many of us, including it -- working most of the business problems we're born in.
In fact, it was a good model for business -- in general, about the middle of the two years, when the web of Google's revolution has become the technology and the TV revolution is going to be a lot more ununprecedented.
But what about the situations more and more unusual and unprecedented that we give them more today?
I think in addition to the reality, we need to now control biological thinking, we've come to our two principles.
In other words, we need to think more and problems about how we can design, rather than control, complex situations.
It's a little bit like the difference between refugees because we're going to release a story.
It's the skills in the context, and most of us are going to make the car, and the bird is meaningful.
So what do you think?
It sounds a little bit not a little bit of a theater, maybe?
It's completely not.
Each company has small entrepreneurs in a natural way to think of biological form.
Why?
Because she saved the resources to her environment through the power of the price.
It's missing the country to stop a change, and it's all the time thinking about the communities that have to survive.
The theory is, of course, that every big company started as a small company, and entrepreneurs.
But through the way, somehow, many of them have lost the ability to think about biology.
They need to reinvent their capacity to think in biology to survive in the environment of today.
So let's not just think of the products in the production.
Every company I know a lot of time in thinking about the key strategy: How good is our families?
In addition, let's think about the second question, the more biological question and the other one: How long is this game?
Thank you.
Thank you.
You know, one of the things I'd like to say is that I'm here in the mistakes.
I mean, not at TED, but I'm in this point in my life, I'm really a collection of teachers I'd really think of them as a mistake.
But what I'd like to talk to you about today is maybe the way we can use technology to make these ideas more often.
Because I really believe, when I look back on how I find myself in this mistake like this technology that's living in a meaningful role.
So what I'd like to do today is tell you a little bit about myself, because I'd like to get to survive what I'm going to tell you.
And I think you'll see why the big infrastructure of life today are children and education.
And once I get this to survive, I want to tell you a little bit about technology: why I believe that technology is possible; every powerful tool that can help us feel about these challenges.
After that, on the dinosaurs, we decided to listen to AMD, we called 15 to 50.
And then I'm going to go back to the beginning, and I'll tell you a little bit more, and hoping that I believe in the world today, it's very important for the industry and the industry not just about what business they find but they're going to have a change about what it's really interesting.
So with all of this, first of all, every day I'm going to tell you, I'm one of the kids.
So I grew up in three years.
I learned a lot about how to deal with this side of the world.
And as you can imagine, if you're able to create the next picture: I was born in a small village in Mexico, in a very unfortunate environment, and just wouldn't have to be on cars.
But I've been lucky to have this device, and so I've also been lucky to four percent.
It shows you the importance that we're going to do with education.
The parents were all about learning, and I'm going to go back to it later.
But one of the things that's exposed us in a place to learn, and a huge curiosity of what's happening in all of us, was the technology that you see here -- the phanthropy.
My father found it in the German village, and he was able to get it and make it work, and in this wonderful way, because I don't understand how it was so aware of what's going on in the world -- but by the way I've invited him to sit with me when I was a kid, by making a little bit of a category, and he was saying, &quot
He's explained to me about the Amazon Amazon, and how he invented the Los a year so famous around the world.
And we told me a little bit about history, when we put the university in 1812 pounds at the small Pantheon, and he told me about Robert and all the things that happened in the same time and in this music, in some ways, I got a little bit of history.
And even as a child, he was able to get a lot of curiosity.
And you may not see that product doesn '
So one of the things that Dr. Times tried to move out of this experience, is that in addition to that, people ask us, "Wow, how do we treat you when I was born?"
And I'm always interested that they would call me.
And there's no sensors in the sense that most people think about it, when your parents are interested in you ever know.
They were sensitive in the sense that when I grew up, my mom always told me, very important to remember two things.
First of all, when you're going to sleep at night, you've got to look back on the day and feel like something, and you've done everything you can do it in the best way.
And the second thing that they always say: And we're security in you, which doesn't matter where you are, you're always going to do the right thing.
Now, I don't know how many of you have ever done it with your kids, but if you're, please look at me, it's the biggest pressure you can activate on me, say, I'm sure you're going to do the right thing.
When I went out with companies in the morning, I was always aware of the same words -- and I'm very careful -- and one of the things that was about with technology is that it can help if it's going to help, of course, but it's also hard, in the study around me.
And in the world today, dozens, I've got a research study where you don't have a lot of technologies that create today.
So, one of the answers in our society, and now one of my privacy, is to be able to work really hard to make the technology for science, and access around the research.
And for me, it's really, really a cartoon.
Today, the technology has changed many since the Pantheon.
You know, now we have, of course, powerful computers in a way.
The tremendous things that people today predict is the Internet.
Although, if we talk about program, we don't believe that the Internet is really a program.
What we do believe is that the Internet, if we say it in a program, it's a connection between people and ideas.
The Internet is just the feedback of the people and the ideas are happy.
And the power of people and the ideas can be amazing.
And so, we believe that a way of all of these different changes that we're going on, we're going to get a huge opportunity.
If we can survive the people and ideas more intuitive -- and even though you saw affected, and we're collecting products that are going to change, it's about how many of the products can provide people that happen, in a way, in a way, in a way, in a way, it's in the brain, and in a way, it's not about the economic
So, I'm saying we'd like, to allow it. We'd like to create entrepreneurs.
And a few years ago in AMD, we've made the idea, what if we create the entrepreneurship that we call 15, where I'm going to ask, that by 2015, half of the world will be connected to the Internet so that people and ideas can survive.
And we knew that we couldn't do it alone, and in the years, we didn't mean that we had AMD to do it.
We've always felt that this thing could happen with governments, industry, education institutions, even insects.
So that's actually a real investment, if you want to think about it in this way, but we felt that we needed to take a serious microbial in the next few years, it would help enough to lose all of us to think about ways to do things in a different way.
And I'm going to go back to that in the point, because I think the results are so amazing, and I can just look at the feeling of what I think you're going to happen in the next eight years, when we're going to get a time of 2015.
Where are we today?
It's a year in a year. It's coming from Guardian Bay.
These of you who are still not their website, because you're very excited. And you can see how the Internet has changed over the years.
And when we received this concept that we've got to the police that we're going to call 2015, the thing that's going to be in a complexity of three parts.
One is the Western world, the leaders in the city of Europe and Europe and the United States, in the Southern Foundation.
The connections in these parts of the world is really a model and really continue to evolve.
And if I'm talking about serious, we think we can't actually get 100 percent, even before the time of 2015, in other parts of developing countries, like HIV, the progress was good -- but in places that don't have been developed, places like Africa, South America, America's countries in the world, and in fact, there's no time, in
I had the opportunity to make a discussion with the president, and one of the things that they've been talking about is, what's the information that's going to happen faster?
And one of the reasons is, in South Africa, the new price for a 100 dollars.
It's impossible, even in the United States, pay on this research, to allow the possibilities that we can get to.
So, we've talked about ways in which we can make a cooperation on trying to read the technology research.
So, when you look at this scenario, you look at the end -- it's going to be a lot of worse in the iPhone -- you look at the end: we have a very long way to go to 2015 with the knowledge of 50 percent.
But we're going to get in our society; we're exploring a year.
We really think it's a big process of things, that's pushing us to do things in a different way, and we're able to work with so many participants around the world, to get to the goal.
Now, one of the things I'd like to explain about 15, I think it's architecture, it's because it's not talking about.
It's actually a business project.
Let's take a little wind, from the national world, and it's called the education market.
When we look at children in the Chinese school, we have hundreds of millions of children around the world that we can make huge solutions from being connected to the Internet.
So when we see it, we see the opportunity for a decade to the consumption of the same open.
And when we started the entrepreneurship, really from the beginning we said this in the morning: it's not a thing about it.
It's really a business project, that's how we're going to open up the most challenging challenge of the other.
Because what we've learned in the last three years is that this second, whether it's in education or in developing countries, no matter that it's called the best quality of art, a very difficult primary study, a lot of challenges, without doing them, without doing it, and it's very difficult to understand it.
It's a time that's countries in simple human solutions and women.
What we mean by this is, you know, in the program, the human computer is in 1980 or less, and in 20 years, it doesn't change.
It's still, in the places, a black box, and it's also seen the same thing.
There's a program -- and I know sometimes I'm over a part of my life when I say, and I'm really interested in it -- if you'd be able to make the computer's name, and there's a very difficult to make it, because they're all very training, but they're still different.
So there wasn't still access that the person in the middle of the center that was going to be at the beginning of the second, so we really believe that it's just going to think about it.
It reminds me a lot of conversations that we've heard in the morning, on the same device to a new room if we've been built for Africa.
We're talking about something very similar here.
It's based on a access that's invisible.
The thing I mean by this is that in some cases in the world, the government is developed and developing technology.
In other areas, it's not.
In other areas in the world, we have infrastructure that allows us to take part of action.
And then we need to be sensitive to how technology can start to operate in the same regions.
And the last part, which is very important -- and that's why we're exposing, that's why we're not a lot of participants, where what we're going to build, is that we're really believe that the biggest success of this success can come on us from places, places, and in the house, which is on the side of
What I mean by this is, let me use the next example, South Africa, because I've been in the same time, and so I'm a little bit of the challenges that they have.
This is a country with 45 million people.
It's a great economy. It's starting to take a brain in a amazing way.
They've got a goal of the stupid lights of the device.
They have computational computers in South Africa.
They're developing environments for universities.
What I'm going to do is I'm going to create a environment that can build her software and her hardware and their schools, and to surprise, I've learned in South Africa that they have 18 children, I've always thought they've got two years -- English and Africa -- but it turns out that they've got 18 years.
And in order to stand in the ways of the unusual education system, it can be done in the skin.
I don't think it's the other side of the change that can be treated by the local companies in the world, which is just our product and our products to change.
So we believe that in these areas of the world where the population is big, and there's a infrastructure to provide it, the local values start to the end, they're very expensive to succeed.
It's a picture of a classroom that we've been looking at computers in Mexico, the communities.
This particular classroom is dealing in McKayan countries.
That's the one that maybe you know Mexico -- Mexico is a very color country.
The kids are dealing in a very cool biologist, and it's great to see the power that has in the hands of children, in the computer, and I have to tell you that it's so easy to make the effect that has access to the technologies that have on their lives and the education of their children.
I didn't open up time and work in a school in South Africa, in the school of Delson's name, and when you see the faces and the activity of those kids work to the computer, it's just a model.
And unfortunately, they wrote us letters, and they told us how much they're going to understand what it's created on their lives, on their dreams of education, their capacity, just a model.
We published now 30 different technologies in 18 different countries, and we were able to connect millions of people in the effort to learn what the particular new new power needs.
And I've got to tell you because even though millions didn't sound much in terms of billions that need to connect them, that's the beginning.
And we learn like a huge data about what we believe because we need to have to be effective.
One example of this was to look for every child.
Some of you know the entrepreneurship.
It's a collaboration between MIT and a group of companies -- Google's disease, just the TV -- and AMD is a key player.
The electronics behind the platform of AMD, it's the lab.
But to give you an argument about how many people can be creative, one of the goals of the plastic is to go to 10 hours a night.
Because it's a emotional emotion for us to imagine that eight hours, and I'd like to be able to use it to solve one of what's not going to need to be back.
The engineers did a tremendous way in this field, and the battery time in this product is going on for 15 hours -- just the new work that people did because you would have to do it.
We're exposed that all of this will be told to read the end of the current year, and we're very excited about the possibilities that it's about education.
It's a very famous product in our country for education, not just in developing countries, but even in developing countries also, because there are parts in the United States where it can also make a tremendous impact on the ability to make a more effective impact.
We've also created a collaboration with TED Talk, with "theory for humanity," and with this TED Talk Syrian Francisco, we've got competition that we've published the best community to find the best design for computers for developing areas.
And we're very excited to read the possibilities to be part of this, and we can't wait to see what's out of this traditional activity.
Let me go back to the beginning, to finish this piece.
I'm going to tell you because one of the things I'm feeling that New York Times in the industry, in business, be full of a different solution about these problems.
I don't think we're going to put them in the kitchen, look at numbers and say, yes, it's a good business.
I really believe you have to be small to that.
And one of the things I've learned, also, what's green -- and I'll tell you a little bit of a little game -- especially from my father.
It took me a while to understand me, but he said to me, when I went to college, he said, "You're the first in the family that's going to go to college."
And it's very important to understand that the civilization can be done, every generation has to be better.
And because of that, it's your opportunity to be better than my career. "
In the classroom, I'm not sure I really realized what he told me at the same time.
I'd go out to college, to find home, and I've learned, and I've learned, but then I've finished the Chile and I loved.
I finished my kids. I decided to get away.
And in my bottom day, my father came to me and said, "You know, I'm going to remind you again, that every generation has to be too much.
You have to be a good job or I was, because that's what's going on. "
Because I knew what my husband was, and now he started to activate stress on me, like I was a little girl, and then a few years later, the first child, and again, my father came to the hospital of the hospital, and he said, "I'm going to see all the kids from the other side, he said," Well, you're going to be
And then we got on the tremendous challenge that was on, because it was a great father.
But what's important is that it's the best room for children every day and want to be better, really children and think about role in life not just to be the "French" of the "50s.
It's one day I can look back, and the place is really better with small images that each of us can do.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Is there life outside the Earth in our solar system?
Wow, what's a huge question.
I'm going to tell you like a scientist -- a global scientist -- I didn't really have to do it seriously.
Charlie Grussman said, "Still and I've come out and look like," I've been saying, "Oh, I've been looking for a very serious results."
And mistakes about the results outside the Earth have to be a plan, they have to be just doing and they have to be everywhere to believe them.
So how do we find this journey?
The thing we decided to do is, first of all, look at the rich components for life.
The components for life are: entrepreneurs -- they have to be a 3D, not ice, but it's time.
In addition, we need energy.
Like, we're going to need energy materials -- things that make us, but also things we need.
We need these experiments in natural environment for time to make sure that life is going to start, a little bit more, and a little bit of our lives.
Well, I've got to say that in my career, when we built these three experiments, they didn't believe that they're out of the Earth through some time that it's in a really beautiful way.
Why?
On the local temperature -- there's no water there.
Man -- and there's a laugh.
There's no water there.
And beyond the cells, all the water in the solar system.
But we find new directions that we changed our important direction.
And we're bringing our attention to the right places and enable us to get a deeper view and really start to answer our questions.
So in our solar system, what are the possibilities?
We're focusing on four places.
The planet's planet is three holes of the external planet: Titan, Europe and a little ocean.
What about Mars?
Let's go on the evidence.
Well, in the beginning, we thought that we're not too far: full of the users, we've been laughed.
And so, 15 years ago, we started a series of strategies that came out in the goal to find other kids in the past that made a biological change.
We were supposed to identify it.
And indeed, and the local.
The images in Brazil are much higher than I've come to the cell and the rainforest that were there in the past.
In fact, New York Times -- the sensors that's based on hundreds of years -- the power for us that it's going to be in the iPhones, that the water's stressed at the speed.
And not for a short period, but it's probably, over a few million years.
And if all of us are there, including the energy material, it might be that life really started.
The New York Times also opened up in the quality of the human beings and discovered another material.
And we were very excited when we saw it.
Because it wasn't the red red red, it was a famous material, from a person.
We've put it into the humanity, we'll put it up, and we'll feel what?
We've done organic materials -- carbon, carbon, oxygen, diplomacy, galaxies -- each one of them.
So you see, in the past, with a lot of water, you might be able to, for a long time, you're able to make life, you're able to enable this concept, you'll allow the growth.
Would life exist now?
We don't know.
But a few years ago, we started to watch a number of letters.
In a month of the summer, there's now been so much more effective about these devices.
The more we've been exposed, we've seen more and more dead, and more than we've gone.
Today, there's more moral than that.
A few months ago, the organization became reality.
We've made the world that we know what these patterns are.
It's a great place.
In this month, these letters are fitting water.
It's a place that's caused in these devices.
So what do we do now -- when we see the water?
Well, it's a force that we've been able to pay for people to have all the components of life.
And in the past, it might be possible that in the third third of my extinction was the ocean.
Now there's a place that's caused.
It's a place that's available on the surface.
There's energy materials.
There's all the conditions that come from.
So what is our next step?
There's a series of use in the police to look for life on Mars.
And now it's more exciting than ever.
As we're going to go on the sun system, we're going to be born in the Italian street.
He didn't find inside what we're going to call "light again," the region around the sun.
It's much more sophisticated.
It's supposed to look like a Sylan Clinota in the street.
But what did we find?
The market and Asian Asissia happened in the region since 2006, and after a couple of years, in a way back, it's based on the ocean to try all of us.
It's used to be a couple of days that you're very trying to go into the solar system and get back to the street.
This is a great environment.
Just a couple of months ago, I went into an asteroid into the water, and a state of a trial.
Where's the Chinese come from?
It's probably the ocean.
Social forces that are created by a cell, you put this ice, you put the moon and you create the ocean.
The same thing happens to the idea.
The only word that we found here on Earth, as a geology.
It's the New York Times.
And the New York Times in the AIDS and started in 1977.
We're not graphic.
And now there's thousands of facts like this in the ocean.
What did we find?
When we're a graphic, we've built the green bubbles, it turns out that they're acting life, whether the water's exposed or climate -- no matter.
So the radical answers are a place where the kids live here on Earth.
So what about Olympics?
We believe that because there's this planet and they're there for a long time, and we believe that there's been by the radical fact, in additional materials, it's a place where we can make life life.
And it's not just microbial life -- maybe some complex life because they have time to open.
And another street, a very, very, very, is Europe.
The global innovation doesn't happen in the system as a planet in 1996, and in the many ways of Europe.
In Europe, as we know, there's a ocean that's going to be reduced underneath the ice.
The Google didn't get it, but we've never seen false.
But not free.
The telescope, a couple of years ago in Europe, the security of insects and insects out of the walls of the moon, just like in the ocean.
These holes, they don't find inside what we're going to call "light again," or there in the system, there are dinosaurs.
And if there's energy materials, there's a life there.
It's a very exciting discipline that these holes are in this environment for millions of years.
The life on Earth started, for our future, after 500 million years, and look where we are today.
These holes are a great street.
The other ice that's in the window is Titan.
Titan is an idea of a cell.
It may be much bigger than the planet.
We have an atmosphere.
That's in the city of a little bit of a metaphor and an apartment -- that you need to study it.
And on the surface of the Asian Asia, I'll find a liquid.
We see the water...
In fact, almost the size of our black day in some of the places.
This region we're not entrepreneurs, it's a metaphor.
If there's a place where the sun system, that life in our markets, a place where we started to place is a different engineer -- and that can be from Titan -- it's maybe Titan.
So, is there life outside the Earth in the solar system?
We don't know yet, but we're in the hot.
The data we're getting very excited and they're able to find us -- represents us to think about it in a very exciting ways.
I believe we're in the right space.
In the 10 years, I've been working on this question.
And if you know about it, and the answer will be positive, then there's life everywhere in the solar system.
Just think about it.
We may not be alone.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We're bringing our natural nature.
Now, when I say that, I don't mean that we're trying the nature that they want to be happy, even though the forest is the case.
Why I mean is that we've started to define nature in a way that it's so hard and so hard that the bottom of the definition we've created, not the rest of our children when they're adults.
But there's a solution to that.
So let me explain.
Right now, human beings use half of the world to live, to grow their trees and their trees, to provide a surprise to their lives.
If you train all human beings, we're going to have 10 times more than all the privacy and our lives.
We're going to write roads through the forest.
We've collected a plastic part of the oceans.
We've changed the chemistry of the land with the artificial senses.
And of course, we changed the chemistry of the air.
So when you take your next task, you'll ask 42 percent more CO2 than you'd be put in 1950.
So all of these changes, and many other people, I've come to a lot of access under the "The Internet". "
And that's a sense that some geologists offer that we need to give to the current idea, in the relationship to some of the human impact on it.
Now, it's still a average idea but I think it's a great way to think about the impact of human beings on the planet.
So where is it there the nature?
What's the nature of nature in the world when everything is affected by human beings?
So 25 years ago, the Syrian Francisco Foundation said that, because of the nature of the person was separated from the person and because the climate change of the Earth has changed by the person, the nature of nature.
In fact, it's called "The end of nature."
I don't agree with that. I just don't agree with that.
I don't agree with nature's definition, because, in Chinese, we live.
Right? Like, we've developed this platform in the context of the rest of the life that you're taking the platform, and with all of the plants and with all the rest of the microbes.
And so I think nature is not that it doesn't touch by human beings, a man or a woman.
I think that nature is everywhere life makes sense, everywhere there's some unique identity, everywhere there's blue and blue and full of life with big life.
And under this definition, things look a little different.
Now, I understand that there are some parts of this nature that talk to us in a special way.
Social places like Walston, the big boundaries, the big human barriers or the Street.
In places that we think of as a kind of nature's idea before we've seen everything.
And in a way, they're less affected by our beautiful activity.
These places don't have roads or a little bit of roads, so on, like these.
But ultimately, even these clouds are affected by human beings.
Now, let's take the North America, for example, because it's the region we meet.
So between about 6,000 years ago when people just came here, they started a process of interaction with nature that led to the power of big animals, from the students to the city of the nation, a luck that was released, all of these very responsible animals that were already unfortunate.
And when these animals were stressed, you know, the ecosystems didn't work.
Egyptian effects that we're going to see forests, we've changed the road from one tree to a year.
So even in these kind of eye, even in these areas that look perfect that we're going to know is going to go through people, we're actually looking at the face of a human effect.
It's not just about history, it's also the history of history, or the children's population for a moment where the first two weeks came.
And that's the same thing about the last year.
People are just involved in nature in a very effective way and over a long time.
Now, just recently, someone said to me, "Oh, but there's still privacy."
And I said, "Where? Where do I want to go."
And he said, "In Amazon."
And I said, "Oh, the Amazon, I was there.
It was air. And the first of January January Guinea who sent me to the National Francisco, which is in the Amazon Amazon, but it's a huge forest, not a road, it's about women, it's about French French Friday, one of the biggest parks in the world.
And when I got there with my mom, what I found, people.
People live there for hundreds of thousands of years.
People live there, and they don't just watch the jungle.
They have a meaningful relationship with the wind.
They're right. They're big.
They understand differences.
They're using natural resources to build their homes, to help their home.
They're even become living in life like this that we're thinking about privacy.
These people there are interactions with the environment in a meaningful way that you can see in the environment.
Now, I've been with this biologist, and he said to me, when we've been watching the river, he said, "There's no Congress in the Amazon."
It's really surprising me, because what it means is that all the Amazon is like this.
There are people everywhere.
And many tropical cities are the same thing, and not just the tropical forest.
People have affected ecosystems in the past, and they're really going to affect them in India, even in places that are harder to understand.
So, if all of the definitions of nature where we want to use a service that it wasn't affected by human beings or that they don't have people, if they all give us a result that we don't have nature, so maybe these are genes.
Maybe we need to define it by the presence of a number of species, by the presence of life that's limited.
Now, if we do that in this way, what will we get?
Well, it's this wonderful.
Finally, there's a nature around us.
Finally, we see the legs and letters from this plant, and we understand that it was, and in this graph in Chicago.
And you'll see this device.
I mean, here's, like, probably, moral, kinds of explanations there, you're waiting for every different insects, and it's a space that I'm a space that I'm going to run, for a party space.
It's a kind of natural natural natural nature under the Palo, that we don't even exist.
And there's a little project and interesting.
So this nature, this kind of privacy, the National Foundation of our Arab Central Arab, the Arab Arab Foundation, and it's probably more than the Arab Foundation, because the French of the National Academy is at the beginning of the 21st century.
Again in ways, which is the National Foundation, it's a beautiful example of the monkey that it seems to come from the past.
But they're losing it in Panada.
One of the issues that they have now is the death of the white Iran.
An Iran Blin here is Panada, as a time -- I say it's a long time that's growing in high places -- and I have all the problems right now with disease.
There's a dream that we've been able to have, we've been looking for here.
So to deal with this, the February School that you're going to be able to switch out in February, even in the areas that they're dealing with nature.
And they're even scared and they're going to take a different place in the region as I've seen for the last time I've gone there.
And things from that kind of drugs are going to think.
Fathers don't exist in Canada.
The privilege life is happy in the age of population and some structure.
I've seen a lot of death.
A little bit of a little bit in the neighborhood.
Scientists that don't exist find out out.
Many species are reduced.
And in fact, I looked at, and the National February does all the things that I'd like, as I've seen, there's a chair, and it's just a pain, it's going to go back to the surface.
It's a lot of work to make places look like I didn't touch.
I'd like you to know, and another theory is, these places that we're really like too much, sometimes.
Many of us who's happy to go there, and because we're going to be design in the world's world's world's world's world's world's world's world, often they're going to be more likely to go through time.
What means is that they're the worst places to decide to take your kids into a fear, because you can't do anything.
You can't treat the trees.
You can't make the genes.
You can't do a teacher using water.
You can't take a frog home.
There's so many laws and limitations that from the perspective of a child, it's like, the worst nature has ever been.
We all don't want to laugh through a beautiful space for five hours and then look at the coffee.
It may be what we want to do as adults, but what kids want to do is to focus on one point and just play it, just to just make it, build a home, build something like this.
In addition, these kind of diversity of eye is often living where people live.
They're hard to visit them. They're women to visit.
What they're saying they're just entrepreneurs, and it's a real problem.
The natural organization that's done in a young age of young children, and they asked them, how long do you spend outside?
And there's only two of you out of five times outside at least a week.
The rest of three out of five just left in the face.
And when we asked them why, what are the symbols out, the response of 61 percent was, "There's no natural areas to my home."
And it's just wrong. It's just not true.
I mean, 71 percent of the people in the United States live in 10 and 10 minutes of our city.
And I'm sure that numbers are in other countries.
And it's not even able to eat your back genes, the asteroids, the rainforest.
They all live to nature.
All of us take nature.
Because what's just because we've forgotten how to see it.
We've spent too much time to watch our poor movies and the nature of the natural natural nature -- and we just forget how to see the nature that's actually outside the door, the nature of the street.
So here's an example: Philip.
There's a very cool word that you can see what's going on, which is difficult.
Now, it might sound like the beginning of the Clinton's story, and it's very similar, but they still haven't developed it to the park, even though they're working on it.
So right now, it's still an axis of a philosophy, and if you know where the room in the chair that you've seen, you can come up with and you can find that one of the privacy just over the city of Philippina.
Each of these plants will grow out of a road that represents itself there.
It's a self-intuitive nature.
And it's exactly the center of the city.
And they've sent people up to do a biologist, and there's over 50 species out there.
And these are not just plants.
It's a ecosystems, a great ecosystem system.
It's made out of the ground, it's a carbon.
The father's in the middle.
I mean, it's really a ecosystem system.
So scientists started read to these ecosystems like "new ecosystems" because most of them are control by local species, and because they're really strange.
They're not going to talk that we've seen before.
For a long time, we've looked at all these new ecosystems when you're wrong.
We're talking about agriculture that we've discovered, treated trees that don '
And of course, less I'm more than all of this is, that new ecosystems are the horrible, where there's a species that go.
In this forest here, there's a fabulous light, and there's a road that's been released in the East Asia.
You can create a new ecosystem system from your own.
It's pretty simple.
You're just trying to use the device.
So the ocean was a biologist, and it does this experiment itself.
It's just been reduced to my subject, and after a few years, he brought a couple of students, and they did a biologist in his biology, and they found 35 species of plants, including two species in the blue chain.
So when you're there on the top of the future of polio, you're facing this nature, you're facing this diversity, this effect, you can look at the side and you can see games for local school, and this is what it looks like.
These kids have, it's -- you know, under my definition, there's a lot of the Earth that's thought as natural, but it's one of the places that we didn't think of nature.
There's nothing here from human beings, other plants, women with other animals.
And what I really wanted to do was, like, thrown out on the side and bring all the kids on the top of me to one of the response.
In some way, I feel like these are the choices that are standing in our face.
If we're looking at this new nature as not as an intuitive or not good or good, we can put on them.
And in the world where everything is changing. We need to be very careful about how we define nature.
Because we don't respond to our kids, we need to do two things.
First, we can't define nature as something that doesn't touch.
There was no sense of this as well.
The nature wasn't about thousands of years.
And it's not all of the nature of nature that most people can visit biofuels with it, including nature that children can't know.
What brings me to the other thing that we have to do, is we have to give children to a nature, because what we don't care about.
Thank you. We're standing in a few different changes around challenges and challenges in the Earth.
Two climate change is one of them.
There's another: We're building biology is the favorite one to get in the middle of the night.
But to solve them. We need people -- smart, people -- I care about nature.
And the only way that we've discovered a generation of people who care about nature is by making them think of nature.
I've got a great theory about analogy.
Each ecologist I know, every biologist I know, all of the five minds that I know, in products when they were kids.
If we have a paper that doesn't know how to build a product, we'll have a paper that doesn't know how to care about nature.
And I don't want to be that you're going to tell that this kid, that in my brain plan and I'm going to take a polio to take them to the main, I don't want to be a book that's going to tell me that it's a party that's going to use someone who is going to go
I think I'm interested to learn from this voice that doesn't matter where this plant comes, it's beautiful, and it's going to get tough about it and we're going to get it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
There's a fact that I like to see where it's, one of the things that you've always wanted to succeed as an asteroid as a species of our bodies -- our skin's hair's hair, our skin's hair's wearing with the blog, allows us to take our body
And now we've developed this point that we can't survive without genes.
And it's more than a tool.
Everything we choose to put is the robot, a story about where we were, what we do, who we want to be.
I was a kid.
I didn't have a voice to find friends to play them, and eventually I invented a lot of the games of myself.
I invented a lot of my toys.
It started with Google.
Here's the end of Amazon in the city of Syria, and they've got a galaxy behind the corruption of democracy, at the age of 18 tricks.
And somebody said to me -- I was six years old -- someone told me that when they're captured with these genes, they're spending them behind, and if you ask them one.
I took a couple of weeks to explore the courage, but I came back with him, and they gave me.
They gave me one child -- I went back home with democracy.
And I tried to think what I can do with the intuitive material -- the metaphor, from the control.
I started to make it in my head and I realized, "Shanging -- my head can go into this thing."
But yes, I've been looking for a room, which I've been looking at as a car and I've made myself a space.
And I had to have a place to ask the space, so I found a printer from a few streets from the house.
And I got it home, and in the moon of the wind room, I turned it into a space.
I started with a political control of democracy.
I went back to a restaurant, and I sold under my way to make it.
I've put a screen on the top, which I've been waiting for the last generation -- and where I thought I'm really smart -- without a list, I've come to the back of the region that's in the black hole, which I've spent with the walls of the size of the size that I've found
A few years later, the movie "Good". "
I was too young to see this, but I've been in my life's lives, like each other in America at the same time.
Here's a nurse in three she'd have a third community of a platform in a window, and my mom probably heard about it with somebody who thought that I'd been thinking about this conversation, because some days before the Elin, he would have a completely different thing to have that sense of "meaning."
Now, I'm recognizing this as a group of people are starting with children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's age, let's show you an invisible example of children &apos
And that's the "Man" that's my mother's been born.
So these are the faces of a meeting in New York City and a child with the asteroid of a plan.
And I loved it.
A few years later, my dad took me to a film called "I'm trying to talk."
In fact, I convinced him to take me two times, and there's no simple thing, because it's a hard movie, it's called adults.
But it wasn't the same day and the creatures that made me see it again.
They helped -- []]] --] It was the song.
The song in "I'm trying to speak" was amazing for me.
It's a more meaningful meaningful in Bertian, like a mirror.
More than that, the heroes in "I'm trying to speak" to hate their satellites everywhere.
All the time -- they put it back to the West, they put it into a bed.
And I was like, "They read my computer?
I want to ask that survival all the time! "
And so I went back to my favorite material on the magazine that went into a form, a global Darwin, and I was able to design a concept, perfect with the Gullan Guinsin.
Now after I mentioned it, here's a picture of the song I've made.
I mean, it's just the first trick I've called "OK."
A few years later, I convinced my father to prepare to be part of a terrible solution.
About another month, he's been working with me from a democracy called Palestinian President, one of the favorite materials that we're missing.
It's in general, through the month, we've been built in a way that's part of the connection of these species with complex teachers.
And we're going to live in a basis because we can women, and we've been trying to get it to school.
Now, it's one thing in this conversation that we don't have my slides for you, because we don't exist this song.
I asked him to school, here's the sound of a book that I've been looking at in Syria, but he didn't find it, a reasonable reason that's going to get in the morning.
There were things that I didn't expect to ask about the web of San Francisco may be able to build school.
In the third hour of math, I've been standing in the classroom, and I'm standing in the classroom because the song can't sit.
And that's the first thing I didn't expect.
And then my teacher looked at me a little bit about the middle of the classroom and says, "Do you feel okay?"
And I think, "Do you need? Do I feel okay?
I'm wearing a solution! I'm doing the wall -- "and I'm just going to tell you how good I feel, when the classroom starts to go to the left and go to the long, and then I'm going to go in the office.
I've gone from a certain kind, because I've learned the device.
And when I came up, I didn't have a bear because I became my classroom, I was like, "Who took the song?
"Okay, you want a lot of years, how many friends don't we forget to do a series of experiment, which is called" The Social Foundation. "
And for 14 years, I learned in work how to build a biology of experiments and how to tell stories about them in TV.
I've also learned a place that you're going to feel able to use a central role in stories.
I'm using the slide to add the original end, hopefully in the speech of the narrative to the story that we tell.
And then we're doing a village called "Claser", "and I'm going to imagine a little bit about the deep consequences for me.
In France, it's successful to a language, "The question that we've tried to answer is: Do you turn into a safe language like the movies make us believe?
So in French, we're supposed to be two key parts.
One was when I was trained to jump out of the buildings by a man who's activated into the air food.
And the second was the Chinese's experiment: Museum's capacity in a beautiful material.
I wanted to separate a project between the two atoms, and I thought, "Well, in the first part we're training, so we need to wear art -- or! Let's say," I'm going to get sick on the road of the art.
It's for the academic. "
But for the second part, I wanted something very excited -- "I know! I'm going to ask like the Twitter Twitter."
I've been a beautiful fabric metaphor, in the road response.
I've found a long event in the ocean.
I've found a summer, which I had to ask to do from thinking.
Today, the experiments came, I went out of my car in the President, and my team looked at me.
And you start to stop their lives.
They're like, "
And I feel two interesting things in this moment.
I feel like this, I feel so clear to my team that I'm very excited to wear the fear.
But we've been reminded in the first time to remind ourselves that in a very high speech, that the long task is going to look amazing behind me.
So five years into a microscope "The Social Foundation," I've been invited to get in San San Guinistan.
And I knew about the Darwin Mondon't have time to go.
It was the audience of the professional professionals -- it was the revolution of innovation.
People Texas from all over the world to show their amazing creatures on the stage in San and Gazi.
I wanted to participate.
I decided that I'm going to write a complexity that you're going to try to switch it, and I'm going to go around San and I'm going to respond to Mexico.
I felt like I'd come up with?
The heart.
It's not me on the web, it's really the heart.
But I've spent months trying to write the attention and the most expensive attention that I could, from the factors and the definition of the engineers and the building between the countries.
I've found a guy who does the head of the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart and put them.
We even had to do when we were born in the rain.
I've spent this around Mexico and I can't even tell you how hot it was within the fear.
I had to remember this.
I'm going to get kids and do a letter to me in the eyes, but every day it doesn't matter because I'm a very understanding.
I didn't reduce the process of making you all around, but also the company of the other stupid society.
It doesn't look at the freedom of building, it's called "Solly."
Now as a teacher, the word 'word' word "and" and "and" is people who're looking for the real places on them from the movies or TV, but it's much more than that.
They don't just see people who're looking for two days -- they're fighting them.
They make them want.
They change them to be the places that they want to be in this revolution.
They're very sophisticated.
They're going to give their solutions to the coffee and it's beautiful.
But more than that, they're doing back with their regulations.
In Mexico or in any other direction, you're not just going to find images of people I've gone around.
You're going to say, "Hey, I love your sense, I can take you?"
And then you give them a time to go into this.
They've been working hard on their face because they're going to see great for your camera.
And it's so beautiful to see.
And I take it to the heart.
Right after that, I'm learning the new process of the Neanderthal as Jerry's "The Ford" Love "."
I'm learning how to be the nature of nature, "natural connection," and I'm actually afraid of a few children.
I'm learning the "Robert" -- we're the first laugh that we're doing.
And then I'm looking at like the Field School.
If you don't know "The President" and my mother, my mom and my mother, first of all, you're invited.
It's a beautiful form, and one of the favorite films on all the times.
It's a young girl called "January who's going to write in the world's hot world in February who's made of Pacific."
And he's finding the way out with the help of a few friends that he's proud -- and Darwin who's sitting on the ocean called "French."
It's unprecedented and it wants to do friends, and it's thinking the way to do it is we need to solve them and offer them from our hands.
But it doesn't work so well, so it's coming out of a journey with a skin and it's just going to find it, replace it.
So I went through a slide of roads, and I asked her to the stage of Mexico.
And I'd like this to happen on the animal's customers.
I decided I didn't talk about this infrastructure at all.
When people were listening to me, I'm going to go and they're going to be going to exist in two years.
They're going to find the picture and then I'm going to get out of my galaxy behind the galaxy of a gold gas.
And at the end of the photograph, we're going to get it for them.
Oh, Oh! -- I loved it.
And people did.
"Oh my God! Oh my God, it's so cool!
And I feel that I'm going to go on the street and it's great.
And after about 15 minutes, something happened.
Somebody would stop my hand, and then there's a flight back inside.
And I think they might be born as a device back, but not, it's one of the natural ones I gave.
And I don't understand why.
And I'm going to go, I'm going to find some images.
And then it happens again.
See, I can't see anything inside this feeling.
I can see through the revolution -- I can see on people's shoes.
I can hear what they say and I can see their legs.
But for the third time somebody return to me in nature, I want to understand what happens.
So I'm looking at the head of the back to get a better opportunity, and I see someone who's going to do something like this.
And then it's great: it's lucky to get the same gas.
In the movie "The French Street," luck comes to the left of the gold gas.
It's not a beautiful relationship.
We're, we're all on the road, we're looking at ourselves for a robot that says something for us.
And we're doing it for our own.
We connect something that's important to us in the face.
And the features are how we find ourselves one another.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What would you do if you had to understand the information that's behind 1,1.5 million plants, love us to find the diversity?
It was the challenge of a human group last year.
A man on a man who was called "Alexander" was able to invest in 40 seconds of the Mexico "Mexico" Mexico. "
Scientists, one of the components around the world, which is at the bottom of the CEO's disease, for example, I love the British community, for some of the money we like Chinese.
"Alexander" has been able to know all these electronics of the same company, all of the customers, "for 1977," and "until today.
All of these are coming out of the biggest metabolism of information in the system that someone has ever seen.
But it's also the design that's also the design of a city in the face of the price.
Think about this: 1,1.5 million documents, which are able to be more than 200 countries.
Where's you start in such a tree?
How do you start to make a story that might lead to every corner in the world, and it's almost about every person that will be surprised, sometimes, in ways that we don't know.
"Mali" explaining the information to two journalists from the German Center "Scott."
He said that my data is, and I'm sorry, he's like, "The Hope's House's House's House's School."
But there's one use that I can't find in a huge amount of information like this.
And so the "Sydney" Tony "" is "Time" to my organization, "we're the international studies."
I've decided to do the worst opposite of all of our minds to do, as a journalist: share.
I mean, the studies are fabric in the universe.
We're defined in our room, and we're just on our experiences, sometimes, even because of our ways, we're obviously clear to us that once we have what we have, they want the story too.
And in program, when you have a good story, you like to keep yourself the community.
But there's not enough we live in a small world, and in the United States, the country is going to respond to it.
The issues about them we're saving are more and more three-dimensional.
We're going to say we're working in the global device.
Other things around health and health are global.
And so it's also the money and the financial crisis.
And so it seems amazing that the problems are going to happen so much to a global story.
And also the data was so intuitive to identify the possibilities that the technology offers, instead of being on their own.
The reason why journalists are sensitive of technology is this: the biggest institutions of professional professional professionals in time because of the change in ways that people need new ways.
The molecules of the privacy that I've been able to capture the baby's baby's experiences.
