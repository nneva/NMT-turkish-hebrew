Erdogan Approves New Political Approves in Turkey
The government, led by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is pushing for the removal of the current parliament's presidency with Turkey, as it is unnecessary and model.

Justice Minister Cemil Cicek said Turkey should be able to hand over its presidency to capture long-term stability. [AFP]
Following the EU's progress report on Turkey last year, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government has made a long-awaited debate over the country's political structure, urging the current parliament to take over the country's political structure.
Justice Minister Cemil Cicek told lawmakers last month that an amendment would bring stability to Turkey, and that it would ensure that EU integration targets would be met.
According to Erdogan and other managers of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), the current 75 annual system is unnecessary and bureaucratic mechanism.
Fikir is not new.
In 1989, he rejected the agenda during Tourism's presidential presidency, but Turkey was not ready to be ready to become a US agricultural system.
The new proposal, some AKP lawmakers say, should strengthen Turkey's judicial system with the priority.
According to them, a rotating coalition that will be made without these reforms will be made very power and will harm democracy because it will be able to open a quarter and open a quarter.
The main opposition Republika Srpska People's Party (CHP) has criticised the plan for the possible efforts to ensure Turkish politics.
Meanwhile, head of the Association of Turkish Industry and Community, Omer Smer, said the presidency's presidency is not in line with the country, calling on the government to strengthen the current parliament.
As the beginning of the consensus system could be removed, President Ahmet Necdet Sezer's mandate could end in April 2007.
If no system is in time, Erdogan may be able to become an easy candidate from Sezer.
Turkey, meanwhile, is also assessed that the electoral threshold of the election image to increase the number of minorities represented by 10 per cent to 5 per cent.
Many parties were survived in the November 2002 elections.
The AKP won a number of parties who have 35 per cent of the vote and remained in the 10 per cent threshold.
The government has acknowledged the need for better representation so far.
"If the parliament will continue to continue the system, it should be protected," Cicek said.
"The representation of political parties that are not in parliament can be a platform for the representation of the parliament," he said, arguing that a lower peace would create a lower section in parliament and will jeopardise stability.
Analysts say that at least nine parties would allow the polls and allow the coalition and bloggers to the bloc.

After more than a year after the cabinet, parliament approved the swimming of Vojvodina on Monday (November 30th).
The delay was disappointed by both the ruling coalition and from opposition members of both the ruling coalition and the removal of opposition members.

EU interior ministers agreed at a meeting in Brussels on Monday (November 30th) that citizens of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia will be able to travel visa-free travel to most of Europe.
EU officials, who assured the decision, said it was an important step in the three countries' European integration process.
"Today's decision reflects Europe's clear signal of the Western Balkans and is a result of a concrete effort to meet the requirements for the visa liberalisation of countries," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Monday.
European Commission (EC) Vice-President Jacques Barrot said the 27-nation bloc "will boost the movement of Macedonian, Montenegrin and Serb citizens, and" will boost relations between these countries and co-operation ".
Sweden's Good and Social Policy Policy Minister, who headed the rotating EU presidency, described it as a "historic decision".
He also noted that Macedonian, Montenegrin, Montenegrin and Serb citizens who want to celebrate with friends in the Schengen area can now be visa-free.
This is the only biometric passport that all the 28 countries in the Schengen region -- Iceland, Norway and Ireland -- which needs to travel to each other.
However, the visitors must not go to 90 days within a six-month period, while the revenue needs to be visa-free.
To work on a long visit, those who want to work on visa or work must take place.
On Monday's decision is not imposed to the Serbian biometric passport, because the summit has not yet been recognised by all EU countries, but not yet been recognised by all EU countries and the EC's visa dialogue launched last year.
"This is a bridge and clear step towards European integration," Serbian President Boris Tadic said at a joint press conference with Barrot and Rehn in Brussels. "It is not part of the EU accession talks, but not a part of the visa liberalisation talks without visa liberalisation."
Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, who is in an interview with Skopje's efforts to fulfil the requirements for visa liberalisation, said his country is a "obvious reason to celebrate" and would "become a Macedonian history".

One of the main symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic of Cyprus is seeing until the end of this year, when the Turkish Cypriots started to start a barrier in the divided town of Nicosia on Thursday (November 24th).
The barrier in Ledra Street was in 40 years.

Although the majority of Turkish Cypriots voted in the deal, only the international recognition of the Mediterranean island joined the EU in May last year.
For more than a decade, the talks between the two communities are very restrictive.
In 2003, however, Turkish Cypriots allow the Turkish Cypriots to open four border crossings, allowing thousands of people to enter a day.
The latest move is expected to boost local trade with the possibility of opening new salaries and logistics after decades, more than ten years ago.
Both sides are urging their business community to open the traditions to use their own authorities.
"The plan is ready to provide economic benefits in both sides in this city," he said. "
"This is a time when a very optimistic optimism optimism is a very optimistic optimism," a local diplomat told Reuters on the move.
Greek Cypriots welcomed the surprise move, saying they would do the same.
"If they don't open their parties, this is a good approach," said Greek Cypriot Mayor Mikalakis Zampelas, who is in Nicosia.
"We are waiting from the UN, which is a number of concerns about the security issue," Zampelas said.
However, he stressed, "it is ready" to open them "if Turkish Cypriots open the street.
In a separate development, the Turkish Cypriot government adopted a law Tuesday to speed up a law aimed at resolving property issues with the Greek Cypriots.
If the parliament's parliament passed, the law will be able to demand the Greek Cypriots not only be used, but not only used or financed, or not only used or financed, if it is threatening to be threatened in the past 30 years.

Local markets have made their market conditions in the EU, but many local companies have to ensure that new competitiveness environment.
Romania's economic performance in 2006 is risk.
However, the general situation is possible to say that the situation is linked to some issues.
These are among the issues that have to ensure that the local economy is changing.
In 2005, the industrial production was lower than a year ago.

This year's damage showed a very serious reduction of 12 per cent compared to 2004.
However, if the production winners in 2005 are the lowest, the optimism is to wait.
In 2005, trade deficit continues to rise, while the current account deficit could be up to 9 per cent of GDP.
Do you think that GDP and industrial production rates must be able to reflect a question: how foreign external supervised
In fact, there are many areas that must be reflected in the external increase.
I have confirmed that I am low this year's production winners, so that I have been able to stay in a step forward about the main competitiveness problems.

Kosovo's Democratic Union (LDK) has been changing since the government, and the party lives in the interest.
Before the seven elections were held in the country, the party will elect its own president.
Pristina Mayor Ivan Mustafa, who is not yet to enter the party's general race, but has yet to support support.
In an exclusive interview with SETimes correspondent Linda Karadaku, Mustafa assesses the situation of possible candidates and the LDK.
SETimes: Do you think that the LDK will be nominated
Isa Mustafa: I think that the LDK's presidential candidates will be good for a compromise.
Tabibii will be able to leave the removal of the LDK leader, to leave the removal of Sejdiu's interests and the LDK leader.
I do not hold any talks with the signals to support the candidates and to want Sejdiu's resignation.
I don't have a connection with support in the vote.
SETimes: What is your opinion about the LDK's ruling coalition
Mustafa: I think it is not true.
For the most time, the PDK has been returned to several major workers who have been transferred to dissolve the coalition, or EULEX's intervention.
I don't know that the coalition was discovered after the election date.
I don't be part of this decision.
I don't know.
No statement was made, even from participants.
SETimes: Do you think the coalition between the LDK and the PDK
Mustafa: Hadzic was operating.
The first phase of independence was in the competition of Kosovo's symbols, but was not functioning.
SETimes: What is your opinion about the national elections
How should you be done
Mustafa: I would propose that I would be held in Ben on 13 February.
I think that this can be resolved between the government and the opposition.
In interim, some laws -- the budget law, privatisation of PTK privatisation, the election law and some laws from the Ahtisaari package -- should be reached.
I think the agreement could be reached.
SETimes: Do you expect the establishment of a Kosovo government
Mustafa: We will have a full stable government that will have a short-term mandate with the early elections.
SETimes: How do you have a candidate for the party, and what is the parties changed
Mustafa: I think that the LDK should be more open with the new traditions, young people, as well as the new attitude of the party.
The new initiatives and ideas should be more open -- to the LDK -- that the owners of experience should be removed.
This should provide enough personnel and information care for the party to make Kosovo different.
It is not a new panel for this government, but in terms of implementation of the rule of law, fighting corruption and poverty and unemployment.

A EU delegation headed by foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton met on Tuesday (July 13th) in Istanbul with top Turkish officials, as well as talks on a series of regional and international issues.

Ashton, who served as EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele, met with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and Ankara's chief negotiator with the Union.
The talks were part of a new political dialogue process, which envisions the two sides' meetings for two years.
"We should be a very clear policy on our commitment," Fuele said at a press conference after the talks. "We have a very clear mandate from our countries.
We will facilitate ways to speed up the integration process. "
Turkey began its accession talks with the Union in October 2005, but the process is widely on the slow pace of reforms and the country's ports and airports to open its ports and airports to the EU member Cyprus.

After their talks Tuesday, Fuele and Ashton voiced support for Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government's amendments to the constitutional amendment package, which will submit a national referendum on 12 September.
According to EU officials, the changes are dealing with the conditions of the bloc's membership bid and are a step towards the country's bid.
In addition, Ashton welcomed Ankara's role in regional and international issues, describing Turkey as a "important partner" for the 27-nation bloc, especially in foreign policy.
"Gul and friendly are signs of the relationship between Turkey and the EU," he said, noting that both are sharing peace and prosperity targets.
Davutoglu said his country wants to expand co-operation with the bloc on key developments that could affect both sides.
"We share a broad geography of so far from Afghanistan to the Mediterranean," the AFP quoted the minister as saying. "Turkey's policy is very important to implement its co-operation with the EU."
Another issue was discussed on Tuesday, both the EU and the United States's Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in the past period.
Earlier talks, he said his country would like to want the Union's support for the divided group.
Davutoglu said on Tuesday that the PKK is a serious threat to the EU not only to the country.
Ashton acknowledged that a joint effort in the fight against terrorism organisations.
"We should have to establish the EU's worst of organisations that use the money and financing education activities," he said.

The final declaration on the issue will be released next week, according to diplomatic sources, only the EU's commitment to decisions on the issue of the EU's commitment to decisions on the issue.
At a meeting in Brussels, leaders of the 25 member states met with French and Netherlands to hold a "nothing" in the referendum on the EU constitution.

However, the public concerns about the Union's faster expansion was made among the factors that caused the outcome.
The enlargement summit was held in the interim agenda of the Brussels summit.
However, EU foreign ministers, who fear that the expansion of the expansion among some member states, agreed on Monday that the debate in Luxembourg should be avoided.
Because of the deployment of the issue, the ministers have decided to be seen as a negative sign by both potential member states and financial markets.
"The Council of Europe has repeatedly reiterated the results of expanding the expansion of the enlargement on December 17th and reflecting the need for the implementation of them," Reuters quoted the bill as saying.
EU leaders agreed on October 3rd the date for Turkey's accession talks, saying it was to meet its economic and political reform commitments, as well as the condition of a protocol that would be completed by ten new member states, including Cyprus.
EU foreign ministers approved the protocol service at Monday's meeting, saying it was sent to Ankara to the document.
Now, Turkey has already signed the document within a few weeks, and is expected to meet all conditions that Brussels has made its accession talks.

On Monday, EU ministers pledged to rebuild the issue of Croatia's accession talks at a meeting on 18 July.
He also urged Zagreb to boost efforts to implement the action plan to resolve the issue of fugitive war crimes indictee Ante Gotovina.
Luxembourg's Foreign Minister Jean Assellbourg, who currently holds the rotating EU presidency, told reporters that Croatia has made "progress in full co-operation".
Bulgaria and Romania are viewed as the most interested candidate countries that are the latest "life" to the EU constitution.
The two countries signed the accession agreements in April are scheduled to join the Union on 1 January 2007.
In recent days, however, members have been calling for delayed.
In an interview published in the German daily Benita Ferrero-Wandner on Sunday, EU Foreign Minister Benita Ferrero-Wandner said the enlargement process should be slow.
"We should not recognise our citizens to get a time to get," the commissioner said. "We should do everything we have to do everything, but I think that we have to lower the acceleration."
However, European Commission Vice-President Gunter Verheugen told the German daily Suldeutsche Zeitung that Bulgaria and Romania are among the priorities of the Union.
Verheugen, the EU's enlargement commission until last year, stressed that the process should continue despite the results of the referendum, adding that stability in Southeast Europe is stable.

The Adriatic Group's decision to boost regional security co-operation and to boost members' NATO membership before the Alliance's summit next month.
The Adriatic Group -- Albania, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- signed a declaration that it wants to continue its "open closure" policy on NATO's accession meeting in Chicago last month.
"NATO is the best advantage of regional security.
Regional countries in the region are working together because they are not disappointed, and not disappointed of their homes, "he said.
Pande Lazarevski, an analyst at Appavel Shatev Institute, told SETimes that the declaration showed that countries in the region are ready to join the Alliance, but also as a regional group.
"The preparation for joining the defence system and the preparation of the future growth is an important step forward in the accession process," Lazarevski said.
He said that NATO members Croatia and Albania are equally important to ensure sustainable support for Macedonia, Montenegro and BiH.
"Croatia and Albania have seen a more widespread phase, but still in the Adriatic Group," he added.
Standing and security analyst Petar Sherbina told SETimes the conference in Skopje is also aimed at preparing for Kosovo and BiH's NATO candidacy.
That, he said, was not participating in Serbia's meeting.
"The US Secretary of State has announced that Kosovo should be a candidate for NATO membership.
This plan should be implemented soon.
Agim Ceku arrived in Skopje with the Kosovo Defence Minister, "he said.
"The candidacy of BiH will be a problem because of the status of Republika Srpska," he said.
At the conference, Ceku said "Kosovo is ready to help the construction of regional security and stability and stability," the time is time "and voiced confidence that Serbia does not join the meeting.
As Greece's obstacles to block Macedonia's NATO membership, the group urged the Alliance to ask Macedonia as part of the declaration to join the country as soon as possible.

"Macedonia welcomes all membership criteria and NATO countries that the ICJ's decision on Greece's decision to block Macedonia's membership by blocking Macedonia's membership," Ivanov said.
He said he hoped that Greece will compete responsibility for the 1995 interim agreement with Macedonia.
"This is the most prosperous solution.
Macedonia's interim referendum could be a member of international organisations, "the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia", the interim agreement says.
Greece agreed to accept this decision, "he said.
The group also said that steps must be taken to implement a multiethnic airport.
The group also called for joint regional projects, such as the establishment of all education centres and improving co-operation in natural disaster.
"This is a clear commitment to apply NATO's ability to use the current regional defence capabilities, which will reduce regional security risks," Dear Mirchev told SETimes.
Macedonia's former Foreign Minister Srdjan Kerim said that the next step must be established to establish a similar regional consortium in the North Council in North to develop energy, infrastructure, food and environmental projects.
This model could be implemented if some Balkan countries are seeking to move forward and participate in different projects.

The two main political groups will face against parties -- the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), the Croatian Social Democratic Union (SDP), the Croatian People's Party (HNS), Istria Democratic Party (IDS), Istria Democratic Party (IDS) and the Croatian Protection Party (HSD) -- on Sunday (4 December).
According to the latest public polls, Kukuriku has a key obstacle against the HDZ.
Croatia's State Election Commission (DIP) spokesperson Hrvoje Sadzic told SETimes that the Commission has made its report on the campaign financing financing and will prepare a report on any attitude.
"During the election campaign, the data showed that the previous parliamentary elections in 2007 was a decline in the previous parliamentary elections.
This parliamentary elections have been implemented on the financing of the law on the financing of political activities and the financing of election campaign, "Sadzic said, adding that more than 4,000 registered observers would be monitored.
Forces and experts have described the campaign as the same, saying the party plans and programmes are largely in the last campaign.
Boris Pavelic, a journalist from the Zagreb central Novi List, told SETimes that the HDZ's election campaign is impossible.
"The HDZ seems to submit nothing after all scandals from the beginning.
But the Kukuriku coalition has a major advantage because [of] specific issues such as scandals, such as [scandals]. "
The HDZ highlighted more national identity, while coalition leaders are trying to push tensions and workers, he pointed out.
Zdravko Petek, a professor of political scientists at the Zagreb central political scientists, described the campaign as "mistakes", and said the parties do nothing to encourage the votes.
"I can't say that in the past years, I can say that political parties in Croatia are not in terms of policy, not only for the ideology.
For example, the difference party is closer to the Catholic Church.
Nevertheless, the health system, education and other social problems are more important than the ideology, "he said.
He added that the campaign does not make any new things, and that Croatia will have a different government after the December 4th elections.
Officials from the Kukuriku coalition are awaiting good results if the public is hiding.
"Some people in the government are likely to vote [the] votes], and that could be able to prove that the option of the option of the option of the option of the option of voters," Dusko Kisberberberg, spokesman of the Istrian Democratic Assembly (IDS), told SETimes.
However, the ruling HDZ continues to play a "nationalist representative" in the vote, and polls say the sports would vote.
"I am confident that HDZ has a traditional option in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and I am confident that these elections will be successful.
But because of the number of polling centres, it will be low because of the lower turnout.
However, there will be no problem in Bosnia for HDZ, "he added, adding that about 300,000 Bosnian Croat citizens are expected to vote.
The HDZ seems full disagreements on Croatia's EU integration process, while about 40% oppose EU membership.
Zagreb delegation Stevan Trippovic told SETimes that if the country joins the EU, politicians estimate that they will not be able to speak with the citizens.
"It is not the last way for a test to be unemployed.
Herkes added that students, teachers, unemployment, unemployment. [I think we will feel such feel, "he added.
Zagreb retired retirement Nadic Nadic told SETimes that he would not vote because it is "more spiritual things".
"I am right to use me.
Both government will be the same.
The vote will not be selected, retired pension will not be held.
"I cannot expect this election story, so we can't be able to end our bombings with the explosive ideas and proposals," he said.

Analysts in Kosovo believe that Prime Minister Hashim Thaci's visit to the United States continued to continue its role in the tension of tension with Serbia and to protect Kosovo's EU integration process.
Thaci visited Washington to discuss Kosovo's role in the Balkans.
He met with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday (April 4th) with US Vice President Joe Biden.

Biden reiterated US support for Kosovo's sovereignty and congratulated Touli for the progress made in the dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade.
"The United States supports the dialogue and expects the agreements between Kosovo and Serbia, which will provide beneficial implementation of the agreements that would benefit from the people of both countries," he said.
After talks with Clinton, Thaci said all countries in the region shares a common goal for European integration and NATO membership.
"For this, however, the United States and the EU is not only in Kosovo, but not only in Kosovo, but also in the rest of the Western Balkans," he added.
Kosovo and Serbia have made a compromise that allows Kosovo to represent itself "a representation of Kosovo's status". "This is not a precondition for the position on the status status, and the 1244 UNHR Resolution on Kosovo's independence," he added.
Although the deal was initially defined as a step forward to Serbia's EU candidate status, representatives of both countries have dismissed the disputes over the dispute over how to recognise Kosovo would be recognised.
Serbia has said it will hold the presidential, parliament and local elections on 6 May.
Pristina, meanwhile, has threatened to block the elections within the borders, but to be held.
Ibrahim Ibrahimi, director of the US University in Kosovo, said the United States continues to keep Kosovo's interests on the protection of the territorial integrity of the territorial integrity.
"I think that the northern issue should be resolved by the Kosovo side by helping international friends and ensuring all rights in the northern Republic of Kosovo, which envisions international friends," Ibrahimi told SETimes.
Ramadan Ilazi, a foundation of the foundation of the Movement of Kosovo's "Fool" (Support), says Kosovo politicians are closer to the EU foreign policy, especially with the medical role between Kosovo and Serbia.
"Kosovo has asked the United States to play a role in the latest negotiations.
This visit is aimed at encouraging US support for Kosovo, and to encourage the support of the agreements between Pristina and Belgrade to encourage Thai to continue this process, "he said.
He said that the situation in northern Kosovo is stable and there should be a new transformation agreement, and that "it should be a process that caused the parallel system in the province's parallel municipalities such as Gracanica and Short municipalities".

That means that he faced him as a consumption, such as the creation of the investigations and procedures, the court documentation of the investigations and arrests, the management of the six units, as well as creation of the court documentation, ensuring the protection of six units and witnesses.
First cases have been beginning at least a challenge of challenges -- such as complicated cases -- to ensure that it was to be able to provide an advisory between the proceedings' right to be conducted as possible.
This strengthened in 2003, when the court was adopted by the completion strategy that must accelerate its justice.
The court's mandate is to stop the court's activities that will contribute to peace and stability abroad. In 1999, the tribunal has established the first example of the Social Assistance programme, which was the first example of the court's work of the international judiciary in order to attract peace and stability.
Now one of the biggest challenges is the court's revenue.
To complete the court's mandate, it is crucial to ensure that even after it closes its doors.
SETimes: How are the judges in the ICTY protected their disagreements
Jelacic: It is a judge that is a judge to meet the most active standards.
All judges in the tribunal are very professional and experience.
The judges reflect their decisions, based on evidence offering only in court.
SETimes: How will you choose the best impact on the work of the ICTY's work, or a return point to a return point
Jelacic: It is unlikely to elect a specific case.
All cases have played a key role in order to cover the salaries and make them a step forward and tolerance with them.

NATO welcomed Serbian President Boris Tadic's call on the security situation in Kosovo on Thursday (December 1st) to remove Kosovo Serbs in the north.
"This proposal could contribute to reducing tensions.
KFOR, however, wants to see that the positive proposal is a real effect, "he said.
NATO urged both Kosovo and Serbia to co-operate fully with all international players in order to ensure freedom of movement.
EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said he is in direct representation with Tadic and that the barriers want to influence the barriers to affect violence.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele met in Brussels with Kosovo Integration Minister Vlora Citaku in Brussels, saying Citaku will continue to support Citaku's visa liberalisation, removing Citaku's visa implementation, EU accession programmes and a trade agreement.
"I understand the importance of Kosovo to launch a comprehensive agenda for the north," Fule said.
He encouraged Kosovo to continue constructive relations with Belgrade before a general meeting Monday.
"The progress in the dialogue will be made, both Pristina and Belgrade to facilitate the EU and help them meet their goals on European prospects.
Both sides need to be pragmatic, constructive, constructive and intelligence in the talks, both Kosovo and Serbia. "
Serbia's Ministry of Kosovo Special Secretary for Kosovo Mirver Ivanovic told SETimes that KFOR is trying to create an conflict to ensure that Serbia is scheduled to revise its EU candidacy on 9 December.
"Serbia's future interests in the coming days, but Pristina may need to be needed in July, when Pristina launched an unilateral action aimed at preventing the interior issue," Tadic said.
"We don't have a final goal, but we don't have any question to Yarinje and Brnjak.
Kosovo's special police are protecting ROSH's future, because this means to end all relations with Serbia.
If we leave our own country, it must say that if we have to say us.
"If he offered hundreds of people, the problem has created that 7.5 million people will not attract us because of us is not alternative," he said.
He said Kosovo Serbs need Serbia's support for Serbia because they are not other countries from Serbia.
"This constitution is a constitutional problem and the president must be interested in the president, and it is here to prevent the public and unemployment," the mayor said.
Bogdana Koljevic, editor-in-chief of the political ideas, told SETimes that Serbia's stance is a negative effect of negative and unfair position.
"Everything we see in the past months is changing, and we don't think that Serbia is impossible and what is why we don't have changed, and what is changed.
There is no doubt that everything is about Serbia's EU candidacy with the Serbs in northern Kosovo is not a sign of Serbia's EU candidacy.
"If Serbia is a willingness to meet Kosovo and EU policies, it is clear that it is impossible to allow it."
Koljevic said that there is no pressure on Kosovo Serbs to decide how to decide what they will be done.
He said all talks and agreements were held by chief negotiator Borislav Stefanovic are now harmful to Kosovo Serbs who have to use the Kosovo Serbs, which have to travel to a permanent island with Serbia.
The importance of the paper, Stefanovic, has denied that it is unlikely to agree on a deal to replace Kosovo customs officers from the Brnjak and Brnjak enterprises.
The Serbian government has formed a Mesic and Fierre Agency that will help improve the progress in management and technical issues and agreements.
Aleksandar Jugovic, a member of the Serbian Movement for Integration, told SETimes that Serbs in northern Kosovo accepted the proposals from Serbia and that dialogue is important for them.
"The barriers have to be completed, but the interests of Kosovo Serbs and Serbia's interests.
The Serbs should be removed from the barriers, because it will be a disaster for Serbs in the southern Kosovo and Ibar, if it will use the authority from the KFOR Kumanovo Agreement.
The barriers should be removed, "he said.

In a long time before Serbia's review on EU candidacy, Serbian President Boris Tadic urged Kosovo Serbs and KFOR to prevent tensions and prevent the barriers in late July, protest the barriers' restructuring between Kosovo Serbs and the restructuring of Kosovo Serbs.
On Tuesday (29 November), Tadic urged KFOR to end the barriers to end the barriers, saying that the operation is dangerous, and that citizens do not contribute to the situation in the north of Kosovo.
"The barriers are not helping Serbia's national interests in Kosovo and Metohija to help define the defendants of their national interests.
The fight against Serbs must continue to combat the rights, removing the removal of the population and to ensure and resources, "he said.
During a meeting of EU foreign ministers Thursday, Tadic's call for Tadic's call for EU Foreign Policy and Security Commissioner Catherine Ashton.
"I am very concerned about the violence in the north is very concerned about what we can make progress towards Europe," Ashton said.
However, representatives of Serbs in northern Kosovo have responded to Tadic's call.
Kosovo Mitrovica Mayor Krstimir Pantic told SETimes that Tadic's call for "today" has come under an unprecedented surprise surprise in the barriers and other Serbs in northern Kosovo.
The decision on the removal of the barriers in northern Kosovo should not give their own way, Pantic said.
B92's Mitrovica citizens Milos Z. told SETimes that Tadic has been calling for the removal of the barriers, but now has been calling for the removal.
"We have been on the barriers for a month.
Do you think that if you think we should not be extradited from the barriers
"After the conflict between the Netherlands and KFOR on 27 September?"
Milos believes that this is under pressure from the EU on Serbia's potential membership candidacy, which will decide on December 9th at the EU summit.
"We are not fair to leave us in our circumstances. We are fighting to live in the state of Serbia for 12 years, and now we are in the position of Tadic."
Independent analysts believe that Tadic is a major return to the Kosovo policy.
"Tadic's call is the last time before the December 9th) that Serbia will be determined to receive candidate status," Ian Bancroft, the founder of the Transparency organisation in the Balkans, told SETimes.
"This is a bill to welcome European countries in order to welcome Belgrade, especially Germany, urging them to do more in order to do with their own diaspora," Bancroft said.
"Tadic's problem is willing to ask the question that Europe can give more to give up money institutions in the north, especially in the north.
The latest initiative aimed at preventing the EU's voluntary is unsufficient and the polls in an option of the EU's conditions for Kosovo will be worse, "he said.
But Alesandar Mitic, director of the Kosovo Communication Communication project, said Tadic's call is not surprise, because it is a "harmful policy" that is under pressure.
"Tadic is calling for the removal of the barriers." We have been calling for the removal of any responsibility of any violence. "
According to him, Tadic's call for Serbia to receive candidate status this month, but does not have a special importance to start negotiations with the EU without a date for starting negotiations with the EU.
"However, Kosovo Serbs do not trust Tadic and Pristina will continue to block the partnership in northern Kosovo or block such an obstacle," Mitic said.

The Serbian government reacted a new report that claims that children and female needs special needs, claiming that Serbia's social development institutions are bad, while Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica described the allegations as "bad".
"The accusations that they are used for children are used to be used for children and are particularly bad," the prime minister said.
He added that a special commission would be established in order to prepare a report on the truth conditions for people who need special needs.
The International Court of Humanitarian Rights (MDRI), a US-based NGO, published its report on 14 November at the end of a four-year work.
The study represents the worst conditions in six institutions in Serbia and documents with symbols.
The MDRI explained that children have been linked to the patients of their children, they had to do their aircraft, and that they had to do their aircraft and discovered by the conflict.
"The circumstances are threatening to live in the Serbian institutions, medical and supervised quality and supervised quality and supervised insufficient unemployment," the report said. "The MDRI is not allowed to be allowed to dismantled the circumstances of children in some years."
Although the government acknowledges a victory to accept the problem, fundamental support, fundamental and legal support are blocking efforts to reform the system, the report says.
"These are the most defendant citizens of Serbia.
Thousands of people closed to the institutions are closed to their institutions, humanitarian and destruction and intelligence.

"This report is not reflected in a press conference before the international media, which has been offered to be offered to us," he said.
Health Minister Tomica Milosavljevic is "a report".
"There is no person or the organisation before the organisation, and if there is no question over the country's official institutions for four years ago, this phenomenon's not a phenomenon, but more political will," Milosavljevic said.
Nevertheless, government representatives pledged to improve the situation of institutions that serve special needs.

President Ivo Josipovic is not optimistic.
Speaking at a recent meeting of business representatives, Josipovic said the high unemployment rate continues to be "a concrete problem that shows that the government's level programme" does not give the results.

EU ambition is seen as a obstacle in Croatia
EU lawmakers say that the biggest obstacles in Croatia may be able to reflect the benefits of membership.

Croatia could complete its EU accession talks within a few months, according to the European Parliament's decision on Wednesday (January 26th). [European Commission]
The European Parliament (EP) Foreign Affairs Committee adopted a draft resolution Wednesday (January 27th) that Croatia could complete its EU accession talks by the end of June, but voiced concern about the country's EU ambition.
The document, drafted by the Croatian Parliament's rapporteur, was adopted by Austria's MEP MEP Hannes Swoboda, with three attitudes.
The document praised Croatia for "progress" in the reform area, while changes in the constitutional and judicial system show.
However, the document noted that Zagreb's progress in co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has yet to ensure some key military documents that want to be asked by The Hague tribunal.
"The negotiations with Croatia could be completed in the first half of 2011 if the necessary reforms are determined," the MEP said.
They also noted the fight against public administration reform and the fight against corruption, and the fight against corruption are among the areas needed to complete the country's talks with Brussels within the next five months.
"Corruption is widespread in Croatia and continues to be a serious problem," the AP quoted the draft resolution as saying.
The document acknowledges authorities' efforts to deal with corruption, other high-level government officials and public enterprises.
However, many corruption cases have been convicted in court, and most of them remain at the investigation phase.
Welcoming the need for transparency and fair judiciary, MEP urged Croatian authorities to ensure that corruption investigations are in political intervention.
They also called for further progress in the areas of refugee returns in the coming months.
While the public reduced Serbs, Croatia must step up efforts to resolve concrete issues, resolving concrete issues, resolving concrete problems and to ensure more funding of these people.
MEP urged Zagreb to show full co-operation with the ICTY as a key condition for Balkan countries that want to join the EU.
If Croatia wants to complete its negotiating chapter on competitiveness, it must speed up the country's restructuring industries and speed up the privatisation process.
According to MEP, however, the biggest obstacle between Croatia's 28th member of the EU is unable to convince the benefits of membership.
In the latest Eurobarometer survey, only 25% believe that the participants will be "good" for the country's EU membership, while about 38% of them "bad", 38% said.
Following Croatia's accession, MEP officials and civil society must be held before joining the EU, urging the authorities and the civil society to "ensure that the people see as a European project".
In a Eurobarometer survey, 43% said participants will vote against EU membership, while 38% said it would support it.

Although the first prime minister of Serbia's first prime minister, Zoran Djindjic's assassination of Slobodan Milosevic, the murder is still uncertain if the murder is playing a role in the murder.
Djindjic was applied on 12 March 2003 at the full application of the Serbian government building, which will meet with Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Linda.
The first board claims that Zvezdan Jovanovic, a member of the Serbian secret police unit unit of special operations.
He said the murder of Djindjic's unit was killed and that some commanders were killed to prevent the extradition of the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague, but later forced police.
The defendants chose him to the court.
The intelligence case began on December 28th 2003, but defence lawyers were blocked.
Three of special operations in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo were discovered after Djindjic's murder.
Some members of the Serbian courts have accused the assassination of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's political opponents.
At the beginning of the list of people charged with Djindjic's murder, Milorad Lukovic, one of the most known commander who is known as Legija.
After the assassination, the indictment is still at large.
Prosecutors conducted in the murder, the Zemun criminal group adopted a direct relationship with the incident of the criminal group in the Balkans.
The death was discovered during the murder of Djindjic's murder.
Despite several arrests of arrests in the case, former Serbian Police Minister Dusan Mihajlovic says the case is the reason for a solution to the case's crime and that authorities are still unable to finance the crime.

A referendum on reunification of Cyprus will be held on Saturday (24 April). [AFP]
The UN plan to reunify the island is the only way to prevent peace, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said in a television published on Wednesday (April 21st).
"There is no huge way to fulfil their demands, while the bureaucracy has no longer fulfilled demands of the entity.
This is so far, "he said.
Turkish Cypriots and Rumours will go to the polls on Saturday (April 24th) to vote on the implementation of the plan.
Public polls indicate that the Greek Cypriot community shows that the Greek Cypriots will soon be able to stop the plan.
On Monday, Takis Hadzidiu, director of the Greek Cypriot Studies, resigned a negative recommendation for Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos's plan for the UN plan.
Hadzidiu said the island is a popular platform for the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots to support the plan.
"I will be unfair because of the positive recommendation, or I will open the public.
"It is responsibility for the public and the results of the agreement will be selected," Hadzianu said. "The accession and the EU will submit a historic opportunity and a new start."
Meanwhile, the Turkish government, meanwhile, said it would likely be recognised as an independent country in the northern part of Cyprus if the plan is not approved.
A long-term embargo on northern Cyprus could be removed.
The EU has said it would take steps to protect Turkish Cypriots' refugees and preserve economic.
Now the international public has already been prompted by the results that will be held in the referendum.
Both the EU and the United States have dismissed their readiness to help resolve the issue.
US President George W. Bush called for a deal to contribute to stability in the Eastern Mediterranean.
The European Commission said it wants to see the referendum as a positive outcome that would allow a united Cyprus to enter the Union on 1 May.
How are the details of the Ahtisaari plan
According to Robert Austin, the diplomat at Toronto University of Toronto, Martti Ahtisaari's battle on the Kosovo plan sparked most of its plans.
If the plan's details, Kosovo Albanians are very serious obligations to fulfil their details, Kosovo Serbs can see potential winners of their communities.

Former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari's plan continues diplomatic attitude on the Kosovo plan, while the document drafted the most prestigious aspects of the document.
Among other countries in Kosovo, they are focused on the basis of the proposed proposal, they focused on recognition of a national maritime, national maritime owner and more importantly important agreements and recognition of international organisations.
The fact that Ahtisaari's plan would ensure the implementation of Ahtisaari's plan, and that does not mean many flights of the most important importance.
I don't don't don't don't think what's citizens in northern Mitrovica will be "after independence".
Ahtisaari's plan aims to bring Kosovo into a multiethnic society before everything everything is important to the Albanian communities in the framework of the plan.
More than 90 per cent of the population's population is in Kosovo, Serbian, Roma, Roma, Aublic, Goi, Egypt, Egypt, Turkish and Bosniak communities.
Sesla Ahtisaari's plan envisions a biometric state.
It is clear that minority parties in Kosovo will play critical role in the establishment of both the government and government policies.
In addition, Ahtisaari's recommendations for the communities must not be revealed from one other.
These proposals have expressed regret during direct talks in Vienna during direct talks.
As a first step, Kosovo has to accept a constitution that would include many elements in the Ahtisaari plan.
For that, a total of 21 members of the Serb community must be established, including three other minorities, and three other minorities.
The constitution should be held in nine months after the current parliament adopted by the current Parliament in Kosovo.
As part of the plan, Kosovo Albanians are taking serious obligations. [Getty Images]
The new electoral system is based on the old system, but some important changes.
Parliament still has 120 seats, based on the rival representation.
The real change is that the party's lists will be open to the list -- so far, and most citizens have been closed to these implementation.
Ten Serbian communities have been leaving the polls for Albanian communities, especially for ten other communities.
These are necessary conditions for the first two electoral authority.
Every seats in the election are expected to be held in the polls.
Among the new parliament rules, various rules on the quality majority votes.
Some law amendments include the majority of lawmakers representing small minorities in both parliament and parliament.
Esas, all of the delegations must be able to be changed for any specific change.
A Serb minister and another small minority will be represented in the new cabinet.
For the same time, the same minister is to be transferred.
With more than 12 members of the cabinet, a minister and a minister of minister will be removed more than 12.
Two of the parliament's parliament's lawmakers must be accepted for any amendments on the constitution, both small and small minorities representing small minorities.
The same formation is being implemented for the justice system.
The judges at the Kosovo Constitutional Court must have to have at least 15 per cent of small minority communities.
The details were given young officials at the local level.
Kosovo's official languages were detained in one of the Albanian and Serbs (right) and national symbols, the language and national symbols.
The mandate will be conducted by a representative of the Mayor of the Council of Ministers, which is more than 10 per cent of the population.
As part of the Ohrid Framework Agreement, the ethnic structure of the Kosovo community will reflect every level of public service.
But it is the most important local administration.
This issue is the biggest obstacle for the Albanian majority, because the Ahtisaari plan envisions a series of new municipalities for the establishment of a multiethnic state structure and for the demands of Serbs.
For example, high education and health issues in North Mitrovica are being transferred to local administration.
The same situation is sparked to other municipalities that Serbs are in the majority.
In schools, Serbian education will be able to be developed by ministries in Serbia.
The international community has not been planned, but envisions the presence of the international community in Kosovo.
As it is in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the International Civilian Registration (UST) has been given very comprehensive officials to the EU special representative in the plan.
The ICST's authority is clear: itself will be the final financial centre in implementing the Ahtisaari plan.
The UST is a difference between independence and control independence.
Kosovo's international community is expected to show the presence in the near future. [UNMIK]
Ahtisaari's plan is more than an independent Kosovo.
Ahtisaari has offered a framework for the new situation in Kosovo.
The plan envisions that the conditions in the region will be able to make such a solution to such a solution.
Now the mandate will now prove to protect the ethnic structures in Kosovo, which will now be more efficient and potential.
The Albanian majority has a lot of political will and demand for implementation of Ahtisaari's visa liberalisation.
However, the Albanian communities need to use the effective effectively recognised and powerful and authority.
If these communities are successful to the use of the Ahtisaari plan, crime should not be guaranteed in the Albanian community.
The reactions reached on the plan should be reached, because both sides need to be more detailed than the details of the plan, because it's whereabouts, such as unprecedented autonomy.
Currently, Kosovo media is focusing on the outcome of the vote and the diplomatic power between Serbia and Russia.
How much is said to be done when it will be moved.
Meanwhile, the Serb community in Kosovo has a opportunity to think Ahtisaari can use its proposal to represent its own disadvantages.
They think that Kosovo will not be able to pay a new Albanian state in the Balkans, which is formed in the Balkans.
A campaign, which will be organised by Albanian officials in Kosovo, could mean how the people are expected to be expected to implement implementation.
The Albanian majority has entered a series of comprehensive obligations that would not be welcomed by the plan and not satisfy the plan.
Following this point, a community owns information about Kosovo's political will and the process.

The Bosniak National Council, led by Muammar Zukorlic, has asked the EU to send international observers from Sandzak, as claims that "religious and ethnic rights" were violated.
The Council's call on Monday (September 6th) was the latest point in the political climate in Sandzak's Bosniak community.
In the region, politics, traditional political, traditionally: Rasim Ljajic's Democratic Party (SDP) and Sulejman Ugljanin's Democratic Action (SDA).
Both of the Ugljanin and Ugljanin are in the cabinet, but the parties are very optimistic and even in a dispute that turned into a physical climate.
After the elections of the Bosniak National Council, the Bosniak National Council, a third political force was discovered.
Zukorlic, head of the Islamic Society, said he would support the establishment of a new party to protect Bosniak rights.
Zukorlic, Ljajic and Ugljanin have been charged with the public's interest rates.
Two officials in the financing of the criticism say that the situation will not benefit from the interests of Bosniaks, harm the interests of the Bosniaks, and that the Sandzak will not benefit from economic and political dialogue.

Ian Bancroft, founder of the Transport organisation, told SETimes that the Sandzak problem should be resolved within the priority and resolved within the Bosniak community.
"Sandzak is a similar part in the Balkans because there is no similar conflict in the Balkans because there is no basic conflict between the basic conflict.
"As a result ago, Zukorlic's attempts to unite Zukorlic's religious and policy concerns, the attempts to unite stability in the region," he added.
"Zukorlic is trying to change the main reasons of a political climate in the sovereignty of the SDA and the SDP, while he and symbolic showed a referendum in a sovereignty and more divisions."
"However, there is no small conflict with Kosovo, because Zukorlic's risks, because many Bosniaks do not support Zukorlic's situation, and many Bosniaks do not support and the approach of Zukorlic," Bancroft said.
"The Serbian government, particularly supported by the international community and the OSCE, should encourage civil political platform, inter-ethnic dialogue and economic development," Bancroft said.

The police services of Serbia and Montenegro agreed to establish a joint state in the Montenegrin coastal season, as one of the most recent examples of regional police co-operation, as well as to establish organised crime team.
"We want to show that police co-operation between the two countries in order to prevent crime," said Serbian Police Director Milorad Veljovic.
Montenegrin police spokesperson Radomir Radunovic told SETimes that the crimes are unnecessary to see free movement, free movement and borders as a promotion of the borders.
"This includes professional training and investigations for members of police experience, training and investigations for members of the two police service," Radunovic said.
Zeljko Likovic, the owner of the Podgorica tourist destination, welcomed the co-operation of the police service.
"We are very important to feel our security in Montenegro.
I don't say Montenegro is safe, but this move is crucial for preventing the crime, "he said.
Likiks Tikovic has reserved more than 2,000 tourists from Serbia last year, and Likovic expects the number of Serbian tourists this year.
Dragan Samolov, 43, who lives in Belgrade, says his family had a holiday in Kotor, Montenegro, and now doesn't have any problems.
"In all years, we have been sparked to the street of young people and more people who are more accelerated than us," Samolov told SETimes.
This is not very important, "he said.
Samolov said that some people have been hiding weapons and that police are fighting good fight against this problem.
"However, I don't see nothing that the weapons were discovered as one of Montenegro for 20 years."
Authorities say the deal is improving long-term co-operation between Serbia and Montenegro.

Last summer, at least 40 Hungarian police officers seized to Croatia's coastal coasts.
Bosnia and Herzegovina police work together with Croatian colleagues.
It is widely widely visiting the border between the two countries.
In addition, Kosovo police are working together with Albanian police for two years, and working together to ensure a complex of several Kosovo Albanians during the summer season in Albania.
Banja Luka Security and Defence Professor Predrag Ceranic told SETimes that the joint police work is a basic basic basis for the extradition of the joint police work, because the criminals are restructuring to the regional conditions.
"The suspects are co-operating with their neighbours in neighbouring countries, so it is essential to co-operate with police to fight them.
This will become a trend in the region and will be more difficult to operate in these conditions, "he said.
Veljovic suggested that police forces continue to continue this trend and retirement.
"We want co-operation between Serbia and Montenegro in all the region and in the document, and in all Europe."
Macedonia begins to start accession dialogue with EU
The EU is due to help Macedonia's acceleration of institutional reforms, and to ensure that Greece will remain on its path towards EU membership, despite its revenues.

Macedonia will meet with EU officials on 15 March for talks aimed at co-ordinating the accession process by Greece. [Reuters]
Macedonia and the EU will begin high-level talks aimed at reducing the official negotiating process, aimed at completing accession talks with the EU.
EC President Jose Manuel Barroso and Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele agreed to start talks with the Macedonian administration in Ohrid last year.
The goal of dialogue is to protect Macedonia's institutional reforms aimed at strengthening the EU, the EU delegation's office said in a statement.
"The reason for the start of the dialogue with Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski is the reason for the start of dialogue with Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski," EU spokesman Konstantin Jovanovic told SETimes.
Jovanovic said the talks would focus on strengthening the reform of Macedonia's public administration, strengthening the freedom of media freedom, improving the election process and improving the market economy.
"Macedonia is now looking forward, and a step towards blocking Greece's obstacles," Gruevski said.
Macedonia is awaiting to receive a date for opening its EU accession talks.
Greece blocked Macedonia's plans to invite NATO in 2008 and envisions EU membership due to a long-term name dispute.
Greece says the name "Macedonia's name" does mean an ambitious claims on Macedonia's same name.
Macedonia, adopted under the UN "former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia", says its name would mean a loan of the national identity. More than 100 countries are recognised as "Republic of Macedonia".
The EU and Macedonian leaders will meet two times, but dialogue will continue to continue over the past year.
A progress report will be published in October.
"When the chapter of the dispute is slow, this dialogue will encourage the establishment of similar mechanisms in other parts of similar mechanisms," political Studies analyst Vladimir Bozo told SETimes.
According to Macedonian Deputy Prime Minister for European Affairs Teuta Arifi, the highest level dialogue is unable to keep the opening of official membership talks.
"Nobel is likely to respond to our activities as the latest EC progress report," Arifi said.
Macedonia's President Gjorge Ivanov, however, said the ICJ decision and the interim agreement in Macedonia has reached a framework for Macedonia to continue its EU integration process.
Ivanov reflected the position at the end of last month's meeting -- Richard Hukititt, Eduard Kukan, Lojan Peteras -- Lojojh Peteras.
"We should continue to continue talks with Greece as a parallel to find a solution to the name dispute," Ivanov's Foreign Minister Darko Kostadinovski told SETimes.
Some analysts say the dialogue mechanisms will overcome the current regional bilateral dispute and facilitate candidates to facilitate EU membership.
"In 1981, the European Parliament decided to negative decision on Greece's EU accession, but the country was accepted because of political pressure," Bozo said.
Other regional countries in the region have not yet announced their accession talks with the EU, but analysts say bilateral disputes would be a problem in the process.

Is the development Economy Reconstruction
Free prices and competitiveness are crucial for the right distribution of resources. [SE Times] The former Romanian Finance Minister and economist Daniel Daianu emphasised the importance of public administration and institutional management in accordance with public administration and institutional management.
According to Daianu, these factors say the economy's overall performance.
By Daniel Daianu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest - 20 / 10 / 03
Free market market and competitiveness is crucial for the dissolidation of resources.
To encourage the initiative and trade activities, property rights must be implemented in every area, and to ensure the protection of the property rights and preserve stability.
In the meantime, however, it is obvious to the establishment of the level policy stations that must be able to serve in concrete interests, bridge, bridge, bridge.
At the beginning of the beginning of the year, the economists are still able to reach a compromise on specific issues that have been discussed for years.
These uncertainty could be a more open debate between policies and government advisers.
These issues are particularly interested in the situation of developing countries:
The free trade is seen as a result of many economists, but broadcasts and dynamic effectively affect countries' work to protect a mistakes in developing developments.
The free trade trade, such as Dani Rodrik, is not always causing economic growth.
A recent conclusion of trade talks in Cancin is unaware of the difference between the rich countries, and the agriculture subsidies (agricultural subsidies) is unaware of the agricultural subsidies.
The free movement of free movement was very dangerous for the markets.
The IMF has no longer proposes for the implementation of the implementation of the ten years ago, but not the current institutional and regulatory conditions.
With the restructuring of the lack of political co-ordination, the public has started to be acceptable in the economy intervention.
According to several financing crisis and a large financial crisis, as well as the functioning of market markets, as well as the functioning of market markets, protests and legal regulations ("markets"), according to some of the "formulation of the markets", as well as the formation of the markets.
The government cannot test a role in the supply of public goods.
At the same time, the encouraging of IT and technological development is a part of the government's role.
A series of defence programmes conducted in the EU and the United States could be described as a example of defence policies.
The union's intelligence policy could be sparked if it is hiding in a world, if it is surprised.
Many economists who have been developed and developed and developed developments are also used to reach national economic targets.
Do you think public goods in the World economy
Do you think that is the co-ordination of different policies, including co-ordination of different policies to prevent diversification of diversification in the world economy
Economists reflect the importance of the markets' resources and the award of the initiative's initiative, while the governments continue to discuss the economic role.
"New Teorists (New Teorists) won the possibility of the new Teorists: the possibility of example [of] the possibility of index [of], which is the possibility of the possibility of index [index], such as the outcome of the school economy
New Teorists, based on the former development economies, attracts good restructuring.
Albert Hirgil, Paul Rosenstein Roden, Ragnar Nurkal, Luxembourg and many other economists have emphasised the structure of structures in various areas of institutions, poor poor economists, and many other economists, emphasised the role of their institutions.
A "Green" is needed, such as Romania's 1943 unfortunately definitely definitely recognised.
The debate on the development economy is restructuring many old issues.
In this donation, external external external external external politicians have reaffirmed issues such as the "summer developments" in terms of public policies.
Both national and international level public policies are open to the government's success, as well as the failure of the market co-ordination.
It needs to encourage the true of institutions and institutional management, functioning institutions and functioning of the economy's overall performance.
The major differences in communist countries in the communist countries have been imposed to economic performance, institutional structures and policies.
In most of the countries that have developed in some areas of economic progress in the areas of China and India, the disappointment of disappointment of disappointment and "control of the global economy", as well as a new development of "controlling", the document reacted in a new modern reaction.
The parallel economists, such as the Paul Krugman, Dani Rodrik, Dani Rodrik and Joseph Stieph, may be more realistic and credited to their policies in the development economies.

Macedonia really uncertainty after NATO summit
Macedonia's prospects for NATO and the EU depends on a compromise with Greece and fulfilling the eight criteria set by Brussels.
However, the process of progress can be achieved in both issues.

Macedonians are preparing to go to the June 1st vote after the first stage and disappointment for NATO membership.
Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski has decided to accept the general election offer by the Democratic Union (DUI).
Gruevski said he wants to have a new authority process and more stable parliament, and that many are hoping to resolve the problems that the number will increase.
However, these move was a reason for criticism. According to the elections, the elections will block the current account -- to block the name dispute with Greece.
The dispute could not block the country's invitation to join NATO's NATO summit, but could affect the start of EU accession talks.
At the summit in Bucharest, NATO leaders agreed to decide on Macedonia's ambassador to wait for a compromise at the next summit, including Athens and Skopje.
US Ambassador to NATO Victor Nulia, who met with Prime Minister and President Branko Crvenkovski, said the dispute on name should be resolved "within weeks or weeks".
Nuland and Nuland have asked Skopje to work to ensure a "compromise".
However, during a long-term debate on the distribution of parliament, the opposition Social Democrats have accused Gruevski's allies and abandoning a political battle.
Crvenkovski, who speaks with Gruevski members of the law body, said he had agreed to accept the idea of compromise with Greece, and voiced hope that international mediator Matthew Nimetz's latest bid -- the Republic of Macedonia (Republic) -- is ready to accept Bucharest.
In every case, Macedonia's partnership with both NATO and the EU -- is now a complex climate.

The EU has offered eight conditions for Macedonia and has met the fulfillment of these conditions, even if the EU has assessed its assessment of negotiations.
However, if the election is possible in June, the EC will be fulfilled by September until September.
A new government will find at least a summer term.
Meanwhile, parliament's distribution is restricting the opportunity for bilateral talks with Greece.
The government, which has been blocking the effects and key decisions, is currently working only technical.
Washington has strongly advocated Macedonia's partnership, but could less efficient than the Balkans because of the US presidency's upcoming elections.
NATO membership is seen as a major church, but not only a major church for Macedonia's stability. In 2001, the signing of the Ohrid Agreement signed with the 2001 Ohrid Agreement is needed to work on multiethnic democracy.
The institutions have a negative environment for the Macedonian economy, which is unprecedented, has created a negative environment for the Macedonian economy.
In the country, 113m euros are 113m euros, unemployment rate is 335 per cent.
There are more foreign direct investments to resolve these problems, but the unemployment environment, which is not more attractive for Macedonia.
Economic barriers and institutional problems could lead to restructuring nationalists after the declaration of Kosovo's independence.
The Macedonia-Kosovo border has not been discovered and separatist groups may be encouraged to developments in the region.
"If Macedonia has not entered NATO, I am very serious that the country will continue to remain in the ten years later.
"I am very concerned because the Macedonian identity is dangerous by their neighbours, who fear that the Macedonian identity is a complicated agenda," he said.

Albania's prime minister voiced concern about the possibility of radical restructuring in the country if Macedonia is except abroad.
"There is a matter that can be resolved on Isia and resolved," Berisha told the BBC.
The elections in Macedonia are expected to be stopped by violence, increasingly liberalised and celebrations.
During a debate over the distribution of parliament, the Social Democrats accused the ruling VMRO-DPMNE's "violation" to the ruling VMRO-DPMNE party.
The opposition has also said the Gruevski administration is preparing to take place in the elections, because the ruling party has not allowed some key laws -- such as the appointment of the new State Election Committee, the president of the new State Election Committee, and a regulation on the right of the state media.
For politicians in Macedonia, they will be able to hold the election campaign without nationalism.
"The fight against both political parts in Macedonia will prove each other to prove that they are.
"It's a lot to Europe."

The leaders of the European leaders, a major step forward in the EU enlargement process, seeing the signing of accession agreements with Bulgaria and Romania in 2005.
"We have made significant results on the future of Europe," European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso said in a speech at the two-day EU summit in Brussels on Friday (December 17th).
The summit was a major death of talks between the Netherlands and Turkish officials on the Cyprus issue last year.
The initial was signed in Ankara to sign a protocol that would have to sign the customs union agreement with Cyprus and other nine new EU member states, which would mean an expansion protocol that would mean recognition of Cyprus.
However, the two sides agreed to reconciliation, saying that Turkey would seek the protocol to start accession talks before the start of the protocol "and signed after the EU's presidency".
EU leaders voiced confidence that Turkey will continue to continue its reform process and guarantee the respect of fundamental freedom and human rights. The negotiation process, which is expected until 15 years, will include measures to prevent Turkey's obligations if it is expected to be suspended by 15 years.
Speaking on Saturday, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the agreement reached in Ankara has opened the way for a stronger democracy and better economic performance in the country.
"I can't get 100 per cent of our friends, but I can say that we are successful," Erdogan said. "It is a point that Turkey has fulfilled its efforts to meet its 41 years."
Another important step in the enlargement process, European leaders agreed that Croatia's accession talks to begin on 17 March 2005, citing the country's full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
Citing Zagreb to take the necessary steps in this issue, the EU urged Croatian General Ante Gotovina to arrest and extradite "and extradite" to The Hague as soon as possible.
Croatia's goal was to join the EU with Bulgaria and Romania in 2007.
Experts believe that 2009 is a possible date.
Bulgaria and Romania's progress towards joining the EU in January 2007, the leaders said in a statement Friday that they are moving towards joining the EU in April 2005 as a date for signing accession agreements.
Both countries have agreed to protect the delay of protecting members' delays if they are successful in implementing reforms.
Retired problem in Serbia's discrimination
The general climate has been optimistic for years, especially for women and minorities, especially for women and minorities.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade â€“ 25 / 04 / 11
Serbian Affairs Commissioner Nevena Petruc. [EU]
Serbia's Affairs Commissioner for Integration Nevena Petercic, who served as a two-year term.
In this exclusive interview with SETimes correspondent Igor Jovanovic, the former director of the Nis Law Faculty, told SETimes that discrimination, discrimination, and that people will not be easy to change the way to change the things of people.
SETimes: Women have a lower salary of 51 per cent of the country's population, but the same job is lower salary, and the law has a lower turnout in law and judicial areas.
How do you assess the reality of women in the Serb community
Nevena Petruc: While women and men have equal rights in Serbia, women are unequal discrimination, women are unprecedented and direct discrimination.
According to researchers, women -- particularly ethnic minorities and ethnic minorities -- are also a law on different parts of the Roma, barriers, barriers, refugees, poverty, poverty, rural discrimination, and social life.
Petrucic says the workers are less than 16 per cent less than the men's colleagues. [Reuters]
The data shows that women do not participate in the state's decisions in the process, only 21.2 per cent of Serbian lawmakers, only 21.3 per cent of the municipality's lawmakers and ministers.
The number of municipalities are limited to 4 per cent.
The separate discrimination, economic data.
The unemployment rate in the village is higher than two times.
The difference between the salaries and men's salaries is 16 per cent.
Currently, the management of the community and the economy is estimated to 30.5 per cent of them.
The economic diversification of economic diversification is very high.
As for instance, women's women are more difficult.
If they have to say it is necessary to say, some minority groups are still completed in women and men's sovereignty among women and men's sovereignty, but in rural areas, women and men's children are still unnecessary.
Although young women are increasing the level of accession, the level of accession is increasingly registered in the rise of young people, it is worried at the high level of piracy levels.
Asian and murder violence is sparked to other violence based on women's trafficking and genocide.
Studies of genocide are particularly in particular, because NGOs are not recognised by the state level of violence.
Women, who are unfortunately discriminatory and discriminatory, seems violence.
The current mechanisms, which provides legal protection against genocide, should not be implemented in the bridge, but there are no protocol on the police's duties on the matter of the issue, which is a lot of co-operation between the institutions and institutions.
Roma women are "the most dangerous part of the population", Petruc told SETimes. [Reuters]
Women who protect the violence remain unable to reach a second victory in the court process, and they don't have enough psychological and support.
Roma women use the rights of genocide, particularly on the removal of genocide, particularly on the removal of safety and women's asylum.
SETimes: Do you have special social assistance programmes to ensure Roma women's participation in the community
Petruc: The average life of Roma women is unrealistic.
Roma women in Serbia are not improved without adequate measures.
In addition to improving the situation of the Roma population, the Roma women should be developed in special measures to improve the situation of Roma. These women are being discriminated for both women and the Roma community.
Roma women are very important for the measures to give more education and employment, because the rights can be used in a very restrictive level due to ethnic villages and genocide.
SETimes: Is the service has been reported several complaints since the opening
Do you complain that the citizens are most discriminatory
Petrucic: We live in a country where he is in both private areas and in the private areas, the spread of spread, spread, spread, foreign abolition, sexual abolition, sexual discrimination and similar discrimination.
For that reason, we are facing challenges in the fight against discrimination, discrimination, discrimination, discrimination and discrimination.
He was only the first step forward to prepare the anti-discrimination law.
More than 200 complaints have been made so far.
People have complained that the most details of the details in the field of the details and intelligence.
In addition, we had six details about the disease of the murder minorities.
Our citizens do not know what we have yet to know what we have yet been detailed, and nothing that any right is violated by the violation of any judges, which are not in accordance with them.
In this reason, there are many things that people can understand the education and understand what details are discriminatory, and that we must do so to protect the examples.
SETimes: Do you think the authority of sanctions against violations of violations of violations
Petruc: A good legal framework for protecting discrimination in Serbia is in the current framework of law and this legal framework enforcement mechanisms under the effect of law, penal code and competitiveness.
I think that the authority of the so-called Affairs Commissioner for Integration is designed as a widely widely widely widely widely widely widely battle against any discrimination.
A part of the eight-wing area is closing to action in concrete discrimination.
The commission's law on details is being held under the law, and the Commission can demand the approval of the perpetrators to protect the invitation of the case, which may be able to protect the case and protect separatists.
I want the commission's authority to monitor the supervise of the supervised structure in separatist cases.
The team is increasingly increasingly increasingly increasingly increasingly increasingly increasingly on the victims of the acts of the acts, arguing that discrimination is unacceptable.
I think that this is the best direction to prevent discrimination for years to prevent separate discrimination.
EU approves aid for Turkish Cypriots
EU foreign ministers have approved a 139m-euro aid package for offering northern Cyprus.
The deal could be possible after the context of contemporary trade between Turkish Cypriots and EU member states allowed to allow direct trade between the Turkish Cypriots.

"The unilateral decision is that the EU is the only unilateral decision and challenges," he said. [AFP]
EU foreign ministers agreed on Monday (February 27th) to open a decision to open 139m euros in financial aid to the Turkish Cypriot community.
The aid will be used to improve the northern part of the island.
The deal, which is expected to wait from 18 months due to the provisions of trade between the Greek Cypriot side's members in northern Cyprus and EU members, agreed on Friday that the EU Information Committee (COREPEPEA) requested a detailed issue of financial support.
"COREPR's goal is to create a better environment to boost co-operation between the two communities and to boost negotiations between the two communities to resolve the Cyprus issue," Greek Cypriot administration spokesman George Lililas said on Saturday.
Monday's approval came ahead of talks between Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in Paris on Tuesday.
A Greek Cypriot official said the goal is to facilitate the reconstruction of peace talks.
Ankara, however, has also criticised Brussels for its unilateral war.
Turkey wants to be part of a major package, including the agreement on direct trade between Turkish Cypriots and the 25-nation EU member states.
"Turkey's most important step forward with financial assistance," Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul quoted Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul as saying. "The EU will bring new challenges and challenges with this unilateral decision that the EU is the only unilateral decision."
Meanwhile, Turkish Cypriot authorities, COREPER expressed their attitude on a door rating in the Greek Cypriots' attitude for further conditions, which is approved on Friday, to allow COREPR to allow trade with EU member states.
Ahead of the UN plan to end Cyprus's division in April 2004, the EU vowed that it would help the Turkish Cypriot community's worst economic situation, which is recognised by the state, which is recognised only by Turkey.
In a referendum, Greek Cypriots rejected the UN peacekeeping plan, while the majority of the Turkish Cypriots approved the plan for the EU on 1 May 2004. On 1 May 2004, the Greek Cypriot side represented the EU as a member of the island.
The EU's proposal adopted by the end of the end of the 259m euros, with a aid package of aid package for the Turkish Cypriot community, envisions mechanism euros to direct trade with EU member states.
However, the price has been given for a part of the price, and the Turkish Cypriots spent 120m euros in the first planned planned planned.

A Orthodox church church near the eastern Bosnian town of Zvornik is one of the search of a time when it is a mosque.
While the local administration has taken an attempt to resolve ethnic relations for months, it is said to be symbolic of consensus in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
The Muslims returned to Divic after the BiH conflict have been demanding the church of the church and reconstruction of the mosque, while local authorities are willing to leave their church in the first quarter.
The local administration has paid 30,000 euros for the removal of the Islamic community, and the human rights commission in BiH assured Zvornik to represent the removal for the new mosque municipality of Zvornik.
Zvornik administrative administrative officer Dragan Jhac said the Islamic community has been offered, but has rejected both.
The situation has caused the protests of Muslims and caused injuries in the church.
Beera Eftoglu, one of the protesters, says he is not a regret of the church, but added that it would be better to return Muslims to the Muslims.
During the intelligence, Dijevic arrived in other parts of BiH.
The town was changed as Saint Stefan, one of the most respective Serbian markets.
However, only one Serb lives in the town.
Risto Cureured retired the pension and neighbours.
He was attacked by the attack and was forced to make police intervention.
The tensions on the Camii issue are being hiding in the worst economic situation in the region.
Many of the 185 families in Divic have diplomatic diplomacy, but only a few members have a process.
The village says people are in line with humanitarian aid and small pensions.
Serbia faces electricity plants
The environmental standards cannot pay money to meet the environmental standards, while the restructuring of Serbia's electricity energy sector is unnecessary.
However, every move towards privatisation of the state power utility will likely be met with the opposition.

The EPS needs to invest 1 billion euros to meet its administrative environmental standards. [EPS]
There is no importance of the Serbian government without challenges.
Following an IMF pressure from the Serbian Petroleum (NI) last autumn to open tender for privatisation adviser to the privatisation adviser, the government announced it was selected "strategic adviser" for the Serbian Egyptian Industry (EPS).
The move was expected to be sold to privatisation and buy financing.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus, the adviser company will need to create a concert for the development of the company, creating "a concert for restructuring and investment".
A <unk> 50m loan from the World Bank to rebuild the economic restructuring will be linked to the outcome of this tender, which will pay EPS's future and public electricity.
While the prices of the gas is likely to cover two years, it will be one of the lowest prices in the region due to subsidies.
The EPS is very clear that everything should be done.
The company has to invest 1 billion euros to meet the administrative environment standards, but there is no money in the town.
Today, Serbia could meet most of the needs of electricity energy, but at least five years, there is no need for a small power plant and a village of a village and a village of village, which is between 750 billion euros.
As the government's electricity prices, the EPS is not chosen to pay prices to meet electricity prices.
In addition, the "socialist" is under the level of "socialist", rather than determined by electricity prices in Serbia.
The EPS paid at least 80m euros for electricity energy imports every year, but the same electricity price is selling one third of the market market prices.
The World Bank supports efforts to restructure the energy market, but says it should not leave.
David Kennedy, senior economists from the bank, says that the Bank does not want to privatise the privatisation plan, but that it should be prepared to be prepared with any privatisation plan.
The government was welcomed by workers unions and reactions by the EPS administration.
They have also indicted charges that the company will be implemented by about 40,000 people and more than half of euros.
The best hydropower plants and mobile power plants, as well as electricity distribution services, will be able to find a lot.
Experts, meanwhile, are concerned about the impact of the system's efficiency, and some argue that integration systems can only provide a safe power power.
This issue is a problem in other countries in Eastern Europe, while Chinese, Hungarians and Polish and Polish communities are more in order to join the system.
The situation is not different in Bulgaria, when the Czech CEZ company, owner of electricity distributors and electricity distributors, is in potential integration.

After two years after Kosovo's declaration of independence, Serbian leaders say the return to the negotiating chapter could be taken.
Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic is confident that independence declaration's declaration of independence would be disappointed by the international law.
Officials say the outcome could be able to open a compromise for talks and Belgrade if the outcome is unacceptable.
"One of the entity victims will have to give up, and that will be Kosovo," Serbian State Secretary for Kosovo Olympic Ivanovic said.
However, many Kosovo Serbs have shown.
According to High Representative Rada Trajkovic, Belgrade is not a political event that needs to make a solution to its own force.
"Serbia does not have a clear strategy for political and security, in terms of dependence on economic and security, dependence on donations and to Kosovo and Metohija," Trajkovic told SETimes. "Even all inflation has been able to start talks with these inflation, even even if these rates have been achieved."
The technical talks on issues affecting Kosovo Serbs are more realistic, he said.
According to him, the talks could strengthen the position of Serbs and the Serb Orthodox Church in Kosovo, "if these talks are prepared".
Trajkovic also urged Serbia to leave any precautionary talks.
According to him, extremist Albanian groups started restructuring in Macedonia, and a step forward could lead to new conflicts to new conflicts.
In other words, radical nationalists oppose Belgrade's talks -- the Serbs in Kosovo -- to improve the conditions for improving the conditions of Serbs in Kosovo -- would mean independence.
"Technical talks are a letter for Serbia," Kosovo and Metohija Council Vice President Marko Jaksic told SETimes. "We will not improve our life in the north, because we are in a bad concern about the independence of Kosovo."
Kosovo Serb refugees, meanwhile, are waiting to see concrete improvements in the situation.
Many feel that Belgrade is doing little to help them.
Since the village of Ljijar and Strpatics in 1999, Jelisavlcic and Curcevic families share a two-chapter at the Belgrade village of Kalucerica.
Both sides also reflected themselves.
"Oslum Bojan is a different model and a different model in the street, the street is a different model and a different model in the street.
The Union ranks 38 others.
They also found that they were found in a concert in New Belgrade, "he said.
"We have not been able to get children for more than ten years," Jelisavljevic said.
Social Affairs Minister Rasim Ljajic opposes the country's policy on Kosovo.
"Serbia has allocated 500m euros for Kosovo, but I don't think that this money is the best spending," Ljajic said.
Analysts say that if the talks continue, the talks will likely be put on different regulations to allow Belgrade, private, parallel relations with Belgrade on its territory of northern Kosovo and Serb monitors.
"In addition to the North Ireland, all resolved issues proposed by former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan," said Predrag Simic, a former Serbian ambassador and international law professor of law.
Because Serbia's rejection of the Ahtisaari plan, Simic noted that the 1244 UN Co-operation and the Kumanovo Treaty Treaty Treaty is unacceptable.
Political analyst Dusan Janjic told SETimes that any direction of Kosovo's independence is unlikely to change any way.
"It would be the main reason for Belgrade to launch talks with Brussels on the status of the crisis management.
This could end the details for Serbia on the path towards the EU, "he said.

Croatia's cheaper energy is based on investments
In Croatia, power and rhetoric energy sources are important, but the authority does not be used.
By Ksicja Jurkovic for Southeast European Times in Siik â€“ 16 / 03 / 11
Regional and glass are Croatia's main renewable energy sources. [Reuters]
Croatia has a broad potential for expansion of renewable sources, but at least one is not used to be used by the potential, which is still in terms of power, swimming, swimming or psychological goods.
However, this situation has changed in recent years.
"In the respect of the Corridor power plants, we are currently producing 40% of energy.
We have to buy about 30% of our energy immigration, because we have to buy the consumption, "he said.
The "new renewable" resources, especially in the field of wind power, reflects special investors, especially in the field of wind power.
The first wind wind plant in Croatia was established in Paath in 2004.
The company, in Adria Wind Power, has formed a 5950 share of the island's Ravna region.
The biggest developments in the development of the winter energy was held in the coastal region, particularly in the two new plants, in Siik, invited to invest in two new plants.
The first plant was established in 2006 in the reactions of the Trav-Krololin reactions, and the first stage was established last year.
In Croatia, the same goal is to be the same goal, but most of them are part of the Dalmatia region in Dalmatia.
For instance energy, it seems a different phenomenon, despite the broad potential.
According to data from the Vojvoje Pozar Energy Institute, about 15,000 square metres in Croatia.
The total production capacity of this phenomenon is estimated at about 52 cubic metres.
"There is no support for the insurance of power in Croatia, and this is dealing with the job," Vjeran Pirsic, head of the Eko Kresner Association, told SETimes.
Pirsic said that various energy clubs, including defendants, preventing more development of power alternative alternative.
"If almost, the entire renewable energy was allowed to be a lot of elections," Pirsic said. "It is a very worse elections for our country, especially in the south, especially in the south."
In the economy ministry, there are almost 700 applications for the development of renewable energy funding projects.
The completion of these would provide about 6,500 MW products, but the current distribution system could be able to deal with only a part of this capacity.
The scandal power infrastructure and a bureaucratic bureaucratic, has only blocked obstacles to the development of renewable energy sources in Croatia.
"The Union needs to receive 60 different documents and our own homes to build a textile equipment.
These include the idea of good product, "he said.
Despite these challenges, Economy Minister Djokijac is optimistic.
"Croatia is currently spending 18 Terameters of electricity annually. In 2020, more than 3.5 Terameters will be allowed to renovate energy sources," Popijac said.
To invest in renewable energy, Croatia's future is crucial to the EU.
To meet the bloc's overall energy needs by 2020, the country promised to meet energy needs at least 20% of production and consumption sources.

Prosecutors in Bulgaria have launched an investigation into several former ministers and state institutions for allegations of corruption, corruption, immunity and similar crimes.
The main opposition party, the main opposition party, the BSP's Socialist Party, and former prime minister Sergey Stanishev.
Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev urged parliament on 3 November to remove the immunity of the former prime minister's immunity in order to investigate a secular report by Stanishev last year.
"Stanishev will be investigated by investigating the investigations of documentation of documentation and materials in the state score, and the result of the information in the state," Velchev said in a statement.
The document was a written written about "the actions of the ministerial and environmental structures", which has created "the ministries and public administration structures".
The scandal was sparked last month with Prime Minister Boyko Borisov, who said former DANS chief Alexander Petrov had surrendered him.
According to rules on rules on the removal documents, Stanishev had to surrender the document's ministers to surrender a special party, but Stanishev did not do so.
Petrov, who has been adviser to DANS, has been adviser to Petko Sertov, has not yet been able to win the software.
Following a long time, the secret report was published in Internet.
The former prime minister, who claimed that the report was extradited to the security service, has denied any crime, but said he would have been voluntary.
According to the Sofia city prosecutor Nikolay Kokinov, the incident would be able to be investigated as part of the investigation in the case.
Borisov later told the press after the former prime minister said he was not extradited to procedures on 11 specific documents, including two documents concerning the increased influence in the energy area.
Stanishev's move was criticised by President Georgi Parvanov, who initially initiated the BSP leader's opposition.

"Do you do not act with the fight against organised crime leaders, one of the symbolic process in Bulgaria," Parvanov said on 9 November.
I am still closed to feel that they are still inevitable, "he said.
Borisov, who did not respond to criticism from Parvanov's criticism, reminded the number of reports concerning the functioning of the state's allegations of criminal environment, and asked him to intervene his work.
"We reflect the natural path to the natural path: we will arrest great paintings, then we will be able to survive the heavy.
This job was condemned with this job, and we have accepted that Bulgaria's former BSP leadership is not managed by the leaders of organised crime group.
"Do you think that?" he said.
If Stanishev indicted, he could be sentenced to three years.
Borisov's centre-right party, Bulgaria's European Integration (GERB), won a disaster victory in the parliamentary elections in the July 5th parliamentary elections in the July 5th parliamentary elections, including the country's European Integration (GERB), which has already caused more than millions of euros.
Last four months ago, Borisov and ministers have revealed several suspects made by members of the Stanishev cabinet. The suspects have been convicted by the prosecutor's office, which has been convicted.
The reality reflects that public tenders have shown that more than half of euros, restructuring and renewed prices based on construction and renewable work in construction and renewable work.
Following Velchev's request for the investigation, three days after parliament requested Stanishev's immunity on 6 November, the law questioned a similar request on former Labour Minister Emilia Maslarova.
The BSP member Maslarova will launch an investigation into the abuse of intelligence of a social centre in Stara Zagora, in the town of Zagora.
The tender worth 10m euros was given to a company claiming that the former minister is linked to the average of the former minister's mandate.
According to media reports, more than 1,200 euros have been removed at the trend, which is set to rebuild the facility.
Prosecutor said Maslarova will be charged with the immunity of about 5m euros.

In early September, former Agriculture Minister Valentin Tsvetanov was representative of the previous coalition government, the representative of former Agriculture Minister Valentin Tsvetanov.
Tsvetanov is accused of using his post in 15 vehicles.
The prosecutors also indicted similar charges against former state manager Stefan Yurov, who allegedly claimed about about about about 2.3m euros in restructuring state damage.
Borisov's first law enforcement is to delay a decision on Bulgaria's recent government to delay the contracts of sports in the country's parts of less attractive and less attractive reserves in the country's sectors, allowing tourists to allow tourists in the fields.
Sofia's prosecutor, the prosecutor of the city, has indicted better on November 9th.
Hristo Monov, director of the State Railways Company of the BDZ last month, opened an invitation to a 16.5m-euro deal, which covers 30 second hotels.
As part of this agreement with a Swedish company, the BDZ general manager was 550,000 euros per month. According to an agreement with the Swedish company, the alcohol was worth 217,000 euros per month ago.
According to Bulgaria's daily Echo, prosecutors have been renewed in the last nine years ago, but these minutes do not meet the technical requirements in effectively.
Furthermore, Bulgaria has already paid 90 per cent of the telecommunications price, but only 12 minutes have been surrendered.
Monov's assassination has reached an agreement with 10m euros, the prosecutors said.

Serbian government expects early elections, early elections
The Serbian government, formed less than ten months before the pro-democratic parties, will be discovered because of the deepening ideas on Kosovo and EU membership.
The early elections are expected to be held.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 10 / 03 / 08
"Serbia's citizens have a better life and economic prospects," President Boris Tadic said. [Getty Images]
Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica announced his own resignation at a press conference early Saturday (March 8th), saying it is no longer losing the cabinet's job due to different positions on the Kosovo issue.
Therefore, the government called on Monday (May 11th) to recognise parliament leader Boris Tadic's parliamentary district and call for early elections, as a potential for local and local and religious elections.
"The government has lost its job -- which is not a lack of policies.
This means that we should not extradite our duties, "he said.
The reason for the distribution of the coalition is the option of Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia on February 17th, he added.
Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) has backed a controversial resolution, which is prepared by the ultranationalist Radical Party (DSS) and that Serbia would participate in the EU if the Union promises to respect Serbia's sovereignty over Kosovo.
The partners, the DS and G17 Plus parties have rejected the decision to join the EU, rejected the DS and G17 Plus parties, and the government's resistance in the final.
Tadic said such a decision would not defend Serbia's membership if it does not defend Kosovo.
He supports the election decision.
However, Tadic said the most important problem in relations between coalition partners is in the position towards the EU.
"I believe the problem is that the Serbian government does not have a common stance on Serbia's citizens -- and the people -- on European and economic prospects.
Serbia's citizens condemn a better life and economic prospects in the EU, and I am confident that we will defend the best organisations in this organisation against the independence of Kosovo, "he said.
Analysts say the early elections will be a referendum on Serbia's path -- if pro-European parties won the EU -- the right true, nationalist parties will enter the EU.
The fight against Tadic's DS and leaders, Vojislav Seselj, are expected to be transferred between the Radicals indicted in The Hague tribunal.
According to a February survey, the Radical Party, 39%, DS and partners will be 38%.
According to these results, both parties can form the government with the help of the coalition partners.
Therefore, if the elections are expected, Kostunica will continue to discuss the talks on forming a new cabinet in the bloc's share of around 10% of the vote.
The move is on Kosovo and the EU.
Polls say 67% of Serbs want to see EU membership.
However, 74% will not accept the acceleration of EU membership if Kosovo does not recognise its independence.
The early elections reflect both economists and Kosovo Serbs.
Economists believe that Serbia will lose great external investment due to political stability, while Kosovo Serbs think the elections will not help Kosovo's presence and that political attitudes are valuable.

Political parties in Serbia have submitted talks on the new government after the parliamentary elections earlier this month, they say that the coalition led by Belgrade President Boris Tadic, the pro-European Democratic Party (DS) led by Serbian President Boris Tadic, is more likely to win foreign investors.
Economists say that a DS central government will be able to deal with the inflation problem, and protect the country's economic resignation.
The government has been linked to the coalition in the Serbian Socialist Party, which won 20 seats in the 11 May elections.
The Socialists began talks with the Radicals and the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), but the polls have dropped.
Some leaders from the Socialist coalition are now seeking to step up negotiations with the DSS and start talks with the DS.
DSS and Radicals have claimed that Serbia would not recognise the agreement, saying it would recognise Kosovo's independence through the SAA on February 17th.
Belgrade economist Sasa Cogocic told Southeast European Times that if the Serbian Radical Party and the Socialist coalition, foreign investors will be cautious to how Belgrade sees its relations with the EU.
However, Cogovic said, if the DS and Socialists are power, "there are" investors "for their policies and" to stop their future since 2000.
Economist Jurij Bajec said Serbia needs a government to provide a direct foreign investment to ensure a 7% GDP growth in the coming period ".
"It is necessary to provide 2 billion-euro tax loans that have foreign direct investment and long-term term process, which has a price of 2 billion euros per year," Bajec said.
The economic initiative could only be achieved with a pro-European government, which "the EU's economic partner", the economist added.
"The pro-European government will implement European standards is not only from Europe, but also to ensure security and stability for investors from the world, including Russia, China and India," Bajec said.
Some, however, discussed different meetings.
Economist Jusan Dusanic said foreign interests have invested in Serbia through more privatisation deals, and that they have already invested in this way.
A special data published by Dusanic, Dusanic told the Belgrade daily Policy that major assets such as the new government would not be able to attract investments, such as the sale of oil industry and electricity company.
Economist Russia and Chinese Chinese Chinese, says it is important that the country has offered conditions such as the ruling or the international aspect of the country's international aspect.

In Brussels late last month, the talks between Belgrade and the EU signed a telecommunications agreement that allows Serbia to remove its exports to the EU, allowing Serbia to reduce exports level of 1191m euros last year.
The deal will enter effect on 1 July.
According to Serbian Economic Relations Minister Milan Parivodic, the agreement has great political importance.
"We see a positive trend in Serbia's political and economic development.
This should be better and more stability in Serbia, "he said.
The agreement signed by Serbia's independent, approved by the EU last year and Brussels's two constituent republics are the first bridge to Serbia-Montenegro, which is approved by the EU last year and to monitor economic development routes.
According to Vojvodic, Serbia's textile industry represents about 7 per cent of the republic's GDP, while 70 per cent of Serbian textile products are exposed to EU countries.
The EU has already been implemented in various areas of technical products from Serbia, but only 25 per cent of the goods exported from this regime.
Under the new agreement, 75 per cent of the remaining customs obstacles could be exposed to the EU.
"This is a good message and a third interior message of this market.
We will not be able to compete in the textile products, manufacturing products, Pakistan, India, India or China, but we can't be competitive in the extile sector.
At this point, I see a chance of the agreement that I hope that we will be able to have our textile industry. "
With co-operation with the EU, Serbia's textile industry could reach <unk> 1 billion in exports and third individuals at the level of exports and third individuals.
To successfully, Serbian textile producers must find serious partners and continue to continue former business relations.
How it will be used to be used to be used in the best way to the deal, and every factory is unable to have its own administration.
Many economists believe that Serbia has the potential to attract important foreign investors in the text sector, given the lower salaries from the Western Europe are lower than Central and Eastern Europe.
At the same time, workers in the textile sector are expected to increase living standards.
Around 100,000 people are working in Serbia's textile industry, which means that about 300,000 people can be able to get the sector.

KFOR's responsibility for the Kosovo Protection Corps [EUT] and is determined to ensure a safe and secure environment of Kosovo, as well as to ensure freedom of movement, as well as to the UN Security Council Resolution 1244.
We don't don't don't think there are political issues, and we don't do in this issue, and we do not do so.
SETimes: Do you think Belgrade has no threat to general security
Blers: Parallel structures are a political issue.
KFOR has to ensure stable security requirements that political problems could be resolved by stock and resolved by stock security conditions.
Any tragic structures are valuable. [or]
The cost could lead to consequences, and even the effects of both structures.
For example, there is no single judicial system, but no legal security or interpretation.
In addition, "parallel structures" may be a threat to political will, as well as a safety and secure environment, so that KFOR is not imposed by KFOR.
Therefore, KFOR is in the areas where parallel structures operate in the areas of parallel structures operating in order to react any threat to security and security environment.
KFOR has been closely closely with all international and local stock stock and support them as part of their mandate as part of their mandate.
If people in Kosovo are a threat to security and police climate, KFOR will be ready to take action against this threat.
SETimes: How do you control the border in the north
Blers: KFOR has a very good technical co-operation with neighbouring countries, including neighbouring countries, Albania, Montenegro, Montenegro, as well as on the administrative border crossings.
We can hold a technical meeting with Serbia.
We are controversial with KFOR and the KP [KFOR and the KP] and the Serb Forces (KFOR).
Most people and goods are the mandate of the police, and that KFOR does not be interested.
The players on how to fulfil these duties will be made during the administrative framework.
KFOR will only be intervened when the people of Kosovo entered security.
SETimes: Most of Kosovo citizens are more confident than any local institutions.
You are soldiers from countries that have not recognised Kosovo as state.
Do you think this problem
Blers: [Tanula] does not affect the position of KFOR or the mission's position on Kosovo's status.
If the local population is on the ground, I believe that KFOR's remarks as a safe Alliance's remarks only as a patient unit.
KFOR troops have always been always linked to the music position.
SETimes: Kosovo has made it clear that its bid for Euro-Atlantic integration.
How do you see the possibility of Kosovo's integration into Euro-Atlantic structures
Blers: The KFOR has not played a role in resolving the status issue.
The organisation is dealing to avoid any debate on political issues.
SETimes: How do you see the chance of Kosovo as general
Blers: I am very optimistic.
In the past decade, many things have been achieved in security areas.
This is a condition for further progress in other areas, especially in the economy and political development.
KFOR continues to ensure its support for the remaining issues, making it clear time for a peaceful solution.
EU member states show little progress on training targets
Blogger members could arrest only one of the five targets to meet the EU's education area by 2010.
The progress towards other four targets, the European Commission said in a recent report.

EU member states need to make further efforts to arrest five training targets over the next three years, according to the European Commission (EC) report released in November.
Voicing that the other goals were reached only one, Brussels said other goals continue to be a serious issue for education and education systems in Europe.
At a meeting in Lisbon in March 2000, EU leaders agreed to agree on "the bloc's target of competitiveness and dynamic economy" in order to bring the world's information on information.
As part of this goal, joint goals were made in 2002 to improve education and education systems in Europe.
The five targets include reduced by 10 per cent to 10 per cent to 10 per cent, reduced by at least 20 per cent, reduced by at least 20 per cent of young people.
The other two targets are to increase at least 15 per cent of the number of teachers in Matemal, Fest and Technology (MFT), and to reduce the climate of genocide discipline of genocide discipline.
The EC's annual progress report on the Lisbon training goals in 2005, says the Union's target for only MFT above.
"If the current situation continues, the number of patients in the EU's 2010 intellectual, cheaper, cheaper, cheaper and technology in technology will be removed to 850,000 students per year," the EC report said.
Of the best performance of the number of MFT papers in the 20-29 paper group, Ireland (24.5), France (22.5) and Litvania (18.9), while Slovenia, Portugal and Italy were the most powerful growth rates among 70 per cent.
However, the report said, there has been little progress on the reduction of genocide distribution of genocide distribution between the MFT insurance and an increase of 30.4 per cent in 2000 by 2005.
Estonia, Bulgaria, Greece, Greece and Romania are the best performance in terms of the genocide distribution of more than 40 per cent of the MFT salaries.
The country is the highest in 2005, with 46.9 per cent of the year.
According to the report, gender equality is not equality. [EU]
However, the EC says the "major part of the society will face the risks of the society," the situation will face the risks of abroad, and that would lead to serious negative consequences for both the economy and the society. "
Since 2000, the number of students who have been living in schools have been provided by 2.3 per cent.
However, the situation has been more than 15.3 per cent of the 15.3 per cent EU average in 2006, and the situation showed that more efforts must be made to ensure that it would not be able to cover 10 per cent of the students from the end of 2010.
"Europe's goal is to encourage young people to get education after the difficult education process, or at least one of the most difficult training process.
This summer, the success of education is seen as a precondition for the image of participation in the economy. "
Slovenia (5.2 per cent), the Czech Republic (5.5 per cent), Poland (5.6 per cent), Finland (8.4 per cent), Finland (8.6 per cent), Austria (8.6 per cent), Austria (8.6 per cent), Austria (5.6 per cent), or the EU member states that have been able to join the EU in 2006.?
Malta and Portugal were the worst performance of the bloc's worst performance in terms of 41.7 per cent and 39.2 per cent.
No progress has been made in improving students' literature.
The price of successful students increased by 19.4 per cent in 2000 to 19.8 per cent in 2003.
This shows that most EU countries should lead to more way to ensure that a 15.5 per cent division of the group by 2010. According to statistical statistics, the statistics in 2003 should be the best performance of the bloc's best performance in the bloc's statistics (5.7 per cent).
"The winning of the basic capabilities is the first step towards participating in the information community.
However, a 15-year-old student in the EU enlargement shows that 1 million students are lower in terms of schools. "
The number of MFT salaries increased by 25 per cent in 2000. [Getty Images]
According to the EC report, there has been enough progress in order to complete the training of at least 85 per cent of those who are 22 in the EU enlargement groups by 2010.
"In the enlargement of the EU young people, 80 per cent of the opportunity to complete education, and that rate has been increased since 2000," the commission said.
Over 90, or 90, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia are the best performance of the bloc's best performance, while the most worst performance, Portugal, Malta and Spain.
In 2002, EU countries agreed to be part of the population's education process by 2010, 12.5 per cent of the population's population in the age of 25-64, and said it was very important for the Union's competitiveness and economic prosperity with the people's society.
Danish, Britain and Finland are among other member states in terms of this goal.
In these countries last year, participants in education and education and teaching process were 29.6 per cent and 23.6 per cent and 23.1 per cent.
Bulgaria and Romania are 1.3 per cent and Romania, with 1.9 per cent of these countries' worst performance, while 1.9 per cent of these countries were among Greece.
"The highest quality of education and education in order to offer Europe's highest quality for competitiveness in the global economy.
Unfortunately, the report shows that the EU member states must make further efforts to meet the requirements of the 21st century and education system.
"The message of the countries' policy structures is clear: we need to invest more effective in the capital capital," he said.

This presence is still discussing, but the decision is still responsible for the BiH Security Council.
The Council will approve a decision to recognise Kosovo's final status. "

A senior US diplomat said on Monday (21 November) that the 10th anniversary of the Dayton Peace Accords continue in Washington, while Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) political leaders voiced hope that the country would reach an agreement on removal of the country's constitution.
"We hope that the country's political leaders will not agree on the half of the country's agreements on the benefit of the constitutional reform process, and continues to continue in the coming months before the 2006 elections," US Secretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns said.
Earlier ten days ago, leaders of the eight main ruling and opposition parties met in Brussels to discuss changes in the constitution, part of the DBA.
They agreed on Sunday ahead of a two-day ceremony with the "Dayton", the Balkans and Euro-Atlantic Integration ", which began on Monday, and the two-day ceremony.
"Dayton has a state that has the Berlin's presence of a society, because the war is the only way to stop the war and disappointment," Burns said at a conference on the US Institute for Peace. "The only way to build the war and disappointment of the war is to be taken this year."
The country must be allowed to be allowed to integrate the integration of different people like Croats, Serbs and Muslims, normal countries, "he said.
As a result of the agreements, both political entities -- the Federation of BiH and the Republika Srpska (RS) -- have been separated.
In addition, a national parliament and the government is a tripartite presidency, including members of the three main ethnic groups.
In recent months, analysts have been strengthening their relations with the international community, calling for reforms that analysts are one of the most vulnerable political and administrative system in the world.
"Bosnia cannot remain part of a state, and no united Europe can be part of a united NATO nor one united Europe," Burns said.
The proposed constitutional changes will continue to continue the two sides, but the national parliament and government will strengthen its power and strengthening the government.
The three members will come to a single president.
US Ambassador to the DBA in 1995, Richard Holbrooke, the former US Ambassador to the DBA, urged BiH politicians to agree on constitutional reform, particularly Bosnian Serbs, particularly Bosnian Serbs.
"I don't say that we have to say that the Dayton Accords have to make progress in preventing the current circumstances," Holbrooke said. "We have to help improve Dayton.
RS must be part of a single state, which is part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and should not really difference. "
On Tuesday, about 40 other Bosnian officials and political officials, led by the tripartite presidency, will participate in a teacher at the BiH delegation, which will host other members of the tripartite presidency, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

Meanwhile, there is no visa-free "in a victory at the Opera and Bale Theatre, a symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic of communist regime.
All this is part of the EU's decision to ratify visa liberalisation for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In Albania, a country that has been experienced for decades in the management of refugee during the decades of decades.
Since the degree of the paper, many men have been sparked to other parts of Europe -- the fact that the number of papers abroad in Albania will not be abroad.
However, many things have been able to do so far.

"I will visit them and visit them.
"It's a house of house," he said.
After 20 days after the EC's decision was released, it is expected to enter into effect before the Independent Independent GDP, which marked Albania on 28 November.
Unfortunately, travel restrictions will be removed before Christmas.
But there is no good news.

It is more important than the impact on the force.
Before the war in BiH, 40 people worked in the defence industry and today's 3,000.
Many local economists have reiterated that BiH's recommendation that BiH continues to be "gold", but the industry has sparked its passports due to the two sides.

Task decision represent more recognition for Belgrade talks
Western states are preparing for a new draft resolution on the future of Kosovo and Kosovo Albanian authorities to reach an agreement on the province's final status.
(Reuters, FT - 20 / 06 / 07; AP, Reuters, DPA, UPI, RFE / RL, Beta, B92, Balkan Investigative Reporting Network - 19 / 06 / 07)
Russia will veto veto its plan, but the province is believed to win independence this year, former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari said on Monday (June 18th). [Getty Images]
UN Security Council members are likely to take part in a new draft resolution on Kosovo's future on Wednesday (June 20th), citing the way for opening new talks between Belgrade and Pristina.
The document, drafted by the United States and EU countries, reportedly will be recognised for four months to reach an agreement.
According to Reuters, UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan will be implemented if the talks did not end with the deal.
The former Finnish president has recommended that it would be granted independence under EU control, including the constitutional, flag and international organisations.
He also urged the plan to protect the rights of all minority groups living in the province, particularly Kosovo Serbs.
According to the plan, an International Civilian Representative will appoint the implementation of the deal.
This will be removed by the UN and the EU, which will have the authority of the laws and competing officials.
KFOR continues to ensure security in the province, while the EU will serve as a police mission to help the rule of law institutions "effectively, fair and representation".
Kosovo Albanians, who have adopted 90% of the province's population of 2 million people, have rejected the plan, while Serbia has rejected a sovereignty over Kosovo.
Russia, which supports Belgrade's demand for continuing talks on the province's future, has threatened to use its veto power to block any UN Security Council resolution that would not be acceptable for Serbia.
Within hope that the possibility of this possibility, Western countries have offered that Moscow's proposal to make a special envoy for changing ethnic Serbs, which will be interested in inter-ethnic Serbs.
Belgrade has shown control over the province with Kosovo's UN administration after the NATO airport movement.
Before that, Serbian forces have taken measures against ethnic Albanians who want independence.
During a visit to Athens on Tuesday, Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic reiterated Belgrade's call for continuing negotiations with Pristina, while reiterated his position on full independence.
"We need to speak on the constitution and we are ready to reach an agreement.
"We are ready to make all the voters, because we believe that any consensus is better than a compromise solution, based on how everything is possible," he said. "Our position is better than our country and territorial integrity."
However, the new talks between the Serbian and Kosovo Albanian leaders are suspected that Ahtisaari will be more efficient in the structures last year.
The talks ended in early 14 months of this year without a significant change in the two sides' positions.
The Kosovo administration, who also praised the province's status issue, said he opposes any new talks with Belgrade.
"The removal of the Ahtisaari package is unacceptable," Belgrade-based Beta news agency quoted the spokesman for the negotiating team, Orender Hyseni as saying in a statement Tuesday. "Kosovo status can be able to make alternative ways.
That would be the countries that have blocked the process in the Security Council, "he said.
Meanwhile, Ahtisaari said on Tuesday that Russia expects the decision to block a Council resolution based on its own plan.
However, he said, Kosovo will likely be able to declare independence by the end of this year.
Finnish television told the Finnish television that Kosovo can be a solution with EU and US support if Moscow's veto.

The document includes various activities in the region, such as fisheries, fisheries, monitoring and monitoring.
After years of negotiations, the deal took place in a major time for both countries.
Moldova, who joined the Soviet Union in 1940, is expected to be a part of Romania's Soviet Union in 1991 and then declared independence in 1991.
Moldova was the only neighbouring country to sign the agreement.
Romania is also hoping to join 25 European countries in the Schengen area, which will be limited by Moldova.
"We have signed this agreement," Baconschi said in a joint statement after some environmental agencies in Moldova signed the meeting "on Romania's name agenda".

EU Talks to Co-operation with Co-operation Talks
[The EU] EU [Bulgaria and Romania's demands for demanding demands that would be killed for the Union to join the Union.
By Daniel Daianu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest - 21 / 04 / 03
At the latest EU meeting in Copenhagen, Bulgaria and Romania were given demands for the necessary reforms needed for joining the EU.
The Talats have been detailed, but many questions are leaving.
"A series of EU normalisation and rules (a series of EU rules) is only a technical initiative, which covers the reflection of national laws.
If more details are detailed, the real functioning of local institutions, social and economic performance.
Therefore, the European Commission reflects reforms in public administration, public administration and legal areas and fighting corruption.
The reforms that the EU wants to be held, together with a liberal democracy, are more optimistic demands that the need for the benefit of a "patient market".
That is why the EU is the product of an organisation, organising and transfer structure.
These are particularly the priority -- national conditions, institutional and functioning.
The Union has to implement a series of institutional warnings, which will not be demanded in a different situation.
Despite the current economic differences, the EU faces prosperity economies and society.
Therefore, Bulgaria and Romania are facing a major obstacle, which will not be removed.
In Bulgaria and Romania, the EU average of 28% are under the EU average of the EU average.
The inflation rate, interest rates, interest rates, budget deficits and tax deficit could not be easy to fulfil the criteria for the rates of Maastricht criteria, which may block economic growth.
Even the pre-accession period, the autonomy of economic policy could be limited to a slowly border, and a Azerbaijan economic policy could be reduced in significant death.
The "economic policy" is a matter that should be on the ground "of the first expansion in 2004, when the first enlargement of the first expansion will be revised.
The enlargement of the EU's future participation is to enhance the Union's monitoring of economic performance and creating a common security policy in the region, as well as the creation of the EU's economic performance and establishing a common security policy in the region, as well as a "creation of different issues" with the management of the coalition.
It is important that Acis is to make it clear that "The idea is to bring the goods that will provide specific benefits and reduction of certain benefits.
Even more, this is not easy to recognise these goods and the plan, and this could create a confidence in terms of state officials if they are expected to be expected.
The participation talks will be detained in discipline.
To join the EU, reforms will be more complex and secure.
He is true to me, but relations with the EU seems more rich with international financial institutions.
The EU could serve as an optimism in order to overcome development and modernisation.
Since the benefits of institutional reforms, financing could create great differences.
The EU will provide "preserving" economic "if unfortunately, unfortunately and preservations in the world.
However, many issues have been in a number of issues:
There are no political problems that are not resolved, and these options should be able to convince the best circumstances of the current situation, the current situation, conditions and the forces.
The policy will be dealing with a low inflation economy (low inflation), ensuring a lower inflation, ensuring the public rival control of the workforce, ensuring the entire budget borders, but also to ensure the implementation of the budget borders.
For example, the markets must be held in accordance.
The policy must block the acceleration decisions, because these decisions are being taken, "prestigious" voting ", and if they do not find the truth of their truth.
This is an example of the capital's capital.
The national industry's woman is linked to how local sectors enter the main industrial networks in Europe.
State officials may play a role in this issue, such as tax revenues and better business conditions for investing in the industry.
It does not mean to continue to support the heavy losses and reduce successful companies' commitment.
Many improvements must be done.
For this, the EU and other experts -- especially from the European Investment Bank -- have a very important role in financial assistance.
The refugee documents in Portugal, Spain and Greece showed that nor a major development of EU aid could be used.
The state budget would have to leave more funding for education and health services.
This issue will seek more climate in the coming years.
As for his structure, it will give a better functioning economy and tax protocol, the main progress is impossible.
The agriculture sector, which is the largest and active population of the GDP, will be one of the issues that are likely to create a lot of problem in accession talks.
In the EU, eight times, the legal sovereignty must not be defined.
The economic problem can be more difficult through consultation of agriculture, which is the basic basic areas that have to find business in the broad city.
This could revive the problem of "rural influence" in the car, if other sectors do not provide adequate insufficient employment.
When the model in Europe's model and increasing asylum seekers to work abroad, the business force could be an opportunity to prevent a major social crisis or prevent Roma (free differences).
These two countries should be excluded from a transformation of Latin American transformation.
In the near future, a "Caspian regime" could be a "good".
The citizens who work abroad to the EU have sent to the job economy abroad are important, and that private transportation is creating a security network.
Belgrade Airport: Serbia's Cold
With the construction of Belgrade's airport, the Serbian capital aims to bring a regional traffic centre.
By Dusan Kosanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 07 / 10 / 03
Most of the facilities built 27 years ago, equipment and facilities are model.

The questions about the Airport are unable, but the issue of the facility will be the question.
Some propose that the prime minister, Zoran Djindjic, who lost the assassination of Serbia's assassination.
In addition to the name of the New York airport, the prime minister's most complicated efforts to open Serbia's Cold are the prime minister's largest efforts to open the world.
Experts Approve EU Integration with Western Balkans
Some experts say the EU needs to develop strategic developments for the Western Balkans.
(EUobserver.com - 19 / 03 / 03; European Stabilisation Rights)
Officials in Southeast Europe have called on the EU to develop the Union's approach on the Western Balkans -- to improve the impact of the Union's aid to this region.
Experts from a debate last month at the European Parliament's Foreign Relations Committee, said the EU has indicated that it is necessary to show more determined to ensure the necessary support for the Western Balkan countries to really really realise their prospects.
The forum was held in May to draw the Stabilisation Pact Conference, which will be held at the European Council meeting in Thessaloniki.
The Western Balkan countries will be invited to join the EU as a strategic summit and "strategic summit", under the Greek forum.
Albania, Macedonia and Croatia signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (IOA) with the EU.
Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia-Montenegro have already signed.
Croatia applied for EU membership in February. The application was held in early 2007 to join the Union with Bulgaria and Romania.
Albania and Macedonia are planning plans to monitor Croatia's road this year.
Vladimir Gordorov, the Institute for Economic Studies in Vienna International Economic Studies, says the IOA approach is very slowly slowly and that the Union does not show the right to support people in the region.
Gordorov is approaching the EU's readiness to ensure that it is determined to provide support for the region.
In a speech to members of the Western Balkans, the Western Balkans is not the two basic threats today, European Parliament (ESD) President Gerald Kaus said in a speech to members of the European Parliament.
Within the region, the EU could help overcome social and economic issues, he said, the Western Balkan countries' commitment to combat the reform process and to continue its commitment to combat the fight against organised crime and organisations.
Kaul also suggested the Union's joint action with these countries to develop its own unilateral intelligence telecommunications.
A new report by the AED said the summit will be held in Thessaloniki for the successful success.
One of them would mean the concrete agreements in the Western Balkans as a concrete EU bid, which means more funding resources and more interested in the region.
A serious decision to ensure unify union in the Western Balkans has been cited by major financial resources, much of the new financial resources, the report said.
The second death was said to have been determined to show the implementation of the union's details from politics.
According to the same document, the third death would be determined to be determined to determine the airport between candidate countries such as Romania and Bulgaria -- such as Romania, Romania and Bulgaria -- to be more growth.
The AMED report said it was planned for the Western Balkans in 2006, and proposed that only 500m euros of GDP in one of the region are equal equal, while it is not low to Bulgaria and Romania.
Kurdish problem
Turkey, which opened the victory between the state and Kurdish movements, came to a critical period on "Kurdish problem".
By Anna Wood for Southeast European Times in Istanbul -- 08 / 08 / 11

BDP, which supported the Kurdish population, has managed to pay 36 lawmakers in June's general elections.
Although an independent candidates supported by the BDP have been really created in the beginning of the election, the situation was sparked after the election cancer of the lawmakers, Hatip Dicle.
In response to the bill, a part of the party's lawmakers, boycotting the decision, boycotting a number of MPs.
The situation has been worried since the beginning of the beginning, saying that the situation is very concerned about the situation.
Barkey described Dicle's blocking parliament as "a step forward" that the AKP's support with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and AKP's Kurdish Progress ".
Benzer developments have come to the country's largest opposition party in the position of the Republic of People (CHP), but the party's boycott process ended with the AKP.
However, the BDP seems to be able to resolve candidates as soon as possible.
Talks between state and party representatives have not been able to end any outcome.
Some observers have been criticised by some observers, such as the National Strategic Research Institute, which believes the BDP's parliamentary boycott.
"The BDP has another alternative alternative to make the change process, which has more optimistic in the political areas and the political area," Natasa told SETimes.
According to Natasa, the party could "make progress in the negotiations and show serious concern about the Turkish state of change," the party said, citing the candidates of prison sentence.
Democracy autonomy
Two incidents took place in mid-July, the tension of tensions in the country.
The murder of the incidents was attacked by the PKK's central political activities in Turkey, where 13 soldiers were killed by the PKK in Darir.
Turkish soldiers sparked the outcome of PKK attacks, increasing Turkish nationalism in the country and deepening the division of the division between Turks and Turks. [Reuters]
This development has increased the rise of Turkish national power and increased the price for Kurdish people and BDP.
The second phase could be described as a return point for the development of the nationalist Kurdish movement.
The Democratic Society Congress (DTK) announced plans to declare a "democratic autonomy" for Kurds in Turkey today.
"This problem can only be resolved with the recognition of Kurds as recognition of the Kurds and a equal level of equal status.
The Kurdish people are threatening to continue the presence of the status, but they don't want to live in the status quo, "he said.
"The problem is important, not only the problem to end violence and violence.
At the same time, a democratic society will provide the management of management. "
Tuncel also praised DTK's statements: other boys
"There are two residents of democratic autonomy.
It is the first process that we can be accomplished as a peace project and that the Kurdish problem is resolved to resolve democratic and peacekeeping ways. "
"All identity, cultural and religious identity in Turkey is a demanding project to allow the freedom of culture and identity," he said.
The reality of democratic autonomy "has been a threat to a new era in the Kurdish politics, though some" described as a threat to the territorial integrity of the Turkish state as "a threat to territorial integrity".
The BDP, DTK, CTK, CEC, PKK and prison leader Abdullah Gul, revealed different organisations and partners, but also revealed the nationalist Kurdish movement, development, development, development and demanding.
The state, media and public are preserving concerns about links between the groups, because the BDP is a specialised permanent of the PKK as a permanent of the PKK.
According to Natalia, the BDP wants to have a public agenda, if people want to have their own agenda.
"To make more progress in the political scene, the BDP or donors should not be a threat to the Turkish state's demands, assets and Kurds' demands of the Turkish state and stability.
However, they do not do fully. "
A free zone could be implemented in Turkey
DTK's statement reflects the question: how is the full system based on democratic autonomy in Turkey, and how is it possible to implement the current political environment
The division of free divisions between the clashes or minority groups may be an effective solution in some places.
Spain, which has been spent for the establishment of free divisions in the 1978 constitution, says Spain, is a very optimistic country that has been seen as one of the successful examples of success.
Both are hosting their connections with the federal government with the federal government, which has been recognised by the state's history, free parliament and courts, as well as the federal government consultations, which was approved by the president.
The death of PKK deaths reflects Kurdish nationalism. [Reuters]
Canada could be an example for countries to combat autonomy demands, particularly in the province.
Although discussions on the free level of autonomy is still under way, it is not a peaceful solution within the political process.
However, as optimistic opposes against free autonomy in Turkey, Turkey and the Middle East are very different than the reality of the diaspora and cultural reality, Spain and Canada.
One of the key factors based on the political autonomy is that the Turkish state needs to be in the long time: there is a fact that the country's local government has been facing.
The centre, the state owns many local policies, which has a system of effective and most influence.
In a country where the Kurdish language was passed by the early 1990s, it may be unprecedented in some places -- a free diversification of diversification -- even though the idea of the idea has been restricted.
Juha Rabika, a professor at the Turkish-run University in Finland, says the public should be tolerated because such solutions must be implemented.
"The basic condition is to see a solution.
Canadians acknowledge that Quem is autonomy.
Finnish dialogue agree that the German and his name is free.
Therefore, regional autonomy is injured. "
The KB, a founder of political writer and India Committee, has suspected Turkey's readiness to be ready for such autonomy.
"If the Kurdish speaks to the Kurdish speaks as a threat to the state's territorial integrity
Following the reserves, Kurds must be recognised as constitutional recognition and guarantee the rights of judges. "
According to Natasa, the situation is not ready but also in the state level.
"Turkish officials, institutions, institutions and political parties are linked to the state's unity and stability," Natasa said. "The idea of the free Kurdistan Workers, security, security, security and unity in Iraq".
According to Natasa, the only unilateral decisions such as the DTK have no chance to pay change in Turkey.
"All changes to the structure of the Turkish state and institutions, including the transfer of the Turkish state and institutions, have to be done within the framework of constitutional and administrative reforms," he said.
In addition, the possible consensus between the AKP and the possible consensus of nationalist reconciliation between the pro-Kurdish Kurdish population, which has been injured to vote.
"We are here, the constitution is constitution.
However, Turkey needs a new constitution.
If Ankara don't do something else, all consequences have been reduced. "
Meanwhile, the solution is the chance of constructive co-operation, constructive co-operation.
"It is difficult to make problems.
People're not expected to avoid the truth: the most important developments are in the province's case of conflict, even if they are not expected. "

The Macedonian government is preparing a new law to change the District Canadian Community and the Group Canadian Canadian.
However, debate over the proposals that the European Commission's call for the registration process has been released.
The current law recognises a single community for people.
The Macedonian Orthodox Church (MOK) is recognised as a representative of the Orthodox Church (MOK), while the Islamic Church represents the Muslim test.
The MOK, the IC and the Roman Catholic Catholic Church, has also indicated that the current system will continue to ensure more than one test.
Members of this idea say the liberalisation of liberalisation would increase diversification as potential to elect more freedom to elect their own test.

Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat announced its decision to remove a sustainable administration in the Turkish side last year, the Ledras Street, one of the most important symbols of the island's 32 annual division of the island.
According to Greek Cypriots, it was built in a bid to boost Turkish military republics in the region.
Talat's plans to remove Talat's structure was criticised by the chief of Turkey's chief of General Yasar Algang.
"The opening of the Ledras Street is not a problem for us, but these steps are necessary," the AFP quoted him as saying at a meeting in Ankara on Sunday.
Despite Ankara's opposing, Talat said the decision by Greek Cypriot authorities is still under way to restructuring the Ledras Street's restructuring.
"Our goal is to be opened," senior Turkish Cypriot interior official Ozkan Murat said on Tuesday. "We are doing everything to be done as Turkish Cypriots."
Other conditions for the restructuring of the Greek Cypriots' Ledras Stream are among the conditions for the restructuring of Turkish troops, restoration and restoration of the neighbouring buildings.
"The aim to open the Ledras Stream is a safe move and a mutual trust environment between the two communities," Cypriot government spokesman Kristodulos Pashiardis said on Tuesday.
The Turkish Cypriots, who hoped to open the way to open the UN peacekeeping talks with the Greek Cypriot part, has been described as a good police indication.
However, Pasidis said on Tuesday that the removal of the high-level administration would not be a withdrawal or recommendation to the Turkish Cypriots.
"It should be removed by the recommendations that will be removed as a consensus of such law, if we have to be removed," the Cyprus News Agency quoted the leader as saying.
A consortium on the Greek Cypriot authorities' plans to remove the removal of the National Convention in Ledras Street, Pasidis said that the government is ready to discuss discussions with the UN Peace Force on the main island.

The European Commission (EC) has announced a series of proposals for the reunification of the island's Turkish Cypriots to reunify international efforts to reunify the island's north, as well as 259m euros.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen said the EU continues to unite Cyprus's Turkish and Greek Cypriots.
"We use the aim to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community and use different vehicles," Verheugen said.
The Greek Cypriots rejected the plan for a reunification plan for the UN sports issue on 24 April.
As a result of the votes, only the Greek Cypriot part joined the EU on 1 May.
"With the best possible possible, the Turkish Cypriots were unacceptable," Verheugen said.
The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (KTC), which is recognised only by Turkey, has been living in international embargo and sanctions since 1974.
Currently, Turkish Cypriot products are exported abroad under the KTC.
However, the new proposals will be allowed to free trade with Northern Cyprus, particularly food products.
Verheugen cited infrastructure projects between potential projects, the ministers' quality facilities and the long-term term -- tourism initiatives, agriculture initiatives, agriculture support and electricity telecommunications.
The EU intends to support joint projects that will include both Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot authorities, the commissioner said.
Among the proposals that will go into effect after the Council of Europe's meeting in September, the trade was held under the event of the two communities in the island.
The EC's move is a key political church for Turkish Cypriots, while Verheugen stressed that the proposed proposals do not mean the recognition of the KTC, or unilateral recognition of the Turkish Cypriots.
"We don't be interested in the most probably interested in the Mediterranean state," Verheugen said.
Nevertheless, Greece and Greek Cypriots have also met with concern.
Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman George Kumumsakos described the EU's "negative point" in economic issues with the KTC.
Meanwhile, Greek Cypriot Foreign Minister George Yakakovaku said the package is based on laws that are based on pro-political census and concrete representation.
The Greek Cypriot side has reiterated free trade convicts.
However, the Greek Cypriots are not expected to reflect a 259m-euro grant to the European Council's vote.
Del Ponte Approves List War Crimes War Crimes War Crimes
UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte reiterated that the war crimes tribunal's wartime leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic will not close their doors to the arrest of Bosnian Serb wartime leaders Radovan Karadzic and Croatian Ante Gotovina.
(Reuters, AP, AFP, BBC, HINA - 12 / 09 / 03)
Carla del Ponte, who began the four-year term at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), said the priorities are part of the list of all fugitives to surrender.

All activities with this programme can be completed by 2010.
However, del Ponte warned that the completion strategy could jeopardise the successful efforts to arrest indictees.
Mladic and Karadzic have been charged with genocide due to the alleged role in atrocities committed during the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including the Srebrenica massacre.
Del Ponte, who said Mladic is still in Serbia, has called for authorities to arrest him.
Karadzic is believed to be hiding in Republika Srpska, the entity in BiH's Serbian administration.
Gotovina, who has been registered since 2001, has been charged with atrocities committed against Serb civilians during a 1995 attack.
Del Ponte claims that Croatian authorities know that the generals are in place.
"The Croatian government and the Croatian government know that General Ante Gotovina is in the case," del Ponte said.
The tribunal will continue to help the international community to help justice, he said, adding that those people are not in the courts and are not in the judiciary.
"I will not take the possibility of this possibility.
Karadzic, Mladic and Gotovina will be arrested by the end of the year and will be transferred to the tribunal.
"The court will not close the doors to stop Karadzic, Mladic and Gotovina," he said.
Croatian Prime Minister Ivica Racan said on Friday that his government had "no representation with General Gotovina".
"Croatian services know that he was in Croatia and that the fugitive would be arrested so far," he said.
Racan urged him to surrender to the tribunal to surrender, saying he would be good for both the country.
In a statement, Croatian President Stipe Mesic called on Croatian President Stipe Mesic to surrender Gotovina to define his own and Croatia's future.

During a meeting in Paris earlier this month with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's President Nicolas Sarkozy in Paris, France's President Nicolas Sarkozy has sparked optimistic that France's stance towards Turkey's EU accession.
Erdogan met with Sarkozy on 8 April.
The French president's strong opposition to Ankara has created a process.
Turkey has the largest infrastructure in Europe with 6444.8 billion euros in the year and has made its growth of 64.5% over the past five years.
This figure is not only high than all other candidates, but also a lower level for many EU member states.
Iran's nuclear crisis, the security situation in Afghanistan and the increased stability in Iraq, the security situation in Afghanistan and improved stability.
Nevertheless, the role of the country's rock platform is not allowed.
Sarkozy argues that "Europe's borders" and that "all countries have to have to be a European member".
The French president insists that Turkey is not in place within these borders.
This was the official position from Sarkozy to power in 2007.
However, Erdogan's recent visit -- Sarkozy's visit to Ankara -- could encourage a change in Turkey's leaving.
"The most important outcome of Erdogan's visit is that Sarkozy's invitation to visit Turkey this year," Dr. Cengiz Acar, a University of Istanbul, told SETimes.
"Sarkozy has changed the idea of all foreign policy issues abroad from Turkey since the presidential mandate," he said. "But in the past period, the French business sector has been under pressure on all competitiveness in the Turkish market.
Sarkozy's whereabouts that Sarkozy's strong opposition to Turkey is now in the way to bring the way to Turkey. "
Erdogan said bilateral relations, including the French president and military relations, discussed the possibility of co-operation in resolving regional and global problems.
"I hope that Sarkozy will assume Sarkozy in Turkey this year and will discuss our steps towards the future," he said.
Turkey and France have similar talks on NATO allies and many foreign policy issues.
Nevertheless, the last French official visit to Turkey was in 1992 by former President Frankois Mitored and Mitored.
Sarkozy's predecessor, President Jacques Chirac, was seen as a friend.
Chirac's support, Turkey began talks with the EU in 2004.
However, Sarkozy blocked the opening of Turkey's membership talks with full membership, which has blocked the opening of 335 chapters.
Ankara's efforts to resolve the Cyprus issue has been a fundamental challenge from France.
He says the option against Turkey's membership is not France, but "Sarkozy" is France.
"Sarkozy aims to take the support of voters who fear Islam only to Islamic," Sarkozy said. "Sarkozy has lost to Turkey against Turkey, which has lost its 2012 elections."
UK members, such as Italy, Italy and some northern European countries, emphasised that Turkey's full EU membership, emphasising the country's eastern strategic importance to the Islamic world as a bridge.
Germany has offered a "yield partnership" partnership ", which is unacceptable to Turkey.
One of the most powerful support for Turkey's EU accession is Spain, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency.
Spain's state minister for European workers, Diego Lopez, said recently that the chapters on education and food security would likely be opened by the end of the year.

The European Commission (EC) passed two new regulations on Wednesday (November 23rd) to strengthen its authority over the country's national budget and strengthen its control over members facing serious financial problems.
The regulations are part of a three-option package, which aims to resolve the crisis in the Eurozone, aimed at resolving the EU's economic priorities and defining a "Stabilisation Treaty" with a joint annual growth of 2012.

The second legal measures will allow the EC to replace the Eurozone countries in the region to replace sustainable rescue programmes with the European Stabilisation Fund, or to other countries in the region, or to the level of sustainable rescue programmes with the IMF.
Earlier this year, the idea of the idea of a common bailout for crisis physical physical physical physical physical physical physical.
The EC submitted talks with a 38-page Framework Framework on Wednesday with a 38-page Framework Framework, which has offered to replace the national prevention of national prevention, which has been offered by the 17-nation Stability Tahornik.
The decision is expected to participate and following a broad resignation that ended on 8 January.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who opposes the military idea, reiterated his position on Wednesday.
Merkel also urges the European Central Bank (ECB) to expand its role in efforts to deal with the debt crisis.
"It is very difficult that the commission has already offered a variety of bonds to propose a variety of euros," the German parliament quoted him as saying.
In a clear increase in the same day, Germany could sell ten years in annual estimates of 3.9 billion euros in the market.
This weapons sparked concerns that Europe is unlikely to prevent the possibility of preventing its weapons from the crisis.

It was successful. "

"We are here to believe that the new debt will help resolve the problems that have been achieved at a sustainable level."
Other experts and analysts believe the bills will be an important factor to resolve the debt crisis in the Eurozone, but stressed that the measures are needed.
"It is a manipulation about the global debt crisis, so we are convinced for both countries (banks) and banks)," Daniel Group, director of the Centre for European Policy Studies, told SETimes. "We can only flexible the Lynastle crisis.
However, the ECB can do so with more financial integration and the euro.
Therefore, the euro estimates may be one of the basic elements of any crisis. "
Former Romanian Finance Minister Daniel Daianu voiced doubt that the Eurozone could not stop a speed move to revive the common policy, restructuring the common policy and not take a step towards deeper financial integration.
"The rules are needed, as well as sanctions.
But the financial rules can't keep the reality of a secular financial arrangement that needs to be operational, "he said." It is not enough that there will be no materials in the rules and penalties.
In particular, there are a common currency in the Eurozone to stay in order to stay in life, "he said.
The policy should ensure a "common regulation and fiscal assets", as well as a deeper fiscal integration ", Daianu said, pointing to the need for a" common treasure "that would be covered by common rules.
According to Daianu, more deeper political integration would be needed for all these.
"A currency union is unable to function without a common regulation and fiscal regulations (share), including adequate arrangement and financing markets," he said. "The findings are a bad step in this issue."
EU leaders are expected to discuss package at the summit on 9 December.

SETimes: However, there is no attitude
We don't have a realistic law, because we are not able to submit more measures to attract more funds, because we risk such incidents.
Public sales have been problems with the European Commission's system.
Therefore, this system has changed.
SETimes: How are the main measures for buying the sale system, and what are the main measures are being taken
Orban: Both tenders continue to take measures, particularly the changes in the system.
The second is in charge of two state structures responsible for public sales in the management of EU funds.
That means that the two institutions will be responsible for responsible.
So far, no one has been responsible for their decisions.
They participated in the system and operations, and they need to ensure that they will be able to bring these institutions to be responsible.
To make these changes, we had a risk of suspension of the suspension of EU funds for the first half of this year, in a move that could block the EU funds for six months.
Therefore, we are the main priority for reform in the public sale system.
SETimes: What are your main targets for you
To benefit from EU funds, I have made it clear that at least 20% of the use rate by 2013.
That means that 3.1 billion euros will be reduced by the end of 2012.
This figure is worth 716m euros to be spent so far.
SETimes: Some environmentalists argue that countries should be able to get less than the 2014-2020-2020-2020-2020-2020-2020-2020 budget.
Orban: The member states that want to reduce their shares in the EU budget are used by internet contributions.
How is Romania and other countries that have been reduced so far, and how much money for money
We will have to submit the force against two contracts.
The first priority is to improve the situation and improve the situation, which we need to improve the situation and improve the situation.
The EU's interest in reducing differences among the lower developments.
No one is not EU progress.
SETimes: Do you think Romania could be based on the economic crisis more than the EU
Orban: You
I am in Poland, which protects the highest level of EU funds.
It has acknowledged that it is high that economic growth is expected.
And it has not only invested in infrastructure, but invested in projects that have created economic growth.
Tabibic is essential for a country such as Romania.
This is essential.
In parallel, we need to invest in the areas of development in most infrastructure.
SETimes: Roma are very complex and bureaucracy for EU funds.
Do you think the procedures and the project is the world
Orban: It was not easy to attract these funds.
We have to deal with many challenges, which is to be removed with procedures and removed.
In this area, however, I don't think that there is no need for improvement, improving improvement and speed transportation.
The procedures that the European directors need to be complex.
However, we have made more complicated than the need for these procedures.
One of the priorities' priorities is to be distributed to the media and we are finalised.
We are in a variety, because we have to be more efficient and more efficient.
The first condition is to implement a better fiscal management.
Therefore, we will not be able to be more media than the situation's whereabouts to jeopardise the financial management.
SETimes: A debate on Romania's new administrative board is under way.
One of these measures' operations in the action would provide better benefit from EU funds.
Orban: The medicine approach of a system approaching projects that have been offered with different province's issues.
In addition, even in the province, they are aware of a link between projects that have been provided.
Another major public companies could lead to a systematic approach, and could help facilitate these priorities, which could be financed with EU funds.
Due to the revenue, a cancellation project was made after a complex structure project that should be built by a new road to be built.
The examples of some different interests -- which are based on the different interests -- have more visible and options, and that the option of an agreement could be reached.
As a result, we can find the financing of projects that have not been implemented in the time, so we can find financing.
Serbia passes pre-election flexibility
The first phase of the IMF's most cautious stand-by arrangement.
However, it is not repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly: how will the parties' financing resources from the upcoming elections

The IMF delegation, led by the head of the IMF delegation in Central and Eastern Europe this month, was part of the first unit's precautionary stand-by arrangement under the precondition stand-by arrangement of 1.2 billion euros.
It's so much to do so.
The agreement is under way, and Serbia's banking system is stable.
As the leader of the Central Bank of Serbia and a good exhibition between banks, inflation is under control, inflation is under control.
The IMF Convention has discovered Belgrade with the benefits that Serbia's budget deficit would reduce a low level of GDP from 4.5% to 4.5% this year.
Serbia is satisfied with the ratification of a higher deficit of 3.9% earlier in talks only three months ago.
This "approved" 25m euros means for Serbia's disappointment economy.
Therefore, Serbia's Central Bank (NBS) Deputy Director Ana Gordorijevic said that this money would be used to be used in the economy, but Serbia could attract 190m euros in December.
Serbia is currently on such a situation, according to the NBS analysts.
The inflation has been reduced since May and dropped by 8.7% in October to 8.7% in October, compared to the same period in October.
In the Central Bank, 41.5% of the planned 41.5% target for 2011 is likely to be in the first quarter of 2012.
The problem is still high, inflation rate is still linked to two cities: low electricity, gas, prices and prices of the state, natural gas, prices and main food products.
The current inflation plant is encouraged.
This trend allowed NBS to lower by 225 per cent (2.5 per cent) since the beginning of last year.
On the other hand, the industrial production does not leave many optimism.
The importance of the World market is being sparked by eight sectors because of Serbia's products, due to the demand of its products from the EU.
This year's economic growth is limited to 2%, but it is expected to drop by 1.5% next year.
Vladimir Vukcevic, the editor-in-economist, told SETimes that "imports [and that] mean imports [mean imports] mean imports [the crisis in the production area] mean imports [.
"The impressive union will be held at 1%."
The reason for more concern is US Steel's statement that US Steel will close the second explosion in Smederevo.
The first opportunity was in six months.
Serbia's largest exports, the company is responsible for about 16.5% of Serbia's total exports in the first nine months of this year.
In a country over 22% of unemployment, 5,300 workers are working on the only time.
The IMF delegation's delegation came from Belgrade to a key issue: public spending is likely to affect politicians because of the approach parliamentary elections.
The government said it plans to improve tax hikes, boost the profit of public companies and boost monitoring on public sales.
If this success, however, there will be almost impossible to continue external debt.
"The current 7.25% interest in the state's estimates are expensive than a country of 1.5% GDP growth," economist Miroslav Prokopijevic told SETimes. "Spain and Italy are expensive than the next 7.6% of EU countries -- which is more than a country of 1.1%."

The economic growth in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union warned on Wednesday (June 20th) that the governments could stop in the failure to take steps to overcome the challenges of the region's population.
"Most countries in the region will be among the most popular population in the region by 2025, the Bank said in a new report," Bank's ".
The total of the region's total population in the next decade is expected to pay almost 24m euros over the next decade.
At the same time, people in 65 will be higher than 2000.
In nine countries, including Slovenia, Croatia, Bulgaria and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), one of the population's population will be on 65 until 2025.
The two reasons for both decades and live, both reasons, have already been seen as a rise in natural gas and rise to the average rate.
Bulgaria is the second country faces the most serious reduction in Ukraine, which is expected to receive 18% over the next 20 years. In the next 20 years, Romania's population is likely to receive 24%. In 2025, Romania's population will likely be reduced by 10%.
In the region, only eight countries -- including Albania, Macedonia and Turkey -- will increase in the next 20 years.
In BiH, the rate of the population is expected to be accelerated by almost two times by 2025.
More than 65 Bulgarian lives will be great and Slovenia will be one of the world's most popular population, the report says.
To meet the rise in the local population, many Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union will have to reduce their governments to lower pensions.
Another outcome is that health cuts will have to be increased to meet those people in this group's group's hospital, hospital and false treatment.
Apart from the region, the report says, the region faces a problem with the problems of poor poor poor poor poor market economies.
"The rich and more developed countries such as France, Italy and Japan are better in terms of the challenges of life, as well as the challenges of life," World Bank Governor for Economic Economic Relations Director Arum Parery said.
According to Bank experts, the best way to preserve retirement retirement is improved in the region, especially in Albania, Romania, Serbia and Turkey.
Another proposal is to change social aid cuts.
"There is no increase in spending, but it is possible to ease the bill.
For this, the number of countries in the region must retired policies and take measures to ensure that they will be sustainable, even if the retired number of pension systems in the region are retired, "he said.
A strong manufacturing manufacturing will be a condition, if regional countries want to continue speed up the rise and living standards, the report says.
These targets could be implemented with reforms that will enhance financial markets and enhance better education and enhance a better education and enhance the liquidity of life.

Romania approved a new law on the National Integration Agency (ANI), which has been granted to control the assets of politicians and other traditions, a step towards meeting the EU's justice standards.

As a result, more than 4,000 cases were suspended.
While the disappointment is entering, Brussels urged Romania to move and to ensure the law.
"The parliament was aware of the importance of the results that the results of this report would lead to the political security of the public, as well as the importance of Romania's interests of foreign consequences," Georgescu said on 24 August.

"We will be optimistic in the vote when the Romanian government and the European Commission's demands, both the Constitutional Court's decisions," del Ponte said.
The PSD's unions did not vote, but participated in parliament's session to ensure enough majority.
A series of issues that have been removed before the new law.
These include establishing the establishment of the investigation committees linked to the Contact Court and a single presence of the internal households, hotels and divisions.
The law also envisions a condition for removal contracts with state authorities to remove any contracts with the state authorities.
Both the presence and interests are open to the prospects.
Furthermore, the new law allows authorities to investigate the investigation over the next three years.
The bill is now going to President Traian Basescu to sign.
"The most important winners and interests are still open in the fight against the battle in the battle of the battle -- which is obliged by Romania's president -- has to be able to transparent state financed by the Romanian president -- which has to be transparent to state financing contracts.
He added that ANI expects the law to reflect the law.
As those cases detailed by the previous court's decision, they will return to the barracks.
"All of these investigations must be completed," Georgescu said. "The two-year working worker was travelling.
Many investigations will be registered because of the border, "he said.

Balkan countries welcomed the outcome of parliament's parliamentary elections Monday (May 12th), when the United States and the EU welcomed a majority of votes in Serbia's Democratic Party (DS).
Croatian President Stipe Mesic emphasised that the victory "coalition" for a European Serbia "is vital for the future of the whole region.
"The outcome of the elections shows that we will have a neighbourly neighbouring country without a neighbouring country," Mesic said.
Officials in other Balkan countries, including Macedonia, Montenegro and Kosovo, reiterated Mesic's remarks as a result of the most important elections in Serbia since the regime of State Slobodan Milosevic's regime in October 2000.
Tadic's pro-pro-European coalition won a surprise in Sunday's elections, because the coalition's ultranationalist Serbia's Radical Party (SRS) showed that the ultranationalist Serbia's Radical Party (SRS).
A European electoral commission said on Monday that 38.4% of Serbia's votes, and that 250 seats in the country would take over 102 seats in parliament.
The statement reflects the SRS with 29.36% and 77 seats.
Tadic was welcomed by Western governments and senior EU officials, praised Serbian voters for their support for European integration.
"Serbian voters are clear that the remaining quality is in Europe," the US Embassy in Belgrade said in a statement Monday.
Citing Tadic's success, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn has vowed that Brussels is ready to support Serbia's readiness for further progress in the 27-nation bloc's accession process.
"The European Commission welcomed the success of reforms that shares European values," Rehn said. "The EU is ready to speed up the country's EU route, including enhancing EU candidate status."
"I hope that a new government will be formed soon soon as possible to implement reforms and continuing progress in the road to Europe," EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said on Monday.
However, Tadic's coalition did not provide the majority of the SRS 126 seat parliamentary majority, and both seat coalition partners.
The fourth of the vote -- 7.6% of the vote -- is seen as a party that would be seen as a result of the party, led by the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), led by Milosevic.
Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia and the New Serbia's Democratic Party (SRS) has said it is ready to join a coalition government that will be formed by the SRS leader.
The SRS leader, Nikolic, met with Kostunica on Monday to establish a joint cabinet with Kostunica.
The two parties will have a 127 seat majority with the SPS seats.
Observers agree to a coalition between Tadic and Kostunica, because of the dispute over the country's EU accession bid, the majority of EU members agree to recognise Kosovo's independence.
Therefore, the president will need some of the Socialists and ethnic coalition to ensure the majority of the parliament. The 5.24% votes and 13% votes are opposed to form the pro-Western Liberal Democratic Party, Cedomir Jovanovic, who won 13 seats in parliament.
Bank Says Government of Economic Economy
The Greek government faces financial challenges, the possibility of violations from the EU and the strike of public sector employees.
Meanwhile, elections are approaching.
By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 25 / 11 / 03
A letter sent to the Bank of Integration Nicholas Gudanas Simitis to Prime Minister Costas Simitis to Prime Minister Costas Simitis, warning that the Olympic spending is worried by the growing budget deficit and new social aid of new social aid.
According to Gudanas, the budget deficit will not allow public debt reflects and slow inflation rates to lower competitiveness.
In 2003, he also noted, inflation would be 1.5 per cent higher than the Eurozone average of 3.6 per cent.
The financial deficit in the first eight months of the year has reached 5.5 per cent of GDP, estimated to be estimated by 150 billion euros.
The figure is reached as a result of the figure that last year's deficit was 2.6 per cent of GDP.
The centre's opening of the government has increased to 4.9 per cent last year.
Economic and finance ministries are the same level.
Though there is a lot of worry for the citizens, the revenues have signaled that Greece has come back to a step forward in financial administration.
Finance Minister Nikos Kristodoulakis, including school teachers, university teachers, police officers and husband officers rejected the demands of strikes, as well as financial concerns, as well as the government's literature concerns from the EU.
The upcoming elections came to the ruling PASOK party, but the financial crisis is not only a time when all staff in the public sector are seeking to help more social aid or more social aid.
In the polls, PASOK's surveyed at least 5 per cent of the opposition, Kristodoulakis has already entered a solution to the financial problem.
However, there is no chance of the minister's chance to allow growth.
The reason for the privatisation privatisation has been the reason for the removal of the opposition New Democracy.
George Alogoskoufis, a spokesman for the opposition's economy spokesman, also criticised the government's efforts to sell the Post Crimes Bank.
Alogoskoufis also accused the 2004 budget, which submitted to parliament on 6 October.
The government could not be sanctions from the EU because of the budget deficit was made by Maastricht Pakistrit, because of the 3 per cent GDP limit.
Greece may be always gone for a long time because the Eurostat exercise has been discovered in these rates, because it is not in place in Germany and France.
Do you have enough economic growth
We say that economic growth is a complex factors to complete political stability.
According to the former Romanian Finance Minister and former Romanian Finance Minister Daniel Daianu, it is not difficult to have to do so.

Political instruments in the new EU are surprised by many observers. [Getty Images]
The latest developments in Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland are worried concerns over the world.
Do you enter this sustainable climate, after the politicians joined the EU
In the next phase, the government and coalition institutions are part of the forms of the parties that have no democratic politics, which are not in the process of talks with each other. In Hungary, the political tensions are sparked to political tensions.
Many of the developments are surprised.
However, these countries are part of Europe's dynamic parts, and the annual economic growth of several countries (1-6 per cent) are more expensive than in the EU.
The general leader, who repeatedly spending political and economic growth, says that social stability and secular politics have a greater chance in countries in the countries that are high.
In Central Europe, the population's largest part of the population has made concrete economic growth over the past decade, and the ruling coalition needs to support concrete economic prospects and support the ruling coalition.
While joining the EU, this was expected to strengthen the representation of young liberal democracies.
There is a need to be taken to be taken.
The citizens of the former communist countries, especially in the EU-15 EU-15 countries (Portugal and Spain), have lived with the citizens of the former communist countries.
Therefore, these people are expected to be better facilities for democracy and cheaper populist analysts in the street.
The democratic life is believed that the democratic life will be mainly protected in countries that have been living over the past decades.
The relationship between the economic growth and prosperity of democracy is also discussing discussion among economists.
They argue that even if serious diversification among the communities, the growth has come from everything before everything.
Observers say that sustainable economic growth should not be reflected, social values, and that public goods should be produced with sustainable level.
In addition to the public sector, both positive practice and the private sector, as well as the effective fight against corruption.
The post-communist Mittelecom (Central Europe) shows that high growth rates are not enough for a secular social and political life.
Most of the citizens in Central and Eastern Europe are unearthed by disappointing the economic competition of the second round of economic competition, which are disappointed by the citizens' disappointment of disappointment, and the central parties could be said to have lost political representations.
Economists continue to discuss good relations between democracy and prosperity. [Getty Images]
When EU membership is supported, it is possible to say that the force is more effective in the time when the countries hoped to be part of the bloc.
This hope to ensure that politicians with different ideologies have to replace their citizens under the slogan "slogan" in Europe.
Most of the citizens "returned" for most of the citizens, the reality of economic benefits was a regret society.
Now people have no intention in any matter since May 2004, but even though they see efforts to ensure the EU regulations.
A call for the move was inevitable.
This is more difficult because of the "economic efficiency", which has been replaced by the EU's main members.
Most European countries have reviewed many markets -- including the Union's efficiency and functioning -- for example to join the EU -- for example, financial services and public services.
Most European countries are more liberal in these sectors, according to Western European countries.
According to the EU's words that there are no unilateral disappointment in Central Europe, some political circumstances in Central Europe are not disappointed.
Therefore, the economic nationalism has led to economic nationalism in Eastern.
Poland's is a vital issue, such as Germany and Russia, which works together with the energy area, is also a sensitive issue.
People want to express their satisfaction of political freedom and disappointment.
However, it is very easy to remember how the life is changed.
Young young people who have no personal refugee over the communist era do not know how it is.
Some young young people are aware of the referendum points, such as the second world war and the Nazi Jews of Nazi.
It is aware of the true democracy with a true democracy.
The findings are democracy, but the rule of law and the judicial forces are very bad.
The real situation of the Democracy is based on the values of political leaders' values and responsibility.
In this time, EU member states live in a democracy problem and there is no real political and real state.
"The fact that there is no" in New Europe ", but it is not only a few hundreds of specialised and remarks, and this is not a chance to such a chance in psychological technology.
Most European countries are very difficult for the EU's sovereign members.
In addition to other Western European countries, these countries face structural problems such as the population's life, prosperity system, prosperity climate, identity climate and rise.
A bilateral economic growth is not a mistakes.
Governments are unblocked by political reactions, high economic growth rates and unblocked by high economic growth rates.
There is no way to resolve these problems and politicians in the coming years awaiting a serious test.
The steps will be affected by the country's policy and the economy.
Furthermore, in Central Europe, it is a weakness for the Balkans.
Southeast European countries live in the transition of liberal economy with all prospects and disappointment.
Economic issues such as unemployment in the region, "Youth" and other obstacles, EU membership has become a permanent possibility for some regional countries.
In these countries, pressure to stable stability in Central Europe, but there is no need to move forward with them to move forward.

EU and NATO membership depends on judicial reform. [SE Times]
Judicial reform is one of the main challenges that Macedonia must be operational in NATO and EU accession efforts.
In particular, the two data for the question of courts and the independence of the judiciary.
In Macedonia, more than six months of cases will continue to be held by ten years.
According to the constitution, meanwhile, judges are the possibility of direct political influence on electorate by parliament.
"The members of the State Judicial Council should be allowed to be elected by the judges," said Rense Serkoska.
"The political parties in parliament must be aware of the differences of this process because Macedonian citizens are not only facing European integration prospects, not only because of the European integration prospects, but not only because of the European integration prospects," he said. "The political parties need to reconcile their interests of the process, which is more difficult to take a more compromise and constitution."
The education system is a key factor in education.
As the country moves on its path to membership, the judicial system will be allowed to implement European and international law enforcement.
The judges will be called for new organised crime to build a more efficient system.
To successfully, it needs enough training.
According to experts at the courts, reforms will be very deeper.
The constitution will be implemented in the constitutional judiciary, improving funds and authority, and implement "constitutional materials" in charge of defence in the court.
Experts say reforms must be done before.
Macedonia's EU accession doesn't be open, but could not be open until the end.

Bulgaria's freedom of press freedom in the country since joining the EU in January 2007, a international media monitoring said on Thursday (February 5th).
"Organised crime groups have improved their rights on media," said Sublic Journalists (SG), who is in Paris.
Bulgaria was ranked 59th among 173 countries in the last year's annual press freedom.
The country's score has dropped 24 times since 2006.
The SG's 14-page report on the country's absence, drawn up after several radical intellectuals in 2008.
In April, Georgi Stoev, an expert in organised crime, was killed in Sofia.
Ognja Stefanov, the founder of the Frogian News website in September, died in three days.
At the same time, the State National Security Agency (DANS) discovered a series of lawmakers and journalists' phone.
This shows that the corruption and news mechanisms showed that the excavation of corruption and news mechanisms has been replaced in a major death of violence, while Stoev and Stefanov show that violence is still in place.
"Some journalists are in a way to ease their own data, while others continue to pressure from business and political environments," the media monitoring organisation said.
He added that the incident based on Stoev murder and Stefanov is "a reminder tasks" for those who are convincing such pressure.
In addition, a 1998 law enforcement of members of the country's communist era is not being implemented as a result of a 1998 law, according to the SG.
The group also cited the official Bulgarian Journalists' Union at least a quarter and that journalists' law is part of a huge network.
For example, some conservative conservatives are in a position to accept "job" to accept the number of journalism.
According to the group, the country's journalists live in two levels of press freedom, they have more exhibition than their colleagues in Sofia, while strong figures linked to local officials.
Asen Yordanov, a visible journalist, told the SG that the situation has been turned to the village over 15 years.
According to Yordanov, the most sensitive issue is high-level corruption in the judiciary or the interior ministry.
"However, the number of issues [such issues] is increasingly increasingly increasingly increasingly," said Yordanov, based on Tehhdad and physical attacks.
The European Parliament's elections in June will test Bulgarian authorities' commitment to ensure journalists' freedom, the group said.

However, optimistic experts see the impact.

Serbia's dynamics have been a rise in a rise in the euro following Russia's national oil company (NIS) announced on Friday (February 6th) that it would pay 400m euros to Serbia's national oil company (NIS). On Friday (February 6th), 96.3 euros to 9.1 euros.
Nobody in Serbia expects Russia's sale to return to 8.6 euros in the first day of 2009, when it comes to 8.6 euros.
Experts expect the decline -- 249% -- in the euro since October 1st.
Turkey's rival, which is the second priority in the region, has dropped by 17% in the same period.
Serbian experts are divided over the reality of the dynamic.
The tourists expect 90 euros to come from 90 to 95 euros, while villages fear that the foreign currency system is unable to be lower than 150 euros against the euro.
A permanent foreign currency has created the challenges of Serbian citizens, companies and government.
Serbia, which has been dependent on imports such as other Southeast European countries, has attracted high inflation.
In addition, inflation expectations are increasingly increasingly increasingly increasingly increasingly.
The consumers who pay a loan of households of households and biometric loan are needed to win more dynamics.
As neighbours, there is no easy measures for Serbia's basic macroeconomic imbalances.
The investment equipment and a 8.2 billion-euro trade deficit in 2008 reflects the country's current account deficit.
Serbia's central bank is trying to pay the country's foreign debt.
Even with Gazprom's euro accord, the bank does not have the assets to pay foreign debt and support the dynamics.
National Bank of Serbia (NBS) is 1.2 billion euros in 2008 to overcome the books of 1.2 billion euros in 2009, but this has not been a lot of effects.
Furthermore, NBS lost another weapons of interest rates in banks, which sells a lot of valuable value networks.
The NBS, which fear, has declined, has also denied that banks have not been able to sell the euro income.
NBS Director Radovan Jelasic said the bank will not continue to defend the dynamic.
"These interventions are to replace new loans from the planned privatisation revenues, foreign direct investment or abroad," Jelasic said.
NBS warns that the circumstances of the circumstances is a sign of the need to end money in the economy and that Belgrade has not been spending money.
The budget cuts, budget cuts, foreign investment cuts, and export rates -- a rise in the quality of the products -- will be reduced, the Bank says.

With the transfer of the Emllak Law on this month, Croatia has fulfilled a precondition for the EU citizens to recognise the Stabilisation and Association Agreement that recognise equal rights in Croatia.
However, the new bill is not part of cultural and national countries in the area of agriculture and protection.
Apart from the EU, the foreign and justice ministries have to receive them a month to buy their citizens.
Despite discrimination prices and the global economic crisis in the past few years, observers are waiting to continue the continuation of the sale of the sale of residents, observers expect to continue.
The foreign ministers find Croatia a long house, both a tourist destination.
In the past, a foreign woman who wants to buy private medics should be allowed from two ministries from the two ministries.
Of least 98% of the applications, the process has been very slowly slowly slowly and at least two years.
Another question was in a clear name for the vehicles because the government is a priority for a few years.
Currently, this internet can be done.
According to the Croatian Economy Summit, more than 3,000 foreign men have been allowed to buy more than 3,000 over the past ten years.
In this area, the Golden (2,000) is increasingly on the number of census (700), Hungarians (700), Hungarians (120) and Britain.
Foreign buyers who have been removed to the villages, are leaving the Istriian distribution.
Over 70 foreign nationals are not impossible, but more than 70,000 foreign nationals reportedly have been reported that they are not allowed to have a special degree, or not a private company or a private company.
In an interview with the Zagreb Economic Institute, Marusa Vizelek said the foreign ministry has had requested the demand for more than 1,500 requests for the year, adding that the price will not change the prices for a "liberalisation market" after foreign nationals ", Marusa Vizelek said in an interview with the Bank.

Afghanistan's National Assembly held its first meeting on January 26th, but has not yet chosen and failed to form a parliamentary committee.
Gashven said Ankara's bid is to leave all sides in the Taliban magazine, which he described as "illegal organisation".
However, Turkey's medieval efforts are looking forward.
Giorhan Chinoglu, head of the Ankara Anadolu Strategic Research Foundation, believes the conditions are not true for such a approach.
"We are looking at a country that does not benefit from the entire entities, because they do not want both sides to the war with each other," he told SETimes.
"Turkey must find ways to contribute to Afghanistan to a strong contribution to the international coalition member," he said.
However, other analysts are more hope.
Serrian Dogan, an expert at the Centre for Middle East Strategic Studies in Ankara, believes that Turkey could be successful to reach a compromise.
He said that this should reach other countries such as Turkey's future, such as Tacikan, Special and Turkmenistan.
"So now, Ankara is time to speed up with all political players," he said.

According to the DODD, the potential for Montenegro is to promote full recognition through government activities.
Therefore, the government needs to prepare a clear strategy that would use this potential.

The arrests came in a number of pressure from the international community to begin the extradition of suspects, including Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander, Ratko Mladic, who is also wanted by the ICTY.
In a briefing to the UN Security Council last week, High Representative Paddy Ashdown criticised RS authorities for their success in this issue.
The situation could jeopardise BiH's chances for joining the EU and NATO, Ashdown warned.
Ashdown's chief spokesman for Ashdown's office welcomed the arrests Monday as a positive step, but stressed the discrimination between local and international claims.
"The crimes committed by individuals indicted by The Hague tribunal is serious, but the extradition of war crimes suspects indicted by The Hague tribunal," the BiH daily Dnevnik quoted Irena Galeova as saying. "The assessment of RS authorities will be made under the assessment of the assessment of war crimes suspects."
RS officials said on Monday that the arrests are a sign of their commitment to co-operation with the ICTY.
RS Interior Minister Darko Matijasevic promised further steps in meeting the entity's obligations to the tribunal.
Meanwhile, the Council of Europe's Council of Europe announced on Monday that 18 new indicted suspects of financing and income sources indicted by the ICTY have decided to expand any financial and income sources, including Karadzic, Mladic and fugitive Croatian General Ante Gotovina.
Over 17 ethnic Serbs, as well as Bosnian Croat Miroslav Bralo, who was transferred to The Hague, is also on Bosnian Croat Miroslav Bralo.
The newspapers in BiH said on Tuesday that all indictees outside Bralo had been banned from the EU.
"We welcome the EU decision.
"We expect a new step towards restricting the movements of BiH officials," Gorelova said. "We expect BiH officials to dismanage the assets of 18 war crimes suspects to dismanage their assets."

The majority of Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) citizens, which were destroyed by nationalist and economic economist and corruption, represents the Berlin Dutch of the Berlin Dutch.
"Some say that the Socialist Yugoslavia was discovered with the Berlin Day," Sarajevo legal professor Zdravko Grebo told SETimes.
The political reforms in 1965 have caused a house market market economy, and that it provides the borders of Yugoslav citizens to travel to free travel, Grebo says.
This system was sparked under pressure and tensions.
The Yugoslavia have a strong social power network, intelligence and money education and health services.
"Yugoslavia was aware of other communist countries in Europe.
But the Berlin Foundation was not positive manipulation. "
The movie has changed Europe, but was not seen as a major news in BiH.
"However, new obstacles have started to discuss the destruction of Demir Pere.
Sarajevo has been under hearing for more than three years, today we are still facing visa liberalisation to travel in Europe, "he added.
Professor says it is difficult to say that there is no need to be more freedom and fair.
"There is no press and freedom in Yugoslavia.
Now many parties have a political system, judiciary and media independence, but the majority of people have been maintained for the majority of power, cultural and education.
"The situation is a disaster of human rights."
Chief pension Zdravko Prlenda, 66, is recognised as "human science" over the past 20 years.
Prlenda says the state has broadcasted itself as young, and the life is more efficient.
While no communist party has not been a member of the communist party, he said, "each of the one has to have the communist challenges" to be in line with "western or politically".
"There is much more crime, corruption and unemployment.
"I don't have been symbolic, such as people in the past."
Hajdar Arifagagic, 62, says the expectations about communism's discrimination are not in BiH.
Aririfagic believes that Yugoslavia has not been part of the EU and NATO will be the first Eastern European country to join the EU and NATO.
"We don't have to travel to travel abroad, a peaceful state, a peaceful state, but we don [no] policy, freedom, freedom, equality and broadcasting.
"I am convinced to see any idea that I see the global level in BiH," he said.
"I don't feel that the Berlin Dutch was the last philosophy, I feel that BiH is the last philosophy," he said.

EU foreign ministers will decide on a date for Macedonia to start negotiations next year. [EU]
Greek leaders voiced satisfaction Tuesday (8 December) that EU foreign ministers' decision to delay Macedonia's accession talks on a postponement of Macedonia's accession talks.
Greek Alternative Foreign Minister Dimitris Drutsas said the name dispute between the two countries must be resolved.
"There is no way to launch negotiations without free," Droutsas said, adding that Greece is ready to help the accession process when it comes to a long-term solution.
To prevent a move from Greece, EU ministers agreed to remove the issue in the first half of 2010, Spain's rotating presidency from the EU presidency.
Sweden's top president has offered draft proposals for a draft date, but strong optimism from Athens failed to reach a compromise.
Skopje's decision was undelayed.
Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said the verdict was no more complicated than those who live as Greece blocked Macedonia's NATO membership bid last April, when it blocked Macedonia's NATO summit.
Gruevski stressed that the open problems between the two countries would not be resolved with tolerance and obstacles.
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki described the outcome of the EU meeting Tuesday's meeting as "a new number of obligations".
A group of students in Skopje announced their plans to organise a protest in front of EU representative Wednesday.
According to Eduard Kukan, a member of the European Parliament, the chance of the chance of the new Greek government is selected.
"If the new Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou cannot make progress in the administration, I don't know how we can resolve the name issue," Kukan said.
Kukan, the head of the European Parliament's delegation for relations with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo, warned the Macedonians opposed to spark nationalism.
He noted that the Gruevski government has a very strong support for his government.
"This situation can be used in two directors: the name issue will be used for the name issue, it is in accordance with a nationalism of producer or nationalism," he said.
Last week, Gruevski met with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso to discuss the situation.
Barroso said he was believed to be a real solution and that both countries should show political will.
"EU membership is the most important goal of our country's foreign policy with NATO," he said.
Gruevski said the last direct talks with Papandreou has been made in a positive airport, but did not give a concrete results.
"There is a good thing, but we are not in any [any serious progress] on the issue," he said.

Serbia's Conservative profits Support of Milosevic's Party
The conservative parties in Serbia have returned to Milosevic's Socialists because of the conservative party's talks.
(AP, Reuters, Scotsman, Telegraph, Radio B92, RFE / RL - 02 / 02 / 04)
The Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) is expected to receive a decision Tuesday (February 4th) to support Serbia's Democracy Party (DSS) candidate.
The conservative DSS, the conservative conservative of four democracy parties who won the polls in December's parliamentary elections, has entered support for the Socialists with the Socialists.
Following talks with the "national interests", SPS leaders said that the parties that have been arrested with the DSS on Monday would support the conservative pro-war crimes suspect Slobodan Milosevic's official leader, Slobodan Milosevic, following talks with the DSS.
A SPS official, however, said the most possible issue in talks is the platform of the government, which will be formed by DSS leader Vojislav Kostunica.
"We will not support a political platform against values that the SPS represents political stability," said Ivica Dacic, head of the central committee, Ivica Dacic.
According to SPS member Milorad Vucelic, the party will demand the privatisation process and demand that Serbian citizens will be sent to The Hague.
The DSS deputy leader Dejan Mihajlov, who confirmed the resignation with the Socialists, said the talks were "done and will be done".
He said he would not continue talks with the Democratic Party (DS) and coalition talks with four political forces in the democratic bloc.
The DSS, DS, G17 Plus and the New Serbian Renewal Movement for Movement (SPONS) has provided 146 seats in the 250 seats in parliament. The DSS has the most represented party among the 53 lawmakers in parliament.
The party came second after the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS), led by war crimes indictee Vojislav Seselj.
Milosevic's Socialists have 22 seats in the SRS.
The coalition talks between four parties in the Democratic bloc ended with a lot of sustainability, despite success.
The DS, which has played a role in the recent government, does not support Dragan Marsicanin's presidential candidate. On 27 January, the DS and SPS was not elected president because of the parliamentary session.
The DS also opposed the prime minister for the start of the three other democratic parties to start work before the parliament.
It insisted that all institutional issues are resolved, but all institutional issues are delayed.
Following the successful results of the talks, DS said it would not support a minority government that won 37 seats in parliament, which won 37 seats.
DS condemned the DSS's interest in support from the Socialists, saying the SPS would not join a coalition.
"The Democratic Party will not be part of a government that will form together with democracy and democracy," DS deputy leader Boris Tadic said on Sunday.
Radio B92, who was in Belgrade a day after Tadic's DSS, G17 PO-NS, Russia, SPO-PSS and SPS coalition, announced that democratic parties will return to the Milosevic regime before October 2000.
A coalition government, which will be part of the SPS, will not go to the tolerance, calling for the parties in the democratic bloc to form a coalition.
On Monday, the SRS issued a statement demanding the government to be formed or be transferred to the general election.

Ankara and Athens have long long long problems, including the sovereignty of airport, airport and oil transportation rights, Ugyptian Information, and sovereignty over the island.

"This situation has been affected by the consumption of consumption," Katsiastakis said. "No large uncertainty was created.

Katsijadakis explained that the bridges are still hiding from the interests of businesses, firms and water owners -- are still under way, especially in restructuring commercial revenues.
If the prices are on prices, the VAT revenues would have been declared by businesses and said they had been reflected by businesses as part of the proposed rescue plan.

One obstacles to Albania's economic growth was the presence of a major loss of the economy.
According to the IMF, economic activities are 50 per cent of the country's economic activities.
Meanwhile, officials of the Central Bank of Albania estimate that 26 per cent of the money in revenue in Albania are exceptionally exceptionally exceptionally abroad.
"This situation is a result of information about the banking system and is connected with economic and financial crimes," said the bank's deputy Director for Director Georgos Ibrahimi.
The government is trying to reduce economic activities as part of efforts to build a modern financial system.
One of the measures taken in this direction is to pay salaries in public employees.
In June 2004, the National Bank of Arbavel held a pilot project to distribute salaries through banks.
Authorities are now planning to distribute the salaries of about ten hectares working in the state administration.
These banks are participating in a conservative market, which aimed at enhancing the public system, reducing commissioners' monitors, reducing ATM Technical and other services.
Most banks offer the service service with banks through banks.
Under the government's new initiative, telecommunications, electricity and water bills could pay for this way.

Several researchers, banks, banks and operations are still low.
However, this situation will likely be changed, with many people who have been trying to get their salaries in order to open their salaries to get their salaries.

Since the end of the 1980s of the 1980s, Serbia's tender plans to revive Zastava, a high-profile industry leader, a time sectors leader.
Although the issue has been brought to the agenda for every election campaign, governments have failed to cover the company debt debt and excessive power.
The municipality campaign in September was not different: only a few days before the elections, mayor Zastava pledged to disarm the debt of the state.
However, the exercise producer has been formed from one of the largest debt in the past months.
In August, Italy's Fiat agreed that the 41.5m euro debt of 41.5 per cent of the Kagujevac company's demand for strategic partnership.
According to a deal adopted after the country's austerity operation with the Paris Club, Zastava is to pay 121.5m euros to pay the rest of Zastava.
According to Serbian Economic Relations Minister Predrag Bubalo, who currently holds a two-month talks before the Fiat's decision, the state will not allow Zastava to another power to Zastava.
"We will help them from the sources that will provide some parts of the company to sell their debt and pay their debt in time," Bubalo said.
Do you expect Serbia's only railway producer to take days
I don't say that.
The debt came two years after the government discovered Zastava Holding's distribution of the company, which will be part of the Zastava Holding and discovered by weapons.
Although the state promised to end these distribution, Zastava continued to reflect around 6.5m euros over the past three years.
Ahead of the deal with Fiat, the biometric producer's debt -- the values of companies' assets -- including state loans, local loans and employees -- were reported.
Talks with the previous government plans to privatise the privatisation plans and the talks with the People's Zdrin Group, Toyota and Volkswwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
However, such a factor is necessary to pay a major government intervention: particularly the planned 250m euro loan for eight years.
The renewed plan, which has been taken over the past months, is a precondition for two hotels in the workforce, and only 40,000 hotels in the first year.
In the first half of the first half of the year, the problems facing 18,500 vehicles planned for 2004.
Nevertheless, the head of parliament's industrial committee, Veroljub Stevanovic, said the Zastava plan is believed to be held.
However, Serbia has yet to remove an expensive experience so far.

As part of the ruling PACE presidency committee, the "removal of dialogue" in the region and removing the tension. [PACE]
The Council of Europe's Parliament (PACE) adopted last week that the need for a solution to the political situation in Northern Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Albania.
"In northern Kosovo, people are concerned about the establishment of the security and free movement and free movement of trade goods and free movement of the national government in Bosnia and Herzegovina," Bjesnon Sydow, an PACE member, told SETimes.
As part of the October 7th decision, the incident envisions an investigation into the Jarinje border in the Serbian border with Serbia at the end of September.
The situation in northern Kosovo is said that the problems in northern Kosovo revealed the way for Pristina talks under the EU mediator.
In addition, a delegation is offered to establish a delegation under the PACE presidency committee for "removing the dialogue process and removing tensions".
Von Sydow says the delegation could "work to stop political divisions, increasing the parties" to take steps towards the European Council principles ".
Ian Bancroft, a founder of Transport Conference, stressed that northern Kosovo would protect as one of the basic issues, and that the importance of talks should be discussed as part of the talks.
"If the problems in the north are resolved, the chance of the UN-Serbia talks is very low," Bancroft told SETimes.
"The relevant relevant relevant relevant relevant relevant relevant relevant relevant talks is crucial to the EU.
Serbia may now be a greater presence of pressure on the EU.
"If Serbia wants to make progress in the negotiations with the EU, Serbia will remain very important to make its messages to the EU and to improve relations with Kosovo."
Another concern is the continuing political stage in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The verdict is "high than 75 per cent of the unemployment rate since 2009, when the country's credit rating from foreign direct investment" has been reduced by foreign direct direct investments since 2009.
According to Von Sydow, the problem is "focusing on the situation", meeting the country's rival forces ", and blocking the country's international financial support and blocking the stage of the national economy.
Bancroft noted that all of the details in Bosnia and Herzegovina have left their chances to find a solution to the country's problems.
"Republika Srpska's removal to strengthen the government's strengthening of strengthening the problem, removing the new ministerial ministries, and removing the new ministerial elections, which will lead to the basic problems and lead to deepening the deepening of the current divisions."
"All political parties in the country are encouraging to work on the democratic functioning of the country's political situation, work on the return of the country's political situation, to return to normalisation of the political situation, and to launch the political dialogue," PACE said at the end of the decision.
However, analyst Yladjan Mladloja believes there is very difficult to ensure such progress.
"The two main political parties [the ruling Democratic Party] and the main opposition Socialist Party [have shown their revenues that they will be able to remove the deepening of the deepening of the articles," Mladloja told SETimes.
Hundreds of Hundreds of Citizens of former Bosnian Lids

Hundreds of laws were held in Sarajevo on Wednesday (October 22nd) to meet former President Alija Izetbegovic, who hopes to meet the latest duties against Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) President Alija Izetovic.
Izetbegovic will be reminded as one of the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords, which ended the 1992-1995 war in the fight against the former Yugoslav republic.
Izetbegovic was elected in 1996 to represent the Muslim community in the first three members of the country's first war elections, and the first president was the first president to represent the health problems, but was detailed in 2000 because of health problems.
"President Izetbegovic will be reminded with the historic role in Bosnia and Herzegovina's integration and the establishment of the Bosniak state," UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said.
"Izetbegovic was very encouraging leader for the people of Izetbegovic," EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said, adding that Izetbegovic "plays an important role in the Balkans in the end of the war in the".
Students at the University of Sarajevo say Izetovic's death has caused the death of communism with victims in the recent house, as a result of the long-term radical radical radical waste.

Kostunica: Serbia to accept "unacceptable consensus" on Kosovo
During a meeting in London on Tuesday between Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and British counterpart Tony Blair focused on the Kosovo issue and Serbia's EU bid.

Serbia is ready to reach a compromise on Kosovo's future status, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said on Tuesday (June 27th).
"It is not a full compromise, and Serbia cannot accept a compromise," Kostunica told reporters after talks with British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
The two leaders discussed various issues, including Serbia's interior and economic ministers, as well as the 45-minute meeting, including the head of the Kosovo Co-operation Centre for Kosovo, Sandzak Raskovic, as well as the participation of Kosovo and EU integration.
Britain has played key role in the process of determining Kosovo's final status and is a member of the six-nation Contact Group, including France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States.
Kostunica, who met with Blair and Kosovo, has expressed clear that his country's "real autonomy" is the only solution.
The prime minister said this means that Serbia will not change the borders and feel the rights of Kosovo Serb minority, while Serbia would mean that the rights of the Kosovo Serb minority will be protected.
Kosovo is still part of Serbia, but has been under UN administration since the end of the 1998-1999 conflict.
Serbian and Kosovo Albanian officials have participated in direct talks on the province's final status since February, but little progress has been made so far, and there is still great differences among the parties' positions.
Kosovo Albanians, who make about 90 per cent of the province's population of the province's population of 2 million, want Kosovo to become fully independent from Serbia.
The international community expects a solution by the end of this year, while some Western forces reportedly support the Kosovo Albanian majority.
That is not among the options, Kostunica said on Tuesday that a move would destabilise the stability in the region.
The British daily Financial Times quoted Kostunica as saying it would "reject the rejection of the Serbian Parliament" and "" that "will be a point of turning point in Serbia's relations with the rest of the world".
Regardless of Serbia's EU bid, Blair has reportedly urged Belgrade to speed up co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia to move forward in this process.
In early May, the EU stopped talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Belgrade's failure to arrest former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic until 30 April to The Hague tribunal.
Since that time, Brussels has made clear that the SAA talks, adopted by the final step towards eventual EU membership, would be sustainable.
Croatia's Journalist Analysis Award
SEEMO awarded the first prize last month: "Dr Erhard Busek-SEEMO award". [Croatian journalist Denis Latin Latin]
A journalist should be a journalist.
However, there is no easy job for the workers of thousands of ethnic clashes, or if politicians reflect their jobs, they are uneasy to the workers of the bottom or matches.
By Lack Barmirt for Balkan Times - 18 / 11 / 02
There may be a journalist in the Balkans.
A journalist must have always become a member of our integration, and must allow all opponents to the incidents.
That is not a very easy job, if you have been in the past years, they have reflected the destruction of the conflict or politicians' weaknesses to the force of their forces.
Hundreds of journalists in the Balkans have to live these principles and intelligence data to cover the results.
Now, a new organisation has decided to convince journalists' efforts to difference their efforts.
Last month, SEEMO awarded the first prize: a jurisdiction of media professionals about "Dr Erhard Busek-SEEMO Award" in Southeast Europe ", a jurisdiction of media professionals at 400 candidates, announced Croatian TV professionals.
Latinica's television programme, which was drawn up to foreign reduction, announced that the relationship between refugees or return to normalisation of relations between Croats or Serbs.
"Will Serbian tourists should be removed in Croatia's Adriatic Charter?"
The congress was nine.
Serbs and Croats in the former Yugoslavia were in the Croatian cities.
Both communities were unfortunately unfortunately unprecedented, unprecedented unprecedented unprecedented unprecedented.
But since the war in Croatia in 1991, many Serb residents have been transferred to restructuring their holidays since the 1991 war in Croatia.
So less time ago, Serbia's opening to the West was seen as a restructuring to Croatia's representation, which will travel to the West and make some Serbs to travel.
This is not surprised when the war is in a biometric life in the Dalmatia coastal coastal coastal.
Latin decided to leave the issue.
Both sides have made their approval: they argue that the time of time to ensure peace between Serbs and Croats and Croats, and the Serbs are not willing to ask the Croatian territory.
The tension between the two groups reached time, but everyone agrees that the time is time for a compromise.
SEEMO secretary of the SEEMO, Olympic Vujovic, said Latin's request affected the request of the Croatian media in order to address issues that should be destroyed.
However, there is only many journalists who work to develop bilateral conflict in the Balkans.
SEEMO reiterated the candidate's candidate to pay the award. "Bay Latin's situation", saying he was "very work to keep a decision", but it was a lot of work for many other journalists who had been sparked for a decision. "
The new award, supported by Southeast Europe Special Co-operation Erhard Busek, is only a small place among the events of the events of journalists' events, as well as the legal framework of law on journalists' standards, and is also in charge of the law on journalists' standards.
The SEEMO has no problem on attracting public interest. In a statement, the SEEMO has made it clear that the Games really reflected in a statement, because the SEEMO has made it clear that the organisation is unprecedented or increasingly reflected, it is a diplomatic approach to improving circumstances.
A political party formed in SEEMO before Albanian churches came to the Albanian television, decided to leave the Macedonian press conference in Tetovo, Macedonia.
Vujovic was linked to the party's leader and emphasised the importance of a clear structure of the press conference.
The party leader has not been delayed with response to this approach: the Party leader promised that the law will not be implemented.
SEEMO also supports journalists for journalists in the danger of personal security.
"The problems of journalists are changing the country, however, but the document is from the people who live in the region where we live in the region live with salaries and wage," Vujovic said.
Police are unwilling to journalists about journalists. The police are still unwilling to three years after the murder of Serbian journalist Slavko Curija's house was killed.
The salaries of journalists in the region do not have enough resources to ensure that their integration of the broadcasting and broadcasting bodies can be able to be able to do so.
"[It] will have to react what every journalist [is] to react what will be reacted," Vujovic said.

The latest remarks on the issue will be KPCG Dytyci.

Bulgarian teachers met with a national protest in Sofia last week. [Getty Images]
After a member of the Greikv committee's recent agreement, a chance of the teacher strike in Bulgaria on Tuesday (October 23rd) was not high.
Nikolay Nikolay told the internet on Monday that the education ministry has been trying to end economic pressure to end teachers.
The strike continues and teachers will continue to hold a new rally in Sofia on Thursday, Nikolov said.
Nine days after the beginning of the year's official beginning on 15 September, teachers are in strike and stopped.
Professor officers are demanding that the salaries of the country currently under the average of 200 euros per month.
In addition, the government wants to reflect 5% of GDP.
The government has denied the possibility of the demand, arguing that it would be in place on the presence of the 13% presence reached in August.
In addition, the long-delayed education reforms and education quality needs to revive the decline in recent times.
Any movement to increase teachers should be made in the sector, which currently needs to be reduced, the government said.
At the end of the talks, unions announced on Monday that teachers will accept an agreement to reach an agreement that would reach about 325 euros, including the average salary in the sector, including staff personnel staff from 1 July 2008.
The government's latest agreement envisions a 325-euro average salary for teachers in the second half of 2008 and only for teachers.

With a unprecedented permanent chance, opposition parties in parliament submitted a widespread proposal in the government last week.
During a parliamentary meeting on Monday, parliament met with the head of the Democrats for Bulgaria and former Prime Minister Ivan Costov, who was responsible for the vote.
"Bulgaria is the biggest strike in the history of the history and I cannot be responsible for teachers who accepted the 15 reform proposal," Costov said.
He criticised the overall approach and Stanishev's party's failure to survive his third coalition cabinet before the elections.
If the government has a 168 seat majority in Bulgaria's 240 seat parliament, it is expected to stay on Tuesday's confidence vote.

UN special envoy for Kosovo Martti Ahtisaari's proposal on Friday (February 21st). After the January 21st general elections, Belgrade has a government in a bridge parliament. After the 21 January general elections.
Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica has denied that he is no longer able to hold talks with the most important state issues, rejecting Ahtisaari's visit to Belgrade.
Currently, President Boris Tadic is the right representative of the Belgrade authorities.
Following his proposal, Tadic described the plan as a constructive way to enter Kosovo's independence since 1999.
"Serbia, nor what we can accept Kosovo's independence," Tadic said.
Belgrade analysts say the Kosovo issue would further boost pressure on establishing a democratic Serb government.
Tadic and Kostunica's parties will have a coalition majority with a pro-Western G17 Plus.
The parties, however, are not able to reach an agreement on the prime minister's seat.
Furthermore, Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DPS) has been a radical recommendation on Kosovo, which will be established.
The DPS has asked coalition partners to ask an independent Kosovo.
The party's platform says relations between any countries that recognise Serbia and Kosovo would be "inevitable".
Some analysts have cited the DPS's move as a sign of signal of the party's approach to democratic bloc, the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS), which may have a majority majority in parliament.
The Radicals, however, rejected the possibility of forming a government with Kostunica so far.
Meanwhile, the fall is increasing.
The EU has sent clear signals to the democratic government that will be formed in order to continue Stabilisation and Association talks with the EU.
The talks were stopped in May due to Belgrade's failure to co-operate with The Hague tribunal.
Meanwhile, Kosovo Serbs, meanwhile, have been under pressure on their differences over parties in Belgrade.
Representatives of the Serb municipalities in Kosovo have asked the establishment of a government that would fight Kosovo's potential independence.
Speaking at a meeting with the president Monday, parliament parties agreed on the principle of a new parliament and a negotiating team that would have to have a new parliamentary and more active agreement against Ahtisaari's proposal.
Croatia helps to help election campaign
Both of Croatia's leading political parties want to increase its chances this year with the help of recognition of prominent campaign experts.
By Natasa Radic for Southeast European Times â€“ 07 / 02 / 07
Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader.
Mara is working with Mara.
Ahead of the general elections in Croatia this year, two main political parties -- the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and the Social Liberal Party (SDP) -- showed that the two main political parties are moving to a victory.
This time, both parties are confident in professional advisers to cover the chance of the chance.
In the past four years, Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader is Iranian political adviser and relations with the public.
Mara consultations.
Mara Mara, the top political adviser of Iranian Prime Minister Bertie Aegean, is one of the most wanted campaign experts in his country.
Mara's efforts helped the HDZ's last elections and hopes that it will benefit from the party.
Mara's approach is based on the person's approach, which is under sports and is based on the best benefit of his personal career.
A clear message sent to the voters: one person who promised political promises is not a single goal, and a single goal, democracy, capable, capable of the country.
However, the HDZ's competitiveness could be reduced, because the opposition has decided to keep British David Evski, a prominent political campaign.
In 2001, the British Co-operation Party has successfully ordered its election campaign, and established his own company in 2001 in communication and political markets.
Tony Blair's controversial political figure and a prominent political adviser, Agrad Campus, worked with Agrad Campus, who helped win the elections two times.
The SDP hopes Evski will help them a similar outcome.
The party is particularly confident to develop communication and relations with the people that would allow their messages to better broadcasting.
More than half of them registered to join education cuts.
Now they are now preparing new skills and prepare to test the HDZ's rival's strategy.
Therefore, it has yet to be able to do so, while Croatian politics have changed.

In less than a month before Croatia's planned EU accession talks, Zagreb has been under pressure Monday (21 February) to prove full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and extradite war crimes indictee General Ante Gotovina.
"The Western Balkan countries continue to be one of the basic conditions for full and precondition co-operation with the ICTY," EU foreign ministers said in a statement after their meeting in Brussels. "The last remaining indictees must be transferred to The Hague as soon as possible."
In December, EU leaders gathered to start accession talks with Croatia on 17 March, as a condition for full co-operation with the ICTY and extradite Gotovina.
Gotovina, one of the most wanted indictees at the tribunal's three most wanted indictees, was shown in mid-2001 after UN prosecutors had been charged with war crimes committed by at least 150 Krajina Serbs in Croatia, and the 150,000 others of the 1991-1995 conflict.
In a letter to the EU presidency last week, UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte said authorities "do not do everything" to arrest the indictees.

"There is no surprise," said Luxembourg's foreign minister, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, Jean Asselborn, whose country currently holds the rotating presidency.
Croatian authorities have said they have accelerated efforts to capture the fugitive, but insisted that no information on Gotovina has been proved in the country.

I am confident that we will find the job, "he said.
"We're going to show transparent, transparent and full invitation in this case," Reuters quoted Croatian Foreign Minister Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic as saying in Brussels on Monday. "I am convinced that we will do our efforts to do our EU."
On 16 March, the next meeting of EU foreign ministers will be held in the last day, when Brussels should decide on whether to start negotiations with Croatia and decide on whether to start negotiations with Croatia.

"Nobody is not a doubt."
In an interview with Kanal, Erdogan said Gul would end its relations with the AKP after the president was elected.
"It will end the end of the relationship with the party," the AFP quoted the prime minister as saying. "It would be the president of the Republic of Turkey, which has been elected."
The army did not comment on Gul's candidacy.
However, Chief of General Staff General Yasar Algang said last month that the personal mandate should be free, but not only the remarks.
He condemned reports Tuesday that he would discuss a secret meeting with Gul.
He said the army would not apply to the market with such a issue.
"The public is in a statement that [The public] efforts to comply with certain politicians and make talks with certain politics," Algang's website quoted him as saying.
"The chief of the General Staff's staff has nothing else and all meetings are in accordance with the interim traditions of the state."

NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer was in Skopje on Monday (April 21st) to meet with President Branko Crvenkovski, former Prime Minister Nikola Crvenkovski, Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki and Defence Minister Lazar Elenovski.
"The job goal is to see NATO in NATO.
I believe that Euro-Atlantic integration is important for the stability of this region, "he said.
Skopje wants to focus on resolving the name dispute between Macedonia and Greece, a key obstacle to join NATO, he said.
"We can do two things -- to do with the past or to do with the past. I would like to see the protocol -- a third country signed with Albania and Croatia on 9 July, when a third country signed its accession protocol with NATO," de Hoop Scheffer said.
NATO does not have direct role in the process within the UN.

EU wants package with Serbia before May 7th elections
Brussels wants to sign a key agreement with Serbia before the May elections, but reiterated Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's position.

"Serbia is clear that it is not the country's not the national interests of a deal that could be interpreted as an independent Kosovo," Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said. [Getty Images]
The EU plans to sign a key accession agreement with the country before 11 May elections to keep Serbia on its path to join the Union, a senior Brussels official said on Monday (April 21st).
"We don't want to attract Serbia's European integration," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn told the German daily Germany's Die Well. "The Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) is a strong signal of Serbia's European future."
The deal, which is dealing with economic and trade disciplines, will facilitate Serbia's candidacy as an official recognition of Serbia's candidacy and then facilitate its accession talks.
The victims signed the SAA in November, while EU officials said full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (SAA) remains key to Belgrade.
The Hague tribunal is under pressure on Serbia to hand over four fugitives, including former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander, Rako Mladic.
Nevertheless, the EU members argue that Serbia would support the country to sign the SAA before the May elections to prevent the pro-European forces, strengthening nationalist forces that have been frozen over Kosovo's independence.
After last month's remarks, the coalition government called for early parliamentary elections.
The coalition has been divided over whether Serbia must work closely to facilitate relations with the EU after most of the EU members recognised by most of the declaration of independence.
A recent survey pointed out that the upcoming elections will be closely closely.
President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party (DS) and the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS) are about 35% of the vote.
The DS supports the signing of the DS, while other nationalist parties, including Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia, see the document as recognition of the document's independence.
That means that the parties could sign the agreement by 29 April, when EU foreign ministers will sign during a meeting in Luxembourg.
However, Belgium and the Netherlands oppose the signing of a SAA without fugitive indictees.
The Netherlands could accept the agreement's signature for the time, according to Reuters' sources in Brussels on Monday, citing sources from the Netherlands.
Kostunica, however, reiterated the deal's position, saying the deal is unfair to Serbia's interests.
"He supports Kosovo's unilateral independence and supports the signing of the agreement," the prime minister said. "It is not clear that Serbia is not an agreement to sign an agreement that could be signed by a half of Kosovo."
EU Regional Regional Affairs Commissioner Danuta Hujner warned on Monday that Serbia has lost a part of 1 billion euros in aid to the bloc's help by 2013 by 2013.

Okkar's decision is a right to appeal.
The group is preserving financial support for the key level, and the organisation faces the Turkish media to explain similar practices, similar practices and products.
Turkey's media responded to internet laws that have been condemned.
"The internet is not immunity," the Colonel daily Radikal said in an interview Tuesday.
The paper condemned the internet laws, emphasising that the laws are imposed by court decisions, but rather than decisions made by the country's Telecommunications Directorate.
Turkey's ruling Islamic Justice and Development Party (AKP) expressed its commitment to the EU protocol, and pledged to revive the reforms.
However, the latest internet laws were serious suspects about their commitment.
The AKP has denied that a secular Islamic agenda and described him as a conservative party.
Some of the AKP's leading members have been opposed in the past, but the party is not a direct connection with Okkar and is trying to make a direct connection with the group.

During the latest summit in mid-June, the presidents of EU member states and prime ministers ordered the European Commission (EC) to make a assessment on the "movement" of new members by December 2006.
The leaders also delayed a debate on amendments in the European Constitution, which many are necessary for enlargement.
Germany, Spain, Spain and Italy have argued smaller changes in the current office, while France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom are calling for a new Constitution.
Britain's authority opposes the transfer of institutions in Brussels.
If the constitution is unacceptable, candidate countries could have serious effects on their prospects.

"We need to change some rules of rules in the EU," EC President Jose Manuel Barroso said.
In the results of the meeting, the EC also stressed that the process should be made in the European citizens of the EU's "encouraging power".
This is considered a key condition for the Dutch and French citizens to reject the draft constitution, which would threaten "the reconciliation process" of the former Europe's unemployment and living standards.
Of least one of the participants, they reiterated their commitment to the enlargement process.
"The future of the new members is a historic opportunity to contribute to peace, security, stability, rule of law, democratic, rule of law and prosperity and prosperity," the statement confirmed.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn cited optimism, saying the summit has opened the way for a "new consensus".
This compromise should "strengthen our interests in the creation of a peaceful, democracy and prosperity region, as well as to ensure that new members should be acceptable," Rehn said.
The Western Balkan countries have been granted at the Thessaloniki summit in 2003 and confirmed many documents since that time.
Last autumn, Croatia and Turkey start accession talks, while Macedonia has been granted candidate status.
Albania recently signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, while Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina have yet to do so.

If the issues are really realistic, the agreement could be held at a next meeting of EU foreign ministers on 16 June.
"There is no country that does not have to become a member of the EU after this road," Lajcak said, welcomed the process of restructuring the police restructuring process, which is a strong signal that BiH is open to trade.

Two hours of reaction in northern Kosovo.
These are willing to represent the border between Albanian and Serb population living in the northern town of Mitrovica.
One Albanian owner says it is optimistic for reconstruction to reject local Serbs plans.
Police and KFOR have set up their neighbours for more than a decade.
The dispute on a house is a series of ethnic incidents -- example of example -- for example of Albanian products -- and for example -- an example of Serb nature -- and a Serb man began in Mitrovica.
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci vowed to promise the future of law and the future of Kosovo, especially in Mitrovica.
Mitrovica Mayor Bajram Rexhepi said police, EUFOR and KFOR support full support for improving its activities.
According to Rexhepi, many prominent resistance residents have been creating confidence among ".
In addition, we support them to ensure a safe and secure environment for everyone, "Interior Minister Zenin Pajaziti praised them for improving security in the state.
On January 23rd, Mitrovica police spokesman Besim Hoti told the Pristina daily Express that police had made some progress, saying the police had been arrested by two local Serbs.
"Police have been arrested for their [them] to disappoint their mosques," Hoti said, noting that [the] carrying out [cuts] as well as a violence against ethnic Albanians.
While the northern Kosovo remains rich, some people like Christian Science Monitor Elizabeth del Ponte can find some reasons for a possible optimistic optimism.
Due to Belgrade's EU accession, del Ponte argues that Serbia and the EU have launched "a promise co-operation" to help northern Kosovo.
According to del Ponte, Serbian embassies blocked "the Serbs" to boost their activities ", while Kosovo police, EULEX police, EULEX police and KFOR peacekeepers stopped" Albanian troops ".
In addition to another signal, some journalists in Serbia and Kosovo, as well as officials, such as Pajaziti, see the career's career as a reason for the career's career as a reason for the career's interests of both Serb and Albanian crime.
Nevertheless, the opposition Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) has accused the government of insufficient efforts for ethnic Albanians in the north.
AAK chief and former Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj said on Sunday (February 8th) that the divided town of Mitrovica could be removed in three months after the ruling.
The elections in Kosovo will be held in November.

High Representative and EU Special Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling said on Wednesday (13 June) that dialogue in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is time to revive the dialogue on constitutional reform.
Stressing lawmakers before the end of his term, Schwarz-Schilling said BiH has been in a serious political crisis, because of the lack of progress towards reforms, increasingly reducing political opponents and the negative impact of the public.
"I am confident that the politicians are able to build confidence among all sides and make concrete progress in the real life issues, but also to ensure concrete progress among the parties," the top international envoy said.
"Do you think that [referendum] will you be acceptable to the referendum and the secularism of the entities
How can this country's unacceptable to other incidents in the region to protect the products of the people
I think that this is unacceptable, "he added.
In the past few days, political leaders in BiH met with Schwarz-Schilling and German rates to speed up the reform process.
Bosnian presidency member Haris Silajdzic and Republika Srpska's Prime Minister Milorad Dodik visited Washington to meet with the US State Department, but the talks were unchanged.
Since then, the high representative rules have decided to take place.
Last year, a constitutional reform package was not gone for the Mecernje.
As part of the last elections, parliament support is still under a two-thirds majority needed to prevent the document.
"We support the previous constitutional reform package because we will have to launch new negotiations because of political restructuring," Dodik said after a meeting with international representatives.
The main dispute is in the parliament.
Most of the Bosniak representatives are opposed to the adoption of a key condition for each other's cabinet.
Bosniak lawmakers say it will slow the progress.
However, RS counterparts have been determined to protect the process, arguing that it would defend the remaining pensions in the vote.
International officials warn that the political crisis has blocked BiH's progress towards EU membership, and warning that it is disappointed by the public's trust in politics.
BiH has been the latest step towards signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU for months, but failed to agree on police reform, Schwarz-Schilling said Wednesday.
He said that the High Representative (OHR) has decided to close the closure of the High Representative (OHR), such as the situation in BiH and the region, as planned as planned.
"This is a step forward," Schwarz-Schilling said. "The OHR is in order to ensure peace and stability, even if we are in the period of political instability."

The disagreements that have slowed its efforts to boost defence co-operation between Turkey and the EU were highest in Ankara this week with NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer's talks with officials in Ankara.
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said Turkey is not opposed to improving relations between NATO and the EU, but that should be done with new co-operation mechanisms.
According to the "Berlin Plus" agreement, strategic co-operation between the two organisations that are not a member of NATO or Partnership for Peace in 2002.
However, the country has already been a member of the EU, particularly the Turkish administration since 2004, insisting that it should be among other new members that joined the Union in 2004.
This is an important dispute for Turkey to recognise the Greek Cypriot administration.
Ankara argues that it should not be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to stop the EU-NATO missions' debate.
Turkey wants Cyprus to overcome the European Defence Agency, a commission to strengthen Cyprus's European arms industry to strengthen its European arms industry.
"The parametric metres were made in 2002," Gul quoted de Hoop Scheffer as saying.
"We have to wait more efficient than Turkey from Turkey, as a country to provide very important contribution to NATO," he said. "You should not be expected only from Turkey.
As NATO's situation, the EU should find a solution if it is unable to show the mechanism of this problem, "he said.
The situation could affect its plans to expand co-operation between NATO troops and the police mission in Kosovo.
If the status plan is currently removed in the UN Security Council, the EU could take over the police mission in Kosovo this year.
The planned mandate facility is concerning 1,500 EU personnel who serve as 16,000 NATO peacekeeping force.
In the first time, however, the framework of EU co-operation in Kosovo needs to be determined.
Turkey has made serious contribution to peace and stability operations in the world, including NATO and the EU, Afghanistan.
Last week, however, Ankara decided to withdraw its commitments on future peacekeeping missions.
As a NATO member, Turkey pledged to send a letter to the EU's Preading Goal 2010, a military delegation that is part of the EU's security and defence strategy.
However, the EU's proposed Turkish tour "prosperous forces", reiterated Turkish generals and diplomats who want to play a long-term role.
Turkey has also said that despite significant contribution to command and control structures under the EU-EU co-operation framework.
De Hoop Scheffer told reporters during his visit to Ankara that talks between partners will be constructive.
He later travelled to Brussels to attend the NATO defence ministers' meeting.
UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier
Earlier this week, UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier and discussed the current role in the country's relations with Belgrade and UNMIK's future.
"We've been easy to Belgrade and UNMIK officials at the highest level," Zannier said. [File]
SETimes: How do you recognise the UN's current role in Kosovo, if the restructuring of Kosovo's independence, the current speech of international peacekeeping forces and the structure of the EU mission
Zannier: The UNMIK Security Council remains operational in line with the mandate based on the 1244.
However, the incidents were necessary, including the EU legal mission in December, including the beginning of the legal mission.
So far, the mission has yet to emphasise its political role.
The assessment of monitoring and report is also in strengthening further facilitating relations with all communities in Kosovo, facilitating practical issues to resolve the solution of bridge issues between Pristina and Belgrade.
It also continues to play a role in the areas where others played.
For example, the mission can be allowed to have the management role in northern Mitrovica, this is the only municipality of this kind.
Another example is to facilitate the representation of Kosovo in Interpol.
SETimes: How do you have a relationship with EULEX, the EU Special Representative and the International Civilian Representative (ICO)
How do you co-operate in many areas
Zannier: The international missions in Kosovo are in different tasks.
As you don't know, EULEX is in Kosovo under the 124-page verdict.
Since the flexibility, EULEX has completed us to complete our job as the OSCE.
The co-operation with EULEX is very good.
Earlier this year, UNMIK and EULEX signed a number of technical agreements aimed at facilitating the case, pensions and assets by UNMIK.
This relationship is now being held in several levels, including mission chief Yves de Kermabon.
Tabibic is also offering a report among EULEX, which operates under the UN authority, presented to the general secretary-general secretary-general security.
The UN Security Council accepted the Ahtisaari Planning of the Ahtisaari Planning, so that there is no official co-operation between UNMIK and the ICO.
This is not a problem for us because we see the ICO's role as a consultation in the government.
However, I met with Pieter Feith, a member of the EU special representative, and this means a good information of information.
SETimes: What is your relationship with Pristina and Belgrade
What is your relationship with Pristina and Belgrade
"UNMIK Executive Directorate is the only legal framework in Mitrovica. [File]
Zannier: As the general's latest report to the security issue, Kosovo authorities have been less direct representation between the Kosovo authorities.
For that reason, Pristina is a message to work with other international players.
However, we have an opportunity to discuss practical co-operation and example of the security issue and example, including Pristina officials, and other international regulations.
UNMIK's more effective than the authorities in Pristina to resolve the practical problems, especially in the north of the IDP (ODDP), in order to resolve the practical problems, such as the return of communities in the north.
Belgrade and Belgrade are more easily easily easy to the highest level of UNMIK officials.
We discussed discussions between the Secretary General Special Representative (SRSG) and the government, as well as issues in various levels, particularly in Belgrade's meetings with the UN Operations.
Initiative discussions could be changed by more sufficient technical debates.
SETimes: What is your only legal partnership in northern Kosovo
Zannier: I think the role of the route museum in the north is that I think that this question is the problem.
The UNMIK Executive Directorate (ICM) is the only legal partner in Mitrovica, but the administrative musicians in the north -- in the north -- are not acceptable for all sides.
UNMIK's role is to prevent a administrative body to ensure practical needs, such as control of the women's registration.
Therefore, all sides have now recognised the ICM and we have the most important support for the people living in the region.
SETimes: How is the implementation of a bidder exercise, or is the implementation of a revised exercise in the region
Zannier: The talks on our practical issues were held last year and the General Secretary General's November report on Kosovo.
Now we have a lot of broad agenda, which is based on this report, and it is also part of them, including returns or people.
A number of other international players also included in this process.
UNMIK continues to support the participation in the bridge of all sides in finding practical solutions.
It's a political instrument, because we need to make progress in practical issues that we need to be more broad.
Political victims are harmful to all sides.
SETimes: Do you expect to see what is the agenda of the mission's agenda for the UN Mission in Kosovo, and what is the agenda of this mission
Zannier: The mission will continue to work to fulfil its mandate.
For now, our political role will continue to be a chance of our political role, especially for the society relations.
I see any important changes in the future mission's role.
However, such as you know, the mission has always stopped always and we will continue to assess the situation in the situation and we will do in resignation with the UN headquarters in the future.

Turkey's businessman Aydin Dogan's media group sparked questions about media freedom of expression. [AFP]
In an unprecedented move earlier this month, the Turkish government punished about 1.7 billion euros in tax on Eastern, the country's largest media group.
The penalties of a Turkish company may be the country's obstacle to the EU accession process.
Dogan Media Group, the owner of the newspaper, textile and TV station, says that the continuing repeat between the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is being taken over due to the continuing repeat.
In March, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged people to boycott Dogan's newspaper "to boycott the AKP's ambition of corruption".
According to reports, the Denmark FT Association, which was founded by Turks, claimed government claims in the horizon consumption of government insurance.
According to the media, more than millions of euros have been transferred to Turkey in 2007.
A German court has accused three Turkish citizens of corruption and sent a Turkish judiciary to continue the continuing of all documents.
He also noted that some AKP members, including Erdogan's close friendship, could be a relationship to corruption.
The main group claims that the money, such as Kanal, has been spent on the establishment of pro-government news stations such as Kanal.
These allegations have been held in a press process and have not been submitted to the tribunal.
A investigation is under way.
Erdogan denies that the penal penalties in the Dogan province, saying tax administration is independent.
Turkish media sector has about 50% of Turkish media sector such as Hurriyet, Milliyet, Milliyet, Canadian and Radicals, CNNme-Warner partner, the Canadian Alliance and Time-Warner partner.
If the signing of the ceremony, pro-government companies abroad.
According to Turkish law, the Middle East group has two options.
The group accepts the allegations of tax evasion and demand the reduction of the penal penal penal penal sentences or treasure to invest in tax evasion.
The EU has already voiced concern.
A spokesman said the penalties could affect Turkey's progress report on the next week.
"I am still concerned about the freedom of movement and the rights of independent associations.
And I think that this is a modern European democracy and most of the medical country, as a part of a country, which is still a unique country, "he said.

Serbia will try to sell the national airport company JAT Airways, which estimated 300m euros.
The first tender for the purchase of the funding was opened in 2008 for the sale of 51% stake.
This time, the state decided to change the strategy and submit a new company that is not the debt to potential partners.
The requirement for joining the IT is that at least 1.5 million passengers, transport transport and 200m euros in 2010.
The new company was given to Newo Cado.
The membership applications will be adopted until 30 September.
Government representatives believe this offer will be more attractive for potential investors.
"It is completely completely a new company that will invest with the state with Serbia, while the current census will now be the best in the world's world's world's world's world, with the best census in the world," Air Traian Commissioner for Air Traian Miodrag Milikovic said.?
But Belgrade economist Cormar Busatlia has concerns about the success of JAT sale.
"The company has opened at a time when the global economic crisis appears to be removed.
If that happens, people have been able to travel before.
It is unnecessary that no one will enter the agreement with the Serbian air carrier, "he said.
Busatlija has to discuss another decision: JAT's debt, efficiency of the Serbian tax duties and to increase the number of Serbian taxes.
"Unfortunately, the state should try to restructure JAT restructuring, reducing its debt and make the company more functioning.
However, there has been many politicians and very professional professionalism in such cases, "he said.
Economist Milan Kovacevic said the JAT's most important presence is private aircraft rights.
However, the tender does not guarantee the success.
"The right to flee the right to flee the points of JAT is a true.
It's a representative, but only before the company's debt and workers is a condition that it is up to the high level of work, "he said.
In Belgrade, political opposition opposes the tender.
The Serbian Radical Party says JAT's assets is 220m euros and the government wants to sell the lowest prices.
"The Serbian government's decision to sell the JAT's strategic partnership model is a plan to give the company's goods at almost soon, and to raise the JAT's debt and increase Serbian citizens," Radikal Party said.
The board, a strong air carrier, has been reduced in operations over the past 20 years.
According to official data, only 14 mobile mobile phones -- 7,300 Bosniees and four ATRM -- are currently under way, according to official data.

In an effort to show Turkey's leader in Libya, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu arrived on Tuesday (August 23rd) to meet with leaders of the National Assembly (NTC) and visited Binginghi's first foreign minister to visit Libya since the residential National Council (NTC).
During his visit, Davutoglu confirmed that NATO support will be the need for security, secure, democratic, stability, stable and united Libya.
Davutoglu said the Libyan Contact Group's political inspectors are concerning issues concerning the meeting in Istanbul on Thursday.
"The reason for Turkish foreign policy is the reason for this reason," said Joshua Wiler. "The international community's external policy, speaking on the international community, and that would not be part of the first political leader in Libya's influence in the Libyan population."
Coming: A special webpage panel news and information from Turkey.
Visit Be.com is more than ten months.
Chamber: There is a special news site on Turkey.
In the coming weeks to pay more information.
In February, the details against Colonel Muammar Gaddafi began to the Turkish sanctions and NATO intervention.
Turkey has been charged with a "farming entity", calling on interests and ideology to seek their ideas.
Turkey's weaknesses to Kaddafi was the most prominent economic interests in the development and construction sector.
About 25,000 Turkish citizens worked in Libya, and the promotion firms have been taken over <unk> 20m.
In May, however, Turkey urged Kaddafi to resign and recognise the NTC in early July.
The country has also played a vital role in support of the residents.
In July, Turkey hosted a fourth Libyan Contact Group meeting in Istanbul, and has been sparked to the residents in a few weeks, which are in the last few weeks to do with Trajlus.
Turkey has repeatedly left the international community to recognise the international community, and has revealed that the residents will be under pressure.
As the NTC and friendly relations, Turkey is now on a major economic and political role in Libya.
"Turkey will continue to build a economic network with Libya before Arab BC, but now it will continue democratic markets in the region," said Dishne McClic, a senior researcher at the Middle East Democracy Project (POD), a senior researcher for the Central Democracy (POD).
"Turkey is now one of the most important factors in many areas, because Ankara has the opportunity to provide regional influence and support.
As NATO membership and the OIC presidency, it may be a bridge of international support for Libyan support in a united Libya for a united Libya, "he said.

"The people in Libya are a mistakes for regional leaders.
"They have shown that the leaders will not leave their homes in power," he warned.
Syria's remarks continue to be reflected by Turkey, and Davutoglu said there is no reason to be addressed by the reform commitments, but Turkey has not invited to consult its relations with Esad.
Nevertheless, Libyan experience shows that Turkey's position is very quickly changing, and the Esad regime may be able to do so.
"If no one in Syria is in Syria, it will continue to continue this relationship between Esad and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"Even if Turkey was in Libya, the problem has made a concrete action in the international community, it will not be a concrete action in the international community when it comes to us or Turkey's leadership," he said.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrived in Serbia on Tuesday (August 23rd), and a message to President Boris Tadic was not the murder of many exhibitions.
During the talks, Merkel established connection between Serbia's European integration process.
This was the latest message that Serbian authorities are willing to reflect the details of Kosovo's European integration.
Merkel's message was aware: Germany wants to see Serbia in the EU, but it should allow dialogue with Pristina, progress in dialogue with Pristina, which should allow EULEX to operate in the entire territory of Kosovo, and that should be removed "parallel structures" in Kosovo.
"Germany recognised Kosovo, while Serbia has recognised.
This is a situation that needs to be made, "he said.
However, he did not require Belgrade to recognise Pristina's independence as an official recognition.
Belgrade is seen as its own state institutions that operate in Kosovo, not more independence.
The Kosovo issue is a long time, Merkel said, but that it is expected to be deepen to Belgrade if it is expected to move forward to EU membership.
"Therefore, it is better to solve the problems today," he said.
Tadic said that "parallel structures" do not respond to the claims, but said Serbia has its own principles and that it is "unprecedented".
"Serbia has its own principles to resolve the conflicts and we want to find a very practical way to protect all people in the region," Tadic said.
He pledged that Serbia will continue dialogue with Pristina authorities.
Predrag Simic, professor of the Belgrade Political Sciences Faculty of Political Sciences, said Merkel's message should accept the Ahtisaari plan on Kosovo.
"Belgrade will have to accept the implementation of the Ahtisaari plan and will be the way for EU membership," Simic told SETimes.
Serbia rejected the Ahtisaari plan for the country's allies in the UN Security Council -- Russia and Chinese -- to block the plan's approval.
The plan envisions independence of Kosovo's independence.
Belgrade supports Serbs living in northern Kosovo, where Pristina institutions do not operate.
"The potential of these institutions will be deeply worse for the interests of the Serb community in Kosovo, as well as for the interests of the Serb community in the province," Kosovo Project Project Director Aleksandar Mitic told SETimes.
Pristina officials have repeated Merkel's messages.
Kosovo Deputy Prime Minister Hajder Kufi said Belgrade has received "clear and fair messages".
Analysts, however, say Merkel's visit was more deeper.
He said that this is Serbia's first factor in this agriculture, which has been declared by a G7 members since it declared independence with Montenegro in 2006.
"This is important because it is the finance of the documentation of all euro zone in the entire economic crisis, and in a deeper economic crisis," Simic said.
Since 2000, Germany has invested 1.27 billion euros in Serbia.
Serbia exports to Germany to 760m euros, while Germany's exports to Serbia amounted 1.3 billion euros.

A pre-election campaign for next year's general elections in Serbia is now trying to punish voters, while political parties are trying to punish voters and various parties that promote various parties.
President Boris Tadic's ruling coalition, led by President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party, has suggested that it is an example of the successful policies in the process of employment and achieving progress in the EU integration process.
The opposition, however, has criticised the low standard of living standards and widespread corruption.
Public voter analyst Srdjan Bogosavljevic stressed that the lack of living standard could create a major impact on the future election.
"The citizens are very happy.
The average average salary in Serbia has been reduced in the past three years.
There is a good change, but citizens do not know they will vote for the current candidate airport. "
He believes the public expects more than more than political changes in 2000, and the disappointment of genocide has started to be disappointed.
Bogosavljevic expects representatives of the ruling coalition's ruling coalition "will not sustain the economic crisis" and that the political amendments will stop Serbia's stability ".
Meanwhile, Bogosavljevic predicts that the opposition would focus on bad economic situation to support its campaign.
Analyst says the Kosovo issue would be "a nationalist reality", as well as the opposition's representative to the opposition.
"Kosovo does not be used to be used for serious tensions."
"In the future campaign, the opposition will be more easily easily easily, because the authorities will have to reflect the criticism of the action and to improve their lives," Democratic Party spokesman Jelena Trivan told SETimes.
Trivan said the government could be pushing for the beginning of the economic recovery.
Some EU countries have not been able to face excessive debt, with bankruptcy or international financial institutions.
"We will emphasise the progress made in European integration, as well as the fight against organised crime and the fight against organised crime and judicial reform," Trivan said.
According to the polls, the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) is taking part in the benefit of the votes.
SNS official Marko Curic said his party's election campaign would focus on "deepening and detailed".
He adds that the ruling coalition's impressive class, while the majority of citizens contribute to the factor of the majority.
"We will submit a concrete programme in all areas of the society.
Anti-corruption platform has announced and we will submit our plans in all other areas, especially in the economy, "he said.
He expects the campaign to be "unacceptable" and see Tadic's Democratic Party as the biggest political opponent.

Many have been surprised by the reduction of the number of Roma, though traditional gas rates were taken into account by 0.2% in 2001, when the traditional gas rates were taken into account.
The reason for this reason is that many Roma are linked to reviving the question about ethnic life, he said, citing them as the possibility of Bulgarian or other ethnic groups.
Roma continue to be the third ethnic community.

We have many people, and some are not in Bulgaria during the census of the census, "he said.
"Another factor is to live.
In Kycin, there are many villages who live in the majority, "he added.
Macedonian community representatives said they claimed that the number of Macedonians were lower than 1,600 people and that the community does not recognise the results of the results.

The AKP has made a national priority for developing the country's local armed industry and launched a policy to boost state investments in 2004 to boost the local research and development sector.

"The AKP's conservative past has helped the work of these markets that the United States, European and Eastern Asian states are under pressure."
Nevertheless, Turkey has yet to push military relations with the Middle East and Turkish companies face challenges with major exports, such as the United States and European countries.
However, he believes, "Turkey will invest more in this relationship in the coming years".
Aram Nerizizas, a professor at the Strategic and International Security Centre for Strategic and International Security Centre for Security, says "one of the main motives of military co-operation with Gulf countries [is] the main motives of military co-operation with the United States, for example, as well as Turkey to make it closer to the region," the
"If Turkey can reflect its role in the Middle East and its leadership, it could offer a sense to accept Turkey to accept the EU.
In addition, the Middle East countries can have a growing role in the region, against Iran, against potential potential perspective, "he says.
However, he opposes, saying "Turkey's experience in the Middle East and the EU's" is not in the United States and the EU's "how Turkey's progress in the Middle East.
However, the region's unprecedented unprecedented, Ankara's efforts to enter the Middle East market.
Turkey's consensus with Syria are resolved, and Turkish initiatives seem to confiscate trade interests.
Meanwhile, a key weapons producer, Israel, has made it clear that the countries' military co-operation.
According to Nergija, the incidents in the Middle East reflected "a lot of questions about Turkey's role in which the conservative Arab monuments are focused on stable and mutually focused on the role of the Arab monuments".

Around 1.6 million vehicles are threatening potential security and traffic security and environmental threat in Romania. [File]
More than half years ago, almost half of Romania's registered vehicles have been impossible.
Most of them were produced in Dacia, Batia, Tancic and Aro factory.
Some of the former vehicles have been imported from Western Europe after the communist era, but these are not good.
About 350,000 vehicles are on 20.
This is a potential threat to traffic safety by 1.6 million vehicles, and also seen as a reason for air circumstances.
"The average salaries of vehicles are 13.5.
We cannot prove them, because such a decision has sparked serious social results.
But we have to protect the quality of the airport, "he said.
Authorities started steps on the issue.
As part of the scandal programme launched by the ministry, vehicles will be able to pay their lives in the railway networks for 930 euros.
This money can only be used for a new vehicle.
However, the programme does not have their own problems.
The money from the programme is under way to buy a new vehicle -- the most cheaper factory is about 4,000 euros.
The average monthly salary is 185 euros, 182 euros, or 62 euros in a country where many are in a country with average pension pension.
Most are using the old vehicles because there is no other option.
Some people are looking to sell old vehicles to sell the government programme.
That has led to a significant rise of the prices of the old car prices.
"I can sell about 100 months ago, but I can sell <unk> 100, but I don't sell <unk> 500.
"I am happy and I will receive <unk> 700 checkpoints to Renault Clio," he said.
The programme's critics say it has used to win a modern railway in Romania and to increase the public's sales to a new car system.
"This will not create an important effect on the quality of EU aspects, but we will not have a major impact on the quality of Hava quality, but we will not create a part of the amount," the former environment ministry expert Catalin Gurau said in an interview with Catalin.
Another obstacle is insufficient.
The programme is only 12m euros, and only 14,000 former medics, meanwhile, meanwhile, means that only 1 per cent of the number of targets will be removed.
However, officials say the programme would be successful if it is successful.

Verheugen said the European Commission supports Romania's aspirations to start accession talks in 2004, adding that it would be linked to preparations for the country's preparations.
Verheugen also voiced hope that Romania could be acceptable in the country's status status, as well as in the European Commission report next year.

The next step is EULEX's mandate in the completion of Kosovo's territory. "

Now, however, strengthening the new constitution.

The parliamentary commission, which prepared Montenegro's new constitution, was released on Tuesday (January 16th) after opposition members rejected their participation.
However, there is still no sign of broad consensus.
The ruling and opposition parties have not yet reached many issues, such as the right to vote abroad, and that Montenegro should not have a right to vote, and that Montenegro should not be recognised as a "state or a" state ".
While the ruling Socialist Democratic Party (DPS) wants to adopt any attempt to lead the constitution to losing Montenegro's state, the pro-Serbian opposition wants to keep a referendum on a referendum on the future reunification with Serbia.
"The government is trying to facilitate the possibility of citizens to make the possibility of deciding different decisions," said Velikar Kalucerovic, senior official of the Socialist People's Party (SNP).
The SNP also wants to recognise Montenegro's citizens who live in Serbia, which opposes the right to vote for the end of the state union.
The government faces an official remarks, particularly the Serbian pro-Serbian opposition.
The opposition argues that 63% of the population census speak to Serbs, but only 26% of the Montenegrin speech.
Meanwhile, the Bosniak parties want to change the military intelligence and flag, despite the military intelligence and flag, Islamic tradition.
"We don't agree that the state symbolic symbols should not be recognised to see them as such as those who are injured.
Some symbolic symbolic symbols, "he said.
The DPS and Social Democratic Party (SDP) praised Montenegro's sovereignty as a "sovereignty", while Bosniak and Serbian lawmakers say the new constitution should not recognise Montenegro as a society.
According to them, Bosniaks and Serbs should be part of the Montenegrin state.
However, the DPS says it could lead to a separate demand.
According to the law, the constitution must vote in a two-third majority in parliament to be adopted.
If only a couple majority -- the ruling owners -- must be approved by a referendum.
"There is a broad consensus on the constitution.
"We cannot prove if the new constitution political forces, NGOs, NGOs and people are unable to reach a debate," he said.
Montenegro wants to join the CoE, but must not stop the constitution.
The CoE requests Montenegro to recognise an "absolute state as an absolute state," and to boost a law on civilian forces and security forces, the Podgorica daily Vijesti reported on Wednesday.
Political analyst Milos Besic says a compromise would be reached at the end, but could need to be needed in the EU intervention.
"Some of the European institutions are likely to make a medieval arrangement under a compromise declaration.
A house can be transferred during the talks, "he said.

According to Barroso, eight EU countries are completely dependent on Russian gas.
"We need to protect the risk of the risk of the risk of foreign supplies to external supplies," the EC chief said.
The dispute on gas supplies between Russia and Ukraine has been a reason for some EU countries in the 2006 conflict, and the Union has asked the Union to ensure more diversification of energy sources and supplies.
In August, the conflict in the village of Kafi has repeatedly discovered Europe's confidence.

"For the EU's 20-20-20-20-20-2020 goals, the EU will be necessary in the coming years to ensure electricity and gas supplies for all EU citizens," the EC said in a statement.
The report also includes six strategic projects that are important for EU energy security. The Balestinian Academy, the South Stream gas supplies, the South Stream gas supplies, the Mediterranean gas supplies, the Mediterranean Sea, Central and South East Europe and the North Sea.
If the governments and the European Parliament passed the package, the Balestinian Framework Plan will be launched next year.
The project, which covers gas, electricity and index police issues, will connect the city in Estonia, Latvia, Latvia and Litva.
The three Balestinian countries, which are also linked to Russian energy networks, are among eight EU member states that have been met with Russia.

The EC promised to use current vehicles in the six projects, including organisations in third countries, emphasised that all entities need to show a serious profit in order to implement the projects needed to implement the implementation of the projects.
"This work is a basic factor of the EU's reaction to the current financial crisis, and that the reaction of employment should be accelerated, and should be accelerated in order to be accelerated," the commission said.
The EC also invested a series of new proposals on energy efficiency, including the review of the buildings and energy efficiency on energy efficiency.
To ask all new buildings with the new buildings with all new buildings and important buildings, the EC said the implementation could provide 5-6 per cent energy bill by 2020.
The commission asked the Union to comprehensive rules for energy test -- not only the houses -- but not only the houses of different products.
In the framework of a legal regulation, a new energy test will be recognised and will be allowed to be slowed by consumers.
The commission believes that consumers could reduce similar cuts by 10 per cent to lower cuts.
The EC is also planning to implement a bid for street and businessman telecommunications, street and other electricity telecommunications, and to invest a bid to harmonise the Union's Energy Executive Executive, energy and climate change.

Although the ruling coalition led by Serbian President Boris Tadic has been determined to speed up the pace of the European integration process, Kosovo has been considered a obstacle to Serbia's path to membership in February 2008, Kosovo has been unacceptable to Serbia's path.
Serbia removed hours before the EU's decision on Thursday (March 1st).
Serbian and Romanian officials have reached an agreement on Serbia's IT minority, and this has allowed Bucharest to withdraw the conditions for Belgrade.
The deal, which covers about 30,000 people living in the Romanian border, has not been announced.
The decision was announced by European Council President Herman Van Romest.
"I hope that this will encourage Serbia to boost efforts to meet the political and economic conditions for EU membership.
I hope that Belgrade will continue to support regional co-operation and good neighbourly relations in the Western Balkans, "he said.
Serbian officials welcomed status.
Tadic said his candidacy would open "closer to economic progress", but that Serbia is "very work" to take steps towards EU membership.
Laslo Vuda, head of the Serbian Parliament's European Integration Committee for European Integration, said the decision was sent to international community and foreign investors and a message that Serbia is "on a European country".
"In addition, candidate status will stop the trend of the support for EU integration in the country and will create new opportunities to use money from the money," Vuda told SETimes.
Vladimir Radomirorovic, however, says Serbia will not win many of its candidacy, because the money could be used for European funds only for certain projects.
"Serbia has not gone nothing in implementing EU candidate status, the web and Montenegro has not gone any winner.
The status situation is very high, and there is no way to prevent political corruption, "he said.
All parties in Serbia think that participation in the EU is a good blow.
Former Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's opposition Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) says the most political entity for Serbia is to stop the European integration, stop and conduct only economic relations.
DSS spokesman Petar Petkovic told SETimes that Serbia has lost more than 500m euros to implement the SAA.
"Serbia must establish a developed economic co-operation with all countries in the world through its political frustration, through the political frustration," Petkovic said.
The next step in Serbia's accession process is to take a date for the launch of EU membership talks and mean new, heavy recommendations.
Vuda believes that the date for Serbia is a realistic expectation in December because of the EU's economic problems, as well as economic problems within its own part of the EU.
"Belgrade will want to fulfil all agreements with Pristina and require a request for the institutions in northern Kosovo.
I don't think our next step towards the EU will be easy, "he said.
Radomirocic agrees.
"According to EU officials, Serbia could receive a date for opening talks in December.
So far, the main EU countries will have to demand Belgrade's positive invitation to Kosovo, especially in northern Kosovo, "he said.
Serbia's EU candidacy has different meetings.
Milovan Brkic, 33, said his candidacy is a good news.
"We have become closer to the EU, and this could only be better better," Brkic told SETimes.
Milena Srdic, 30, does not participate.
"Now will you live better
Can we will increase, more jobs
I don't believe that the EU has great financial problems, "he said.
In addition to candidate status, Serbia has been able to Macedonia and Montenegro, which has been candidate status since 2005 and 2010.
Croatia is prepared to join the Union in mid-2013, while Bosnia and Herzegovina signed the SAA in 2008.
This week, the Union gave a physical feasibility study for Kosovo.
Ashdown: First First Says BiH Says
The European Commission's recently endorsed Bosnia and Herzegovina's Feasibility Studies and must meet BiH's fulfillment to join the country by the end of June 2004.
By Antonio Prlenda for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo -- 26 / 12 / 03
In a recent speech to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) High Representative Paddy Ashdown stressed the importance of the future is the importance of the country's prospects for a possible future in the EU and NATO.
"If the next half of the year is not enough, Europe will have to have to be ready, if we have to be ready.
The European Commission will not be able to propose the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA).
The Fisibility Study Study says it is clear.
And if the future treasure is a way to be successful, it means the point.
This is the reason for the coming months to be important. "
Last month, the European Commission (EC) approved a Fibility Study for assessing BiH's Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) talks, aimed at assessing the necessary steps towards European integration.
BiH has made significant progress since the 1990s, but still has been made in the fight against serious weaknesses, the Fisibility Study says.
The EC hopes that BiH has made significant progress in the 16 areas that have been identified as a priority progress in the 16 areas, as well as significant progress in the implementation of the SAA talks, and that is more effective in the current international obligations, especially in line with European integration.
In the 16 conditions, four of the rule of law enforcement, a number of economic reform, particularly in the field of co-operation with the war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
"In the next year we have been very satisfied with member states that can start the SAA talks with BiH," EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner Chris Patten said. "We can make it serious and serious progress in the areas that we have defined that we are in the areas of recognition and progress."
"There is no reason for BiH's failure to reach this goal."
At a meeting of the ministers held on December 4th, NATO welcomed BiH's progress in the past time when the State Defence Prosecutor's Office is approved by parliament and the acceptance of the BiH Armed Forces, as well as the defence reform of the BiH Armed Forces.
The Alliance now emphasised that BiH must implement the Defence Reform for Peace (PfP) to receive an invitation for joining the Partnership for Peace (PfP) in Istanbul at the June 2004 summit.
The arrest of war crimes indictee Radovan Karadzic remains a key condition for PfP membership.
"There is many important decisions and a state business, which will be taken under the beginning of our initiative," Ashdown said in a diplomatic forum in Sarajevo. "It is that there is no longer no longer delayed steps that have been delayed.
This country's time is reducing.
BiH will be able to fulfil this opportunity if it is set to fulfil the conditions, "he said.

Despite Croatia's increased GDP, the number of people living in poverty has not changed over the past ten years.
Although Croatia's GDP has been hiding over the past ten years, the number of people living under the poverty border has not changed since 1999.
According to government data, Croatia's economy was more accelerated than EU member states, but the number of people living in poverty was the same.
Local social assistance in Croatia are paying only 55 euros per month due to resources.
For low pensions and salaries, almost 500 Croats live under the social insurance border, which means that they need to live in the high level of social insurance, which is needed to live with large insurance.
Most of these people live in rural areas, and they are working with their lives.
Many are not seen in accordance with the need for help.
Nearly 2 per cent of GDP -- half of GDP -- is spent on the only personal families.
One third of the remaining is children and children.
More than half of the people from social aid are about 40.
More than 40 per cent of the aid areas have been unable to replace school, a third third of the schools.
Regional meanwhile, Croatia's eastern and eastern coastal parts of the country.
More than 70 per cent of the acceptations have been deployed in central and eastern Croatia.
More than several people live in areas in the 1990s conflict.
The government is working on developing a National Health Strategy, which will develop the social prosperity system as one of the measures to promote the social prosperity system.
The new criteria will provide financial assistance to the state, and the current system is closely closely closely.
For example, it was only 214 euros per month, but only 214 euros per month, a person has the right to help the needs.
"Therefore, the number of goods is one of the models for new social policy," said Health and Social Affairs Minister Neven Ljubicic.
As part of the planned reform framework, every citizens will be provided by a state.
The citizens will need to be able to make all future and property countries.
Authorities will decide on these information, saying that no one will not receive financial aid.

A IMF delegation headed by Peter Doyle is in Belgrade for two weeks.
The goal of the visit is to see what the Serbian government has signed with Fund and see how much progress has made in line with inflation -- 15.5 per cent in the framework -- the highest rate of inflation, and accelerating and structural reforms.
They have been under way for the next monitoring programme, following the three-year arrangement.
Belgrade has agreed to launch major reforms, such as privatisation or closer than the remaining 700m-euro debt of the Paris Club.
According to the Fund, these changes have to create a more efficient investment environment.
However, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic don't think a new regulation arrangement on "the time" is not true.
Such statements are worried about economists.
Experts are concerned about about about half of his mandate, the current government is trying to win a season in order to win the implementation of business reforms.
Financial experts and the IMF's positive assessment is low.
A few months ago, Dinkic said the new arrangement should not be proposed by Montenegro's status.
Although the referendum was held in May and Montenegro is now independent, it was not yet a letter from Belgrade.
"I don't think it is not clear that I don't be sent to be sent," Central Bank Governor Radovan Jelasic said.
Bozidar Delic, a former finance ministers, believes that the IMF is very needed.
"The fact that we have more active than our money, responsible policies and control.
In the future, Serbia will have the coalition governments that are working under daily pressure and not prepared to prepare the country's 21st century, "he said.
In a environment, it may be very important to pressure from international financial institutions to make any way.

Croatia's Military Elections
The lawmakers in Croatia will reflect two major parties in Sunday's elections.
Unfortunately, the next government will be a coalition, and the first mandate will be to be negotiating for Croatia's cabinet.
By Ivana Ercel for Southeast European Times in Zagreb - 20 / 11 / 03
The benefit between Prime Minister Ivica Racan's Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the Croatian Democratic Union of Croatia (HDZ), is sceptical of the parliamentary elections Sunday (November 23rd).
Both parties also stressed that the country will travel to the EU.
In the public polls, HDZ also envisions the centre-right coalition force from the SDP.
The HDZ, which won 20 per cent and 28 per cent of the vote, is at 2 per cent to 9 per cent.
Analysts say the centre-right coalition partner, the main coalition partner in the elections, which has been pushing for a higher participation and brothers in the elections.
Meanwhile, the Croatian People's People's Party (HNS) has made it clear that it would leave the next coalition with the SDP.
However, HNS has decided to enter together with some small political parties because it wants to sustain the political force as independent.
That could lead to divisions.
If no party opposes any victory, the next government will be a coalition, and the main tasks will be to negotiate for Croatia's cabinet.
Croatia, which is in February, hopes to begin its application for EU accession talks with the bloc and Romania in 2007.
However, the opportunity to make this goal has been jeopardised because of the fugitive retired General Ante Gotovina, who was arrested by at least 150 ethnic Serbs during the 1991-1995 war crimes tribunal.
Croatia's EU membership depends on full co-operation with The Hague tribunal.
Several times, the EU has made it clear that Croatia expects Gotovina to extradite to The Hague.
HDZ President Ivo Sanader said his party is very different to the country during the war crimes, and that "even if General Gotovina" will be able to co-operate fully with the UN tribunal ".
In addition, Sanader also called for Serbs to return to the Serbs to return.
Rakakians see the HDZ's move as an election principle.
Some warn that the party will continue to create the party's scandal, warning that nationalist voters will continue to create a party climate.
Young voters are different.
The ultranationalist victory, which won the HDZ in January 2000, was a chance point in the country's political life.
Racan and coalition partners have pledged to transform Croatia into a stable democracy.
After the ruling, however, the coalition was sparked by an attractive attraction to the book.
Corruption from the previous regime was unable to deal with corruption, because of the unemployment rate in September was not reduced by 18.3 per cent.
Racan's government has sparked the support of the Croatian citizens, sparked to the central coalition's support.
The HDZ, meanwhile, has always been finished to rebuild and strengthen the organisation.

The indictment wants to change the law to allow the law to be changed in order to find a solution.
However, the government does not change its position.
"Macedonia is not the first country to decide on full implementation of smoking in public areas, and the last country will not be the last country," Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Pesevski said.
Citizens are seen in the law.
The government has conducted 1350 studies in the country, restaurants, hotels and clubs, and only two violations in Kumanovo and Gostivar.
The council's violations were sentenced in the case, and has been punished to businesses.
The money is changed between 150-300 and 1,500 euros for individuals.
The law could be closely closely closely to 30 days.
Prosecutors took place in public companies and local government agencies and a single violation of a single violation.
However, 19 violations of the "smoking" have ordered for no victory.
"The law should be good and changed," Skopje residents Zoran Stefanovski told SETimes. "I don't have to do with my family a few days ago, and I don't go to really really.
People should not be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to smoke in the cities. "
They believe that the law is more active.
Olympeta Pankova believes that "European laws" should be warning and allow the government to allow smoking victims.
"If there is a victory for the mountains, they can decide on whether to enter such barriers, such as smoking," Pankova said.
Opposition lawmakers Vlado Buckovski and Gorgano Oresrovic started to sign a procedure to change the law.
"We don't think that this law is impressed to the model for smoking, which allows to apply smoking for smoking for smoking, which allows to apply smoking for smoking," Buckovski said in a statement to send the 100m square metres on smoking.

"It is strong, fair and multiethnic legal institutions for all communities," EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon said. [Getty Images]
According to local media reports, a new preparation by the Kosovo government and the International Civilian Intelligence (ICO) has been drawn criticism from Serbian representatives, a new approach and a new approach to the north of Kosovo.
The strategy envisions establishing the establishment of a North Mitrovica municipality by mid-year.
The plan envisions the Kosovo government to organise local elections in three northern municipalities, including Zvecan, Leposavic and Zubin Potok.
According to Pristina, the new approach would help Serb structures operating in this part of Kosovo, which envisions the presence of EULEX's presence.
"It is strong, fair and multiethnic legal institutions for all communities.
This judge will be trust and will be very important, "he said.
De Kermabon said EULEX's top priority would be to ensure the restructuring of the Kosovo Serb and Albanian judges and prosecutors to replace the Mitrovica Regional Court, local, multiethnic and unilateral judicial system.
"There is no other place in Europe, and there is no two judicial system.
The two judicial authority will lead to justice, and will prompt the rules against humanitarian rights.
A single judicial system in Kosovo may be only a single judiciary, "he said.
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci voiced support for the new strategy.
"All the rule of law in all Kosovo territory is also meant to prevent the obstacles from the obstacles from those who recognise structures or recognise Kosovo's institutions," Thaci said.
He added that the new plan aims to improve the economic situation in the region.
"Stratea has four main areas: strengthening the rule of law, strengthening the rule of law, decentralisation and new municipalities in northern Mitrovica, and improving local governments in three northern municipalities, and improving the economic situation in this part of Kosovo."
According to Milan Ivanovic, the head of the Serbian National Council of Northern Kosovo, Serbs want to remain in Belgrade's constitutional and legal system.
Therefore, the new plan will lead to stable stability in the north.
"The strategy, which aims to work in the Resolution 1244, is a organisation that aims to work in Kosovo, which aims to make an independent Kosovo, which has created an independent organisation that has created independent Kosovo," Ivanovic said.
Serbian President Boris Tadic told Glas Srbije that the Kosovo issue has not been closed to Serbia.
Belgrade wants to negotiate with Kosovo Albanians to find a compromise "in Kosovo".
Tadic stressed that Serbia will "recognise Kosovo's independence", but stressed that "the lives of Kosovo Albanians" are not in The tribunal.
Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu told the World Relations Council on January 12th that Kosovo is facing challenges in the north, "which is supported by Belgrade supported by Belgrade's".
"There are many people who are in justice in these structures.
They have the people who have crimes committed in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo.
"If these people are not interested in the justice, Kosovo will be able to destabilise the stability in this part, which is turned into a region that is transformed to the justice," he said.

According to local media reports, problems began after a meeting with US Secretary of State Nicholas Burns.
First, co-ordinator Blerim Shala, co-ordinator of Rugova's appointment, cited Daci's approval.
Daci, a lot of frustration, was not taken to make Sala's proposal for creating working groups.
He accused Shala of "unfortunately, unfortunately," unfortunately, who has not been able to make the policy decisions ".

Shala also used a TV station in the KTV TV station that the leader of the ORA party, Veton Surroi, a team of more than 200,000 other members.

In recent years, financial revenues in Serbia have been accelerated.
That is why Serbia's Central Bank of Serbia (NBS) has to file them with new regulations.
The financing sector has come to live for similar individuals and companies.
Consumers and textile equipment, such as financing in Serbia, include consumers and textile equipment, such as commercial and buildings, TV and houses.
Serbs have been punished against such goods over the years and the economic stalemate, which has been increasingly opposed to such goods, while they are unregistered in the short term, are unregistered.
According to official data, the Serbian financing market was 220m euros in the first ten months of 2004.
This figure is in the first six months of the amount of the amount, which was made in the first six months of 2003.
According to the new regulations, the financing of financing companies have to invest in the NBS to invest reserves, while the institutional revenue needs to be revealed at the level.
All participants in the market will be conducted by the Central Bank and will have to pay at least 100,000 euros, but financing companies will have to pay a serious plan and adequate staff in future trade activities.
Many consumers will be unhappy, but only 2,000 euros will be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed for the quality of values in Serbia's average annual salary -- including food and biometric consumers.
It's the first stake in the transport sector.
Serbia's average homeland or commercial season, while demands for new vehicles with the opening of the economy will increase in the EU.
NBS officials, however, insisted that the goal of new rules is not to keep citizens, but not because of financial financing.
In addition, authorities have signed consumers to sign all the conditions without regulations, so many have always declined to defence programmes, they say.
"We have to be able to make the circumstances of the consumption companies, such as our banking loans," NBS Director Dejan Simic said.
Finnish revenue companies argue that this would increase service.
The only reason is that this is the only reason for this reason is to submit a better revenue, because they do not have to invest to invest in the Central Bank.

The two countries -- Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Serbia -- Serbia -- rejected a deal on free trade zone in Southeast Europe on 9 November.
To resolve the remaining dispute points from 19 December to 19 December, countries will risk the risk of losing a market, which is worth 40 million people.
The current Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) is planning to replace the city's secular city, which will expand its presence in Albania, BiH, Croatia, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro and Kosovo.
The deal is very important for the enlargement of the region.
"The lack of co-operation is not a condition for the success," Stability Pact head Erhard Busek said last week. "The lack of success is not a condition for the growth of the market, not the development of the market.
"We need to open European markets through regional co-operation through regional co-operation."
BiH and Serbia oppose a deal with the current agreement.
Sarajevo wants to be removed in a matter that allows products from Croatia, Croatia and Serbia to make a temporary date.

Croatia's own producer, Rovinj, is preserving 38% customs tax.
Serbia, meanwhile, has been implemented by a small tax (15%), but is preserving high consumption taxes (Philip Morris and British American Tobacco).
Foreign Economic Relations Minister Millatko Pariarovic announced that he would soon be in Zagreb to find a solution to the solution.
The markets are promoted to protect customs intelligence with CEFTA, and say free trade figures would harm the country in the long term.
BiH and Serbia's economies do not have a lot of competitiveness forces in the region, which will be completely completely restored in 2010.
That would make them clear to the global competitiveness pressure.

Turkish officials said on Tuesday that the intervention to open Turkish ports and airports would not help resolve the problem to resolve the Cyprus traffic.

"The issues such as Cyprus cannot solve or intervention," Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said in Ankara. [Getty Images]
Turkey said on Tuesday (November 21st) that the EU is not planning to open its ports and airports, such as demanding a day ago.
"The issues such as Cyprus or intervention," Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul told reporters after talks with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Turkey's chief negotiator, Ali Babacan in Ankara.
Gul's statement warned that Finnish Prime Minister Mladi Vanhanen's warning that Turkey's accession talks could be resolved within the next two weeks if it is under way to meet its trade commitments on Cyprus.
"We cannot be possible if we are unacceptable conditions are acceptable," the AFP quoted Erdogan as saying on Tuesday.
Ankara signed a protocol on a customs union agreement with Brussels in October 2005, several months before the start of accession talks with the EU in 1963, including Cyprus.
In May 2004, only a few days after the Greek Cypriot part of the island, which is recognised by the EU as the whole island, the Greek Cypriots joined the bloc's plan to reunite themselves with Turkish Cypriots in the north.
Although the deal was accepted by the majority of the Turkish Cypriots recognised by Ankara, it was unacceptable to the 25-nation bloc.
Despite its obligations under the customs protocol, Turkey has refused to allow Greek Cypriot ships and airports to enter the ports and airports.
Instead, the country insists that the EU would allow the economic isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community to implement the implementation of the Turkish Cypriot community.
Finland, which aims to end this impasse, would allow Turkey to enter its ports and airports to ports and airports, while the Famagusta port in northern Cyprus proposed a compromise that would be opened with the 25-nation bloc.
At the same time, the town of Vararoa will return to the old Greek Cypriot residents.
However, the Finland's proposal envisions the opening of the Armenian airport in the Turkish part of the Turkish part of the Ergenan airport in Cyprus.
The British daily quoted the British daily as saying that if the ruling Justice and Development Party accepts the agreement, it would be a great political risk in the next year's general elections.
Gul, who is scheduled to visit Finland on Sunday, said Ankara does not reject the Fund's plan and said the proposal is still "still discussed".
"We are interested in the presidential efforts, and we support these efforts," Gul said in a statement Tuesday. "We have long time."

PASOK sparked the ruling centre-right New Democracy (ND) party in the early elections Sunday (October 4th).
Now, the PASOK led by George Papandreou should be able to congratulate its neighbours, leaving Turkey and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with its immunity.
"Papandreou's very global minister has a more global minister, and the EU wants to become a major role in Greece," political analyst George Kirstos told SETimes on Monday.
According to Kirirstos, PASOK will likely be on the agenda of the former government's agenda with Macedonia.
The committee of Athens is under pressure on its neighbourly "northern", such as growth in international relations.
According to Paschos Mandravelis, however, the Macedonian government is unlikely to accept this demand.
Some experts believe that the secular name issue may be a problem on the region's European integration.
The country will not be an important change in its policy towards Turkey, he said.
Ankara will continue to meet the requirements for membership.
Papandreou has criticised Greece's former government and accused former Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis of "piece" to stop the country's EU bid after Greece rejected former Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis.
However, he believes Papandreou's government will continue to continue "deeper" ", while others from the European community to Turkey's EU path.
It is not expected to be a member of Turkey's near future, and there is nothing that Greece will lose a compromise position.
Amid PASOK victory, Kirstos and other analysts have surprised the party's failure to win a major difference.
"The Greek voters have assured the message that they want an effective and effective government," he said.
Other parties were the most winner in the elections, the centre-right centre-right Populer Union (LAOS), which is recognised by national issues.
Girirstos, party and founder, former ND lawmaker George Karacafis, noted that the documentation of "extremism" is deepening factors, but nothing more populist, tolerance and tolerance.

The EULEX court on Friday (October 2nd) punished three members -- Latin Gashi, Nazatin Mehmeti and Remiro-Remij-Remij-Remij-Remij-Remij--Remij--Remij--Remij--Remij---Remij---Remi
EULEX said the third was charged with humanitarian exercises for civilian arrests.
The latest case against the most famous province opened in Pristina's District Court on 7 July.
However, only the last part was.
The first investigation into the case was reached by 2001.
First, he was convicted in 2003 and was sentenced to prison sentences.
In 2005, however, the Kosovo Supreme Court decided to rebuild the restructuring.
The result of this case was repeated by the government.
"The war of Kosovo's Council of Ministers was the war, fair and all Kosovo citizens," he said in a press release after Friday's decision.
EULEX responded to this statement Saturday.
"EULEX wants to convince the Framework Court -- a comprehensive judge -- a Kosovo judge and two EULEX judges -- and that every exercise is based on the legality of the law.
EULEX supports the Kosovo government's commitment and commitment to the rule of law and unfair justice.
The donation is very important to ensure that the Kosovo judiciary must meet European standards. "
Mustaf-Remi, a lawmakers from the Democratic Party of Kosovo, and the head of parliament's Security and Interior Affairs Commission, dismissed a press conference after the sentence was announced.
"Today's justice system has been done within the justice system.
This is an external intervention.
However, we don't feel guilty to attract Nazi Gashi, nor Nazi Mehmeti, who is on the road to attract the sentence today, "said Latin Gashi, who was in a statement.
Mustafa-Remi said the Supreme Court is confident that the verdict will leave the verdict.
Kosovo's Alliance for Gordan (AAK) condemned the decision, calling it as a new action on the justice system on the Kosovo justice system.
"The EC has entered the establishment of a real justice system in the Republic of Kosovo, but continues to protect our common values as general, and maintain the secularism of the Kosovo Liberation Army," Ramush Haradinaj from the EC, said.
Croatia's government falls budget austerity
The old budget cuts, salaries, salaries and workers are living in Croatian citizens.
By Drazen Remikovic for Southeast European Times in Zagreb -- 06 / 03 / 12
The food prices and the VAT rates are waiting for the highest level of time, with Croats awaiting the highest level. [Reuters]
The first effects of austerity measures in Croatia were living on March 1st, when the government's VAT rate rose by 2% to 25%.
In Europe, only Iceland and Hungary's VAT rates are higher.
The food prices increased and the price of oil and natural gas reached by 3% on Tuesday (March 6th).
Finance Minister Slavko Linanovic said the VAT period could be reflected but necessary.
"The citizens means that the Veterans will not be used in the government and the administration, which will not be used to create employment," Linic told reporters in Zagreb earlier this month.
The VAT has proposed by the government for 2012, and the draft measures adopted by the government in February were only one of the "unrealistic and realistic" measures adopted by the government.
Croatia's state budget for 2012 is estimated at 14.6 billion euros, while spending spending in public sector salaries and workers will be able to reach 15.5 billion euros.
Fitch Crvenings confirmed this week as the lowest investment rating in Croatia's credit rating -- the BBB- - confirmed as the country due to its budget deficit.
Darko Solic, 28, from Zagreb, said the government is expected to make a austerity decision on salaries and workers.
"We cannot expect politicians to make their own salaries.
We must accept any austerity measures that every austerity measures will be deployed to citizens and workers, "he said.
Despite more than 660m euros, these amounts were dropped to 440 euros.
Economic analysts say the government should remain linked to austerity bills.
Zagreb Economic Institute Director Sandra Sandjek said the government's announcement is unrealistic.
"We can't get a lot of things," he told SETimes.
The government estimates that 0.8% GDP growth of 0.8% this year, but the analysts show that Croatia will have a negative GDP growth between 0.5% and 1.5%.
Even if the draft measures envisions, Croatia will continue to have a high budget deficit, "he said.
Many ministries received less than last year.
Agriculture Ministry estimates about 60 million euros to the budget, but the same amount was also cited from the budget.
The government has announced that the government has announced the job to work on railway businesses, and the state daily Vjesnik was removed from 180 employees.
At the end of February's Community Council, Croatian Chief of Community President Mladen Novosel, the head of the Croatian Chief of Community Chairman, was unable to pay social assistance, reducing workers' social aid to the public sector and end about 260m euros.
"If representatives of the government, I think that there are 5,500 people in the public sector, I think that these people are in the reason.
I do not have a direct response.
In Croatia over the past few years, more than 100,000 people have lost their job in the sector, "he said.
The Croatian Citizens Association said the government is surprised by 440 million euros to public spending, and reminded the first plan for more than 700m euros.
"We don't satisfy with the recognition of the new VAT rates.
The government announced on March 1st that it was recognised as a date for the GDP increase, many parts and sent a negative message to potential investors in Croatia, "he said.
MP MP Zlatko Tusak said reactions reacted by the new budget are rights.
"The proposed proposal has sparked many negative reactions, but revenues will be improved in the right direction within a few months.
However, workers in Croatia are in very poverty of the European average, "he said.

Under the deal, several other small parties will participate in the coalition.

The new government will head Ramush Haradinaj, leader of the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo. [AFP]
UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen welcomed the agreement between the Democratic Union of Kosovo (LDK) and the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) to form a coalition government.
"After the elections, I called on political parties to move forward by voters, and they have not been able to stay in the international intervention," Jessen-Petersen said after the announcement of the LDK spokesman Lulzim Zennen announced on Wednesday (November 17th).
UNMIK chief voiced confidence that "the new responsibility for the new institutions will prove their commitment to work together together with representatives of minority communities and prove our commitment to our common goal of a stable society".
The deal came three weeks after Kosovo's second parliamentary elections, which has been held under UN administration in 1999.
According to Zenul, many other small parties will participate in the coalition.
On 23 October, Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova's LDK party won 45 per cent of the votes, but did not have a majority.
The EC finished third with 8 per cent of the vote.
According to the AP, some international officials have suggested that the second largest Kosovo Albanian Party -- Hashim Thaci's Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) -- will spark a broad coalition that will include the votes.
The coalition will meet the opposition parties.
"PDK leader Hashim Thaci has nominated the prime minister and will not be acceptable if it is acceptable," PDK management board member Caval Haliti told a Kosovo daily earlier this month.
In addition to a similar message, AAK members said they would not participate in the government coalition if the prime minister is not allowed them.
Despite Wednesday's announcement, the majority expects Haradinaj's cabinet to head the cabinet, and expect Rugova will continue to continue the president.
The province's final status is expected to serve as part of the province's final status talks in mid-2005, when Kosovo has made significant progress in meeting the criteria in areas such as rule of law, minority rights and dialogue between Pristina.
In addition to the status talks, Haradinaj, a former KLA commander, will represent the province.
Haradinaj, however, was questioned by the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague last week over his role in the 1998-1999 conflict in the province.
UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte said he would issue new indictments about KLA members who are currently displaced by the end of the year.
Analysts say a crime against Haradinaj could lead to the government crisis.

"The nuclear power plant should be transferred to operate in order to build the nuclear power plant.
"There is a way to the creation of damaging radioactive radioactive actors which threatens the public health," Brace said, calling for the idea to submit the idea.
Berisha's administration said it could hold a referendum on nuclear energy in the future.
At the same time, the government has no controversial controversial energy sources.
Two major companies in Europe by the end of October have submitted major projects in the government.
One of the company has proposed to build a major wind power plant near Krievi, 50km from Tirana. The facility needs to invest 2000m euros for the facility of the facility.
The second company has offered a power power project, which will be established near Durres, 40km from Tirana.

Both sides are working in this stance, when a European minister is widely expected to speed up the process of building a better future for everyone.
As a member of the European family, Greece is seeking to work to join the EU as a key candidate for Turkey to join the EU.
Nevertheless, we should not reflect the problems in our relations.

Do you think that is the situation in this issue

He and other residents were forced to hand over the Austrian Empire in 1813, when the Ottoman Empire launched a strong supervision.
The Azech Corridor Church was 3500 square metres.

Last week in Belgrade, four members of the Serbian Renewal Movement began a new case on the murder of the Ibar Troika in October 1999.
The party's leader and late Serbian opposition leader Vuk Draskovic was condemned with the incident.
The trial began with a statement by Nenad Ilic, a former members of the Special Operations Initiative (JSO).
Ilic has been accused of being used in the murder.
In an investigation into the February 2001 murder, Ilic reiterated that he was part of the murder.
Now, he claims that he and his family will be given him for a few months in prison sentence, after a few months in prison sentence, promising that he and his family would be given to him to provide money.
According to Ilic Security Service, former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's complicated crime and believed that the case would be delayed or prevent Milosevic's extradition to The Hague.
Ilic has now accused Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic's close members of Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Cedomir Jovanovic, who is now in the assassination.
This is not surprised by Dragoljub Todorovic, the lawyer of victims' families.
"I don't think that Ilic has not been determined to assess the first judge's assessment.
No thing was issued by the Constitutional Court.
"I don't have any special impact on this case in this case without other details," he said.
In January 2003, the regional court sentenced a seven years in prison sentence in the case, former State Security Service chief and friendly Rade Markovic.
Two perpetrators were sentenced to 15 years in prison, with Nenad Bujjevic and Ilic, while the former head of the State Security Service in Belgrade's branch.
Markovic's lawyer, Toma Pala, claims that Ilic's latest coup is important, and that Jovanovic is valuable for the media.
However, he voiced concern about the final outcome of the case, due to the investigation is still expected.
According to Pala, Markovic was linked to the murder of Milosevic and the Ibar Treaty.
Ulem, known as Legija, is a former JSO chief charged with planned Djindjic murder.
In addition, the Ibar highlighted charges, but the murder of the killings of the Ibar highlighted.
In Belgrade, the first assassination in Djindjic's assassination in 1999, the scenario scenario is a unique between the killings of the killings in the 1999 murder.
JSO allegedly allegedly played in many murders in Serbia. The new investigations, which will be launched in the murder, are hoping to reach new figures for the perpetrators.

In the history of history, Kosovo and Albania's nationalist dynamic dynamic dynamic dynamic, Turkey is widely seen as pressure due to the Ottoman conviction of nearly five years.
However, the nationalist materials argue that this winter could have long-term impact in relations with Turkey, which won reunification in the region.
The Ottoman Empire and Turkey's history on the Albanian nationalism, told SETimes that the Ottoman Empire's history on the Ottoman Empire and Turkey's history reflects an effective judiciary that has been affected by the Albanian nationalism.
"All this phase is Europe's point of the chapter, Turkey's chapter, and it shows Turkey as a part of this village since 11 September."
In Kosovo, an prepared date for schools is the effect of Islamic's impact on the Ottoman era.
"The factors affected Islamic's broadcasting, preserving only the presence of the Christians to Istanbul, preventing the children's children's flexible tax, transportation of Islamic consumption and facilitate training in the province of the population."
It also discussed another issue between experts and historical experts, experts and historical issues discussed at the Ottoman Empire.
He argues that the Ottoman Ottoman's Albanian nationalism has shown its territory as a major warning.
"The Ottoman was not Turkish, most Albanians have time.
The Ottoman Empire and the Albanian Muslims, built their part in Europe, "he said.
This presents the Turks' talks with Turks, part of the Ottoman monument, which is part of the Ottoman monument of more than more than Albanian villages.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told the 19th century Egypt in Sarajevo that "I would not have an Ottoman tradition," Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu wrote to the 19th century Egypt.

"The Ottoman immunity has been interested in our Albanian territory," Koci said, arguing that "Any change is unchanged." In the history, any changes in the history, the history of history, the national identity of our national identity. "
However, the historic debate among the historic debate among the historic debate, Davutoglu, argued by Turkey's foreign policy, and that Turkey's common history and cultural donors, could be used "strategic deepening" to increase its influence in the region.
Now Ukaj, for example, is suspected of "broadcasting relations between Kosovo and Turkey".
"Our war in five years ago is that we have been warning that we have been translated into the world because we have been translated into the mistakes, bigger, bigger, bigger and the rest of the world," he said.
He warned that the negative image of the Ottoman image could have a impact on Turkey's tender for ethnic Albanians in the long term.
"Currently, Turkey is under a delay policy that wants to begin with the people in the Balkans, and that Ahmet Davutoglu wants to begin the beginning of date.
However, a few years after the Turks will start to change their position on Albanian broadcasters, "he said.

BiH has made a major process to fulfil its duties with the EU to fulfil its duties, if BiH is not in order to make progress in the Euro-Atlantic process, "he said.
Democratic Progress Party (PDP) President Mladen Ivanic says the parties are not interested in the government's formation of the government.

"We are waiting serious economic problems and a serious funding.

However, political analyst Tanja Topic says the latest talks showed that the government will soon be established soon.
He says the leaders are not willing to find a solution to the new government, but the political crisis must find ways to find a way.
According to Topic, the SDP has no longer risk in the elections, because it is the highest risk in the elections and because BiH's chances for the future.
"We are really in really really really really really to form a new government between the SDP, HDZ and SNSD, then the agreement will come to the day after the elections," Topic told SETimes.

Economy, transport and industrial ministries are preparing to work together with international advisers and the tender.
The company is expected to win the company's telecom tender, with 51 per cent of the firm.
ARMO's demand will not buy more than 51 per cent.
ARMO is also responsible for oil refineries in Ballysh and Fier, as well as customs and retail retail operations.

EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele assesses the EC progress report. [Reuters]
Authorities agree that the European Commission (EC)'s latest assessment on Bosnia and Herzegovina's progress towards EU membership is one of the most critical assessments.
"The EC report shows that all parties must be discriminated and detailed," European Integration Director Nevenka Savic told SETimes.
The report, presented on Wednesday (October 12th), points to a major obstacle, which is still a year after the elections.
The situation in politics, politics, economy and security is critical, and that BiH politicians have no common vision on any direction, the document says.
In addition to the fight against organised crime, the EC says, the economic and administrative reforms and improving improvements in the field of human rights, economic and administrative reforms.
In general, he described the implementation of reforms as "very slow".
Otherwise, the season is sparked to the scores of visa liberalisation in the Schengen season and start structural dialogue on judicial reform.
Do you think the negative reports from Brussels will do with local politicians
Most are concerned.
"The phase has to be more difficult, the majority of people are registered in the distinction of the EU visa policy," political analyst Vedran Cihic said. "At the time, BiH has also been spent in politics in the political element of the political element, which has been offered to offer its own normal crisis, as well as to the political distinction (
"I think the authorities are very satisfied with the report.
BiH's churches, especially in the Republika Srpska, are convincing that people can be easily easy, "he said.
According to Sarajevo commentator Senad Pecanin, "I think that BiH should not be able to enter the EU if this fall is more than ten years ago."
According to Pecanin, a part of the problem is that citizens are unwilling to combat the economic fight against the economic battle until they do not give up this issue.
According to him, warns from Brussels are more effectively affecting the public and they don't preserve political instrument.
"While there is no need to stay in the life, EU membership is a matter of concerning the public's ruling mechanism," Pecanin said.
Nevertheless, citizens of SETimes say they are worried in their hopes of change, but they are worried.
"All countries in the region are in BiH," Haris Halilovic, a broadcast meeting with Sarajevo administrative director Haris Halilovic said. "If the national interests are in the country, there is no progress in this country."

The 7th page report presented by EU security chief Javier Solana and Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn called on Monday (December 12th) to play a major role in the establishment of a EU force, including police functioning in the province after Kosovo's final status.
The report says the idea of the establishment of a EU police mission should be a priority in June.
On Monday, the document presented the EU foreign ministers in Brussels to discuss the prospects of EU enlargement in the Balkans.
"The EU can be able to take responsibility in the areas of police and rule of law," Reuters quoted the report as saying. "Police and the rule of law, and the rule of law." A possible emergency plan for the police and the rule of law [the SDP] mission should be launched. "
The two officials also urged the bloc to help strengthen the rule of law in Kosovo, with prosecutors, judges and prison staff, to help strengthen the rule of law in the province more than 50 per cent.
However, Rehn and Solana stressed that the bloc's mission is not to completely completely completely completely in the UN mission, which is currently under control of civil administration officers in the province.
The bloc will not create a "EUSAK", officials said.
Officials also warned that the EU will bring tensions within the bloc's 2013 budget, which has sparked tensions within the bloc, which has been the largest and unprecedented post in the bloc's role in Kosovo.
"In the EU's future international presence, the future of the future could be created for the establishment of any interim civil administration structure for the establishment of the status agreement, as well as for the establishment of police and rule of law," EU officials have urged EU officials to ensure sufficient funding.
The financial effect will likely be seen by EU leaders, which have not reached an agreement on the long-term financing of the bloc's long-term financing.
The current situation has created a impact on the Balkan policy, while Macedonia's budget concerns are already delayed because of its budget concerns about candidate status.
However, Rehn told reporters Friday, however, that Kosovo would not be sparked to the province because it is "important for the stability of the Western Balkans".
In his report, Rehn and Solana said how the status issue should be a European perspective for Kosovo.
However, officials said the EU's role would depend on the path of status talks, with demanding Serbia's demand for continuing sovereignty, with demanding the ethnic Albanian majority.

"There is a new approach, but police officers are not the target of classical and men," Mijjovic said.
While he was imposed to the public, he said there is no other way to strike for problems.

Albania's Socialist Party ended the parliamentary boycott last month after the two years of protests and strikes continued to end the parliamentary boycott, but an inadequate and delay action.
In the European Commission (EC) report released last month's Report Report (EC), Albania has no proposal for EU candidate status for many reform areas.
The EC pointed out that the SP's parliamentary boycott contributes to the slow pace of reforms, while the opposition is responsible for the government.
"Instead of reforms to improve the democratic standards, Albania has come ahead of a democration," Ditmir Busuli, a SP lawyer, told SETimes.
However, the SP said the government does not mean unprecedented support for the draft laws sent to parliament.
"Our duty is not the government's parliamentary statistical statistical statistical statistical statistical statistical statistical statistics on the law.
We want to move forward, and this is a real parliamentary initiative that will turn into the EU's recommendations, "he said.
The opposition has submitted a proposal that includes ten parties that have been covered in the appointment of both parties, such as the ombudsman and central bank director, such as the ombudsman and central bank director.
"Our awareness is not working to do, but to make the truth solution of the Albanian people," he said.
However, however, the party has sparked the union, but the SP is not stronger unanimous until the reforms will be held, and questioning the union of the party.
According to former SP leader Georgos Nano, the party is not serious to tackle reforms.
"There are no image," Nano said. [Getty Images]
Meanwhile, the divisions within the party will affect the party's ability to the leadership, Aleksandar Cipa, said.
"The opposition in the Rama has been very clear that the removal of visible and divisible divisible divisible," Cipa told SETimes.
"The problem is how to return to the parliament.
This movie is mixed and diaspora, such as the SP management, "he said.
"The opposition has taken the image of the country's image, reforms and [EU] integration process," he said.
Nevertheless, Albania's political impasse is more street than the end of the boycott.
"It is very important that the opposition will be returned to the parliament: free democratic dialogue," Mustafa Nano, a journalist from the journalist Mustafa Nano told SETimes.
However, Nano said the situation could be a positive side.
"The parliament will be approved due to a number of laws, laws, police and external pressure.
However, this is a small reminder, because the majority and the opposition will remain the same. "

However, fisheries are unrealistic.

Since January 1st, Montenegro has the right to exercise the right to free movement from EU member states.
So far, however, at least half of fisheries could be removed.
Furthermore, there is no consensus about the potential of the sector.
Another bids argue that Montenegro could exercise 1.5m euros, while the fisheries are unrealistic.
Experts at Kotor's District Institute said about 130,000 tonnes of Montenegro's cities were injured in Montenegro's cities, as a result of work together with his colleagues in Anada, Italy.
According to the director of the Institute, 30,000 tonnes of tonnes this year means that 30,000 tonnes could be held.
This year's book is 36,000 tonnes.
However, the real amount of the fisheries are under way.
According to Montenegrin and Italian experts, researchers show the capacity of the fisheries of fisheries are very difficult.
To resolve this problem, a series of projects designed to implement the capacity of the Rizzmo fishery and concert plant capacity to increase tender capacity.
Among them, the farmers are promoted.
Around 300 people are working in the beginning, while this figure will reach 1,200 people over the three years.
Montenegro's Agriculture Ministry, meanwhile, has allocated 97,000 euros for development this year.
According to Marko Kapan, head of the Association of Professor Marko Kapan, the biggest problem is not the main problem.
According to K., some fisheries who are currently selling 1.5m euros from Montenegro's fishery exports are not more than the year, but that some fisheries have been selling out of the fishery.
In addition, Montenegro's fisheries are facing obstacles, such as the rise of interest rates and insufficient unemployment.
Although 30,000 tonnes of tonnes are possible, representatives of the fishery sector are warning that the figures would mean an excessive excession.
In addition, Montenegro needs to find local markets.
Although the fisheries tried to enter the Belgrade market, the fisheries who are trying to enter the market -- can find 48 hours before the fisheries can reach the capital.
While the fishery exports remain in Montenegro, all sides agree that research and experience projects must be made to assess the potential of the sector and to find ways to find it through the end of this.

Delevic: reforms needed for Serbia's interest
The head of the country's Integration Agency says more than EU membership is at risk.
By Bojana Milovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 05 / 09 / 11

Serbia has taken one of the most important obstacles to the EU accession.
The process, however, could be more complex than Serbs' hopes.
As a speed up of various reform laws, many are waiting to fulfil.
Meanwhile, some EU leaders -- particularly German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- have made progress in bilateral talks with Serbia's EU prospects, progress in bilateral talks with Kosovo and the conditions for resolving the dispute of Kosovo.
A research study by the government's Integration Agency shows that citizens will support a possible referendum is a score of four points to the number of citizens to support EU membership.
This rate, 57 per cent ago, has been reduced to 53 per cent today.
Belgrade has also claimed that the European Commission will be able to issue a good rating on 12 October, when Serbia is ready to be ready to become an official candidate.
Milica Delevic, head of the European Integration Agency for Integration, revealed the questions about the general situation.
SETimes: Do you satisfied with the tension in the tension of the tension of Serbian citizens who have supported the country's European integration process
Milica Delevic: No one political analyst is not a idea that Serbia's progress towards EU membership is high, but it shows that the progress towards Serbia's progress towards EU membership would be a benefit for both the country and itself.
The possible NATO membership is a matter to protect Serbia. [Reuters]
Currently, it is a high level of support.
Our support for our reforms is more important to support for EU membership.
The fifth per cent of citizens think that reforms should be implemented for the EU, not for the EU, but for our own diversification, six months ago.
I want our citizens to move forward with the situation: Serbia's continuing to move forward towards European integration is very important that the citizens want to see the reforms that do not want to see the reforms.
SETimes: The possibility of recognition of Serbia's recognition of Kosovo's recognition is the possibility of Kosovo's political framework in Europe and Serbia.
What is the real reason
Deljevic: Serbia is moving to recognise conditions under the framework of stability and enlargement process, the conditions, human and minority rights, the democratic principles of the rule of law, a functioning market market and the EU law enforcement of the law.
As part of the first criteria, regional co-operation is essential to fulfil its obligations to fulfil international agreements.
Kosovo could be revealed as an official condition, but only as a provisions of the political climate in both Serbia and the EU.
There is no idea that Kosovo is not a state, but it is clear that everyone should participate in regional co-operation and EU integration process.
SETimes: One of the sensitive issues in the Serbian political scene is that NATO membership is not a precondition for EU membership.
How do you assess this issue
Delevic: The majority of EU member states are also in NATO, but some are in a very comprehensive presence that they are not in line with their fans.
Serbia's readiness to take responsibility for regional and global security and global security, as well as the Alliance's constructive relationship with NATO, needs to be a difference between the Alliance and NATO.
Ratko Mladic is now on trial at The Hague tribunal due to genocide and other war crimes allegations. [Reuters]
SETimes: Serbia hopes to win a positive response from the EC on 12 October.
Do Serbia needs to do so
Delevic: There is very difficult that Serbia needs to do this issue and I believe it will be done until the European Commission decision on 12 October.
However, I can't see the candidate country's status as an inspiration, which will change everything.
This decision will be a assessment of some certain laws that we are under way in some reform process, and the Commission will assess how to assess the implementation of the laws will be implemented.
It would be unfortunately unlikely to expect Serbia to become a completely system.
Currently, the most important thing is to work to make the EC's assessment as possible.
The assessment will affect EU ministers, state ministers and governments' governments' decision on 9 December.
SETimes: Do you facilitate Ratko Mladic's arrest, what is Serbia's European integration process
Delevic: The political environment has changed the political climate, which has been met.
I don't see this as an important thing in connection with European integration, and that Mladic's arrest is crucial for the detention of serious crimes committed.
The arrests revealed our recommendations on international obligations and the commitment to the rule of law, while nothing that any crime will not be sentenced to the rule of law and stability.
SETimes: The Netherlands was one of the most violent advantage of violence in Serbia's European integration process to arrest Mladic.
Although Mladic was arrested, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between Serbia and the EU has yet ratified.
What is the Netherlands a message
Delevic: I expect the Netherlands to approve this document.
I think that we have done many things, and I think that the Dutch parliament will be able to do so.
However, many countries have yet to block the deal, not the Netherlands, but the Netherlands have yet to ratify the deal.
SETimes: Many believe that Serbia will not be made in the EU's next expansion in the EU's next expansion, due to serious crisis and mixed environment.
How do you respond to this suspects
Delevevic: The economic crisis and political conditions are now in the member states, and this situation will be very serious value, which will affect the expansion of the enlargement process, and this situation will be very serious value for the EU's presence of the Western Balkan countries, and that this crisis is a threat to the EU's risk of its strategy.

The EU-Balkans summit in Brdo, Slovenia will be scheduled for some of the judges, according to the Brussels news agency Euobserver reported on Tuesday (March 16th).
The news agency said Saturday's meeting with all former Yugoslav republics in the past 18 years could be cancelled in the middle of Serbia's threatening to boycott a boycott meeting on the situation of Kosovo as an independent state.
Serbian President Boris Tadic said his country would participate in any regional conference, including 1244, including the UN's principles.
"A regional conference cannot represent the most recognition of Kosovo's independence," Tadic told reporters after talks with Hungarian President Laszlo Soluel in Novi Sad on Sunday. "Any decisions, what is why Serbia will be recognised with regional forums and regional forums."
Kosovo, which is recognised by 65 countries in the world, including most of the EU member states, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Romania, has insisted that Kosovo must join international forums under UNMIK.
But Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said last week that he would join the Brdo meeting as a representative of an independent state.
The "European Union" is part of a conference on Slovenia and Croatia.
Spain's Foreign Minister Herman Herman Herman Angel Moratinos attended the meeting, as well as Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos.
Spain is one of five members of the 27-nation bloc to recognise Kosovo.
Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor said the meeting was aimed at promoting the region's EU accession goals and "guaranteeing" for some problems.
The organisers want the summit to end a joint declaration on the "Western Balkans" with the European perspective of the European perspective ".
Serbia, which submitted an official EU membership application in December, has been warning that the bloc's western territory has been hiding by the western territory of Kosovo, according to Euobserver.
"Serbia will lead to the opportunity to decide whether Kosovo can join international and regional forums," a senior EU diplomat Euobserver quoted Euobserver as saying. "The past has come to the past, but it is time to do so."
A week before the Brdo meeting, Serbia's leader of the pro-European Liberal Democratic Party, Cedomir Jovanovic, urged Tadic to meet with Kosovo leaders as well as a good division.
"We must fight to live for the war," Belgrade-based B92 quoted Jovanovic as saying.

Hundreds of thousands of people were sparked in Macedonia this month because of the so-called "bronze salary" system, due to the so-called "bronze salary" system.
Among the barriers, two rounds were also in the way.
According to the paper, the ruling VMRO-DPMNE and Ljubomir Frckki, the candidates of the ruling VMRO-DPMNE and Ljubomir Frckki, the candidates of the opposition Social Democrats were unable to get their salaries in February and January.
Both are working for legal teachers at the University of Skopje.
Macedonians' salaries, as well as the price of debt and interest rates, do not have money in the plates.
According to local media estimates, about 600,000 citizens from around 600 euros to banks, while the retirement has no arguments against the penalties.
The situation is still unprecedented in mid-February, but the KGD has still far far far far far far far from the country to pay 42,000 registered workers in the country's workers' salaries and salaries.
The government believes to boost transparency and improving workers, and to pay workers' contribution to the workers' contribution to the credibility of pension and health care insurance and health care insurance contribution to the salaries, because they will face their salaries and residents of the Games, which they are facing up to 2,000 euros.
If the request was removed, the government has not made threats to the threats, and the government has punished about 5,000 businesses who had not submitted their estimates until 15 February.
The charges were broadcast.
The finance ministry has criticised the data to submit its debt estimates in January.
Earlier companies have confirmed that the software software software software software has been in time.
Experts, meanwhile, have claimed that companies are able to complete the bloc if a work of the KGD software, even if a worker is unable.
On February 11th, parliament was seen as one of the reasons for the salary of the success vote, and the country's largest union union Minister Trajko Slavko asked the country's resignation.
Nevertheless, the government argues the transition of technology.
Deputy Prime Minister Zoran Stavresrescu described the system as "excellent, sustainable and transparent", while arguing that all European countries have a "vulnerable".
Stavreski said the government would be unable to disagree.
Serbia-Montenegro Soks to Soke Armed Forces
The Serbia-Montenegro Army plans to cover more than 9,000 officers this year as part of a comprehensive military reform.
As the institutional unemployment rate, this move could be a key factor to improve the government's economic situation.

According to the army reform plan, the number of members of the Serbia-Montenegro Army will decrease to 39,722 from from 77,000 to 22,000 by 2010. [AFP]
Serbia-Montenegro will give up 9,300 military officers this year as part of its efforts to meet NATO standards, the defence ministry announced on Sunday (May 29th).
In Serbia, a total of 1,400 professional soldiers and 5,300 civilians, while professional soldiers and civil servants will be reduced by 1,800 and 800.
The ministry said it would be possible to be removed in the first phase of a group of workers, and then retired the privatisation of some facilities would be part of the privatisation.
In the framework of comprehensive army reform, 4,300 civilians and 1,300 officers were registered in Serbia in early April. The expansion of the Serbia-Montenegro Army's expansion of 7,227,22,000 people will be replaced by 2010.
According to Serbia-Montenegro Defence Minister Prvoslav Davinic, an agreement was reached under the agreement between the IMF and the IMF, which is a condition for the support of the number of army staff personnel.
The Serbian Finance Ministry said that the Serbian Finance Ministry had 6,500 funding funds from the army budget in January.
"They are still paying the salaries of the budget, and this means an excavation," Davinic said.
Furthermore, the reform in Serbia will be very difficult.
According to official data, 800 million people in Serbia are not trying to work.
The government and the military have no specific social programmes for the interests of the job.
The interests will receive an annual salary of between 4,000 and 6,500 euros after discovered.
As for the demand, they will receive 20 per cent.
A spokesperson for civil workers, Vladimir Stanimasijevic, says the state is successful to protect their clients, because they don't have no other opponents from the defence ministry.
Stanimirocic said he would apply to the international institution and courts with "convinced" decisions ".
So far, only 270 of the interests have been removed from the military commission, and they returned to their jobs.
This year, privatisation is expected to be reduced, as well as privatisation in major public companies -- this process will be concluded.
As a result, it seems to increase social pressure on the government.

Following several months ago, the country has implemented a reflection of foreign currency, which is worth 1.953 euros per month.
Bulgaria's entry into the ERM can allow ERM to get 15% in this central care.
However, Cankov and central bank officials said Bulgaria will not change until the euro season.
Cankov stressed that Bulgaria has no need to make a need for the IMF loan demand, but said Sofia plans to demand the rest of the Fund from the Fund to the rest of the year and especially in 2010.
"The IMF anger may be used for a possible loan for a possible loan for 2010, if the 2010 budget will not be imposed with cuts," he said.

Tomislav Nikolic, the leader of the SRS, who opposes co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, told reporters that Tolimir is not in Serbia, such as Tolimir's allegations of authorities.
"Kostunica and [President Boris Tadic] [President Boris Tadic] has been able to leave the government's [from] to survive the dialogue and exercise Serbia in such a period, and to serve the media," Nikolic said.
The proposal is expected to be supported by at least three MPs to be taken into parliament's agenda.
In neighbouring Bulgaria, the opposition Democratic Forces (UDF) adopted a declaration Tuesday urging the country's three parties to resign the "harmful resignation".
Other parties in parliament urged the UDF to support the move.
Meanwhile, the National Stabilisation and Progress Movement (NDST) -- the former Simeon National Movement for Integration (NP) -- faces a major crisis after a debate on Sunday.

"A Israeli has decided to be free for more than a year ago, and now has to be forced to reflect the results of this loan -- the lowest diplomatic relationship in Turkey's Turkish-Israeli diplomacy -- the lowest diplomacy in the Turkish-Israeli diplomacy.
"The losses of Israeli and Turkey's bilateral relations are inevitable," he added.

However, Iran has also met with officials from the EU, due to Iran's decision to replace the 20% rich inflation programme, due to the UN Security Council decisions.
Under a deal signed by the foreign ministers of the three countries' foreign ministers, the Iran's lowest rich platform would send to Turkey within a month.
In addition, more than a year after a year ago, 12020-high foreign resources will be suspended to use the medical research reactor.
Takas came after talks between Iranian President Holdd Ahdijad, Breznjak counterpart Luesio Inacio Lula Silva and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
On Monday's agreement is based on a deal that signed last year's medium-rich transportation Agency (IAEA), which was signed last year's medium-rich transportation (IAEA).

"We have no need for new sanctions or measures," Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told reporters in Tahran. "Ireland will react a letter to the IAEA and the IAEA, which will react a letter to a letter to the positive and positive reaction."
Western officials, however, have made it clear that the new agreement plans to continue to work on new UN sanctions against Iran, saying it is not enough.
Catherine Ashton's spokesman, Catherine Ashton's spokesman, Maja Kocijancic, said Monday's agreement on Monday appears to be "changed".
"Iranian IAEA has acknowledged its proposal, but this is not the basic challenge that the international community is very good news," the DPA quoted Kocijancic as saying.
"The reason for sanctions in the Security Council is still unable to make Iran's not serious credibility and to ensure that the provision of the provision of the provision of the programme should be made," he said.
While acknowledging the efforts of Turkey and Breza, Turkey and Breza, the agreement should now be removed "clear and resistance" to the IAEA, he said.

Serbia submitted a proposal to increase the risk of risk for everything else, bribery or other corruption.
The measure will be weapons of one of the unit's provisions of corruption -- "stable".
"The state has said it is ready to stop corruption, and I claimed that they will be more efficient to do so," the State Department Director Dragutin Radutin Radutin told state television RTS.
In addition to the presence of the unit's assets, the proposal calls for the preservation of a unit's weapons.
While acknowledging that the fight against corruption should be accelerated, many lawyers and NGOs argue that their proposal is disappointed on the constitution.
These areas say corruption would be more successful if the current laws are implemented.
"It was disappointed by a constitution. It is not possible to connect a single constitution," Zlatko Minic, a member of the Anti-Corruption Agency, told SETimes.
"The possibility will be removed by the Constitutional Court," he added.
They argue that the fight against corruption is more efficient.
"Officials are working to encourage people who announced more extradite corruption, as well as protecting the protection of the public service," Transparency International Organisation for Serbia Nemanja Nenadic told SETimes.
Radvavljevic, however, argues that further measures are necessary if corruption has been taken.
"A case of corruption is a whole institution, the sector and the government's image on the image of the image of the state," he said.
Experts say the Tax Department's proposal is impressed on the presence of the goods.

However, he added, the Tax Administrative has the most difficult to control the assets of persons.
"The law on tax administration and tax administration in 2002 allows the law on tax administration and tax cuts. It was unprecedented to see the mechanisms to use the mechanisms before the measure was proposed.
In this way, the persons who have been controlled in the judges could be investigated, but no evidence has no evidence, "he said.

"It is why that Israel remains to be more efficient and harm the Israeli government to harm the Gaza people," he said.
"We have to find us that we will find us to block the destruction and reflect the demands of the true strategic interest in both sides, and to reflect the true strategic interest in the region and to reflect our political policy.
In Turkey, there are many friends in Israel.
There will be both sides to find a solution to this issue. "

The controversial debate between Greece and Macedonia took place at the end of December.
This time, a new name -- Aleksandar Aleksandar Macedoniski (Macedonian Orthodox) -- was sparked to the Skopje airport.
Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis, who accused Skopje's historic estimates, reiterated the threat of blocking Macedonia's EU integration process by Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis two months ago.
"A long time after 2,000 unions could be changed, nor be reflected," Bakoyannis said. "This invitation is to be changed in the interim accord and creating good neighbourly relations with the EU.
They do not serve as services in Euro-Atlantic integration.
Greece has made it clear to its stance and partners.
This is a position supported by all political bodies, "he said.
The ancient Macedonians' cultural heritage is the issue of interpretation discussions since the country declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1992.
The dispute points include "Macedonia" name "in Greece, which is still used in the official flag, but Macedonia's official flag and controversy in northern Greece.
The Macedonia group of Macedonia in northern Greece has been very sensitive, citing allegations of the region's culture in the beginning of the 1990s.
The minister, who is responsible for the region's administration and the industry "Macedonia's own airport", has been widely discovered by criticism of the Skopje airport's amendment.
"We want them to conduct good neighbourly relations, but we don't want to see that historical reality is reflected," said George Kahoris.
That move is exclusive to friendly and will not make a solution to problems in the country, he said.
Nevertheless last month, Athens responded to concerns about the "Macedonian minority" in northern Greece, which rejected the presence of Bakoyannis.
Special Representative Matthew Nimetz proposed some solutions about the name issue of the name issue with the FYROM, which is still in the UN in 2005, but were rejected by both sides.
However, Macedonia's prospects for EU and NATO, while both sides may be under pressure to pay a political capital to reach a compromise.

Serbia, which opposes Kosovo's independence, has warned that it would oppose any proposal for the "real autonomy", which does not guarantee the borders ".
Local Industry Minister Zoran Locar said Ahtisaari would "reflect the Serbian government" if it is in an agreement with Albanian separatists ".
Serbian President Boris Tadic urged Ahtisaari's plan to postpone the next week to postpone the formation of the new government in Belgrade.
Tadic said a unemployed proposal could jeopardise the coalition talks in Serbia.
Kosovo will not be part of the Security Council's agenda this month, Russian Ambassador to the UN Security Council Vitaly Churkin said at a press conference last week.
"We believe that the parties should be given an opportunity to continue dialogue," Cardkin said. "We will be very dangerous to turn the way to transfer the independence."
However, he appeared that Ahtisaari's plan would be invested soon soon.
"There is an optimism that Ahtisaari's proposal will present the Kosovo proposal after the elections in Serbia," he said.

Voters approach, debate over Kurdish problem
The continuing competition and exhibition of the Kurdish votes are sparked under the disease of the June 12th elections.

The clashes between security forces and PKK terrorists are increasing, including a attack on Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's election congress.
Nearly 50 people died in violence over the past two months. [Reuters]
Turkey has been mixed in the Middle East, with long-term Islamic and democracy, which has been seen as a example of political crisis.
While the general elections are approaching on 12 June, tensions between the state and the Kurdish community has always reached a dramatic level in order to arrest the law, arrest and arrest students from both sides.
Women rise on May 4th, PKK terrorists attacked Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's congress.
Erdogan has been set up to the attack, but the police died a member of a member of the police.
Meanwhile, the High Election Council's decision to ban 12 independent candidates supported by the Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party (BDP), citing protests in southern and other areas.
During the protests, a Kurdish civilian died during the demonstrations.
"This increase in violence could be seen as a result of the ruling battle," Hakan Ozoglu, an expert at Kurdish nationalism, told SETimes.
The public has been strengthened as well as the majority of candidates who have passed the rules, allowing the majority of candidates to be nominated in June.
This decision reflects the first law on Turkish politics and reflecting the importance of the judicial system.
Henna Barkey, a member of the League Centre for the League Studies and a member of the International Criminal Organisation for Peace, described the law initiative as "a last minute initiative aimed at bringing democratic elements within the government and the army".
Barkey said that the board's decision was "convinced that people" will not prevent the BDP's entry into clear. "
According to Professor, this is a positive signal for the difference of rights.
The National Strategic Studies Institute for Strategic Studies, emphasised the importance of protests is the importance of the protests.
"The reactions of these incidents shows that a number of positive positions" shows that a number of positive positions are in true, "Natasa said.
Such incidents are a magazine that has launched the AKP's initiative to turn into a "Kurdish Agriculture", which will allow the controversial rights to this population two years ago.
It has been taken to take steps, such as the establishment of a state television channel that has been used in a country where the 90 Kurdish language is still being used in a country where it is still being used.
However, the basic changes of many people have been made always time and relations following the incidents, which were seen as rumours in rumours.

Nati also warned that the talks on state structures and society are aware of the current incidents as a degree of improved relations.
"Such reactions do not represent the joint speech of Turks.
"In response to the Kurdish problem, the reaction of the state has always been very complex with different groups in the political track market and military voters in different approaches," he said.
The recent arrests and laws live as a longer history process.
"The arrests have been arrested in the past two years, in the past two years," said Aliza Marccus, a member of the PKK and the Kurdistan Independent for Independent Independent (PKK) and the Kurdistan Independent Independent for Human Rights (PKK and the Kurdistan Independent for Human Rights).
The next month's elections are expected to be concluded by the AKP's victory.
The remaining polls are likely to come from the remaining seats, the Republic of People's People's Party (CHP) and the conservative Movement Party (MHP).
Since the BDP fails to enter parliament, the party must leave its candidates as independent.
The candidates will affect the parliament's agenda if they won 20 or more votes in the polls, he said.
It is possible that such a series of pro-Kurdish political parties supported by the BDP last year, when a series of pro-pro-Kurdish political parties have been unprecedented successful success.
According to Barkey, the party's highest status was the best in the ability of a "yield boycott boycott", against constitutional changes last year.
After the elections, the AKP pledged to do broadcast broadcast of the 1980 military coup and to do broadcast broadcast reforms in the constitution.
"The Kurds are expected to do something serious and large," Barkey said. "The problem is that the constitution is a point that the Kurdish issue is that the Kurdish issue is a key progress in the Kurdish rights and the state relations with Kurdish relations."
The opportunity to strengthen the constitutional reform and strengthen minority rights and strengthen minority rights, is very important to complete by the completion of the BDP and Kurdish population.
A protests feeling "Kurds" as a peaceful ". [Reuters]
Natasa stressed that the nationalist demands are only part of the Kurdish platform.
"It may be particularly valuable for the constitutional reform, as well as the reality of a more participating in the region," according to him.
Meanwhile, the threats of all sides continue to come to the charges and charges.
In the past two weeks, the BDP's Kurdish lawyer, Ayhan Brigade, announced that it would build "its own democracy" if the Kurds do not provide state.
Erdogan has denied "the Kurdish problem", but State Secretary Budge Ardic issued a statement saying that the AKP has recognised the problem.
Meanwhile, PKK punishment Abdullah Gul warned that if there is no agreement between the government and Kurds could be reached, broadcast violence after 15 June.
Although a positive change is the potential to live after the upcoming elections, it seems that there is no solution to a short time and that is not expected to be done.
"The institutions do not change in a delay," Natasa said, adding that the truth change and reconciliation could be "time and take steps".
"I hope that [people] will be able to enter the job before they enter," he told SETimes.

Serbia's presidential victims may be "serious return"
Despite nine candidates in Serbia's presidential elections Sunday, polls show that only two of the European conservative President Boris Tadic and the Serbian Radical Party -- the candidate of the Serbian Radical Party.

Most analysts in Belgrade believe on Sunday (January 20th) that the presidential elections will decide on the country's future and decide on European integration.
Although nine political president is nominated, the leader of the Democratic Party and the leader of the Serbian Radical Party, Tomislav Nikolic, is the deputy leader of the Democratic Party and the leader of the Serbian Radical Party.
Tadic, who was in 2004, argues that Serbia's EU integration is speed up.
Nikolic argues Russia's location, and said Moscow must be invited to form a military military base in Serbia.
Nikolic also said he would nominate candidate Vojislav Seselj, the prime minister's Radical Party leader, who is in The Hague tribunal.
Tadic and Nikolic agree on a matter, while Serbia does not recognise Kosovo's independence.
The province, the majority of the population, has been run by the UN since 1999.
Kosovo Albanians announced they will declare independence within a few weeks within the United States and the leading countries.
The two main candidates could be a third political -- Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica -- one of the main candidates.
Polls show that Tadic's ruling coalition could only be replaced by all partners, especially with Kostunica's support of the Democratic Party of Serbia.
Kostunica, however, opposes a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) plan, even if Tadic is planning to replace the UN mission in Kosovo, even if Tadic sent a mission to the EU plan.
He insists that the EU will support both Kosovo's independence and sign the SAA with Serbia.
For now, Kostunica has chosen Velimir Ilic, which is expected to support the coalition partner in the previous parliamentary elections, which is expected to vote by 8%.
Liberal Democratic leader Cedomir Jovanovic, the only candidate since Kosovo's independence.
Jovanovic, such as Ilic, is expected to vote at about 8%.
The other five candidates are expected to vote.
According to the law, none of the candidates have to vote on 50% of the vote, but the first two candidates must enter the second round.
This tournament is the most votes.
According to polls conducted by the Belgrade Centre for Special Elections and Democracy.
Nikolic's first round is expected to provide about 1.15 million votes in the first round, giving Tadic, which is expected to vote for 11.5 million votes.
The participation process will play an important role in the end of the month.
The bridge could benefit the Radicals, which are very discipline.
But Strategic Marketing Director Srdjan Bogosavljevic said the chance of Nikolic's chance for "25% of the votes" would be very difficult for the first round of the votes.
Bogosavljevic said Serbia faces "a very serious turning point", if the power has changed ".

He said the community should "not be removed by Belgrade politics".
"The future of them is in Kosovo and institutions," he said.
Kosovo Serb representatives, however, say they are not ready to return.
"We will do it, but we don't want to do," said Rancel Noykic, a member of the Serb delegation in the talks with Pristina.
Serbs boycott the Kosovo politics for two years, saying their assets are only resistance.
UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen criticised Serbia on Wednesday for demanding the boycott of the Kosovo Serb community and demanding that the province's budget has been demanding their salaries.
"All Kosovo Serbs are responsible for the creation of confidence and to ensure the security of the minorities, but Belgrade needs to be constructive," Jessen-Petersen said.
At the request of the Kosovo Co-operation Centre in Belgrade, Serbs are willing to give them from the salaries of Kosovo's interim institutions, as well as substantial institutions of Kosovo.
The move affects Serbs who serve as local government, health and education institutions.
It means that all Kosovo Serbs will be equally independent from the subsidies from Belgrade.
The aim of the co-ordination Centre says the goal is to improve differences and tensions between Kosovo Serbs.
Jessen-Petersen criticised the Co-operation Centre for trying to speed up Kosovo Serbs from institutions.
He said that this is the international community's disagreements for a multiethnic Kosovo.
"The implementation of new political leadership in Kosovo, including the new prime minister, has made a new momentum in implementing standards," Jessen-Petersen said in a press release Thursday. "We want to see real results in the areas of minority issues, especially in the areas of minority issues."

Greek Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat opened the first of the two-year round of UN peacekeeping talks on Monday (January 11th) aimed at end Cyprus's 40-year division.
The six-day session -- completed in the first round of three sessions on Wednesday (January 25th) -- will focus on issues, including two leaders, administration, supervision, economy and EU issues.
Retired property rights, one of the most wanted talks, are on the agenda of the second round of negotiations, which will end on January 27th.
This process will be monitoring a two-month matter before the island's presidential elections in the north.
Talat is critical for his post and improving progress.
The talks will be held at the revenue of UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's Special Representative for Cyprus Techno Bromo Zermoud.
Speaking after nine hours of talks with Talat on Monday, Christofias told reporters that Cyprus's administration has been focused on various aspects.
"Our two have said that everything will be determined and will not be determined," Christofias said. "And everything will be determined, nor will be determined, nor will attract Talat to the negotiations.
"If we hope that we will provide more compromise in the end of the year, this is our common goal."
The latest initiative to find a solution to the Cyprus issue ended in April 2004, when the UN reunification proposal was rejected by Greek Cypriot voters.
The majority of Turkish Cypriots voted in the main action.
In May 2004, only the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot part of Cyprus joined the EU.
The Turkish Cypriots recognise the northern part of the Turkish Cypriot administration.
The peace process has been stopped until September 2008, when Christofias and Talat launched a new round of direct negotiating chapter to reach a compromise by the end of last year.
Following the 60 meeting, the agreement still seems to be extended.
Ban voiced hope that the two leaders would reach an agreement on critical issues and "important progress".
"I reiterated the secular commitment to ensure that we are in accordance with things that are in accordance with time, and preparation," the Cyprus News Agency quoted Ban as saying Monday.
Prior to the start of the talks, Turkish Cypriots submitted their proposals on the management and authority, but the proposals rejected the Greek Cypriots as "unacceptable".
"There is no basis for the proposed proposals," Greek Cypriot government spokesman Stefanos Stefanou said on Sunday.
The Turkish Cypriot side's proposals last week are said to sign international agreements and are under separate rights over Cyprus's airport.
In a survey conducted last month, Talat's radical Turkish Cypriot Prime Minister and National Union (UBP) leader Medvis Eroglu suggested that Talat would be discovered by his leader.
UBP, who praised the division of the province's ethnic communities for the division of the province's division, said the two states are the only basis for a solution.

Petroleum prices and developments revive global bonds
Economists have been interpreted in different areas that have been seen in oil prices today, and the economic stalemate in the 1970s.
Observers say the market will be resolved, such as details, such as railway capacity, would be resolved, while China and India's economies, increasing competitiveness, increasing competitiveness and global presence in the coming climate.
In the past, hydro-scenario stations and market forces have been hiding.
How can it be the same
According to former Romanian Finance Minister Daniel Daianu, political, strategic and technological problems should not be unregistered.
By Daniel Daianu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest â€“ 02 / 01 / 06
Following more than <unk> 50, the Petroleum has started to be concerned.
In September, when more than 70 (<unk> 70-65), analysts have been removed from the team to <unk> 60-65 (<unk> 65-65).
The true is clear to the Varik resort, which is 80 years ago, "the price of the risk in the Western economies, which is the same as the price of the stagnation.
In the time, oil producer Arab countries used this strategic product, economic and political weapons. In many times, many times stopped up to <unk> 40.
This price reflected trade between countries that export oil exports to oil and oil imports.
"What is our high oil prices: the current situation, which does you have a unique with the previous year?"
Varernically and industrial countries have slowed oil prices, slowing the country's economies, slowing the country's debt deficit (even) and growth deficit.
The price rise in the industrial products has been reduced in oil prices.
The highest inflation of the economic stagnation (Paul Volcker's highest inflation (Paul Volcker) was closed to 20 per cent before the US Central Bank management.
As a result, a new scenario modelated scenario has been expanded. The union was expanded to the effectiveness of a strengthening of the economy's resource resources and restructuring the economy's ability to revive this school.
In such a situation, the risk and high inflation has been inevitable.
The school of Western economies can be said to be influenced by the former communist countries more than several years later.
Initially, the countries have to be seen in a strategic goods, and the post-communist countries have to be able to deal with institutional reforms and resources with the restructuring of the Soviet trade bloc.
Of the Essen Soviet bloc, the countries of the oil crisis were less effective because they used to use the oil crisis.
The worst effects of the crisis have been the poor countries that are imported oil imported by oil imported, because these countries have been able to cause a higher oil prices and prices.
"What is our high oil prices: the current situation has been able to have a question with us by the previous year
Meanwhile, fears at railway capacity are a problem that has reached natural disasters, such as natural disasters such as the Katrina and Rita.
Furthermore, oil search has been increased in recent years.
Political internally, it will be possible to make a interest in the market if the details on supply supplies are being removed.
However, there is a significant difference in the current census: the rise of the Asian economies, especially in China and India, is a factor of further pressure on oil and gas markets.
Public industries in industrial products have attracted an increase in oil prices. [File]
Therefore, this new global economic climate is the possible impact on the basic costs of the fundamental costs of modernisation of modernisation of the modern economies
A scenario scenario scenario, which has been given to control of key resources, can be seen as a scenario, and a worst scenario.
A statement released by the Rome Club earlier this year, Meadows reminded the city's electricity and political debate after the "Club" report.
In addition, global dynamics modest Jay Moaj (MIA) restaurant was developed by global dynamic modest Jay Moaj, a professor of global dynamic professor Jay Moaj).
This exercises the use of technologies and market forces, even though the use of alternative energy resources are more profitable than the use of alternative energy sources.
Nevertheless, what is it possible to be unregistered
The municipality needs to be hiding in China and India.
Due to pressure on the oil and gas market, the demand will be repressed in the coming years due to pressure on the oil and gas market.
The Serbs could even say that the oil prices could not be able to be transferred to 40 hectares / <unk> 40 hectares.
At the same time, the price rise is a relatively visible travel, but consumers and production are necessary.
The worst effects are the worst effects, especially in energy imports.
It is possible to do various interests.
In the coming years, the competitiveness of oil and gas sectors would be more important and more important to improve concerns about the control of oil and gas supplies, which will be improved as oil and gas supplies to the new division of oil and security.
At the time when the impact of the global recovery has been seen more competitive and concern, the accordance of archaeological issues with the accordance of industrial companies to be more competitive.
Supreme oil and gas prices are slowly slowly slowly and increasing inflation.
Therefore, both companies and governments reflect significant markets that need to be created in terms of clear policies and harmful profits.
This new conditions could be seen in the new conditions.
If the measures must be taken into effect, the private company and public budget will have to be more difficult.

Many EU experts have expressed concern that some debt would affect their relations with Russia as a result of the outcome of the Union.
At the same time, Brussels is not a desire that Brussels will be removed in a connection with the rich Caspian port, which is which the first project will be removed, which will be removed, which will not be removed.
Petromann experts think that Moscow would be the final decision on the issue, which will be removed.
Many EU states worry that Russia's oil exports are worried.
In one side, Brussels is under way, while the competition in the Southeast Europe oil transport is more efficient than every month.
In the first phase, Romania announced a new initiative to launch a new initiative under the Pan European Petroleum (PEP) in late January.
As part of this initiative, Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia will connect the port of the Black Sea port of Romania's Trieste port in Italy.
The pipeline will benefit Russia's control over the regional energy market, and will contribute to a greater dependence on Russia's Russian and Middle East oil.
The news was announced during Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi's Bucharest tour.
Prodi reiterated his support for Rome's 1319km pipeline.
According to PEOP supporters, this initiative has a "vulnerable": There is at least two times more than a "debt linking" in Trieste, which was linked to the "current debt".

The project is also waiting for years to ensure a variety union between some states, particularly in the river taxes.
As a result of the first physical feasibility study, the project was estimated <unk> 2.4 billion.
The talks began in 1994, but there was no progress in many progress due to political conditions and regional conflicts.
Furthermore, the Italian newspaper Il Pico has faced delays because of the project financed and even decisions.
Rome, Rome and Bucharest, which has been in recent years, are clear that they are willing to develop the project.
The PEP has become a key target of Romania's energy policy in Romania's energy policy, because of the more developed developments from the Balkans last year and last.
One of the most important opponents of the PEOP has sparked the Russian oil route to the Greek port of Black Sea, a Greek port in eastern Eastern eastern Bulgaria.
According to the Greek news agency ANA, the estimated <unk> 800km pipeline is <unk> 800m, and the annual capacity of 35 tonnes of oil for the beginning of the beginning.
After several months of delays, the main supporters of the project decided to take a final move.
A three-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six
Russian President Vladimir Putin urged Greece and Bulgaria to reach a final agreement before a final deal.
"If the Bulgarian and Greek partners are not able to make a memorandum of understanding, we will continue to do with other countries, including exports," Putin said at a annual press conference on 2 February.
According to many experts, the PEP's increasing concern is not only the last stage of the PEP's recent degrees, but also a third rival in the region, Bulgaria, Macedonia and Albania.
Under an agreement signed in Skopje by the end of January, the third pipeline is planning to transport its oil role in Bulgaria's Black Sea port in the Black Sea, and later, after Macedonia.
The most optimistic scenario pipeline could be ready for the end of 2010, after the 850km pipeline process, the most optimistic scenario capacity of 35 million tonnes and about <unk> 1.3 billion tonnes.

Aleksandar Fatih, head of the Belgrade Security Centre for Security Studies, said the meeting would open the way for direct communication to the Republika Srpska (RS), not as Belgrade authorities.
"These good relations between Belgrade and Sarajevo are the best piece of protecting RS's status under the Dayton Peace Accords, which could lead to a potential conflict between the Bosniak leaders in the Federation of BiH," he told SETimes.
"Serbia will not reflect Bosnia and Herzegovina's stability," Tadic said at the weekend meeting.
He stressed that the beginning of the new beginning could mean a new moment in enhancing regional co-operation.

"It is not easy to come to this point," the Turkish daily Milliyet quoted Sami Kohen as saying in a press release Tuesday (April 27th). "This meeting could be believed to be known as Davuten."
Banja Luka analyst Tanja Topic described the declaration as a strong step towards normalisation regional relations.

The deal has not been made without corruption.

"Silajdzic and Foreign Minister Sven Alayaj met in Istanbul for an official visit to the BiH island, so they do not accept any document," Radmanovic said.
He said that reaction "shows that RS leaders" feel share in a house stake in relations with Serbia.
During the meeting, Gul was important to establish regional relations and continue.

Voicing concern over the purchase of foreign investments in the country, Montenegrin leaders do not agree on removal restrictions on the removal market.

Two years after the declaration of Montenegro's declaration of independence, discussions on the liberalisation of the smuggling law on the liberalisation of the smuggling laws are increasing concerns about Russia and other foreign businesses in the country.
The coalition's main partner -- Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic's party -- the Socialist Democratic Party of Socialists, has been under full liberalisation of the sovereign market.
But the Social Democratic Party, the main partner of the coalition, shares the same idea with the opposition, which wants to continue restrictions that the country's attractive coastal climate.
Due to the debate over this issue, the government has withdrawn a draft law on the property rights of Greeks.
According to the constitution, such law needs to have two majority to be passed in parliament.
As part of the current laws, foreign commercial persons can buy in Montenegro, while foreign foreign exercises have no right.
In contrast, many foreign countries -- a company with the help of Montenegrin witness witnesses -- and reiterated that the company closes to the company after the sale.
In Montenegro, a administration court said "there will be no foreign personal owner who is not in Montenegro".
However, this decision is still unknown as implementation.
Statistical data reflects the importance of this issue. The 53 per cent of the Foreign Investment for Foreign Investment in a total of 900m euros in a total of 11 months.
Meanwhile, the country's capital amounted to 450m euros -- this figure is almost equal.
Montenegro, who is seeking to sell them, is spent to use the sale of sale, leaving foreign trade deficit, or to use new investments in new investments, especially in Belgrade and Novi Sad.
Deputy Prime Minister Gordana Djordjevic, who is responsible for international economic relations, has rejected the government's offer to sign the sovereign code, "unless they are not able to be able".
"The law envisions a similar idea on state property, arguing that [the state] should be removed in the state [in the state] with some special judges that will use the use of public goods and reserves," Djordjevic said.
But President Branislav Radulovic, secretary of the Association of lawyers, believes it is not a "strong claims".
"If I think that Montenegro's death is 13.812 square metres of technical conditions will be able to protect the country's interests.
For instance, for example, it is not completely unfortunately unfortunately. "
Deputy Prime Minister Gordana Djordjevic, who is responsible for international economic relations, said the government has signed its offer to sign a sovereign code with the need for "intelligence conditions". [Montenegrin government]
"As Montenegro," Radulovic said, "Bulgaria could use the so-called so-called so-called contracts for foreign investors." Bulgaria has signed an agreement with foreign investors, allowing foreign investors to use them to 99 years.
That was to protect the territorial owner's territory, and the agreements in the other hotels of manipulated manipulation and the situation. "
Predrag Mitrovic, head of the Co-operation Initiative, warns that the state must be taken into account of refugees in the region, with other countries in the region.
"The countries that have been managed with free liberal laws have found themselves with the economic terrorism, when they have been able to pay their territory from abroad," Mitrovic said.
Such liberal laws are dangerous for smaller states, particularly Montenegro, and I think the state should be more active in this issue. "
The finance ministry adviser Predrag Stamatovic believes that this idea would not reflect the rights of special residents, including the state's transfer, judges.
"There is no right to avoid the right to prevent the way for development and the country," Stamatovic said, noting that the tax revenues made last year.
During the latest talks signed last year with the signing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, Montenegro has defined the opening of EU countries' citizens.
The deal is expected to be implemented in 2010 after the 27-nation EU member states approved by parliament.
Montenegro will start talks on all chapters of the facility, as it is a candidate for joining the EU.
The European Commission will review Montenegro's laws and assess the values of the EU criteria.
The rights of EU citizens will be discussed as part of the free movement of goods and capital.
In the past, these chapters have been the most difficult challenges for candidate countries who do not want to leave their flags.
Croatia, for example, has failed to make talks on the free movement of capital.
European Commission experts said that Croatian laws are not in line with European standards.
Despite the EU warns, Croatia is facing legal changes to the "legal changes", which will allow EU citizens to be able to become a conservative owner in Croatia.
But other documents on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, Croatia must complete the process of liberalisation market by 2009.
Germany, Belgium, Britain, France, the Netherlands and Spain can have a vacation in Croatia, based on technical agreements.
But because of the administrative bureaucrative bureaucrative bureaucrative.
Therefore, those who want to have a country in Montenegro have applied to the creation of a company in Montenegro, and then created a firm in Croatia and then created any restrictions.
During talks with all new members of the EU, all new members have tried to lift the sale of the second concrete economic issues, during talks with the EC.
Malta was the most successful one in these initiatives.
No one who lives at least five years in Malta, has the right to buy a second consultation in the country, but the same rules for the citizens living abroad.

The ICTY's former Bosnian Serb leader accused more than 10 years ago over his role in the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
Karadzic also faces two genocide charges of genocide from the 1995 Srebrenica massacre and the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.
So far, Karadzic is widely believed to be hiding in eastern BiH or Montenegro's eastern parts of BiH or Montenegro.
In late July, Karadzic's wife called for a surprise in public opinion.
"I don't have all the lives for the surrender," Ljiljana Zelen-Karadzic said in an interview with the EP Television on July 28th. "This will be a autonomy for us."
Addressing the large pressure on Karadzic's fugitive family, Amohije told the Times that he would be in the same situation if he is in the same situation, he would be surrendered.
"I don't say it should do, but I can do what I can say.
I'm going to The Hague, "he said.
Metropolitan, who described his family and his family, has denied Karadzic's claims that the ICTY had not been hiding since 1995, saying he had not see Karadzic since 1995.
He said similar recommendations have made similar recommendations to other Serb commanders who surrendered to the ICTY.
Metroitan's remarks came after a report by the Montenegrin weekly independent Monitor on Thursday that Karadzic could surrender before Serbia-Montenegro's talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU in early October.
He said the authorities had been hiding information about Karadzic's surrender, saying that the talks on the surrender of the ICTY is in the past time and that the indictee is prepared to co-operate with Serbian security services.
The extradition of all war crimes suspects wanted by the ICTY is essential to meet all other former Yugoslav republics in the Balkan conflicts with Serbia-Montenegro and NATO to join the EU and NATO.

Following attacks on the Kurdistan Workers' Party, officials in Ankara launched a new strategy aimed at resolving the problem.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the solution was in strengthening democracy's strengthening democracy.
Following his meeting, the Turkish National Security Council (MGK) has been held to discuss new measures to develop the Southeast European Anatolian region, which has been disastrous over 20 years.

Thousands of people died in the outcome of the PKK's ongoing campaign. In 1999, the organisation declared his detention to the capture of Abdullah Gul, who was arrested and then changed his name.
However, when it ended in June 2005, it decided to end the armed fight against weapons in southern Turkey's Kurdish population.
Furthermore, civil society organisations and some Kurdish intelligence organisations are concerned about the return of the past days, while urging Ankara to leave the PfP to leave the weapons, while urging Ankara to make a broad climate.
Members of the former Democratic Party (DEP) have asked the members of a new Kurdish political movement, led by Leyla Zana Zana, Middle East, Selim Sadak and Hatican Dicle.
Meanwhile, the prime minister stressed the prime minister's remarks that violence could be resolved through compromise.
He acknowledged that the Kurdish issue should be resolved ", saying that the 15 Kurdish nationalists and some opposition politicians are unresolved to stop violence. The 15-year-old Kurdish nationalists, 30 companies, 30 companies, 18 companies and 30 companies have backed support for the Darir Democracy Platform.
Retired judges are among the problems that Turkey is scheduled to start accession talks on 3 October.
The country has already implemented some reforms, including the removal of broadcasting and education law in Kurdish language.
The main PKK leader appears to be seen as a positive response to the government's initiatives.
Zilkir Aydar, a former DEP lawmaker, also discovered a month in a statement saying that Ankara's recent steps were made by the government's sovereignty.

Milic: Will peace in this region
In an exclusive interview with Southeast European Times, Socialist People's Party leader Srdjan Milic shares the differences about Kosovo, NATO, EU and future.
By Brian Salace for Southeast European Times in Podgorica -- 03 / 08 / 09
"In the next five years, Southeast European countries will be in Europe," SNP leader Srdjan Milic said. [REREF / SETimes]
Speaking to parliament on 3 October 2008, Srdjan Milic, leader of the opposition Socialist People's Party (SNP), Prime Minister Milo Djub issued a remarkable statement that Prime Minister Milo Djub is the issue of recognition of Kosovo.
"Montenegro could recognise Kosovo on a day after its recognition of Serbia," Milic said.
After a week after the statement, Montenegro recognised the former Serb province as an independent country.
The SNP is taking over 30 per cent of his support -- Montenegro's broad Serb minority.
The SNP, which won 545 votes in March 2009, is 16 seats in parliament.
"The Albanian issue has not yet been closed in Montenegro.
"We will wait for what I expect the International Court of Justice in The Hague," he said.
Montenegro's NATO membership issue
The issue on Kosovo's status is not the only problem facing the country. On December 14th 2006, Montenegro joined one of the first steps towards full membership in NATO. On 14 December 2006, 2006, Montenegro joined the Alliance's intervention in the country due to the Alliance's intervention in 1999.

"I think that Montenegro has been successfully successfully successful now," Milic said. "I think that the campaign is to join NATO two years ago, I think that you will be asylum."
Milic says the SNP has not yet been in a meeting on NATO membership, and that the volunteers will not learn to the media about this issue.
A study by the Centre for Democracy and Human Rights (CEDEM) said participants support NATO membership, and that 43.3 per cent opposes any opinion about the issue.
In these areas, more than 4 per cent have been changed since the CEDEM began to monitor the issue in October 2007.
Milic says NATO has changed many years after three months of military action against Serbia and Montenegro in the period of state union.
Therefore, the efforts of citizens to take their support for the Alliance could not be sparked.
"I don't think that NATO was the same with 1999," the opposition leader says.
The CEDEM's research shows that a small majority of Montenegrin citizens are not the same idea.
The participants think that 20.3 per cent of the participants are "a military organisation", 30.6 per cent think that "military / military organisation".
"I think that we are trying to resolve the modern problems of the poverty, to resolve its natural disasters, to resolve the modern problems of modern networks, and to resolve the war of the Warsaw Pact," Milic said.
Nearly 50 per cent of the Montenegrin citizens do not have important concern about defence and NATO relations, Milic said, "This is a matter that must be taken into account."
We should stop the barriers in the friends, and we should not wrap up to this issue, "he said.
Montenegro hopes for EU membership

Milic's five-year mandate ended last week as head of the country's National Council for European Integration.
"In the next five years, Southeast European countries will be in Europe," Milic said.
"Yugoslavia was closed in 1990.
Many young and intellectuals have been young and intellectuals, but in this process.
Benim was a heavy heavy.
I don't want to see the loss of the cases. "
Milic, however, think that the Montenegrin authorities should not tackle with fulfilling the EU standards. "We have to find a positive signal that we are acceptable to us in 2011," he said.
"Montenegro can create a success in Europe, but we can ensure the integration of Montenegro's citizens before," he said. "
Regional peaceful step
"You can you allow your children to be able to come with a Albanian house?"
"I don't have me," Milic says. "This is nothing that the funds can know."
"I want to convince a story," he said after the fears.
Following NATO's move to the Balkans, a former Albanian friend will be phone from Milic on 23 March 1999.
A few hours after the phone, Milic's house will be reduced.
Milic and his friends were granted economic training in Dubrovnik, Croatia, and his friends have been living in Germany over the past nine years, "he said.
"It is a volunteer and my children."
"It's hope that peace in this region could be able to be created," Milic said.
Kosovo's leaders agree on strategy for monitoring status talks
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leaders met on Friday for a joint strategy for talks on the province's future status, which will be monitored with UN support for the province's future status.

While Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leaders are approaching the start of negotiations on the future status, the province's ethnic Albanian leaders did not agree on a joint negotiation strategy Friday (October 28th).
"I hope that our next meeting will have more credible and tolerance to our ideas," the opposition party leader Veton Surroi said after a debate in Pristina.
Prime Minister Bajram Kosumi, who will be led by Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova, Parliament Speaker Nejil Daci, Democratic Party of Kosovo Hashim Thaci and Surroi.
The market is expected to start the launch of the UN Security Council last month after the status talks was appointed by a special UN envoy for the status talks.
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan proposed Ahtisaari as a basic name of the post.
Meanwhile, international officials urged Kosovo Albanian leaders to speed up preparations.
"I think it will be a clear and good decision that the target will be held and will be good," UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen said after talks with Rugova on a retail meeting with Rugova.
The talks are expected to be held before the beginning of the talks, when the sides are not on the negotiating chapter.
"The talks are very good to find a very good thing, but the first different entities are beginning," Reuters quoted Ahtisaari as saying in an interview with Fin's national channel JE on Saturday.
"We need to discuss how these problems can be resolved.
There are many fundamental jobs that we have to be done before the start of a specific debate. "
Ahtisaari, eight, has played key role in international efforts to end the Kosovo conflict in 1999, when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to accept the requirements of NATO.
In addition, the medieval role was a medieval role in the peacekeeping agreement between the Indonesian government and the Special Movement.

We are going to do our matches with Nelia, Australia and the last group.
Therefore, it will be a victory.
We have decided to go to a long time when we can see South Africa's some injuries of injuries.
And we have decided to decide.
We are now unacceptable that one of the world's most beautiful countries is acceptable.
I'm here.
The province's capital is in a small town of Pilgrip, in a small town of Pilgrip in the Mpphila, where he was sold.
He was declared in 1986 for the gold.
It is very good for the end of the 19th century.
The most attractive director, Africa and his partners, has warned that everything can sell everything to sell everything to sell all of the town.
The prices were very high.
After the plan, it was negotiating.
Even if we pay 50% of the prices, we're sold.
Some can buy the official price for 30 euros to sell only 3 euros.
The bombing in Nelia is one of the best atrocities that have been seen in exercise.
A new built was built for the World Cup.
The unit seems to be hiding by 18 staff victory.
The idea reflects a bill for a slash summer bill.
We are not a reality of life -- not the biggest park in South Africa, the largest national park in South Africa.
The only problem on the Stady has to see the future use.
Although Nelia has been changed as a name of Maxha, many are unchanged.
This is the lowest in the city's cities, with more than 200,000 people.
The season, which will have a Premiere League club, will have the first time since the middle of the 1990s, is not easy to stop the 40,000 people.
There is no longer much less than the law on Johannesburg or Portugal Elisabeth.
The only McDonald, which will be able to win after 10 hours.
Following the opening, all sides want to celebrate or leave themselves.
Another McDonald is not enough.
The 16th Golden
There is no disappointment.
We were 1-2 renovated to Australia.
For us, there is an exception for us.
Technology director Tim Cahin has been charged with punishment in Larik, who did not give our penalty after Tim Cill's golden territory.
We think that this is not a spring.
In Gana and Australia, the two team who are worse than at least one of the players' players, even if we are worse.
We have to return to the death and fraud.
Nevertheless, judges were disaster.
The conservants were injured.
Women's floods, penalties.
Gana was victims.
German player Philip Lahm played in the season, but the rights remains.
He was unprecedented, and Gana was able to win six winners.
The quality of the tournament was lower.
The workers have become better.
They are looking to play their votes, and we will be able to get a football football football.
This World Cup and South Africa are world.
Africa world.
This is not only Europe, Americans and China, Japan or South Korea.
I don't think that there has been very power to calm homes or organising problems -- a very power to the Jabulani territory -- that Kupa's resistance.
However, we are here in order to take part in our hands.

It should not be used, "he added.

Although the requirements are willing, Romania's chief negotiator for the EU, Vasile Puscas.
Southeast European Commission (EC) described Romania as a effective market economy.
Do you think that "diplomatic targets", such as the monuments
Vasile and Puscas: This is "diplomatic delegation".
As free prices of free inflation rate and route economic stability, the effective market is to fulfil all the basic criteria of the economy.
Poland and Bulgaria were the same member of the same status in 1997 and 2002, according to these criteria.
SETimes: Romania's economy is not in a capacity that can be based on competitiveness in a single European market.
Puscas: In 1993, transition countries in Central and Eastern Europe were taken into consideration.
The countries are expected to reach an effective market economy, but if it continues to reach a higher competitiveness.
SETimes: Do you think that the Romanian economy will be able to reach a capacity with competitiveness pressure in the future
Romania hopes to join the EU in 2007. [EU]
Puscas: This is essential.
The entity, which is concerned about the EU market, will have to be able to deal with our own competitiveness system and our own products, based on our own competitiveness system and our own products.
I do not want to emphasise that Romania could win state status in 2007.
SETimes: How can you be able to complete negotiations on environmental, Justice and Reconstruction issues by the end of the year
Puscas: The Commission has been used as the first time in the Stratea document, "remarks" that every effort to complete the negotiations by the end of the year.
So far, the negotiations have been signed to be completed by the end of 2004.
The talks will be completed in December and will assess the issue of Bulgaria and Romania's accession issue.
SETimes: The latest report, published in the latest country, is also being criticised for press freedom and corruption.
Will these critics are unemployment
Puscas: We are convinced by us.
We must be able because this report is not the most difficult negotiator or not the team of all Romanian people.
The government must support the necessary measures to ensure press freedom and implement the implementation of legal regulations.
We must be taken into account and preventing the problems that have been critical of criticism and criticism, because freedom is widely broad.
SETimes: The "terrorism" was part of the Committee report during the first time in 2003.
Earlier, he had not been used.
Puscas: The corruption issue is necessary to address the right direction.
We are moving forward with such a approach, and we are aware of the importance of the issue.
Corruption is not only a individual or politics.
I will strengthen competitiveness in the competitiveness system, which would strengthen corruption.
SETimes: We accept a "security requirement", which allows Romania to delay the delays of membership by one year if it does not meet its immunity.
Do you think that the EU is to ensure that reforms are completed, after completing the same speed
Puscas: The justice, interior and agricultural issues are in effect in the areas of justice, interior and agricultural issues.
Bulgaria and Romania are different practice, but a security condition that allows the results of the accession date to be delayed by a year if the results are not expected to be delayed.
SETimes: The elections will be held in November.
Do you think the negotiations and accession process are affected
Puscas: We hope that all technical solutions are to be completed by the elections.
In the coming period I hope that the policies will not be in the negotiating process, and that the process is moving towards natural progress by December.

After four years of waiting, Serbia's EU candidacy was approved last week.
The state officials, led by President Boris Tadic, agrees that the candidacy status is a better life, better investments, new employment opportunities and a chance for better living standards.
However, economic analyst Miroslav Zdravkovic believes that all of Europe are not really really really really really.
"The EU countries have a decline in industrial production -- the situation is true that in the end of 2008 and in the beginning of 2009.
Therefore, the new jobs and investments in Serbia are not really realistic, "he said." I don't see any special winner because of Serbia's candidacy, because of the candidacy, they do not see any special winner or here. "

Serbia should now be proud and should be in the future.
The next step is a date for the talks and we should be resolved so far.

"We don't find a solution today and we decided to continue our talks," Croatian Foreign Minister Gordan Jandrokovic said after the meeting.
Talks focused on Rehn's latest proposal for a dispute between the two countries declared independence from 1991 to 1991.
The dispute between the two Adriatic countries is a major obstacle to Croatia's progress in the EU integration process.
Slovenia, which joined the Union in 2004, has blocked the opening of new chapters in Croatia's accession talks with Brussels since December 2008.
The country has threatened to block the process's border dispute.

Serbia's prospects for joining the EU's "Beydon Schengen" rose during a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Monday (June 15th).
They were unable to remove visa requirements for countries that have met the conditions for the European Commission (EC) to meet the requirements this year.
Earlier this month, European Commission Commissioner Jacques Barroes said Serbia and two other Western Balkan countries are candidates.
While completing most of the criteria for Serbia and Montenegro, he said, Macedonia has fulfilled its consumption.
Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic told reporters that Serbia will work to implement "all technical and other conditions" for the removal of the visa regime at autumn.

He also stressed that all EU member states should accept the EC proposal.
The EC also assessed the preparation of the three countries' visa practices, citing a score between 1 and 3.
Macedonia ranked 1 points, while Serbia and Montenegro ranked 1.7 points.
Serbia's score is reportedly due to the transformation of the passport distribution of Serbs living in Kosovo, Albanians and Republika Srpska.
Serbia is also pushing for the blocking of the visa rules, as well as the blocking of the blocking of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
In both cases, Belgrade's pro-war crimes suspects have been suspended due to the extradition of Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic.

Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), which has a very complex government structure, faces a serious slowdown problem over progress in recent months.
In the last year's election campaign, disappointed nationalist denies returned to nationalists and continues to be a political climate.
The EU also says it is clear that significant reforms aimed at strengthening the state institutions.
The current state structure of three national and two entities is a result of the Dayton Agreement, which ended the four-year conflict in 1995.
The Dayton Accords has been surprised, but many observers think that the political system established with the agreement is unfair, expensive, expensive, expensive and final standards.
However, it seems to retain political will to change this system.
Although the dispute's differences are politics, observers agree to Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik. In the 2006 elections, observers agree to Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik. In the 2006 elections, the Independent Social Democrats Union of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) leader, Dodik.
"It is the RS.
For me, BiH is a structure of the Dayton Agreement.
I am respected to the agreement, "Dodik said in another speech, calling BiH's" an obstacle to the development of RS ".
Local and foreign politicians are critical for Dodik to make a free state status of the Bosnian Serb entity.
During the election campaign, Bosniak politicians called for RS's secession.
Dodik also welcomed the independence referendum.
Representatives of the Bosnian Serb entity in RS and representatives in the BiH Parliament warn that all those who have been extradited in recent years could be extradited to the state.
Reforms say the current security system allows criminals to avoid the entity borders to justice. [Getty Images]
"If the demands of RS's secular demands, we want to be extradited to our powerful authors on defence, defence, extradited tax, the High Court and Prosecutor's Office," said RS President Milan Jelic.
Dodik and his party, SNSD, argues that RS will be a federal state structure, which is not based on central administration.
Dodik claims that the country will be judged as a single election unit as a single election unit, if the country's completion of a single election unit is possible.
Dodik, one of the most important local commercial relations, believes the economy is the most important factor for the future of the Bosnian Serb entity.
Dodik, who arrived in the village of Laku, near Banja Luka on March 5th 1959, was not the death of the Belgrade University of Political Science. The Laku Mayor of the Laku Mayor of the BiH war.
The ruling party's Independent Chamber of Independent Parliament, which is the only political opposition in the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS), has formed it.
Dodik's chairman was the victory of the current party. In 1997, it was elected by the RS Parliament.
In January 1998, RS President Biljana Plavsic nominated Dodik as prime minister.
Dodik's cabinet was in office until January 2001.
Dodik, who is focusing on strengthening the political party, has criticised the SDS.
Dodik also attributed the international community's interest in the international community in BiH as an interim alternative to nationalist conservatives.
Dodik, who served as prime minister after the party won the elections in February 2006, promised that RS would protect its presence.
The EU is not possible to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said. [Getty Images]
"Dodik in 1996 was one of the political analysts that [war crimes indictee Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic must surrender to the UN war crimes tribunal.
However, the bridge is one of the bridge and a politically conspiracy, because it is a populist political approach that would make him more support from the people, "he said.
According to Topic, the restructuring of nationalist data is very reason.
One is that the basic believes are unchanged.
According to Topic, RS citizens have been innovated for years and political, as the Bosnian Serb entity is a state.
He also think that the international community has not been very high and that the finance of the existing structure of Bosnian Serbs, which is spent to convince more benefits, such as social programmes, such as social programmes.
A controversial debate on Kosovo's status, Topic said, noting that one of the factors that are being spent on Kosovo's status, adding that Serbian policies have used for RS to block Kosovo's independence.
In terms of citizens of both sides, the price of lives are unable to lose BiH's EU path.
Police reform is the most important condition for the signing of the signing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU and the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA).
But the reform is long as Dodik's presence on police powerful presence over the entity level.
In addition, RS representatives oppose NATO's request to keep the Civilian Co-operation.
"BiH has been false between two bonds, which are abroad to one of the constitutional structure.
One of these rumours enjoy the entity's completely secure, while the other RS continues to continue its presence.
"It is to find a way to find a solution and has been in a comprehensive position of the international community," he said.
According to Topic, the international community demonstrates that the international community has made a secular position and is a reflection of the dispute between Paddy Ashdown and the previous High Representative (Paddy Ashdown), who is using the dispute with the previous two High Representative (Bonn Paddy Ashdown) and many successful approach of the dispute.
Even in July, High Representative Miroslav Lajcak has been criticised by Dodik's position and the proposal for detailing RS's state union.
In a statement last month, Lajcak said the prime minister should "think that Bosnia and Herzegovina does not think it is not willing to win to the international community with farmers who questioned the Dayton Peace Agreement".
The final date for the police reform was reached at the end of September.
Political leaders cannot reach a compromise, the SAA will not be signed this year, and the chance of the country's EU candidacy will remain at the chance.
"Bosnia and Herzegovina faces the risk of stable and risk of the European competition," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said.

The Turkish government has promised a new intelligence policy against ethnic Kurdish citizens.
Following days after a comprehensive action against the PKK campaign in northern Iraq, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced a new government plan, including various investments in Turkey's southern part of the Kurdish population.
Voicing that a new state television would start broadcasting in the broadcasting of a new state television would start broadcasting, the prime minister reminded the law that provides information from PKK members or the organisation.
While Erdogan's administration has convinced Kurdish products in Turkey, the Kurds in Turkey are convincing Ankara's concerns about the concerns of the PKK.
However, the terrorist organisation continues to claims that the "state" is the only true option of the "state".
According to Duran Ketovo, Erdogan's pro-Kurdish economic programme, Erdogan's "is not another thing that" the reality of the Kurdish policy ".
The PKK, which demanding Turkey's establishment of a "union" republic in 1970, wants to establish an independent Kurdish state, which includes northern Iraq and Syria.
The organisation seeks to take the support of Turkish Kurds in Turkey for the major life, is trying to create the regret of government policies over the pressure of economic diversification and Kurdish nationalism.
It is also trying to give political power from Turkey's military action, which has been attacked on border attacks against PKK campaign in northern Iraq.
"The Turkish military continues to fight against the PKK, while the government will continue to continue Kurdish policies in politics, economic, economy and society," a survey published in a survey published on the website.
Do you think such claims still be hiding
Officials in Turkey have taken concrete steps to reduce borders on minority rights in recent years, particularly connected with EU goals.
The first time after the destruction, the Kurdish case and even one political party linked to the PKK â€“ according to the allegations of many officials in Ankara.
The government underlined that the separate military action against terrorism is not enough, and that the disappointment of the disappointment of the Kurds should be addressed.
At the same time, the civil society has been trying to find a political solution within the framework of parallel parallel metres, but the last quarter continues to 37,000 in five years.

Group groups sparked fears due to disagreements
This month, the Kurdish Democratic Accords (KCK), a precondition of conditions and dialogue with the Turkish government.
But the other entity has warned that "ongoing war" will be held for several years if their demands are not met.
Meanwhile, the organisation claims that they want to negotiate talks, questioning Turkey's foundation agreements and territorial integrity, which is unacceptable by Turkish officials.
The PKK has been discovered in the past several times, but none of them did not continue.
For that reason, the service could be guaranteed.
Canadian groups are different policies and some influential forces in the PKK see violence as a way to reach the goal.
Although the KCK called for dialogue, PKK commander Bahoral Erdal, a Syrian citizens, said the attacks against Turkish troops and other targets would continue.
"This can sustain the war environment, which allows the Kurdish products to be able to get political winners," he said.
PKK is the most dangerous, but the dangerous situation
"The PKK is the most dangerous today, but the most dangerous situation.
"The terrorist organisation is under pressure, which can work to show the force by organisers and use intelligence bombings," he said.
Turkey has conducted military operations against terrorists in northern Iraq since December, where at least 240 terrorists were killed in February, according to information from the General Staff Chief of General Staff.
Lopiner says the PKK's logistics and financial resources were discovered by the PKK's logistics and financial resources.
He added that the organisation is now going to be dialogue.
As a result, it could try to support itself from regional players, such as the past -- as a "modern" in the global or regional players used to implement regional policies.
The PKK is imposed to make up the barracks, and that is in the framework of criminal activities in the region and in Europe.
According to the US State Department's Terrorism Report in April 2007, the organisation provides money to drug and human trafficking activities in Europe, as well as money from the organisation's symbols.
Many international security experts in both international areas say the PKK threat is not in line with a solution based based on military action.
Turkey must continue to work together with other countries, especially in Europe, to ensure financial sources.
In response, the government must ensure the safety of Kurds to the civil society and the rule of law.
The remaining economic remaining is one of the problems that the PKK has been hiding in the past.
Currently, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is a key factor for <unk> 15 billion in claiming to boost investments in southern Turkey and improve economic climate.
Another details is that human rights is that Turkey is in order to ensure safety in the past few times.
The idea of discrimination against the Kurds and that the Kurds had been extradited to the autonomy of the PKK's last decade.

In 2004, the limited death of Kurdish broadcasts started.
Erdogan's administration says it plans to make further transport.
In a television station, only Kurdish, it will be broadcast in Argentina and Farsen.
The prime minister said the government will continue to continue new reforms, calling on one of the prime ministers' expectations of the people in the region, leaving their expectations of the people in the region.

DTP finds government programme's insufficient
The Turkish government is facing patients, but the Turkish government is facing patients.
The pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) says they are not affected.
"We should speak up and restrictions.
If the AKP government is fair to resolve the Kurdish problem, the referendum is unfair, and I think the demands of the Kurdish people 'demands, "he said.
The DTP wants Turkey to recognise the Kurdish identity through the constitution and establish a unique autonomy management in southeast.
DTP's basic bridges between the DTP and the PKK demands, the dialogue between the government and Turkey's main Kurdish party is impossible.
Erdogan faces strong public pressure for the PKK terrorism, especially in particular, and has to do nothing about the prime minister's DTP.
Following a recent term before party members rejected him, Erdogan said he would not meet the DTP if he described the PKK as a terrorist organisation as a terrorist organisation.
The public's immunity against the PKK is very high, since at least 47 people were killed in the terrorist attacks, including at least 35 soldiers in October.
The PKK questioned more than 37,000 tourists since 1984.
The DTP, meanwhile, is increasingly increasingly increasing evidence that the PKK does not show different from the PKK.
In November 2007, the Metropoll research group opened a public research in southern coastal.
More than a third of the participants argue that DTP does not represent the ethnic Kurds, while only 38.6 per cent said the party is represented fully.
According to Metros, the DTP reflects "political will, democratic rights and the Kurdish issue.
However, the party faces very difficult criticism due to the recent terrorist actions. "One of the basic reasons, the party is not the basic reasons for the PKK as a terrorist organisation.
The research results showed that support for the PKK's targets.
Most (64.5 per cent) opposes the establishment of a Kurdish state in northern northern part, while 95.2 per cent said they are unable to stay in Turkey if it is in a state.
More than half of the survey participants (51.5 per cent) said the border operation was necessary for the "border campaign" in northern Iraq.
As politics, around 60 per cent of the participants said Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's name.
The survey poll showed 65 per cent votes in the elections, while 6.3 per cent said they would vote in the AKP in the next elections.
The research team warned that these figures are different from the real electoral turnout, and some participants warn that the DTP could not want to see the DTP.

For that, Eastern European and Central Asia countries need to spend their restrictions and encourage private companies, such as restrictions systems, to encourage restrictions, "he said.
Here, governments should not be able to ensure research from research, but that is necessary to provide public funding from public work, while private companies should be allowed to pay research for those companies.
"The government has a more important role: to make the necessary structural reforms to bring research by the end of research.

The government also should facilitate public access to the internet, encouraging companies to facilitate the right financial report and should support the rule of law.
The same thing is to fight corruption and implementation of the rules for the protection of property rights. "

In July, Montenegro chose his own symbolic symbolic, which was based on the 19th century: the new disappointment has been replaced by two conservative and evidence, open, infrastructure.
The small republic's new marriage was a former national singer "Aeh".
The state symbol issue has sparked political reactions, while some argue that the initiative of Montenegro's symbols is to revive the government's pro-independence stance.
Indeed, Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic announced he would represent a unilateral Montenegrin representation, which would win independence by the beginning of 2005.
Other Montenegrin officials have expressed similar talks.

The UN General Assembly adopted a resolution Thursday (9 September) to be supported by Serbia and Belgrade, and called for the start of direct talks between Belgrade and Pristina.
The initiative came after Serbia agreed to change a draft bill demanding Kosovo's status.

The unprecedented verdict was adopted with a union of 192 assembly.
"The tender process will contribute to peace, security, security and stability in the region, and is aimed at improving progress towards improving the European Union and improving living standards," the resolution said.
The resolution acknowledging the EU's role in the Kosovo talks would play a medical role in July, argues that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) recommended that Kosovo's declaration of independence is not disappointed.
Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic, who is in school, voiced confidence that this is "a document without the basic status issue".
Jeremic also stressed that Serbia does not recognise Kosovo's independence.
The Serbian delegation was delayed hundreds of hours during a meeting of the General Assembly's session of the Kosovo delegation, President Fatmir Sejdiu, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci and Foreign Minister Orender Hyseni.
Following the six-month debate, Parliament Speaker decided to allow Kosovo representatives to remain at the end of the meeting.
Jeremic told Serbian media that the dispute was resolved as "a result of the representatives of the United States, Germany, Britain, Britain and France" to invite representatives of Kosovo Albanians.
Despite the tension of the parliamentary session, Pristina's new reaction was positive.
"The decision is completely completely completely in the reality of Kosovo and the region," the government said.
"This draft draft is in line with the ICJ's position, which has made clear that the declaration of Kosovo's independence is completely completely completely completely completely completely in line with international law.
In addition, the new draft is closely closely to any negotiations on Kosovo's political status, "he said.
Kosovo leaders voiced hope that the state is ready to co-operate with Serbia as part of the framework of bilateral interests, and in the framework of the Euro-Atlantic perspective framework.
The leaders, however, underlined that sovereignty, territorial integrity and the local constitution will not be brought to the agenda.
Before the session of parliament session, Thaci said Kosovo and Serbia are facing joint problems, and should establish constructive co-operation in practical issues, such as energy, telecommunications, organised crime, missile, registration, losses and returns.
US Deputy Representative for UN Rosemary DiCarlo said the EU's proposal to support the entity's entities to enter the process of constructive dialogue in Washington.
"For us, progress in the region and for Serbia, it is time to open a new census in relations in relations with Serbia and Kosovo," DiCarlo said.

Since 1999, nine banks operate in Kosovo have been operating, and high credit rates are negative to the country's economic development.
Following that, the Kosovo Reconstruction Commission (KRK) has started investigating whether banks are high in a mutual agreement, with high interest rates.
"Kosovo banks have been detained to investigate the suspect of complicated agreements.
If the sentences can be able to do with the discovery, the sentences of the Reconstruction Law could find 10%, "he said.
The Raiffeisen Bank and Proret Bank, which operates the logistics of the banking system, envisions higher interest rates in Kosovo.
"The interest rates in the country's banks are very similar to each other, as well as those in the region," he said.
The Institute for Protection Research (GAP) in Pristina is a three-year study on the research of research of a research of research on the Kosovo banking system, which is published by the banking system in Watch on the Kosovo banking system. The most popular loans -- personal, agriculture, agriculture, agriculture, agriculture and concrete data.
Experts argue that many businesses are based on a bank loan, but high interest rates do not have the creation conditions for the development of the business climate.
"The changes in interest rates between 2011 and 2011 are changing between 9% and 24%.
Local loans, loans or concrete loans, have a lower interest rates that have been allowed to create 70% of the total loans in Kosovo over the past three years, created by commercial and agricultural loans that have been given in Kosovo, "he said.
Heroi-Puka argues that low interest rates will improve Kosovo's economic development and financial stability.
"The interest rates have a positive impact on the demand of loans, and this is a good development of the economy," said Heroi Puka.
"The banks are not a unique of agreements between the banks.
Instead, banks have shown their shares, and there is no model for competitiveness with others.
This status quo resigns two or three tolerance -- the market leader's bank, "he said.
He added that the government allows changes to change change in the banking system, while must take steps to strengthen financial stability.
"The ratification law will allow the adoption of the laws to be adopted as a first step in this direction.
First, I can say that the functioning of courts is a precondition for the functioning of debt.
In the past, the concrete loan system will allow the concrete loan demand for the concrete loan system to reduce interest rates, "he said.
According to the Bank Watch report, the financial crisis in Kosovo has sparked a loan of loans last year, but also sparked a bigger.
"The global financial crisis has affected the quality of the quality of Kosovo's economy and bank loans.
Therefore, the total loans are 5.9% of the total loans, while this rate was 4.4% in 2009.
The banks see growth in loans risk to the risk of interest rates in early 2011, "he said.

According to the paper, this means that 40 cities per litre per litre per litre per litre.
Venizelos reportedly reportedly pledged that the government will take measures to meet the EU and the IMF, as well as to prevent the country's inflation rate to prevent its inflation.

The package also includes a new aspect tax tax, which Greek authorities hope that they will help the 2 billion euros needed to close this year's budget deficit.
Although the IMF does not affect this open problem, it should focus on tax evasion estimates.

Sandzak, southern Serbia's problems
Although Serbia faces with northern Kosovo, Serbia has been sparked in other parts.

Following tensions in northern Kosovo last week, Belgrade said the two potential challenges revealed more restrictions.
First, some Bosniak parts in the Sandzak region announced they would want free autonomy.
In the end, Albanians in southern Serbia protested protests from local education conditions.
Analysts in Belgrade believe that Serbia's developments in these two region are connected with Kosovo crisis and Serbia's bid to obtain EU candidate status by the end of the year.
"Serbia is currently under strong pressure on the possibility of other issues concerning the possibility of northern Kosovo as well as the possibility of EU candidate status," said political scientific professor Predrag Simic. "I think that such an pressure is very optimistic for the future of Brussels is very optimistic."
Sandzak was inaugurated on Thursday (September 15th) by the leader of the Muslim Community in Serbia, Muammar Zukorlic.
Zukorlic has criticised Belgrade for discrimination against Bosniaks in Sandzak, and announced that the region would want free autonomy.
He added that Sandzak will open regional bureaus in Brussels, Washington, Istanbul and Sarajevo.
Zukorlic's support came from Bosnian Muslim leader Reis Mustafa Ceric, who criticised Belgrade for a "increasing discrimination" against the Sancians.
Belgrade wants to create a "bad and clinic environment", Ceric warned, warning that "a new crisis in Europe".
He cited the current attitude of the current attitude from the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s.
Ceric's comments were not met by representatives of the Bosniak party in the Serbian government.
Bosniak MP Meho Omanovic, a member of the ruling coalition, said Ceric's words are "unfair and dangerous" and would provide any benefit from Bosniaks in Sandzak.
"Instead of facilitating the internal divisions, the tender is a factor of new divisions," Omanovic said.
According to Dusan Janjic, head of the Ethnic Relations Forum, the debate is not the winner of the debate.
"The Sandzak wants to replace Serbia's open problems on the agenda," Janjic said. "If Serbia is on the agenda of its membership candidate, it may be very difficult if it is to receive a date for opening talks with the EU."
Meanwhile, Simic agrees that the pro-Milosevic era is unprecedented.
However, Simic said Sandzak's economic problems and social tensions caused.
"In Sandzak, there is a social situation in the situation in the other parts of Serbia, but there is a lot of Bosnia's multiethnic structures, because it is being used for them," Simic told SETimes.
Before the Sandzak announced the Sandzak, thousands of Albanians living in southern Serbia organised a protest in the education system on 13 September in Bujanovac.
The demonstration of Albanian representative in the Serbian parliament said the goal is "politically" and that the goal is to show problems concerning the "education issues because Albanians" in priority ".
After that incident, the Serbian government said it was unrealistic to speed up efforts to resolve the problem.

Agriculture, Doha Talks
Albania's Deputy Economy Minister Ilir Ciko was held in Cancin on 11 September.
Talks focused on agricultural subsidies and the EU's efforts to assess issues on investment, supplies and competitiveness issues. [AFP]
Romanian Finance Minister and former Finnish Minister Daniel Daianu explained that the situation has been shown.
By Daniel Daianu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest - 22 / 09 / 03
In the past period, the entire world has been intensified on Iraq and the Middle East.
Many governments have been creating problems such as the agenda, jeopolitical issues and terrorist attacks.
However, the economic situation in many countries in the world has become a member of the economic situation in many countries, the Gajni Safi Hasila, who has sparked high or rise unemployment rates, high unemployment rates, high unemployment rates, and high unemployment rates, commercial disaster disaster disaster disaster.
Although the US world economy is logical, some countries are linked to positive signs that the prospects of the US economy will show the prospects of the US economy, the reality of tension, even tension, the optimism.
As part of these conditions, the situation faces the situation, social, economic and policy faces more worse.
Africa's major part of the Africa and the Latin American are also deployed in economic problems, discrimination, social discrimination and violence in some areas of ethnic groups.
The state and government partners, which ended with intelligence, is a more concern.
These trends are an important donation for the meeting of Cancin's World Trade Organisation (WTO).
When the DOHA Trade Protection Protection has been launched, many environmental process has been convinced to prevent the risk of the current rival in the world, but also in line with the current rival in world trade.
The free trade debate on free trade and fair trade is expected to be discussed at the DOHA Trade Process. The development of countries' agricultural products are expected to be taken into considerable restrictions on developing countries' markets, developing agricultural products, developing countries' agricultural products and the impact of the agricultural markets.
For many countries, agricultural products are the main exception of agricultural products.
In other poor countries, the public spending is on food spending on food spending.
The United States and the EU have to provide about 280 billion euros in the agriculture area, but only about 50 billion euros are discriminated.
These high primary subsidies in the revenue countries are mostly imposed, and that their own products are sparked to a jurisdiction against the farmers of developing countries.
The serious obstacles to fulfil the right demands of countries should not be taken.
The farmers in the rich countries may have to have to stop the implementation of reforms.
In particular, security concerns have also been entering the state as well as to prevent excessive dependence on foreign supplies.
The current regulations are trying to combat the villages in poor countries, punishing and punishing the development efforts.
Although the World Bank's negative situation has been aware of the differences of years, the United States and the EU are aware of the actual differences, national interests have been obliged in a proper reform process.
A deal on the trade of agricultural products before the United States and the EU is expected to be discussed in Cancin.
Analysts, however, do not have any concrete figures on tax and subsidies or subsidies to restrict restrictions.
This agreement, which has been respected as a census, reflects it more difficult.
In particular, progress towards trade (particularly agricultural products) could affect the negative effects of Cancin's meetings on trade abroad.
The EU has made a very determined position on joint negotiations on investment rules, competitiveness policy and other trade regulations.
These rules that "Singer concerns" are important, but are not seen as a critical factor in this phase of discussions.
If the main formulation is being implemented, trade rules could not contribute to economic development.
The fourth is that trade issues except Doha's agenda will be unlikely to be achieved by the successful results of the Cancin meeting.
The agricultural sector is widely widely widely widely widely widely.
In general, 8 per cent of GDP accounts for agriculture.
Albania, for example, is closer to 50 per cent.
The population's biggest division is in rural areas, as well as low and low and public budget support.
The situation of the population, which has not been made in terms of technology / efficiency / efficiency and has not been made in order to enter EU markets, and in the process of developing in Southeast Europe.
With high unemployment rates in the region, this problem could facilitate social disputes, facilitating more pressure on local economies.
The demand of less developed countries in Europe is a strong need for reforms in the path of agricultural products (CAP), demanding demand of agricultural Policy (CAP). In the meantime, Europe's chances of joining the EU are higher than the chances of social insurance, social and social insurance.
Public subsidies for these countries will provide an example of security network in the public budget. Poland and Hungary, which is expected to join the EU in 2004, are facing the problem.
As for Romania and Bulgaria, the situation is more serious, the situation will live in the Western Balkans: to live in the same principles: integration and agricultural subsidies to the EU.
Therefore, the Orthodox Policy, which is seen as one of the specific problems in the world trade, could be able to see unfair policies in countries in the EU accession process.
Most of these countries want to join the club, but the economy is not enough for competitiveness.
Unfortunately, rural, rural, rural could be controlled if the effective is not intended to create social security networks, and if the operational movement against abroad has not been made in a few restrictions.
Anccka Doha said the trade process is crucial to the development of countries in the EU, countries should be a lot of logistics, slogistics.
Balkan countries in the Balkan countries that have already been unprecedented for time, which are less unprecedented in agricultural subsidies (and more interest in agricultural subsidies) could provide a more strengthening preservation to domestic products if the Doha trade process is successful.
In order to end the Doha trade process, the leaders of developed countries must show visa-free state immunity, creating the problems of the world's poor countries with poor countries, and to establish a compromise policy.

EU foreign ministers agreed on Monday (January 28th) to open co-operation in trade and education areas in trade and education, facilitating visa requirements for Serbian passengers.
"Serbia's road to EU membership is a very bad instrument," Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said after a meeting in Brussels.
Most of the ministers attended the meeting with the EU in November to remove Serbia's Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU.
However, a decision was blocked by the Netherlands, who insisted that Serbia must meet the requirements for full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
The Hague tribunal still wants to arrest and arrest four remaining war crimes fugitives, including former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and military commander Ratko Mladic, who played a role in the Balkan conflicts in the 1990s.
In the past, EU foreign ministers agreed on a new proposal on a new proposal, which would present Serbia and that Rupel described the bloc as the first major step towards eventual membership.

The EU plans to sign the new framework agreement on 7 February, four days after the presidential elections in Serbia.
Brussels hopes that this date would boost the chance of President Boris Tadic, the most pro-European leader, Boris Tadic.

Nikolic's party is head of war crimes indictee Vojislav Seselj, who is arrested in The Hague.
Some EU officials voiced hope that a new agreement would be signed by the signing of a new agreement, nor the SAA if Nikolic wins.
"Nikolic's victory is very different," the AFP quoted Spain's European Affairs Minister Albert Navarus as saying at a meeting in Brussels.
"There are very difficult to be losing in Serbia today," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said. "The Serbian people are in a European future between a nationalist past.
I am confident that the Serb people will elect the European future and really really really really. "

According to experts, this increase in human trafficking is the biggest reasons for poverty, poverty and political pressure.
Experts say the problem will not be able to find a solution to the problem, if people who are unable to seek human trafficking.
The high revenue of the refugee refugee was increased by 2002, when a widespread salary of human trafficking, low risks and penal level of prison.

A total of 23,000 teachers will be the first to start the new teaching system.
The new system will begin in schools, while children will start in the age of 7, and they will start nine unions, with eight unions.
The amendments aims to make Macedonia in line with most Western European countries where students began in 65.
However, the reform has not sparked some challenges.
Most of the schools in the country have been built at least a lot of students, and now will have to be able to begin with the feasibility of schools.
Nevertheless, the education ministry says.
Education Minister Sulejman Russia told reporters that conditions would improve.
Many questions about school buildings have been resolved in the last ten months and will continue.
The country has completed new urban authorities, and new scientific books were registered.

Economic, institutional regulations must be held in countries in EU
The Balkan countries that are approaching EU membership targets should be aware of the economic impasse.
Romania's former finance minister and economist Daniel Daianu, has attracted some risks.
By Daniel Daianu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest -- 14 / 08 / 06
Some EU members are worried about the enlargement process, while the Balkan countries are continuing to move forward to their accession targets. [File]
Romania and Bulgaria are expected to join the European Union on 1 January 2007.
Another candidate country, Croatia's accession process is on the agenda.
Meanwhile, some EU members are concerned about the process of enlargement, while the Balkan countries continue to move forward.
The number of the countries' accession process is in the region with governments in order to ensure the necessary economic, institutional and political regulations to ensure the EU.
I reiterated what the integration is in terms of the economic policy.
The most functioning market economy, such as the "functioning market economy", needs to be able to leave one of a economy with the EU, and to make a more deeper issue of economic competitiveness.
To enter the European club, the traditional policies should be able to make a rules that are unable to make traditional policies.
For example, the liberalisation of capital capital capital (capital) is a challenge of time, a challenge is acceptable.
Meanwhile, new members will remain at the same time, or at the euro zone.
The real true is that a lack of competitive economy would have to have to have to be very difficult in this market.
In other countries participating in the EU, the financing sector, an independent central bank, the property rights of property rights and mechanisms, need to be key to key importance, such as a special sector, a private sector, health system, health system and the implementation of mechanisms.
The capacity to combat corruption and organised crime is one of the key conditions.
Economic stability is essential.
For that, the decision is to work under a sustainable level of inflation, reducing budget deficits and to be deployed in low levels of budget deficits.
Economic stability is a way to foster budget restrictions and good management agencies in both public sector and private sector.
The bridge budget deficits are increasing pressure on the retirement system.
Public organisations are one of the key issues that have been concerned.
It's a major job to privatise these companies.
However, some public companies will remain better to improve the management of the administration as a solution.
Property organisations should be able to hold a good arrangement and that citizens should not have to pay extremism prices for services.
Economic stability is one of the most important problems facing many countries. [EU]
However, we need some warnings that we need to be hiding.
In fact, the economy policy needs to establish commercial administrative.
A low inflation rate of 2-3 per cent is a very difficult goal for the economies, which is lower than the sale of the sale of the EU average, in terms of the sale of sale park.
Increased economies, demanding pressure, supervised inflation.
The price of local services' prices (Balassa-Samuelson) could lead to this.
Balkan economies have been captured in recent years, such as Central and Eastern European countries.
However, there is a more secure capital, and more stable human resources need to invest.
Currently, low budget deficits can be revealed by two times.
First, it can really be able to secure the true to public services, such as low figures, infrastructure, infrastructure, education and health, and a serious problem in the region.
The second is to have to increase public spending in the framework of facility after the new members join the EU.
Therefore, budget deficits are likely to be limited.
If the ruling institutions have made progress in tax evasion, the budget deficit could block overall economic stability if they do not make progress in tax evasion (pension system).
Currently, the growing current account deficits and budget deficits are not the same.
In the Middle East and Eastern European economies, economic growth differences are increasingly higher than the EU's permanent members and increasing banks in private sector loans.
In the framework of capital liberalisation, the current account deficits are not supported by direct investments.
The boycott of revenues is to ensure the work of governments who are trying to create a medical budget policy.
The IMF's reason for more than Bulgaria is the reason for more than a budget deficit from Bulgaria. It's a 12 per cent of GDP in the last period, and the establishment of money is not allowed to allow the money.
We are returning to the competitiveness.
For the region's economies, foreign currency can be a surprise increase in foreign currency rules, because they can be able to live.
This is a negative effect of competitiveness and employment.
This will be more important in the economies, such as Western Balkan countries, such as unemployment.
At the time when products from China and other Asian countries imported imports are imported to European markets.
The competitiveness telecommunications ended a major time to ensure low wage in Europe.
To protect competitiveness competitiveness, the new development of IT and communication technologies must be made to be made and serious investments in human resources.
The most important issue so far has been on a significant issue, and some important benefits can bring the problems.
Of course, citizens who work abroad are sent to the disasters, money laundering a 25-40 per cent division of trade unions (Romania and Bulgaria) can seek a half of euros.
However, many families have been losing through farmers and many families are losing.
The unemployment rate of unemployment, such as Western Balkan countries, is very high, and economies that the labour export is a clear impression.
The governments in the Western Balkan countries should be able to see their reality in recent years, bridges, bridges of bridges, bridges, bridges, bridges and the EU's refugees.

The five-day deaths increased to 65, while the deaths were injured in public buildings.
The concerns were sparked at the end of the 13 countries.
Although many are believed to be seen as a political structure.
Hundreds of people were unemployed, while thousands were unemployed.
The injuries denied more than 45 million residents with the agricultural reserves and agricultural reserves.
Unfortunately, it was unprecedented.
The worst in the country's worst in the century has yet to be held only weeks before the general elections scheduled for 16 September.
Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis and the ruling New Democracy (ND) party has been responsible for "environmental terrorists", while parties in various parts of the political opponents, have accused the government's motivation to ask the crisis.
However, public opinion polls cited the polls in a sustainable situation.
The ND also points to a difference between 0.7% and 3.5% in polls.
The same polls say the population is not satisfied with the tolerance of a third of the population, and that one of both people think that it is more probably the government.
Nevertheless, the ruling party lost only one or two per cent support.
The main opposition party, PASOK, seems to be seen as a political obstacle.
The party has ordered the country for more than ten years ago before the ND in March 2004, and has been charged with violating the laws of violent environmental protection laws.
The ultranationalist data and other parties that have been discovered by the public's disaster, seems to concern about the parliament's information about the first time in the current situation.
The smaller parties include small parties.
When the two main parties are registered, 11% of the women say they are unacceptable.
"These details have been increasing," the British daily Independent reported on Tuesday (September 4th), senior analyst Eliameti's senior analyst Eliameti, as saying.
"This is a result of the state's failure to prevent them with them and not solve the situation as a result of resolving the situation."
Among them, frustration and bloc software are calling for the people to remove their votes from the two main parties abroad.
The amendments say the infrastructure of infrastructure between the Greek people is not only a general indictment that the current government is not only a crime.
Many of the public believe it is unsuccessful of the government.
This means that five parties can be able to enter parliament.
Greece could soon find themselves in a weak government based on the alliance of small political forces.

Cypriot President Demetris Christofias (right) and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat agreed on some key issues. [Getty Images]
"The two leaders agreed to discuss the only sovereignty and unilateral sovereignty and citizens," the UN said on Tuesday (1 July) after a meeting between leaders of the divided Mediterranean island's President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot President Mehmet Ali Talat. "The leaders of the two leaders agreed to agree on full implementation
The surprise statement sparked mixed reactions and expectations in Cyprus.
The issue of digital question and questions about citizens are the most important issues.
The northern Cyprus Republic of Northern Cyprus was demanding "congress" to protect the rights of Turkish Cypriots.
Women in 1960 were forced to live in the enclaves in the Turkish Cypriots.
Therefore, there are no strong unity to the government under Cyprus control.
The presence of the unilateral sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus was one of the main positions of Greek Cypriots.
The latest major effort to unify Cyprus was adopted by the Turkish Cypriots in 2004, which rejected by the Greek Cypriots by Annan Plant, but the founder of a "unilateral international sovereignty", which was rejected by Greek Cypriots.
The details of the agreement on the sovereignty were not announced on Tuesday.
Analysts say the UN is "constructive" on sovereignty and citizens ", in order to encourage negotiations.
Tuesday's deal was a change for Turkish Cypriots, but Talat had to accept Talat's Christofias to accept the reopening of full cultural talks before a meeting.
So far, the Greek Cypriot government has slowed the process and insisted on comprehensive preparations for the start of negotiations.
Turkish Cypriot nationalists agreed on Tuesday that the Turkish Cypriots' history '' 'history' '' -- the only sovereignty -- the only sovereignty of sovereignty -- is in a bridge.
But the ruling Democratic Party, however, acknowledged that the Greek Cypriots are disappointed as disappointment because they do not start a real interest.
Christofias has been under pressure on his own radio.
The Greek Cypriot Rumbs have been against Turkish-run Turks over the last year against immigrants to northern Cyprus, but Hollyides announced they are ready to accept 50,000 Turkish immigrants.
Turkish Cypriot Parliament Speaker Nicosenoglu described the talks as a good step.
"The details of intelligence and citizens' issues will be announced when the negotiations started," he said.
The Greek Cypriot administration is a member of the island in 2004, but the island does not see the island's north because of the EU's secular Turkish Cypriot state, due to its international isolation.
Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot leaders will meet on 25 July.

The Greek representative court has decided to extradite Dejan Milenkovic of key indictees for Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic's March 2003 assassination.
"The Contact court has decided on Monday (23 August) in Thessaloniki," the AFP quoted a court official as saying.
Milenkovic was arrested in the northern town of the port on 16 July, under a warning international arrest warrant over the fugitive.
A police chief said that he was arrested as "very beneficious travel", but no identity documents on armed and that any identity documents have not been made.
Two weeks after the arrests, Belgrade sent an official extradition to Greek authorities.
In addition to more than 100 pages from the Orijinal demands, Belgrade has made many other materials, including the laws that have been charged since then.
Milenkovic, 34, did not use the right to impose the Greek court's decision, saying he wants to prove and prove corruption.
It was not yet clear when it comes to the island's time.
According to the AFP, the team must be approved by Greek Justice Minister Anastos Papaligas as priority.
After returning to Serbia, the suspects involved in the Djindjic's assassination are expected to be transferred to a special organised crime court.
Milenkovic, known as Bugssen, is among 13 tunes and paramilitary officers who have been charged with the murder of Serbia's first prime minister since World War II.
Serbian prosecutors say the indictee is a member of the organised crime organisation, believed to be Djindjic's assassination.
The 13 suspects have been tried in the special court in Belgrade, including Zvezdan Jovanovic, believed to be killed.
Milorad Lukovic, a former paramilitary commander and the assassination plan, was surrendered to police in May, nearly five months after the court began.
Djindjic was killed in a long-term consumption, where the Serbian government built on 12 March 2003.
Milenkovic is also the top suspect of a successful assassination initiative in Djindjic on 21 February 2003.
The chemical player in the management of Djindjic, who was in the leadership, was sparked in the shooting, and the prime minister was unable to stop a car.
Milenkovic was arrested shortly after the arrest was arrested.
Serbian Justice Minister Zoran Stojkovic, who also linked to the extradition of extradition, said Milenkovic would likely be delayed with "more time to recognise the defence authorities".
According to Serbian officials, the goal of Djindjic's assassination has returned to Serbia's pro-Western government and brought to power by former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
Djindjic, who played the role in Milosevic's extradition to The Hague, wants to move forward co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal and to stop organised crime in his country.

At a recent press conference, Bulgaria's Executive Director Nikolai Popov announced some details about tax evasion trafficking.
In a series of control, 62 per cent of the country's most prominent citizens discovered their assets by tax officials.
As a result, unpaid taxes cost 3m euros in Bulgaria, or 30,000 euros per tax trafficking.
Three years ago, authorities have launched two similar operations, after "the Sivalent Operation".
Amac has been allowed to meet the true assets.
Authorities aims to benefit all details over 50,000 euros, with all details over 50,000 euros.
More than 200,000 Bulgarian citizens were elected for supervised control, but due to the budget restrictions.
According to Popov, the investigations have been welcomed with radical refugees and tax evasion.
In an incident, a family of 1500 square metres metres from Sofia's most irregularities discovered in one of the most irregularities.
Another, a husband households stopped a treasury treasury at the spring of this rich.
Meanwhile, however, the majority registered to Germany or Austria to pay tax on their owners.
Popov's deputy deputy, Valentin Vidarov, told reporters that ten tax inspectors are working on the ongoing Sivellor operation, and that they have taken an interview with more than 1,000 houses and agencies.
Most of them are businessmen and state officers.
The inspectors are planning to promote their "assets" in co-operation with the Intelligence Agency after the "exercise".
That still seems to be a permanent prospect.
The risk operations are not independent because they are charged with charges of transparency and independent control.
One reason for the reason is that tax officials may be corruption within them. The participants revealed 70 per cent of the respondents, in a recent survey conducted in a recent survey, which worked at 69 per cent of the tax director.
The results confirmed that tax officers are in the current general station that they are not unable to corruption.
Despite the issue closely approaches, the authorities are very true that financial interventions are interested in low salaries and to accept money or to accept money.
If the tax officials don't submit the cases in the coming months, there is no other risk of "Public Operation".

The international community must not make the closure of the Office of the High Representative (OHR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) to ensure that the current conditions should not be needed, the International Crisis Group (ICG) said on Monday (9 March).
The situation in BiH is high, high, and the situation in BiH has been reflected "the risk of the risk of the country's links", according to a report by the Brussels central defence group.
The ICG report issued a two-day meeting of the 55 countries and international organisations, which revealed the implementation of the 1995 Dayton Peace Accords.
The meeting began on 25 March in Sarajevo.
The ICG said the PIC should not decide to end until June 30th, as "high representative or the office".
Instead, the PIC should "try to keep its office" until all conditions needed for the transition of a EU Special Representative (EUSR) from BiH, it said.
The new high representative (Bonn) should keep its authority, but only a few cases are serious threats for example, for example, for example, and must use them to prevent their violations.
BiH still fulfilling the Dayton agreements, resolving the Brcko Society's status and to resolve the public finances, the ICG stressed.
The study warned that a decision to close the OHR would "risk the EU's ability to implement secular policies for Bosnia".
"If the OHR closed, we will need a strong EU mission to encourage BiH's candidacy to encourage stability and encourage BiH's candidacy," the ICG said.
Furthermore, the EU will still need to improve the deeper classes in the situation.
"The EU should be an instrument for the Dayton agreement against unilateral divisions and now focus on special authority, as well as financial support," the report said.
The EU mission, which will replace the OHR, must operate under a high-level official that will serve as the head of the EUSR and the European Commission in BiH.
The EU should guarantee the Dayton agreements with BiH and the Dayton agreements, and that any of the EU should focus on a variety agreement on a "withdrawal" on variety of the state "or that BiH entities" will be rejected, the report said.
The ICG also recommended that EUSR will report on the UN Security Council and other entities.
It also proposed that the EU is co-operating with EUSR to boost NATO's presence in the FBiH.

Bulgaria's citizens are more efficient to remove their holidays in neighbouring countries, while recommended prices for foreign tourists not only to attract more bribes, but also to attract more bribes to local tourists.
Unfortunately, the number of pieces is another problem in Bulgarian tourism.
The delays are very quickly and they do not get faster education until their authority.

We have yet to see that the Justice and Development Party (AKP) will not create a difference.
By Fatih Baran for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 13 / 05 / 03
Turkey's Human Rights Association (IHD) issued a new report that assesses the human rights situation in the first three months of 2003.
According to the report, it is not a positive development in these issues.
"As the result, we understand the truth of the job truth in this report," the IHD said.
"Unfortunately, we don't see any progress in this area.
In a position on freedom of expression, we reflect the comment of public prosecutors and rights in freedom of expression, "he said.
In addition to this, Turkey received a victory in improving human rights in the Kurdish broadcasting and education, as the goal of full membership in the EU.
The coalition government, led by former Prime Minister Bulent Eceval, has made some reforms last year.
Former Prime Minister Abdullah Gul has completed these reforms over the critical importance of Turkey's success in the EU.

Macedonia should show Macedonia's ability to make the problems in a democratic manner, NATO Parliament Speaker Jose Lello said on Monday (November 26th).
Lello also rejected the country's proposals that the name dispute between neighbouring Greece has damaged Macedonia's NATO bid.
"The name dispute is not the problem of NATO.
This is a bilateral issue between the two countries.
However, when I know, there is no obstacle to a country's name with NATO membership, "he said.
Macedonia's actual structure is to approve the necessary legal legislation, Lello said.
The rule of law, protection of minority rights and the fight against corruption is the main factors of the country's accession process, he said.
Macedonia hopes to receive an invitation to join the Alliance at the Adriatic Charter next year in Bucharest.
NATO officials, however, say they do not have yet to be invited to join the accession.
NATO Secretary General Martin Erdman visited Macedonia earlier this month to assess the implementation of the National Programme for NATO membership.
This was not the most important assessment of friendship and potential.
Erdman's team will submit a clear signal on the country's chances in Bucharest.
During his visit to Erdman, the NATO reform process could be sufficient among political parties, and that there will be enough dialogue among political parties, and that there will be no current and that political stability in the long term is defined.
Macedonia's national co-ordinator for NATO, Nikola Dimitrov, said the Alliance is "a good signal" for us, because it is "a good signal for us" in the coming period, the summit and before, "he said.
President Branko Crvenkovski said Macedonia's prospects are linked to him.
"We have to do our primary.
We should not complete the Council of the Judicial Council, and we must not be able to implement the law, "he said.
He suggested that all laws that do not contribute to NATO and EU membership requirements are not contributed to the parliament.

For the possibility of Belgrade's position, Pristina leaders have threatened to share the only unilateral declaration of negotiations.
Greece is among the EU member states that reflect the possibility of Kosovo's possible division.
However, a prominent analyst on the Balkans suggested on Monday that Athens could be a possible change in its position.
"Greece is unfortunately unfortunately unfortunately unfortunately," the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network quoted Tim Judah as saying.
Kosovo was one of the regional issues in the region.
Other talks include Macedonia's name dispute with the name dispute, Turkey's EU bid, Cyprus issue and relations between the countries.
Voicing the strategic importance of inter-Albanian relations, Papoulias voiced his country's support for Albania's Euro-Atlantic integration.

The leaders of the world's leaders have to focus on ways to continue the transformation of the interim level, IMF economist Borvier Budjman said. [IMF]
The global economy has started to survive the deeper crisis over the past 60 years, IMF chief economist Borvier Blanjman said in a report released on Wednesday (August 19th).
However, Blanko warned that the process will be slow.
"Integration started.
To continue to continue this, both countries and the countries will need to make sensitive restructuring, "he said.
A right reunification restructuring would help continue to continue in the world, he added.
US exports to China and other Asia have to be increased, but the current account is needed.
The crisis, which applied last spring last spring, says the crisis is not normal.
Therefore, models are not being used to mean the current situation.
"The increasing commitment will not be unprecedented," Bajrd said. "The benefits of the benefits and demanding will affect the demand for the coming years."
Most countries are preparing to see an increase in economic growth for the next few years, he said.
This growth, however, will not be unprecedented until unemployment must be reduced.
Welcoming the need to be implemented from the need for a long time, economist said they can only be extended to structural measures aimed at ensuring "the future growth programmes".
"Therefore, the IMF estimates suggest that the cost of the cost of the crisis is a decline," he said. "Therefore, the cost of the cost of the crisis is the most important amount of financial benefits to continue to continue its growth programme, even if it has been sold.
However, there must be a special request to replace the residence of financial disaster, "he said.
"In almost all countries, the crisis has been financed by financial costs and increasing taxes," Blanjman said. "It is unlikely that we can be able to return to the old growth path to the former growth path."
A analysis based on the 88 banking crisis in various countries over the past 40 years, citing an analysis, the IMF concluded that these are not reduced to lower growth in average.
"Therefore, the history of history is likely to return to the rise of the world's economic growth rise," the economist said. "But in particular countries, especially developed countries, especially in the middle of the average, normal improvement can be able to be able to be able to be easy," he added.
He also stressed that co-operation between the crisis and risks would be crucial for the next few years.

In November 1995, the agreement was designed to establish the most responsible responsibility for the peace agreement in the divided country.

Talks on judicial reform in BiH begins
Talks envisions a potential exercise to live between the High Representative and RS.

RS President Milorad Dodik met with EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton in Banja Luka on 13 May. [Reuters]
During a meeting between Republika Srpska President Milorad Dodik and EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton last month, an agreement reached an agreement on structural dialogue on the structural dialogue that both officials would be long-term.
The restructuring process was necessary due to a referendum on Dodik's court and the prosecutor's office.
Bosnian Serbs have long long been criticised the current system for a process that would focus on war crimes against Serbs during the BiH conflict.
At the first round in Banja Luka last week, EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said the process could be recognised as "more than BiH" in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
Ashton pledged that a special committee would be established as a step towards restructuring.
The committee will submit recommendations on how to resolve problems in the judiciary will be resolved.
The main goal of dialogue is to strengthen the law and create an independent and unindependent legal system.
"This is a very serious business and business and representatives of the Republika Srpska have prepared a number of documents and analysts," said Igor Radojicic, head of the RS Parliament,.
Radojicic expects the first day of dialogue with politicians to be the first day of the June 6th meeting.
High Representative and EU Special Representative Valentin Inzko said BiH is no doubt that BiH has to begin by the end of this process, under a Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
"The process that started in BiH is that every country wants to become a member of the EU," Inzko said.
Dodik has made clear, however, that RS would not support the establishment of a High Court in BiH, one of the EU proposals.
"We don't question a house of house courts and prosecutors, but every situation should be implemented.
We will not accept the unity of the legal budget, such as proposed by some of them, "he said.
"I believe that the EU should not find a solution to fulfilling the administrative standards.
At the same time, we should be respected until the rule of law and constitutional system.
If some things need to change, we will not change the constitution reforms without constitutional reforms, "he said.
But Vitomir Popovic, director of the Banja Luka Law Faculty, does not participate.
"There is no longer a long way for this dialogue on the work of the judiciary, so that this reform will be completed before a debate on the work of the Bosnian institutions."
European representatives said the final decision will come with specific proposals after each negotiating round, but the latest decision would be a key to Bosnian authorities.
Before the first time, a survey on the judicial system in BiH must respond to 31 August.
Turkey's EU accession process sparked
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government has established a new ministry to speed up the process.

The progress in the EU integration process has slowed. [Reuters]
At a time when the EU accession process is almost stopped, the Turkish government hopes to revive the interior ministry.
Turkey's progress in the EU integration process, which currently holds the state minister and chief negotiator Egel Baghdad, currently holds the co-ordination of Turkey's progress in the EU integration process.
The government has an ambitious goal: I am full with the EU by the end of 2013.
According to retired ambassador to Turkey's most refugee diplomats, the ministry has sent an important message to both rivers and abroad, citing the country's readiness to become a full member of the European Union.
"This is evident that the presence of Turkish foreign policy is under way," he told SETimes.
Turkey's slower regional diplomacy and the EU, as well as EU members and France's entry into the EU, have caused fears that Turkey's entry into Turkey's EU member states and France's participation.
At the same time, however, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the ruling AKP party has started its five-year mandate -- a number of mistakes that could serve as a key chapter to the EU integration process.
These include preparing a new constitution and efforts to resolve the Kurdish problem.
The new ministry will include the same level in the cabinet.
For Baghdad's progress, the EU Secretary General (EUGS) has promised direct prime minister to report the prime minister, while the ministry will have full responsibility for the EU interview.
According to Arbert, however, the situation could lead to a quarter between various ministries and medieval centres and medieval centres, so that the new ministry will have to co-ordinate the implementation of the reform process and ensure that other ministries will be met.
"This ministry must be a specific and authority of the ministries of the ministries from the ministries of the interior ministries, but this has to be open for political experience," Dutin diplomat said.
Sovolm Karauak, director of the Kriter co-ordinator and the Eurohorizon Danish.
"It is an important step forward in order to reflect the transfer of the supervised cities between EUGS institutions since the establishment of the EUGS in 2000," Karaukak told SETimes.
The State Department's State Department argues that the responsibility should continue on foreign relations, arguing that EU membership should be dealt as a precedented time with foreign and boycott, rather than divisible with many countries.
Therefore, the State Department must be able to do so, the new ministry should not be able to work in a consensus such as the responsibility of Foreign Foreign Affairs, but to work in a close and effective co-operation and co-ordination.
Despite the EU's role in Turkey's reform process, the question questions that the issue and the blocking of Cyprus's new Fund in the agenda, some questions that the government could be located in the list of EU membership.
"The AKP won the election results on 12 June, together with the election results, will reduce the new ministry's event," Uststa diplomat and CNNK diplomat Yalat Eralald, told SETimes.

Authorities expect another witness to one other.
"We are based on developing infrastructure, improving infrastructure and progress in general tourism sector," Enagi Jorgoni, head of the Culture and Tourism Ministry, told SETimes.
"However, the political situation could have negative negative," he added.
Jorgoni said the infrastructure of infrastructure, including the most popular documents, is one of the main problems facing the country's potential to turn the truth of tourism.
He added that the government wants to boost investments in the sector and has drafted a draft law.
Dritan Xhago, 35, is operating a tourist forum in Tirana for eight years.
The company has offered everything to travel from scientific, scientific and pieces.
"This year's tourism is good," Xhgyo said, acknowledging that "broad political climate in Albania could affect the number of visitors.
Nevertheless, the sector has passed "a positive change" in the western level of a few years ago.
Most of the Western tourists feel tourists, cultural tourism and archaeological.
Many are from Britain, Italy, Finland and Danima.
"Albania is optimistic."
Meanwhile, the number of people from Albania is increasingly increasingly increasingly, Albanians are moving abroad for their holidays.
Xhgypo says Albania is still "exports" than imports ".
Among the reasons, it is the lowest level of service in Albania and wants to see other cultural events in Europe.
"We have been able to have the quality of the quality that we are paying for money," Xhgypo says.
In the past, Albanians have ordered to travel to countries that do not need visas to Turkey.
According to sources of the sector sources, however, the situation has changed the situation, and Croatia, Greece and Spain are increasingly increasingly increasing.
Tirana Index Index Beqo says he has chosen to send its holiday countries in different countries because it is going to see different cultural events, seeing a rich in terms of history.
"At the same time, we are also about what we want to recognise the holidays, which is in accordance with the quality and service," Beqo told SETimes.

The Serbs' political parties have asked the EU to cover their shares that the country is one of the biggest corruption producers, demanding that the country's political activities are in financing.
As a result, the Serbian parliament adopted a law Tuesday (June 14th) that it would make them transparent activities and financing the financing of these activities and allowing citizens to see money sources of money.
"The law envisions clear penalties for those who do not exist," State Department Minister Milan Markovic said, adding that all parallel financial assistance would be made public and will be done through the banks' banks.
The move will be financed outside the state, and how the parties can get money from private sources.
That means that parties in Serbia will be punished for the first time for the penal operations.
Zorana Markovic, head of the Anti-Corruption Agency for Corruption, said that new regulations on political activities are necessary because it is too much corruption in this area.
"I think that we can be satisfied because we are based on a good legal framework that is now in this area.
Therefore, I believe that political parties will be able to prevent the financing of the financing of political parties, "he said.
According to the new law, the illegal financing could be sentenced to three years in prison.
The same sentence will be obvious for political parties to jeopardise their financing.
Zlata Djordjevic, a member of the Anti-Corruption Committee for Anti-Corruption, told SETimes that the new law is important that political parties will allow to control and control their financial reports if the party is suspected.
"The control of the party activities could be very important in the absence of corruption in political scene," Djordjevic said.
Djordjevic said that the law would block the parties' part of the formation parties to take part in the elections, only for the elections.
"All parties are planning to participate in the elections are to pay a specific representation that would be removed if the party fails to win the elections if it fails to win a selection rate of 3 per cent," the committee said.
Nemanja Nenadic, a representative of the Transparency International, told SETimes that "all problems will not be solved in a sustainable way".
"Everything is based on independent state bodies and their control of them, but this is true, they have more control.
So far, there has been no approval for the support of a certain party, "he said.
Serbia's political life has not been satisfied with the new law, but all MPs say the financing of the financing of the financing of all MPs should be controlled.
Miroslav Petkovic, the leader of the opposition Democratic Party of Serbia, told SETimes that more money to the budget would be allocated and that is unacceptable in the economic crisis.
"The law is not good because state resources are implementing potential resignation for the financing of the parties -- the possibility of the public companies -- is not in no way to attract the possibility for certain parties," Petkovic said.

You need to find and convinced them to convinced their jobs to Bulgaria.
These companies are going to here because they are more efficient.
This is the benefits. "
According to Dimitrov, who thought the tax mechanism mechanism, this system was injured. "It was a lot of major investors, investors, general centres and financial control to Bulgaria," he said.
"It seems to be a total price of taxes, but not the most important price of business in Bulgaria.
If we do not have a infrastructure, if we have problems with bureaucratic and corruption, it is more expensive.
"How will the benefit of taxes will be lower?"
"There is no policy in the small villages of the town's small villages, attracting small accounts in the country, attracting a region and the economy."

Montenegrin officials proposed on February 23rd to transform a state union of Serbia-Montenegro.
Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic, Serbian President Boris Tadic and Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
Montenegro's Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic and President Filip Vujanovic said they expects an agreement with Belgrade on an alternative to ensure that the current state union is unemployed and efficient.
According to Montenegrin officials, two independent and international areas will be better results.
The leaders argue that Serbia-Montenegro is expensive, arguing that the union's secret's compensation has jeopardised the functioning of the military.
Dukanovic and Vujanovic said that the status vote would only be increased, and that Montenegro and Serbia would benefit from joining the EU and international security structures.
The first reactions from Belgrade were not positive.
The Kostunica plan described the plan as a clear violation of the Belgrade Agreement, saying it would not stay in 2003.
"We are trying to create a huge situation that will lead to the Constitutional Charter by violating the materials and violating them," Kostunica said in an interview published on Monday (February 28th).
Kostunica said Dukanovic's latest proposal shows that he is trying to hand over the independence referendum for the independence referendum, which could not be able to stop in the province.
Kostunica's deputy deputy, Miroljub Labus, opposed the same idea of Montenegro's state union, but opposed the initiative, despite recognition of the initiative, Serbia's strong advocates.
"We have to organise the two referendum, and we should not be able to stop this issue," Labus said.
"Serbia's priority is to join the EU and reach better living standards," Tadic said.
Meanwhile, Vujanovic, meanwhile, argues that Belgrade does not argue that Serbia does not oppose its own sovereignty and its own international status.

However, Cristina Gallach, spokesperson for EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana's spokesperson, expressed concern about the political initiatives that would lead to unification with Serbia and Montenegro to lead political tensions.
Officials in Brussels have described the proposal as "extremely excessive, spread and spread time", Beta news agency quoted officials in Brussels as saying.
Serbia-Montenegro's role in Euro-Atlantic integration, following the murder of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic's murder, the officials said, while the year should not be spent with negative actions.
US Ambassador to Belgrade Michael C. Polt said Washington would support any democratic agreement between Serbia and Montenegro.
Podgorica's proposal sparked as a result of the constitution crisis, which has sparked direct elections for Serbia-Montenegro's Parliament.

Dejan "Buggling" Milenkovic was extradited to Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic in March 2003 after six months in a Greek prison sentence.
The indictment of the indictment of his family Bugsy Siegel is one of the major topics of the Zemun Clan's criminal group, allegedly allegedly indicted by Djindjic.
Authorities hope that he would ask the assassination, as well as to help other consultations concerning the case.
Milenkovic is said to be used by the public who used Djindjic's initiative on 21 February 2003 on 21 February 2003.
According to the indictments, other members of the Zemun's Zemun will organise an attack, but Milenkovic's plan to stop Djindjic's car.
Milenkovic was arrested, but three days later.
The conditions still maintain uncertainty.
The Serbian police and the tribunal have been convicted of crimes, but no official investigation on the issue has not been launched.
Milekovic was discovered after he was free. In July 16th 2004, the fugitive was arrested in Thessaloniki on 16 months.
In his first visit to the Belgrade Special Organised Crime, Milenkovic asked for more time to prepare the defence.
The case was decided on 9 March.
"I don't know that most of the presence in the presence of the presence of the presence in the north," he said.
According to Serbian law, Milenkovic could be allowed to recognise the armed status and the charges against the right.
In this case, however, the prosecutor has to co-operate with the prosecutors and tackle the Zemun Church.
If this impasse, Milenkovic will be tried on the assassination of Djindjic.
At the same time, six murders and several injuries are facing allegations of illegal immunity.

High Representative Miroslav Lajcak urged Bosnian Serb politicians on Wednesday (September 26th) to end a compromise on police reform, a key condition for progress towards EU integration.
"We have been losing, and we will lose more time if a compromise was reached until Sunday," Lajcak, who is in the Republika Srpska (RS) parliament, said. "We will not return to the fugitive and will not return to less than a year."
Benzer also came from EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana.
"Bosnian politicians have played with their future of their own countries," Solana said in an interview with the Dnevni daily Dnevni.
In December, BiH completed technical talks on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, considered an important step towards eventual membership.
Brussels, however, has made clear that the agreement would not be signed this year if BiH politicians do not reach a compromise on the country's police structures in line with EU standards.
Currently, two entities -- the RS and the Federation of BiH -- have their own police services.
Brussels wants all legal and budget institutions to be held under a single coup, and wants to be held at the state level of state level.
The EU has called on the creation of new police areas based on professional criteria and to end the police's operational work.
The efforts to reach a deal are more than two years.
Bosnian Serb politicians see the EU's demands as a step forward to RS's demands and rejected proposals for restructuring the two countries.
On Wednesday, Lajcak assured Bosnian Serb lawmakers that the establishment of a single and more efficient police force is not a threat to the presence of the entities.
He said that if politicians do not support police reform, BiH's road to Europe.
As a result, the country faces a "complex" in the region, and will remain in the tension of its neighbours' neighbours in the EU integration process.
"The election will choose to solve the rhetoric solutions, and we will test their own prospects, which is a positive economic force that affects Bosnia and Herzegovina's economy," he said.
RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, however, said the entity's service would not accept the survival.
"I am not ready to accept any way in the structure of the structure of a Bosnian Serb police in the Republika Srpska territory," Dodik said.
At the same day, Bosnian Serb officials warned that Lajcak would be able to attract sanctions from other institutions in the state level if the sanctions against Dodik and police reform are being blocked.
Representatives of BiH's eight main political parties, meanwhile, have failed to reach an agreement in Banja Luka, despite technical talks on police reform.
The parties reportedly will continue on Friday.

Burns also invited members of the BiH presidency to participate in Washington on 21 November to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the DBA's 10th anniversary, but stressed that the administration is expected to be seen as early as date.
The most wanted indictees -- former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, military commander Ratko Mladic and retired Croatian General Ante Gotovina could not expect to be closely closely closely closely to NATO relations with Serbia-Montenegro and Croatia, the US diplomat warned.
He also noted that BiH authorities have signaled their statements that Karadzic and Mladic should be brought to justice in The Hague.

The efforts and the work of a Serb NGO have failed to arrest an opportunity.
By Bojana Milovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 02 / 03 / 09 Photos by Nikola Barbutov
Natasa Bojanic arrived in the world, but there was no doubts from the society in the work of his family.
Natasa Bojanic, 26, lives in the age of their family, friends, friends and friends.
At least, it is confident that he can be able to be able to deal with challenges.
Natasa arrived in the world as Dorroglu.
However, they live from the society without their efforts.
Natasa's speaker was learned about the presence of the Children's Kaliseval aid company six years ago.
Natasa has started to attend new friends, participate in the work of a day death, theatre, theatre, concerts.
Natasa attended a "Construction" programme, which was launched by the institution.
The aim of the programme is to ensure that young young people will win their daily skills, prepare and work to do their daily homes, and to make their lives more independent.
"We don't do everything we do everything we are in our own beginning.
We are doing our responsibility in this case, "he said.
One of the most successful participants, Natasa, was given a opportunity to work in Children's Footing.
No day, everyone arrives with transportation.
Since the beginning, the project has been sold to developing the factors.
Even the time, they say, "short" is beginning to come.
The tolerance of the "church" is the victims of the church, which means that all mission and workers should be removed, such as church, church and water.
We showed a score of various individuals and historic flexibility of the history's daily workers.
"I think that a person of a person of a person's families will be the biggest presence of my homes, which is why we are trying to do with the practice of these young people," said Tanja Staljonic, a Children representative, Tanja Staljonic (right).
"We should be always always, and this is my job," Natasa said.
Apart from the business, it is sustainable.
Those are in time, TV monitoring and visa-free votes.
"It is not allowed to allow many TV stations or to leave the computer's long time," he adds.
They have the authority of the insurance, and the school also scored some of our work and seems to see us for us.
Tanja Staljonic, a representative of the Children's Kalalonic, pledged more detailed information about us.
The programme's goal is to provide very practical skills for intelligence obstacles as possible, ensuring a more independent life.
"I think that one person of a person is the biggest presence of his parents' parents' families will be the biggest presence of my parents' families, so we are trying to do their practice with the young people in this few days.
Herkes can know their responsibility and daily duties.
"We are facing such cases, and we are in the intervention if the crisis is necessary," he said.
About 50 children are participating in the Children's Kaloci projects over the past eight years.
"The principles is essential.
Many are not true about how judges will benefit.
The victims are mixed and they don't know what they can go.
The Children, Children, seems to serve as an intelligence centre that can receive all necessary information. "
Natasa has been taken many mandates to develop the project to develop factors.
The intelligence opportunities for the residents have been discussed in Serbia for a few years.
But such physical obstacles, such as Staljonic's statement, are easily easy.
"They don't want to show the bronze and not want to take responsibility for an unprecedented identity identity.
The situation is completely different for those who do not have no question.
They need the only needs, removing some obstacles and work, "he said.
Staljonic argues that participation in the normal education system should be in the legality of the obstacles.
"The obstacles of children or for example, for example, such as unprecedented children, normal schools.
"The intelligence obstacles are not going to the entire programmes, but also the need for practice and physical capabilities."
"However, these children should be a reason for index and differences in the same school buildings, even if they are not obliged with children who are not obliged," Staljonic said.
About 250,000 intelligence are estimated in Serbia, but this data is not.
In addition to rural areas, these families are in the rural areas.
These exercises, which are not in part of the intelligence and social protection systems, may not be the issue.

Hussein Hussein Hussein Husseinovic's new but sparked competition in Srebrenica is still dismissed.
However, Husizenovic says he would be ready to start the airport at least here.
This is an example of small businesses that the UNDP helped develop development.
UNDP's Srebrenica Regional Development Programme is seeking to help those who want to return to one of the country's most remaining areas.
The most exercise, which has been hiding since World War II, is part of the July 1995 Srebrenica massacre.
Local officials have been under financial support from the region and Republika Srpska's natural monopoly until 1999, because of political obstacles.
"I don't don't don't have done this project," he said, "I don't don't think that the UNDP has not been able to start a month ago."
Huszenovic is one of the 166 people, under the three-year project, which was launched in 2002 and a three-year project worth 10.4m euros.
According to Alex Prieem, director of the programme, about 2,000 people have been injured so far.
It is on the establishment of small businesses that operate before the war now operating in Srebrenica, rural and distribution, which can work in rural and distribution.
The project also includes strengthening the civil society and local administration and rebuild the power network.
The refugee returns -- about 3.200 municipalities -- have returned to the three municipalities -- if the pre-war Muslim population is leaving to the state, the UNDP believes that the number could be increased.
The number of returns during the past 12 months is almost equal.
Following their lives in 1995, many observers think people will return to the region.
At the same time, there is no one that the project can be able to see the opportunities here.
UNDP officials say the efforts for the region following the tragedy is a symbolic symbolic.
"This is the main reason for UNDP to continue the project," said UNDP Deputy Representative Moises Venjano. "We have to feel that the removal in this project, because of the atrocities that have been taken to return to the people and return to return."
The plans for 2004 include reducing a small loan line for women's businesses, strengthening of the small loan pipeline, support of agriculture and mechanism, completing the completion of 17 civil society projects and improving infrastructure.
He says the programme is not affected by the programme because of the benefits of money laundering money laundering.
"People are trying to help unemployment, and they expect to help me," he said. "However, there is no agricultural resources."
The UNDP has not been able to do with a loan union, and it is a great investment that allows the family to work. "
Del Ponte Approves List War Crimes War Crimes War Crimes
UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte reiterated that the war crimes tribunal's wartime leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic will not close their doors to the arrest of Bosnian Serb wartime leaders Radovan Karadzic and Croatian Ante Gotovina.
(Reuters, AP, AFP, BBC, HINA - 12 / 09 / 03)
Carla del Ponte, who began the four-year term at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), said the priorities are part of the list of all fugitives to surrender.
The tribunal's leaders for Bosnian Serb wartime leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, del Ponte said, adding that he would not close their doors to surrender them until the end of 2003 to surrender them.
The three are part of the 17-member war crimes suspect, which is still still on the list.
"The Croatian government should surrender Ante Gotovina to The Hague," del Ponte told a press conference Friday (12 September).
Bosnian Serbs have focused on all co-operation to arrest Karadzic, "he said.
As part of a strategy adopted by the UN Security Council, all investigations must be completed by the end of 2004 by the end of 2008.
All activities with this programme can be completed by 2010.
However, del Ponte warned that the completion strategy could jeopardise the successful efforts to arrest indictees.
Mladic and Karadzic have been charged with genocide due to the alleged role in atrocities committed during the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including the Srebrenica massacre.
Del Ponte, who said Mladic is still in Serbia, has called for authorities to arrest him.
Karadzic is believed to be hiding in Republika Srpska, the entity in BiH's Serbian administration.
Gotovina, who has been registered since 2001, has been charged with atrocities committed against Serb civilians during a 1995 attack.
Del Ponte claims that Croatian authorities know that the generals are in place.
"The Croatian government and the Croatian government know that General Ante Gotovina is in the case," del Ponte said.
The tribunal will continue to help the international community to help justice, he said, adding that those people are not in the courts and are not in the judiciary.
"I will not take the possibility of this possibility.
Karadzic, Mladic and Gotovina will be arrested by the end of the year and will be transferred to the tribunal.
"The court will not close the doors to stop Karadzic, Mladic and Gotovina," he said.
Croatian Prime Minister Ivica Racan said on Friday that his government had "no representation with General Gotovina".
"Croatian services know that he was in Croatia and that the fugitive would be arrested so far," he said.
Racan urged him to surrender to the tribunal to surrender, saying he would be good for both the country.
In a statement, Croatian President Stipe Mesic called on Croatian President Stipe Mesic to surrender Gotovina to define his own and Croatia's future.
Defence Reform Reform in BiH Says New Says
As part of the defence reform process under the monitoring of the international community, the Defence Reform Commission submitted its report on the state defence law.
The bill will make Bosnia and Herzegovina a safe candidate for NATO's Partnership for Peace programme.
By Antonio Prlenda for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 20 / 10 / 03
The reform process in Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH) defence structures has entered a new phase by the end of September, when a state defence law submitted to parliament submitted its report to parliament.
High Representative Paddy Ashdown, who also headed the post as US military expert James Locher II, completed the 100-day mandate for concrete legal legal and legal steps to restructure BiH defence structures during 2004.
The request of reform is a condition for full membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme.
Two entities, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH), the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) and Republika Srpska (RS) will continue to have separate entities and defence ministries.
The parties, however, will be united under a military commander, operational commander and the state level.
The high commander of the BiH armed forces will be headed by the BiH joint presidency, which will take over the decisions.
The victims' defence ministries have an administrative command in defence issues, while the physical commander will be established through a joint staff commander, a joint staff and operational commander.
The military's defence minister will be a problem for full co-ordination of the budget.
The head of the secret commander, the joint staff and the state defence minister, the Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats, who have created the country's three ethnic groups.
Sistem was designed to prevent the armed forces against any other ethnic groups.
"These decisions on defence reform are crucial," Ashdown said. "It is now clear that the PfP has come to NATO.
However, the decisions still need to be approved by the BiH state parliament. "
The RS Army has 6,000 soldiers in active service, while 9,000 Bosniaks and 4,000 Croat service in the FBiH Army.
Under the SRK's recommendations, the number of soldiers will be reduced to 12 to 12 to 12 per cent, in order to ensure that armed forces can be able to stay at 1 per cent of GDP.
Both sides will serve in the same platform, which has been helping the state of BiH.
Seven local representatives from the two entities, the SRK, defence ministries and the BiH Military Committee, as well as the extradition of the OSCE mission in BiH, the Office of the High Representative and the OSCE mission in BiH.
Representatives of the EU, the United States, Russia and Turkey were among the commission.
The state's assembly must allow the final decision by the end of the year.

Serbia's talks with the EU could be closely closely closely closely with the EU, such as war revenues and persons, such as war revenues and persons, such as the EU's mediator.
"Brussels is not serious approach.
The issue has been cited as a precondition for any steps towards Serbia's path to the EU.
"All signs have already seen so far shows that Brussels has not been taken to the matter so far. In a case, some will need to be able to leave the court and leave justice," he said.
More broad broadcasting issues have not yet been found between Kosovo and Serbia.
The process, which began in March 2011, is very slowly slowly due to technical issues.
At the same time, some major developments are not in place, such as the common border management, but the energy delays and the technical issues such as telecommunications and Kosovo's regional representation has not yet been transferred.
It is preserving uncertainty that it will be removed in any time.
The latest session was held on 2 December.
"There is no clear information about the date of the next session [in this point], but the dialogue process continues to continue," EU spokesman Mak Kocsijancic told SETimes.
In a statement issued by the Kosovo opposition parties, the situation was more complicated. On 7 February, the situation was more complex. On 7 February, the main opposition Democratic Union of Kosovo (LDK) called for official intervention to talks.

The opposition party also organised two separate protests last month to prevent the government's measures to prevent bilateral border crossings with Serbia.
Kosovo negotiator Edita Tahiri says the talks should be discussed this year, while all sides are determined to be taken into the agenda of the talks, while Kosovo, Serbia and the EU have expressed concern about the issues of the EU.
Tahiri stressed that "Serbia must fulfil its obligations in the war in the Kosovo war".
Belgrade's position is completely different.
"There is no revenue to each other in the country.
"I don't know that Serbia's idea."
Marko Milanovic, an international law co-ordinator at the Notingingbody University in Britain, confirmed that Kosovo is not an independent state, because Kosovo is not an independent state.
"Serbia has repeatedly violated the rights of the citizens of our own citizens," he said.
According to Kosovo lawyer Adil Fetahahahor, Serbia has not received <unk> <unk> 1m in Kosovo, and Pristina needs to pay for the revenue of the medieval damage and should not be able to leave this exercise.
"There is many things that have to be done, and even more than ten years ago," Feth said, adding that "Kosovo and Serbia should be able to reach an agreement on war attractions."
"There is no possibility for a solution in the near future," Fetahahor said.
That point, however, is not the legal legal legal legal legal, which "no state cannot be a member of the EU to resolve the border dispute with neighbours, and that every country should" reflect the requirements for border neighbours ".
"It is a situation in the implementation of this agreement, and it is better that the agreement will be done between the paper and delayed," said Dusan Janic, a researcher at the Belgrade Institute for Social Sciences.

Technical dialogue will be "a" matter ", because the technical dialogue is" in the bridge ", he says, noting that the international community and Kosovo officials are trying to work to use everything in the bridge" from Belgrade to use everything ".
Meanwhile, the public's body will be resolved to be resolved.
"So far, the agreements have been adopted," Pristina Besniqi told SETimes.
There are also fears about the findings.
I don't don't know that the restructuring of the restructuring will be made at the time. "
Kosovo Serb Sasa Denic, who lives in the eastern Kosovo town of Gilan, said "How do you have to pay money in Kosovo, or to pay money in Kosovo?"
However, when the concern is the problem, everyone seems to agree on the agenda of the issue.
According to information from the International Commission for Co-operation and Co-operation, 2.70 people have already been facilitated.
Kathathon Bomberg, commission chief Kathathon Bomberg said the number of people who have not yet been lost during the war in Kosovo, noting that "the number of people" have been sparked to years.
"I hope that we are on the rhetoric," said Serbian negotiator Borko Stefanovic, who is close to a mechanism that would provide the loss of the victims.
Gordana Djukanovic, the Association of the Serb victims' Association in Kosovo, noted that 512 Serb and Albanian villages, as well as the Albanian village, as well as the Albanian village.
"Before start negotiations with Belgrade -- Borko Stefanovic met with Borko Stefanovic and that the negotiating team will be invited to invest in the agenda," Djukanovic told SETimes, noting that the issue would not be held under the agenda.

Chief UN war crimes tribunal prosecutor Carla del Ponte said on Thursday (September 1st) that the EU should not boost relations with these countries, as well as by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
"The full co-operation with the ICTY is one of the requirements for membership for the former Yugoslav states," del Ponte said at a conference on the Balkans conference in Berlin. "The process of European support is not a success of the European justice process."
Special co-operation with Croatia and Serbia-Montenegro are co-operating only in international pressure. "
Del Ponte described the current level of co-operation with the ICTY as "unfair", urging Brussels to preserve its presence to hand over its international obligations to hand over its international obligations.
"There is no power to implement reforms, the EU has to have to have the EU's reforms," del Ponte said. "It would be no power when it comes to the club."
Croatia surrendered authorities to arrest retired General Ante Gotovina until March and surrender to the ICTY.
However, Zagreb has been waiting to wait for talks until the UN tribunal will not meet full co-operation with the UN tribunal.
Meanwhile, Serbia-Montenegro is scheduled to begin talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU on 5 October.
Both the EU and the United States, Serbia-Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) over the past months, pressure on former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and del Ponte, believed to be hiding in BiH's Serb control areas, or in Montenegro, allegedly believed to have been hiding in Serbia.
"The immunity of immunity will be a major blow to the international community and the international justice," del Ponte said in Berlin.
He denied allegations that Zagreb is in order to find Gotovina in order to find Gotovina to find Gotovina.
"It is not a clear change for Croatia's operations in operations.
"The performance in the north is still signalling that Gotovina is still in the region," he said.
Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader cited Croatia's action plan for co-operation with The Hague on Thursday, saying that Gotovina is one of his supporters' supporters, adding that Gotovina is one of his supporters.

The biggest obstacles to growth are the most obstacles to the overall bureaucratic bureaucratic bureaucratic bureaucratic bureaucratic.
"It's to open more, better, better and more active prices.
For that, the opening of the willingness investors must be implemented.
In this case, Turkey is a more competitive position with both prices and the right services, "Gavrias said." The sector is very important that the sector needs to be drawn up to a draft bill to structure and business.

By Fatih Baran for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 05 / 05 / 03
The Justice and Development Party (AKP) pledged that a key part of the central bureaucratic authority would be transferred to local authorities, saying it would be transferred to local authorities.
As the most prominent majority in the Turkish Parliament, the AKP is unable to have many challenges in the atrocities.
The proposed law, however, is weapons, intelligence institutions, intelligence and workers unions.
Turkmenistan passed in 1920.
Before the republic's establishment, he warned that a US similar presidency would not be dismissed.
For the equipment, direct elections have been made in the bridge because voters are not chosen due to voter votes, education and communications.
This situation, as well as the only party system, facilitated its authority's centre in Ankara.
Three attempts to have no political regime have ended with the government's control.
However, the political life in Turkey won a stable stability in Turkey after the 1980s.
The government in Ankara has also been rise, with the rise.
The reform has long been part of Turkey's agenda, but a part of a part of the authority that has been reduced or reduced the number of options or reduced personnel in Ankara.
The centre's government has been criticised for years, but the centre has been insufficient to resolve the local problems.
At the time of the 1989-1993 presidential term, the debate on delaying the presidency's delay system has been discussed in the delay, establishing the creation of seven areas and the central authority of the centre.
However, conservative conservatives and army opposes the war crimes against the PKK in southern Turkey's southern region, saying that the Kurdish people want free autonomy.

During the past ten years, the next governments were successful in implementing the central management, because they have different political meetings, or three parties.
In addition to management revenues, traditionally traditionally traditionally, traditionally, the owner's owner was distributed to supporters or railway.
Nevertheless, reform has been increasing.
In the first time, the mountain was attended by the IMF, with the removal of bureaucratic reform and the removal of the necessary posts on the removal of the necessary loan.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on April 21st that he would welcome the US secret administration, which is the only presidency and central authority.
Local administrative reform was part of the main platform in the AKP's election mechanism.
The draft draft was submitted last week.
As part of the law, a number of ministries, the interior, foreign, national education, health, health, health, and justice ministries will be transferred to local administration to local administration.
The management of the municipalities remain under control, while the power will be transferred from the interior ministry.
The reform will lead to some changes in the central government in the central government.

According to the indicators, the ministry agencies will be unemployment and unemployment.
At the same time, mayors have repeatedly ordered the expansion of airports to the government.
The law also includes establishing the establishment of a Local Committee that will be appointed by the president.
According to the mayors, these changes will disagree that they will win their power to win reforms.
If the case, they don't don't don't don't don't reject some aspects of reforms.
The transfer's mandate will not strengthen them to local governments, and will not strengthen further taxes.

Turkey's "Ottoman software"
The restructuring of the Ottoman culture and history is seen as a "trade" for the identity, but a referendum on Turkey's external and foreign policy.
By Menekse Tokyay for Southeast European Times in Istanbul â€“ 17 / 10 / 11
"Ottoman" is a example of the "Ottoman", in 1453. [Reuters]
"Ottomoric", the magazine of every city of Ottoman, has become a new trend in Turkey for a few years.
This is not clear that television dates such as the "Muhem Sulejman", which includes only Sulejman Sulejman and spending.
This is also a chance of the Ottoman history books that exhibitions on the Ottoman reserves, exhibitions on museums, restoration of the remaining buildings from Ottoman, restoration and the Ottoman cafe of Ottoman cafe.
The new mobile phone cannot test a specific trade boycott, Bunung, but Turkey may be able to become a referendum on the expansion of protocol regional diplomacy, protocol regional diplomacy, protocol markets and overcome social division.
Dodik, who promises to the Ottoman cultural cultural history at Istanbul University, says interest rates from two resources to Ottoman.
"The first of the society's identity of the society with more than Europe is the first of the identity's identity's identity of identity capacity, which is a chance of the rise of exchange capacity," he said.
At the same time, experts don't see this trend as a victory between the Kemal political ideology, which is trying to facilitate him from the Ottoman era.
Later, this new trend is a chance of change in the approach to the Ottoman culture.
As Professor Emre Alkin, Professor of the University of Tourism, people see as a traditional life of life as a state, but not as a university.
"Despite all efforts to move forward to the Zorla, the agreement was reached that the Ottoman's desire is a lot of cultural life that has a lot of dozens of dozens of dozens and protection," he told SETimes.
This trend was a reason for the number of people who are more proud in the Ottoman past.
According to the figures, "Ottoman mistakes" is a resistance from Turkey's Ottoman past. [Reuters]
"In fact, people don't know what the past has been worried, now now have been unprecedented," he said.
At the same time, the Ottoman era is less visible than different times, and some of these times were extradited from some of them.
Therefore, the Ottoman era is possible that people were closely closed to "some time".
"However, if one of the long-term period ended in the long time, there is no need to live in a lot of life," Galatasaray University of Galatasaray says.
Some experts, such as disappointment, acknowledged that a tender of a tender continued to be operational, while others think it is a month.
"Although there is no tax on the issues related to the Ottoman Empire, it seems to be very different, it seems to be very different than the route routes," he said.
In terms of the institution, a way to restructuring the market and restructuring of goods in the shopping centres, shopping in the shopping centres and abroad in Turkey.
"In this period, the restructuring of Ottoman's restructuring shows that this issue is not in a market economy," he said.
According to the Board, the unit of the specific academic academic academic academic academic academic academic academics has been discovered in the past century.
At the same time, the Ottoman heritage could be a chance to conduct a referendum in order to conduct Turkey's foreign policy and overcome identity problems.
The Ottoman Empire is a potential for different identity and religious religious identity in the Balkans and the Middle East, AKP Chairman Professor Pelin Gundet Gundet said.
Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu (centre) is Bosniak member of the Bosnia and Herzegovina's Mustafa Izetbegovic (left) and the Bosnian Best Mustafa Ceric in Sarajevo.
Davutoglu opposed many times as Turkey's foreign policy as the new Ottoman era. [Reuters]
"The Ottoman Empire, tolerance, peace and political stability has been the centre of peace and political stability during five years.
This is Ottoman model, the Middle East and Turkey policies in the Balkans, "he said.
"As for us, peace in both the Balkans and in the Middle East have a potential to play a very important role in Turkey in the entire Balkans, stability and economic prosperity," he added.
At the same time, the tax restructuring the Ottoman heritage does not mean an instrument of restructuring to me, such as the restructuring of "New Ottoman".
Later, the post-Cold War ID economic conditions and psychopolitical changes are seen as a consequent outcome.
"As the new Ottoman instrumental, it is really definitely definitely in Turkey's closest pieces," he said.
Political commentator Mustafa Medvey does not see it as an obstacle initiative, "if the political commentator Mustafa says." If there is no more visible visas, foreign policy. "
According to the Mediterranean, the Balkans and the Middle East, "the risk of a extremely detailed detailed details", the risk of a extremely discrimination. "
The figures are patient from the West, while the Mediterranean rise in Turkey's promotion policy in the Middle East, which is not seen as a European loan.
"The Ottoman Empire was a key part of European policy in alliances such as France and Britain.
Therefore, Turkey's EU accession process has already been seen as many parts of the Ottoman past days, the Ottoman past has sparked to Europe, "he said.
"The interest in restructuring the Ottoman heritage could be achieved by a positive step towards restructuring differences in the Turkish community," he said. "In another case, there is a positive step towards restructuring differences in the Turkish community.

Belgrade media reported that Serbian President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica signed an agreement before the 3 February presidential elections, but parties are seeing to do so.
According to the Blic daily Blic, Tadic said the EU should oppose a plan to send the mission to Kosovo if there is no new resolution from the UN Security Council.
Tadic wants the prime minister to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU.
According to the paper, Kostunica's support for Tadic will announced after signing the energy agreement with Russia on Friday (January 25th) in Moscow.
Belgrade analysts say Kostunica's support could be determined in the second round.
Tadic will face face with Tomislav Nikolic, the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party candidate, who voted in the second round in the runoff.
Kostunica's support quality will play an important role in determining the winning in February.
Kostunica's party, however, asked on Wednesday that Tadic's Democratic Party to change a coalition agreement during the government's office.
The Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) has been calling for further policy on the EU, but the party wants the EU to not sign the SAA if it is sent to Kosovo without a mission to the UN.
A EU mission to sovereignty will violate Serbia's sovereignty, the DSS says.
Gelim Tadic's platform is focused on European integration.
He's campaign slogan's "Haydi".
"Kosovo can know about Kosovo about the future of this country, and everyone can do everything about the future of this year.
And I will not allow us to allow the main requirement.
"I will fight until the last stage, and I will not be able to fight in this way, but I will not allow the conditions for a better life for Serbia and a better life."
Hungary and Croatian minorities support the president, but Tadic's winner is unlikely to win Tadic's winner.
Nikolic believes that he would have to have to survive 6% of the voters of Serbia's Socialist Party, as the opposition Socialist Party of Serbia supported the Radical Party.
Nenad Canak, leader of the Democratic Union of Vojvodina Social Democrats, has accused Kostunica for preparing for the ruling coalition with the Radicals after the second round of elections.
For now, however, there is no signal that there is no signal.

According to the strategy, which will be implemented since 1993, more than 40 artists have been tried to be implemented since 2010, the court will continue to be tried in The Hague, such as former state leader Slobodan Milosevic, the court will continue to be tried.
According to some court observers, the cases have been seen in the local level, fair, fair and prevention.
Ana Uzelac, executive director of the project, which was the latest developments in the courts at the London Institute for War and Peace Reporting, said the "concern" in parliament in parliament in the parliament ", but we are ready to be dealt with the local level" in the region, but we are ready to be prepared for those who are prepared
Local courts in Bosnia and Herzegovina are taking some cases from The Hague. [File]
"It is possible to think that the start of the courts will begin, the establishment of the legal system and the experience of judges by prosecutors, together with the experience of the law system and the experience of judges," Uzelac said.
For example, Croatia has been on war crimes so far, but four courts have established in Zagreb, Osijek, Rijeka, Rijeka, Rijeka and Split.
According to an analyst, the smaller convicted courts could not be rejected by the high-level courts. The case, which has been charged with 13 civilians in Karlovac on September 1991, is a example of the situation.
Vesna Terroric, a third time in a local court, said the case was launched in a local court. "In the case, the court has been sent to the murder of the murder, the murder of the indictment," said Vesna Terroric, a former adviser at the Institute for Peace Studies in Zagreb.
Terroric also added that the courts are facing pressure on local people and that this pressure will not be high.
The figures have been removed in a training process with the ICTY, but the courts have not yet been able to start in time to start cases.
According to Terroric, The Hague tribunal is a very important institution and is possible to establish local courts, but the crimes committed is crucial to the local level.
"There are great impact on the courts [public].
"All the former Yugoslavia are committed to such crimes," Terroric said. "All the countries of the former Yugoslavia are being involved in different areas and the best way to be the best way," he said.
In Serbia, six Serbs indicted for killing 200 Croatian civilians in Vukovar in 1991 were arrested in Belgrade in March.
The tribunal is seen as a protest of Serbia's legal system.
In Kosovo, the last two years is being conducted by international and international judges and other international and local judges, a Addian official said.
"The implementation of this implementation is under pressure on local judges that will be concerned about the safety of their security," said Thomas Monaghan, head of UNMIK justice chief Thomas Monaghan.
According to Monaghan, the BiH state court must ensure that justice must be accelerated. "It is the most important point in the cases of war crimes cases, investigations and intervention as soon as possible.
Women, questions and respect are more willing to recognise witness.
"It is a sovereign process, especially in order to express all details."
The results of war crimes cases will be conducted in BiH, McNet said.
"This case has not been chosen or sanctions or sanctions," McNet said. "In other cases, such as serious crimes cases, such as serious crimes cases, the effects of the effects, or in other cases, the effects of the effects, or in the economic situation.

Greece's Terrorism Disn't Disn
Due to the Olympics planned in Greece next year, authorities are facing measures against terrorism activities in the country.
By Dimitris Agrafiotis for Southeast European Times in Athens - 24 / 06 / 03
The attacks against El-Qaeda's attack last month in Rosad and Kazil, the latest terrorist events in the Mediterranean region.
Amid warnings from terrorism and extremist groups and foreign intelligence services, warning the possibility of losing losses in Greece against the borders.
"The threat of the Yalancy" is very serious.
There are many reasons for Greece to move forward.
The geographical position is more easily easily easily to Greece because of the country's progress has been easy for terrorist groups.
Greece's extremely slow coastal administration, strengthening illegal initiative.
According to the government's tender for national security, one of the biggest dangers for the national security are the first of the Islamic group, which has entered Greece as illegal immigration.
Three years ago, many immigrants were sceptical of any significant investigation on criminal delays.
Therefore, the Islamic extremist groups are likely to have documented documentaries that would allow people to remain in Greece.
Officials are currently under the monitoring of four hotels, which are currently under a close monitoring.
Despite these dangers, the National Intelligence Service (EYP) has a strong position.
The EYP has entered a close co-operation with foreign intelligence services, citing possible terrorist donations.
Greek officials are concerned about a possible terrorist attack during the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens.
El-Qaeda's target to the global operations, the Olympic Organisation Committee and the government has sparked the government.
As the most difficult tasks, the government is in the government if visitors spend their safety.
Greece's terrorist anti-terrorism promotion was sparked to a radical scrutiny.
The United States, which has been granted against the El-bought organisation, could bring Greece to the target of extremist extremism in the country's country.
Greece, however, has little experience over the first terrorist terrorism.
Therefore, this new threat is taking a problem that must be able to secure the EYP's immigration.

The new findings that the key war crimes fugitives from the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) have sparked criticism from High Representative Paddy Ashdown.
The Sarajevo daily Dnevni Avazi issued a report Tuesday (November 30th) that wartime Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic is a military staff.
Mladic's entity entity in the Serb administration, Republika Srpska (RS), shows that only two years ago.
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) accused Mladic of genocide, including genocide in late 1995.
Mladic is among the top Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and retired General Ante Gotovina, along with his retired General Ante Gotovina.
According to the report, Mladic was extradited to the RS Army (VRS) by the time RS president Mirko Sarovic's decision in March 2002.
He said the VRS is "scandal" of a worker relationship with only two years ago before the fugitive.
The top international envoy in BiH said it is "a show that RS authorities, particularly the VRS, and the violations of the violations of the international tribunal in The Hague".
The document published on Tuesday, Ashdown's office quoted ICTY chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte as saying that the document was supported by ICTY prosecutor Carla del Ponte's speech at the UN Security Council last week.
"In BiH, I believe that the legal implementation and police structures in the RS, especially in the implementation of law enforcement and police structures in RS," the prosecutor said in his speech on 23 November, criticising RS officials for failing to arrest him.
"This is the question of the VRS's demands for Mladic's extradition to co-operating with the ICTY and the military's extradition for co-operation with the ICTY," Ashdown said. "How should the RS wants to seek a modern European future?"
The document, published by the Sarajevo daily VVB (VVB) that he continued his post until 2001, reflects that RS officials had ended their relations between VVRS and the end of 2001 and 2001.
"If Mladic is registered to the VVRS and VRS, this personnel claimed that the authorities claimed they were linked to 2000 and 2001," Ashdown said.
The new findings revealed days before NATO's summit on 9 December.
At the end of June, the Alliance delayed the invitation to join the Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme, due to BiH's failure to meet its obligations to the ICTY.

Turkey is preparing to reform the border policy on poverty and water resources in order to ensure EU criteria and international law.
The country's foreign ministry has drawn up a new law that would make Turkey's needs and the EU Public Framework Process, and two working groups that will take place in institutions.
In addition to a EU candidate, Turkey needs to make laws, including laws concerning its exercise sources.
Ankara hopes to launch its accession talks with the EU in 2005 if the Union is closely closely closely at the summit this month.
The EU and Turkey are urging Turkey to accept the Union's sovereign standards in 2003.
In addition to protecting resources, the international law needs to establish a monitoring interpretation among interpretation interpretations that the country needs to be hiding its effects on neighbouring countries.
Currently, poverty is 40 per cent of Turkey's potential.
Middle East reported that the Caucasus countries will live in the next 25 years, especially in the coming year and will be among the main sources of Turkey's water pollution.
Two key factors from Turkey -- Dicle and First -- are the long-term dispute between Syria and Iraq -- which has been sold to the dispute between Syria and Iraq -- are the only time to build more than 700 contracts in the 1990s to build economic growth in Turkey, while the country decided to build more than 700 contracts in the 1990s to build economic growth.
As Ankara signed the latest international agreement on poverty, Syria will have to be approved to build a peaceful message over the First.
Turkey needs long-term needs.
Many experts warn that the country could live without a fast city and industrial transformation as a result of the country's increasingly influence.
Although the foreign ministry is prepared to develop a more efficient policy, the measures are under way.
Ankara is likely to work to ease international law obligations that Syria and Iraq are under pressure to accept the Dicle and Ferre to accept a single airport.
In addition, Turkey is trying to block the intervention of the third individuals' intervention, demanding that only countries that have been in debate on rights.

According to EC President Jose Manuel Barroso, the two Balkan countries "have been a historic success" to make the Union more confident and more powerful.
Barroso called on the bloc to resolve the European Constitution while urging other candidate countries to be closed.
"We will remain linked to the statements that we have opened our perspective perspective," Barroso said.
Romans, meanwhile, have not been cautious during the celebration.
President Traian Basescu warned that the country should not be closed.
"Our rich is that everything we will enter the EU, but we will not be a very great way," Basescu said.

As a result, Romania could lose 25 per cent of EU agriculture funds.
The EC also faced a factor.
In addition to the wife, some requested EU member states -- France and Germany -- which has yet to ratify Bulgaria and Romania's accession treaty.
While praised both countries "to make sustainable progress in sustainable progress", Barroso assured European lawmakers that the EC would establish a mechanism for the next accession co-operation and progress.
Both countries will need to make a EC report six months.
Judicial reform, corruption measures and the criteria in the fight against organised crime will have to meet the criteria.
If any country fails to meet these criteria, the EC can enhance a special presence that will suspend its obligation of judicial co-operation and the current EU member states to suspend its obligation to the court decisions in the country.
Some EU officials, such as the head of the EC Mission in Bucharest, agrees that the matter could be "bad" that would affect the citizens.
In Brussels, however, this is seen as a pressure on Bucharest and Sofia to continue the necessary reforms.

There is no safe power supply in Albania, only citizens are not in the situation.
However, the new management of the state power institution has become more parallel.

In Albania, the democracy process has to turn up to major benefits.
The biggest problem for Serbs is stable to stop electricity supplies.
In the former regime period, the number of people who need electricity in the electricity period was very low, and even days, the country was based on energy exports.
In the new Albania, the situation has been living in the country since 1990.
Many Albanian citizens agree that the electricity problem is part of this electricity problem.
Albania is not the only part of this problem in the region.
The situation in neighbouring Kosovo is the same.
Balkan countries live the negative effects of Bulgaria's Soviet period.
Albanians say the last year's last couple is the worst of women's worst.
Last day, electricity cuts and similar energy exercises were very difficult.
Nevertheless, though, there is no longer death, but now seems to be seen.
The new head of Albania's Egyptian Corporation Board KESH, Gjergj Bojaxhi, is a new instrument management of the United States after the United States received training.
The World Bank and other private financial institutions are pushing for a serious experience in their homes.
Bojaxhi later served as deputy minister of the Trade, Economy and Energy.
The Corridor power plant is working on plans. [Gent Shatilaku]
Bojaxhi, 33, attended the KESH in March and is currently one of the most difficult tasks in the country.
There are very serious results in the distribution distribution distribution of electricity distribution -- or to win votes in the energy issue.
Bojaxxhi should reflect the people of Albania and Albania, as well as a solution to foreign investors who are worried about the electricity cuts problem in the country.
So far, the work shows that Bojaxhi's long and short time, and shows that Bojaxhi has created a credibility and motivation that could ensure many solution can be implemented.
Albania has some factors on energy production.
The project depends on climate climate conditions.
Currently, the country's heavy amounts to lowest mines and reserves are in institutions so far.
As a result, only 50 per cent of the electricity needs.
To import electricity imports, it is very expensive option.
The state budget has to meet the country's electricity needs to meet other countries.
What is the solution
According to Bojaxhi, variety should be removed.
Bojaxhi is focusing on improving efficiency and to ensure more dependent on workers.
With the media search, Albania's public concerns about this situation and is being held in various campaign to convince people to pay the electricity money.
The privatisation agenda is focused on modernisation of existing facilities, modernisation of existing facilities and new plant construction. [Gent Shent Shent]
Some parts of Albania have a bad piece to pay electricity bills, to pay electricity bills and buy electricity.
Property users have almost bought to pay the bills, while biometric consumers, especially in the north of the country's north, are unable to pay the bills.
Around 25 per cent of the users are paying their bills.
Bojaxhi, who is planning to cover these consumers, was the first KESH management management in really to resolve the problem.
I am only a first step.
The long-term solutions that would allow KESH to provide security and stable power supply.
The institution, for example, plans to privatise distributors in the next two years.
Bojaxhi believes that the outcome will be improved in order to improve the control of the distribution of distribution distribution units.
The new census between Ellan and Podgorica will make it more functioning than electricity, which is paid by users.
The plans to build oil plant in Vlora, southern town of Vlora.
A new hydropower plant in the north is planned to build a new hydropower plant.
It is also possible to develop smaller projects in Albania.
International donors are very serious contribution to improving the problem.
Meanwhile, however, they voiced hope that the public could provide more austerity to electricity prices.
According to Bojaxhi, this is not possible.
A year ago, prices have been made in prices for prices, and a new person will create a great social pension for many Albanians.
Bojaxhi says he could think the reality could be resolved after the supply problem is resolved.
It is focusing on modernisation of current facilities and focusing on new power construction construction.
Bojaxhi acknowledges the problems over the next two years.
Foreign investors, who need to need electricity supplies, hope that the most serious problems facing Albania faces.

According to the law, there will be "recognition of women" for women who elect professional military service, reduced hours and other judges ".
Women and women will not be called for soldiers who have children under the age of ten and ten.
It is only one of the most important innovations that have to implement military service to the law enforcement.
Another obstacles service is "the sale of the military service" -- to pay money for the reality.
This option will be beneficious for Serbs who don't want to leave their career, who don't want to make their career to meet its own obligations.
The price will be determined by the Council of Ministers of Serbia and Montenegro.
"Our representatives continue to buy the purchase of the military service service, while a price service was 5,000 euros in Turkey.
It is really think that this should be between 2,000 and 2,000 euros, "he said.
However, many civil society organisations do not see the best way to resolve the problems of the modern soldiers who live abroad abroad abroad.
Such a system, the organisers say, is a fair discrimination in the province of the economic force.

The armed service was 13 months, and the current bill will take six months.
We hope that this law will make free liberalisation until the general trend is professional service in a world where it is professional service. "

However, tourist officials from both republics in the country are trying to change these outcome in the history. The work of an international tourist fair, which took place last year's annual international tourism fair.
"Bosnia and Herzegovina is known as a country of war.

In co-operation between the foundation of Solanovic's presidency and the Ministry of Trade and Tourism in Bosnia and Herzegovina (RS), co-operation between Bosnia and Herzegovina (RS) and the Ministry of Trade and Tourism is trying to reflect the image of Bosnia and Herzegovina's image of a single country with a scope of geography.
That is why it is not a effort that has been conducted in time.
Earlier two years ago, tourist data from the country's federal areas have been trying to discriminate.
Willem Eekrevan Eekrevan's (OHR), who was in 2001, decided to meet the country's natural discrimination between Sarajevo and the Jahina Distorina Mountain to meet with tourists to meet with BiH as a whole.
Later later, the OHO and the Sarajevo Economic Regional Development Agency has started the project "for Bosnia's Tourism Initiative".
Two joint accommodations have been slowly attributed to the project, since since the federal republics have been sparked to tourist fair rates, and are promoted in Bosnia.
According to Van Eekelen, who is working at the YHO's economy, Bosnia is a major business in the economic way to promote the security and promote peace environment in the country.
"It is clear that no one will not want to invest in a country that has not been able to invest in a country that is not positive evaluation.
"This's impact is limited to tourist tourism," Eekelen said at the beginning of February. "It's why Bosnia's whereabouts the first time in the first time, such as the first phase of Bosnia.
We know that national parks in Kozara and Sutjetska -- the national parks in the village of Kozara and Sutjetska -- and eight Bosnia and Herzegovina -- are unable to see the authorities' desire to seek visa-free tourism.
He is what Bosnia can do so.

Bosnia and Herzegovina's work to promote all rich rich images, he said, noting that people in the north have shown their politics, while they do not see any rich.
"One of our consequences that we've promised is to ensure Bosnia's integration through tourism through tourism.
Tourism pensions reflect the political problems. [We invite] a great relationship with the RS Ministry [in the tourism fair], and we invite a great relationship with the media, which we have been able to pay all tourists in the country, "he said.
And what is important for everything else -- a new market for products, or a new market for products or products -- could be negative to change the negative prevention of the people in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to change the negative effects of their own countries.
"I have to change the people in Bosnia and Herzegovina to change their things," he said.

Following a 11-day visit to Cyprus this month, the IMF warned that the decrease of Greek Cypriots, revenues, revenues and credit rating rates and banks are needed in accordance with Greece's debt problems.
Erik Jan Vrijer, director of the IMF's European Agency for Europe, said the funds see the situation as worried.
"The risks that the government cannot reach capital markets are very serious situation and the risks of the banking sector, which are more complex," De Vrijer said.
Vrijer said that the main priority should need to ensure a bailout loan loan loan in the end of Cyprus, the main priority should be to be deployed, especially especially in the excessive public spending.
The IMF warned that the country is not acceptable for economic growth this year, because it is unable to accept the demands for workers' salaries, in 2012 to 1% decrease, as well as social aid.
"The government has time and opportunity to move forward in a decisive action to prevent these problems," De Vrijer said.
The Greek Cypriot government, which monitored Greece's highest climate, is now being discriminated in services such as reducing salaries and students donors.
The government, which faces the debt costs, has been facing a four-year loan for investments in Cyprus, a country that has been investments in Cyprus.
The IMF believes that the loan would be very difficult to help that this loan would help the island's main power station in July, when the island's "removed" in a blast couple of the island's main electricity station.
"The government has an claims that the government will provide a major reduction in 2012 and provide a experience in the three years," said IMF mission chief Wes McGrew.
"To stop a speed increase in the public debt," McGrew said.

"We have the problems of public sector spending.
We need new growth networks.
"We continue to represent the economic activity measures: we have more worse than interior," he said.

"In recent years, the IMF acknowledges that many austerity measures have been negatively negatively negatively negatively negatively negatively negatively on growth," Demetris said.
"The plan of Greece's plan is unable to make the negative effects of the negative impact on the state revenues and unemployment," Professor said.
Both analysts agree on Russia's post because of the low institutions and farmers agreement in Cyprus, due to a deal on a number of Russian firms in Cyprus due to a deal.
"It's much more expensive than the open markets," he said.
"Cyprus has to pay the debt from Germany and France to get debt from the Stabilisation Fund, and tax rates from Germany and France have repressed pressure on Russia's interests and the Greek Cypriot economy," Demetris said.
He also acknowledges Russia's interests in Cyprus.

Turkey's alliance with the United States, NATO membership and final EU membership is the same goal of the same goal, he said.
He also discussed the government's policy of establishing closer ties with Russia and other states.
"Relations, such as Austria, China, India, India and Japan are not an alternative to Turkey's relationship with the United States and the EU," he said.
Erdogan's proposal came after four months of political tensions over the next president of Turkey's government and the military.
Former Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, a close supporter of Erdogan, arrived last week.
The country's largest secular opposition party boycotted Gul's vote on the candidacy, and reiterated that the army reiterated the outcome.

The latest round of talks on Kosovo ended on Thursday (August 30th) without a significant progress towards resolving the solution.
The two sides agreed, however, that the province is not an option to the province.
The Kosovo Albanian delegation has reiterated the demand for full independence from Serbia, while Serbian representatives offered broad autonomy as an alternative.
"We believe that we are not negotiating on the independence," Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku said in a statement to Pristina. "We should not be able to negotiate on the independence, because we cannot be negotiating."
But Vecernje Novosti, the daily Vecernje Novosti, said international medics were "very important" with Belgrade's proposal.
According to the paper, the EU-Russia's "troika blueprint" has issued a more detailed statement that concerns such as border control and the regulation of military forces in the province.
Belgrade and Pristina have agreed on whether the talks should be completed and that negotiations should be the latest round of talks.
The Kosovo Albanian side does not recommend on December 10th that the process is the end of the process and that is not another delay.
In addition, Serbia's chief negotiator, Slooo Samardzic, says it will not be really realistic that the status is expected to be determined.
Samardzic said that Western countries will soon be aware that this date will not be held.
Benzer also came from Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic.
Speaking to the daily Vecernje Novosti, Jeremic stressed that both Serbia and Russia are under way.
Nevertheless, Serbian officials have agreed that Kosovo Albanians could accept independence without a unilateral deal without the current talks.
At a clear government meeting, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said Serbia has started "the danger of the danger" to accept a solution based on Russia's aid, based on former UN Security Council envoy Martti Ahtisaari's plan.
However, Kostunica added, "the danger of Albanian separatists to declare their own independence by the end of the year".
Serbia will take measures to accept Pristina's move, he said.
"If the Union will harm us, you must react a certain damage.
"We are protected by the state and all citizens, such as protected individual protection," the prime minister said, rejecting that Serbia would also be made in actions such as those actions.
On Sunday, however, the prime minister's Democratic Party of Serbia (DPS) issued a statement suggesting that Serbia could give up its efforts to join NATO.
"In particular, one of the possible reactions that the possible reactions that the Serbian parliament will not be able to become a NATO member," the DPS said.
Serbia currently holds a member of the Alliance's Partnership for Peace programme.
Although NATO membership does not have an essential condition for EU membership, the accession process is on the ranking.

BiH politicians criticise police reform because police reform
If a deal on police reform is not reached, Bosnia and Herzegovina will be dangerous, the chance of the chance of a key accession agreement with the Union, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn warned.

"The EU cannot sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina, without an agreement on police reform," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said. [Getty Images]
A new draft proposal on Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU integration process has been removed in the country, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Friday (August 31st).
"This is the chance of Bosnia and Herzegovina (SAA) to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA)," Rehn said in a statement. "Bosnia and Herzegovina has now entered its neighbours and the end of Europe."
The commissioner came a day after leaders of the two most popular Bosniak parties -- the Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina (SBiH), the Haris Silajdzic and the Democratic Action Party (SBiH), Sulejman Tihic and the Democratic Action Party (SDA).
They said the plan is not in line with the principles set by the EU and that Republika Srpska (RS) police structures are not in line with the principles.
"This is not a police reform, but the law of ethnic divisions of ethnic divisions," he said. "We cannot accept this."
RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, however, rejected the proposal "unacceptable" and "violated the constitution".
"This initiative does not support our recommendations on police reform, and unacceptable solution," Reuters quoted Dodik as saying at a press conference.
In 2005, the EU has made it clear that it could only be possible if the country's police service with BiH only if the country is restructuring its police force in line with European standards.
The European Commission (EC) has set three principles to ensure police efficiency in the country, which has two entities -- RS and the Federation of BiH -- have their own police forces.
The EU wants all legal and budget commitments to the police to be made in the state level of police, political intervention, and that police areas should not be determined by professional criteria, not ethnic.
The attempts to ensure a deal were blocked by the Bosnian Serb parties.
As a step towards RS's secular reform, these parties have blocked any proposal to unify the two police force and restructuring the country's two police force.
Lajcak rejected the allegations that the plan violated EU principles, saying on Thursday that Silajdzic and Tihic's proposal to "fair and experience".
"The only only entity is not losing anyone," the High representative said. "Bosnia and Herzegovina will be the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which will be able to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Union."
Lajcak, who also serves as the EU special representative in BiH, pledged to help the country's progress towards EU membership in July.
Last month, Lajcak warned that the SAA talks are completed in December, but the agreement on police reform could be signed by the end of September.
Lajcak voiced support for his proposal to facilitate the agreement, Rehn insisted that this is in line with EU principles.
"I urge all political parties to continue a constructive work on Bay Lajcak and reach a comprehensive agreement without delay," Rehn said on Friday.

Archaeological risks in the Balkans
Southeast Europe is one of the highest areas in the region, but there is no common approach to the assessment of psychological risks so far.
This is willing to change with a new spending project.
By Beat Muco for Southeast European Times â€“ 05 / 05 / 08
1: 1,000 deaths of the Balkans are the Jeological Risolic Movement of the Balkans (Albania, Bulgaria, Bulgaria, Kosovo, Montenegro and Romania.
The Balkan Investment is the region of Europe's most complex production.
Sisolic movements are installed by the magazine earthquakes that caused the villages in the region.
A small team of Albania, Bulgaria, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Montenegro and Romanian experts have created a new feasibility of technologies in the countries, with the US Civic Research and Development Fund.

So far, the work has been conducted by employees, various institutions and organisations.
However, earthquakes and other risks are not attacking national borders.
Many countries, such as extremely free, free and inadequate preparations.
Experts agree that a common approach in the region is still at large.
The new project is hoping for preparing for future co-operation.
The first historic document on earthquakes in the Balkans is based on the 6th century BC.
Many cities and villages in the village were completely completely completely in the village, or some of the villages.
In addition to the military, a earthquake of 6.3 violence in the region every year.
The number of conservative earthquakes have been made in the past century.
What is the cheological movement
The Balkans are under the effect of a number of small platform, such as major Austria and Africa routes, both the Arab railway and the Adriatic routes.
In addition, many prosperous consumers in the region have created a lot of rural actors.
The earthquakes are spread, but the region is not a single threat to the region.
He lives very difficult.

Following the communism's degree, many countries in the region have entered a rapid transition process of democracy.
The development in the region showed free market economies, creating a controversial action, creating concrete and facility construction of the population and facility construction.
If the region's technical structure is being taken into account, these trends can be said in the future disasters.
To be aware of the concern that the risks could lead to the risks, review and spending.
The new spending project is a renewable worker.

However, these prospects are still complicated because Belgrade does not co-operate with The Hague.

The Serbian parliament adopted a law Thursday (December 14th) on the authority of state bodies that they have the power of war crimes suspects.
The government hopes it would encourage this to encourage some cases in the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
The new law envisions two major changes in the judiciary.
Professions offered to the ICTY are allowed to be used by Serb courts and provide full presence in Serbia if they do to express witnesses to the witnesses.
They also are also known for a murder of murder in Serbia.
The law allows ICTY representatives to participate in all stages and provide information about the work of the case.
Serbian Justice Minister Zoran Stojkovic said the new law would remove the main obstacles to the ICTY.
According to the UN tribunal's remarks strategy, the tribunal could now be able to be transferred to Serbia, according to the minister.
At the same time, he said, he expects "to be extradited" in some cases made by the charges ", adding that Serbian judiciary is confident that the courts could be in line with all international standards.
Serbian officials have sought to say they expect to expect any cases from the ICTY.
Justice Minister Branislav Bjelica said the first case could be transferred in early 2005.
"I cannot estimate that the interest cases will be given us to our courts," Bjelica said, adding that the first first election would be indicted for three former Yugoslav Army officers who were indicted for war crimes committed in 1991.
However, Belgrade's failure to co-operate with the tribunal is slowly reduced.
In an interview with the UN Security Council in late November, chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte criticised Serbian authorities for failing to arrest and extradite indictees.
Del Ponte accused Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's government of "a sovereign stance against the tribunal" and that he was not shown by the Security Council.
Belgrade does not support Washington's support for war crimes cases in Serbian courts, US Ambassador to War Crimes Pierre Richard Prosper said after del Ponte's report.
Currently, the war crimes agency in Serbia is being tried to be charged with the murder of Croatian arrests near Vukovar in November 1991.
The three high-ranking indictee Veselin Sljivancanin, Miroslav Radic and Mrksic are also indicted in The Hague.
Another case was sentenced to 40 years in prison for the murder of Albanian civilians during the 1999 Kosovo conflict.

Republika Srpska (RS) President Milorad Dodik has made the possibility of a referendum in the entity last week -- about NATO membership.
Some say this is a market for the October elections in BiH, but the majority of RS citizens are optimistic about the Alliance.
"The Serbs live very negative experience with NATO, but we can't think that the Alliance is committed to establish good relations with the Alliance." In the time we are trying to see what we think it is time for NATO membership, we can see what we think it is time for a referendum on people, "Dodik said on 14 March.
Opposition parties in RS supported the referendum, while parties from the Federation of BiH stressed that the issue is a state level.
Aleksandra Pandukic, a member of the Democratic Party of Serbia (SDS), said the vote should be done as a controversial law that has adopted in 2010.
"We believe the decision on whether the entity should participate in a military alliance such as NATO, and not participate in all democratic and developing countries.
Our recommendation is that BiH is in military spirit, "he said.
The major part of the public is due to NATO's operation in September 1995, when the RS Army's defence systems.
The move was organised as a plastic of the RS forces in Sarajevo, sparked the Markale market in Sarajevo and sparked the death of 68 people.

"We have strategic interests to do everything that can be acceptable to the Alliance.
I believe that the referendum story was used to be used in the daily political purposes, because the referendum was announced in RS, but there was no time time, "he said.
BiH acknowledged the Action Plan (MAP) in April 2009, but the country's military goods remain a condition for resolving status.
Milos Solaja, director of the International Relations Centre for International Relations in Banja Luka, said RS's recommendation to NATO, with the Alliance's recommendation, that Serbia's main political forces in the country have formulated with the Alliance.
"If the referendum was held today, there is no support for NATO in RS.
However, I think BiH will take years to take over the closure of NATO's door.
So far, many can change, "he said.
A survey conducted by the Banja Luka market agency Commerce confirmed the presence of pressure among RS citizens on NATO.
NATO membership is supported by only 26% of the population, while 55% opposes membership in the Alliance.
Around 19% are unacceptable.

Serbia's plans to participate in the May 6th election in Kosovo could lead to a force demonstration, a force demonstration among the two countries.
But some analysts think Pristina must allow the elections.
Representatives of four municipalities in northern Kosovo said on Wednesday (March 21st) that Serbia wants to hold local elections in Kosovo.
According to local media reports, representatives of Kosovo Serbs rejected the Pristina institutions in a recent referendum, rejecting Pristina institutions, rejecting the provisional majority in a recent referendum.
Kosovo Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi said police prepared to prepare a operational plan to prevent Serbia's vote, and will be operational within EULEX and KFOR.
"Serbia claims that Serbia will hold elections, but we should be ready to respond to the election agenda," Rexhepi told Radio Television. "We should not be ready to respond to the election agenda, and we should use all democracy to prevent the country in order to prevent the elections."
The peacekeeping force would not be unprecedented if Serb groups work to organise the election meetings, he said.
Serbia says it is a constitutional obligation to hold elections in Kosovo, which declares independence four years ago.
Kosovo is recognised by more than 80 countries.
The UN's Office for the Mitrovica Regional Directorate and Transparency Co-operation, Gerard Gallucevic, told SETimes that the elections in Kosovo should be held.
"For Kosovo, it will be more active for everyone.
The media denies the law and the importance of the importance of their importance, while a diplomatic invitation can be a diplomatic invitation, "he said.
He said the elections could be blocked in southern Kosovo but would not be done.
A successful attempt to stop the elections will be deepen to deepen division, and reflect Pristina's lack of any real influence in the north.
"The use of power to stop elections in South Kosovo will be successful.
However, it could lead to incidents in the incidents.
In the north of the Ibar River, the force is likely to replace its power use.
Another crisis threat to local Serbs will lead to revenue, "he said.
The international community will not help Pristina to prevent elections in preventing a new crisis, Gallucker said.
Arjeta Demiri, head of the Kosovo Executive and Public Policy, told SETimes that the international community is committed to help Pristina.
"If Kosovo police should be supported, it should be supported if the international community and police will not be held in Pristina, it should be supported," Demiri said.
Pristina's ability to prevent elections in northern Kosovo is limited, he said.
"If the barriers and the current situation in the north, the elections will be able to prevent the elections.
It can do only KFOR, "he said.
International Civilian Ofis spokesman Christian Palace told SETimes the laws support Serbia's parliamentary elections in Kosovo, but only that Pristina can hold elections.
"As a decision on Serbia's election in Serbia, Serbian citizens living in Kosovo -- have the right to vote for the parliamentary elections in Kosovo -- to vote for the parliamentary elections in Serbia."
"If the local elections are on the future elections, the right local elections in Kosovo are being held by the Kosovo government.
In January, the International Administrative Group called for Serbia to ensure that local elections are not comprehensive, "he said.

These include freedom of movement, freedom of movement, relations between Serbia and Kosovo's local communities and protection of religious communities.
Local administration is expected to be another critical issue.
The direct talks between Serbian and Kosovo Albanian authorities must begin on January 25th, but the talks were delayed after Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova's loss four days ago.
Now the talks are expected to begin in late February.
In November, the Contact Group issued a series of circumstances that would be addressed in a solution to the status issue, as well as other intelligence, the division of Kosovo's division and the unification of any other country.
No solution should be accepted by the people of Kosovo, the Contact Group said, noting that Belgrade's "disaster policies in the village of the past".
The international community is ready to support Serbian democratic forces "in use of this opportunity to boost Serbia", the statement said.
However, the document also called on Belgrade authorities to fulfil "the process" to co-operate fully with the UN war crimes tribunal.
Kosovo Albanian leaders have said they should remember that there is a very complicated solution. "They warn that those who think they are not the only option to reach violence to reach the targets," the ministers warned.
Meanwhile, Annan voiced concern about Kosovo's progress in meeting the standards set by the international community.
Annan urged the province's leaders to renewish their efforts to reach their goals.

Turkey's local elections on March 29th sparked the chance of a solution to Kurdish issues.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP), which is believed to be linked to terrorism by the terrorist PKK, won almost one of the main municipalities in southern part of the Kurdish population.
This result was a major blow in terms of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), who is trying to take support for Kurdish policies for the Kurdish policies.
The DTP, which has been a symbolic diagnosophy, has won the municipalities in the city of Dardarir, as well as four cities and 50 municipalities in Southeast Europe, has won four cities and 18 local elections.
Erdogan's party has won 100 municipalities in eastern Turkey and southern Turkey, hoping to ensure a stronger powerful authority for the prime minister's reform programme.
Following all the force for the victory, the AKP has opened the country's first Kurdish television station on the TRT.
State officials have ordered the public for the public and frustration.
Erdogan vowed to visit key cities in the region, promising to provide more investment, more investments, more employment and better social services.
The initiative, which has been very serious criticism from the Turkish opposition, has not been unlikely. The party, which lives 15 per cent of the votes in 2007, could win only four municipalities.
The AKP has accused the PKK for the end.
"The terrorist organisation is not possible to conduct a successful election campaign in areas areas that threaten voters and party officials," Turkey's EU Presidency chief Egel Bagis told reporters.
According to the Milliyet daily Taha Medvehicle, the results are a "strong sign".
The outcome, he added, is to ensure that a solution to the Kurdish issue in the near future, which the DTP is continued to be under pressure under pressure under pressure under pressure under the pressure of the Kurdish issue.
"This is a warning against nationalism, partners and the only party," said DTP leader Ahmet Ismet. [Getty Images]
DTP leader Ahmet Turks described the success as a victory of democracy and urged the AKP to change its approach.
"This is a warning against the AKP's nationalist, quot; he said.
This is a warning warning for the AKP to be respected for democracy, with a new constitution debate on EU reforms and a limited democracy, "he said.
DTP, the DTP -- including a new constitution that recognises free autonomy, wants radical changes in the Turkish state system and wants to be removed for PKK militants.
Although the last election results are more confident with the past elections, many analysts think the party would not be able to make a compromise from the AKP less than soon.
Erdogan has not suggested no DTP members so far, or not to do with them.
Furthermore, the party has criticised the party for failing to accept the PKK as a terrorist organisation, and that the PKK has not been condemned.
Sedededat Bozilar, a journalist and Fox TV office in Ankara, says Erdogan's party is reducing a political tender.
"The leaders of the DTP have been more violence and radical and radical dynamic to undermine the Kurdish support for the AKP.
The Radical demands were held and was rejected by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and AKP leaders.
This team has made it clear, and Kurdish voters have been united under the DTP, "he said.
According to Bozilt, the AKP wants to retain the security and votes, if the Kurds want to retain their demands on the identity.

Erdogan has promised a new opening of a new opening for southern coastal. In a letter to Dararir in 2005, Erdogan pledged to recognise the "Kurdish reality" and revealed a new citizens.
However, the restructuring of violence made by the PKK in months has been restructuring, the country's benefit and a serious political pressure.
PKK terrorists have been using the northern Iraq's distributors for years in attacks on Turkey.
It has been removed to almost 40,000 people since 1984.
DTP leaders seem to see the idea of terrorism organisation, and still seem to find a more peaceful solution to the PKK, not the Turkish government.
All observers are now under the International Kurdish Conference in Erbic, northern Iraq at the beginning of May.
The DTP plans to meet Kurdish groups from Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran, as well as representatives of the PKK.
Local media reports that the PKK could explain the conditions to leave weapons.
But the Mediterranean think the PKK's terrorism may be able to reach a solution soon.
"It is important that the democratic reform policies and the union of our union will enhance the respect of the Kurdish identity.
But it depends on a opening opening for Turkey's future, including opposition parties, CHP and MHP, including CHP and MHP. "
Another factor that is more complex, the ruling party is tension between the military and the secular state.
He and his party condemned a conflict with Erdogan and his party, while the military circumstances called for a "Islamic agenda" on Kurdish issues.
Turkey's top commander said earlier this week that cultural rights supports the expansion of Turkish citizens.
Chief of General Staff General Ilker Basbug said on Tuesday that the Kurdish youth have been closed to the PKK's jazz "and the fight against terrorism," a comprehensive strategy and "comprehensive legal changes".
Meanwhile, he opposes the idea of recognition of a new constitution with Kurdish identity, saying Turkey is not a state based on ethnic village.
"The Turkishness is a general identity (high-level identity), who said," The Turkishness has all Turkish citizens who have equal rights. "

Montenegro's pro-European pro-European Studies initiative initiatives to reform the country's leading figures, according to the problems in the country.
"The main principles of the Archaeologist of the Archaeologist, but if the current conditions are implemented, it will create only a French representative," Milan Popovic, a professor of political scientists at the University of Montenegro told Southeast European Times.
According to the European Commission website, "These are three priority priority: the transition system (transition), the transition of the returnees / piece / [doctor]), the quality and education of the process is recognised."
"Besna should be implemented in reality conditions.
"We have here, and we don't have enough," he said.
"It's normalisation of 30 students.
This figure can be able to be done by 50, and I can remove 100 students.
However, there are 300 students reduced.
This training is an indictment against this education, "he said.
Dragan Kopric, a professor at the Faculty Faculty in Niksic, acknowledges that a professional professor is "very very difficult" to represent 300 or 500 students.
"It has been easy for the students," Koprivica said. "There are two or four methods of explosives.
In addition, the students need to be tested during the year's year, this situation could be able to have almost cheaper for a professional professor. "
Montenegro has been member of the Besna Studies since 2003.
Prior to Besna, the students were only a test in the year, and this was a young signal.
The book was another test during the year.
Archaeologists and Besna are not needed to finance some students.
"I don't think that this is a student teaching teaching in the year, and if the territory can be able to get the final class," he said.
Popovic acknowledged that a student should be able to score a score during the year, but some universities believe that the funding is not impossible.
"Political scientific scientific factors will be able to speak at the future [in the future].
I don't learn them to learn them to learn them, "he said.
Milena Miskovic, the newly known as the International Relations Programme in Montenegro, agrees.
"I don't want the idea.
For us, the chance of work for the rating for us.
Archaeologists sparked the rating rating rating. "
Nemanja Curaskovic, a student at the University of Montenegro's Economic programme, said "[Besna] needs to work to work for the same idea.
"It may be a good thing, because I don't don't return to the deeper."

In addition with these and other measures, the government hopes to speed up the reform process in order to meet NATO standards.
Among those armed forces and defence ministry employees, the existing number of armed forces and the number of military employees include a speed decline from 1940,000 to 2006.
The Aira force envisions a single command unit unit unit, especially in different commanders, and equipped.
In addition, authorities responded to NATO to establish a special commander unit that would be to prepare Croatian soldiers to prepare their peacekeeping missions.
Croatian officials have said the transformation of air force is under way and that it is considering its final approval.
The defence ministry has blocked the idea of the new airline, such as modernisation of the current airline and modernisation of the current airline.
Public and academic helicopters have become the priority of air air forces.
These can be used to be effective for both military purposes and peacekeeping operations.
Military analysts say the bureaucratic obstacles are slow to the military reform process.
The key churches of the transformation of the Croatian Army, which has been formed on the remaining of the former Yugoslav Army, have been charged with insufficient efforts.
NATO's intelligence delegation concluded that the country has a model for the approach with several army and commanders and commanders.
Investigators say the largest strength of Croatia is to take over its territorial defence conflict.
After this change, Croatia will face an important obstacle towards full NATO membership.

In the beginning of the Cyprus peace process earlier this month, the Cyprus peace process was interpreted as a widely unprecedented opportunity for the future of the divided island.

In the north of the island, 40,000 soldiers have had to want Turkey to seek a solution in the island.
The country's military presence in the island will seek a very difficult crisis that has been closed to the Greek Cypriot side.
In January, the leader of Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, called on his country's politics, calling on his country's political politics to continue.
Glafkouos Klaides, who continues to open the career's career, hopes to open a complex agreement with a deal.
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan's efforts to resolve the problem for resolving the long-term solution would mean an important success for UN Secretary General Kofi Annan.
Nevertheless, the obstacles that have been achieved for years to reach a solution has been uneasy.
The latest reconciliation reconciliation, which was announced on 10 March, was not elected in the history, and Tassos Papadopoulos was not elected.
Annan, who was disappointed, said his special envoy to All De Congress was leaving the rescue and leaving the region.
If the only one of the victory won, Denktash could be said to be believed to be the last solution.
He said that a "vote" is the victory of Turkish Cypriots to enhance them.
Annan's plans by Annan reflected the model in Switzerland.
According to that, a joint federal federal state will be established to the establishment of two sovereignty states, which will be represented in the Council of Ministers, and will be represented in both state population.
Topilak issues have created one of the basic disputes that have returned to the restructuring of Rumours in 1974.
On 30 March, a recent referendum on both sides called for talks to meet the leaders of the two sides to sign a final deadline for Cyprus's membership agreement on 16 April, as a result of a unilateral deadline to sign the EU on 16 April.
Greek Cypriot leader Papadopoulos, who has already been elected, has acknowledged that invitation, while Denktash rejected the invitation.
Annan announced his way to the end of the facility, saying he was "a deeper disease".
"I don't think that a similar opportunity will be removed and arrest," Annan said, adding that the Greek Cypriots' chances "to decide on their own future".
US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher announced that Annan supports the statements.
"We are very proud that Denktash [Turkish Cypriots] find the opportunity for determining their own future and the right to vote in a institutional issue," Boucher said.
The first effective effect is that Greek Cypriots will sign an agreement with the EU to sign a membership agreement with the EU, as it is not expected to sign the accession agreement with the EU, "European Commission spokesman Jean-Christophe Palestinian said.
Speaking to EU Enlargement Commissioner Gunther Verheugen, Pori warned that the assessment of Turkey's accession prospects could be affected by the EU, warning that the province would be "jeopardised" in the case of the province's accession talks ".
"If there is no agreement on Cyprus over the end of 2004, there will be a huge situation, such as not recognition of a country that has not recognised our doors to join the end of 2004," he said.
If the Turkish Cypriots are entering the EU, a problem will be more proud.
The Greek Cypriots will be able to vote "to vote" with their behaviour ", continuing to change the island's north", and continue to change an unexpected development.
As part of the "Turkish-run Turkish-run" programme, it could continue to keep its candidate if Anadolu's residents from the poor "programme.
Turkey has said it could be able to condemn the north of the island's north, but could mean that Turkey's chances for joining the EU.
However, Turkish leaders could decide if their chances of accession chances are unfortunately.
Some are approaching Annan's plan. [AFP]
Furthermore, Turks, who have been dealing in the island, could be unable to reunify the country's countries.
The Greek Cypriots are suspected of suspected of the Annan plan. The suspected of the suspected Kikides were in the elections, which will bring the number of refugees to return to the refugees, the number of refugees and property claims.
The latest draft draft draft is to live in the borders if them vote as a member of the Turkish Cypriot state.
Turkey, the Mediterranean, North Africa and the Middle East, has been a major trade centre since the former modernisation.
The Ottoman Turks are sovereignty in the village of Venice in 1973. In 1973, the 1973 is in Britain's supervision of the island's supervision of the island before the end of the island.
Cyprus was an independent republic in 1959.
Observers and ethnic conflict have been leaving the island's Turkish and Greek communities to be formed by the establishment of a interim Turkish administration.
Talks between the two communities have been deployed for years, with the Greek side of Kikides and the Turkish side of the Turkish side.
During these talks, the Turkish Cypriots have asked two divisions, while the Greek Cypriots opposed the demand of this demands, and the talks ended without any outcome.
In 1974, Turkish military officers from Greece have been creating a military base, when the island's National Protection of the island's management of the island -- removed 37 per cent of its territory "(Rumca) in a bid to remove the island's territory.
The UN monitoring talks began in 1976, and has been under way since.
Nevertheless, the EU's Copenhagen summit in 2002 seems an active functioning of developing the possible development of the Greek Cypriot side.

Albania's new investment strategy
At the time of the Balkans, the countries in the region are beginning to focus on the issue: to ensure more foreign direct investment.
The Albanian government, led by Prime Minister Sali Berisha, has been implemented in the session.
By Robert Custin for Southeast European Times â€“ 02 / 09 / 06

Today, the most popular issue in the Balkans is the fight against foreign direct investments and improving these investments.
Southeast European countries are seeking renewable ways to boost foreign direct investments.
Meanwhile, political stability is estimated that if the final situation in the coming months will be resolved, investment will be a key condition for the investment.
A recent independence referendum in Montenegro was a symbolic news about the future.
Despite concern and uncertainty, the referendum has been slow.
Independent pro-independent votes have been protected by the 55% threshold, but there was no fear in the south.
Byzelically, EU and other observers received a radical phase and returned to their homes.
The country's latest election campaign has been sparked.
Political politicians have to think more basic issues in the case of independence.
After years ago, I am satisfied with the tensions, I am very satisfied.
Serbia's women are still linked to the arrest of Ratko Mladic, but the rest of the region is ready to move forward.
Albania's Democratic Party, led by Sali Berisha, can start a battle between countries who want to attract foreign investments soon, and can know what Albania needs to do so.
Everything is the most surprise to Albania, the delegation is not the country's foreign brand.
In the country's capital, the foreign currency has been made in the number of important workers, especially abroad, but there are more important jobs that are key to key sectors.
Tirana and Durres are increasing with the highway linking the two city.
However, there is no stability in investments, and Albania is not only resistance from Tirana.
The poverty needs investments in foreign parts.
The most important reason for foreign investments is the negative image of Albania's unfair (international arena).
The traditions in Albania are returning to their countries as a more positive assessment.
However, it needs to be done more to show the country's progress in the serious level.
In addition, it may be able to sign international investors in the country.
A growth of 5-6 levels is a very difficult figure.
The Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU shows that Albania is true.
Although the political life is still a rural, risks are no longer unprecedented.
The Democrats are published on their own daily daily daily newspapers, such as the Socialists.
No one of these newspapers, but this is not a problem.
Socialist party leader Edi Rama and Berisha are in the fight against the Berisha.
On the other hand, the two major parties have agreed to agree on electoral commitments to implement the upcoming local elections, which was also prevented to boycott the ruling parliamentary boycott.
Albania's tourism potential is not enough. [Getty Images]
Berisha's huge team has a huge team.
We can know that we can be able to make it clear in a clear way.
Beya's office shows how to improve how Albania's privatisation network will be improved in the framework, which will be easily easily easily easily easily in the country, and will increase strategic ports in the country.
Montenegro has a variety of international investments, but Montenegro has been in open for tourism investments.
The highway, which will begin in Dubrovnik and will change the country's major death.
This project is critical for Albania's long-term tourism potential.
The service sector, particularly restaurant and books, has offered the country's flexible immigrants.
The country's citizens returned to many mission and abroad.
The country will be very affected by tourist transportation and visitors.
Albania is a rich country in terms of natural resources such as oil, oil, gas, food and hydropower potential.
So far, Berisha's "name programme" has been the most important step forward.
Although the plan is not fully defined, it is to offer investors who are interested in the areas of strategic importance, such as reducing, agriculture, agriculture, export, energy imports, and the need for major investments.
As part of the plan, the ministries will make their assets and make them more than a long term.
Ozetle, if the state has been removed, a coastal coastal coastal coastal of a year, it is possible.
Meanwhile, many important details, such as how the biometric biometric will be chosen, and how it will be implemented if it is not fulfilled.
The plan will be granted to Juli, the economy minister representing the plan, and Ruli is one of the job.
The plan is very important, but the political consequences that will be able to meet their assets.
The government is preparing to submit foreign investors to attract foreign investors.
The country's disappointment of trade registration, which is now disappointed to eight days.
Prime Minister Sali Berisha has promised that this would be spent further.
Another measures that envisions the state's reduction, tax hikes and general spending are particularly satisfied with the government.
The citizens in the village now have the chance of the chance of corruption, which is more difficult.
This is a very positive development for foreign products.
Albania's main ministers reflect developments in their countries, citing forums abroad.
I am positive that Albanian ministers are being established in foreign investors.
Berisha, meanwhile, has been working to consult issues such as security issues such as organised crime and corruption, organised crime and corruption, as well as to consult on issues such as NATO partnership and investment.
The country is being implemented in the local.

The Hungarian leaders, who protested the law, said their countries would review Serbia's support for Serbia's EU membership.
"Serbia's EU membership is unrealistic, but the law is unrealistic," Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister Zladt Semjen said during a visit to Subodua on Sunday (2 October) during a visit to Subodua, who lives in northern Serbia's north.
The problem is imposed last week by the Serbian parliament adopted a law on materials and competencies.
The adoption of the law is a condition for EU membership.
However, one of the law's lack of law enforcement forces and their revenues in World War II envisions that are not extradited to them.
Hungarian parties in Serbia say the measures is impossible to affect the Hungarian parties in order to effectively affect their own requests, or any organised crime officers.
"We repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly disappointed the constitutional responsibility, and that the constitution is not in line with the principles of the principles," said Ivvan Pastor, head of the Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians, a member of Serbia's ruling coalition.
Pastor said the law would call for the assessment of the constitution.
Meanwhile, Semjen called on Serbia to change "the parts of the Reconstruction", which is unacceptable to the Hungarian community ".
About 350,000 Hungarians live in Serbia.
In response to SETimes, Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic told SETimes that Serbia opposes the society, but no one is not willing to see the disagreement during World War II.
Djelic also noted that Serbian authorities will try to convince the Hungarian community to convince the law on criminal crime, but also pointed out that the current structure is not reluctant to change the law.
Nenad Canak, leader of the Vojvodina Social Democratic Union, was more clear.
"We are doing between the EU and our citizens to choose between our citizens and the mistakes," Canak said.
And we think it is such an EU and we will think that we want to join them, "he said.
Serbia will likely receive candidate status from the European Commission on 12 October, EurActiv website editor Smiljana Vukojicic told SETimes.
"But all members must accept this.
In this point, Hungary could be able to stop Serbia's road, and candidate countries seem to block their right progress towards EU membership, because of their disputes with EU member states, "he said.
The verdict was high due to several physical conflict between Serbs and Hungary.
Dinko Group, who is the NGO coalition in Vojvodina, believes that such incidents are likely to cover.
"Earlier elections and the tensions in the region are increasing.
"The incidents in Conergin should not be reduced, but the ethnic communities have been discovered because they will live with a more comprehensive action," he said.

Ashdown: Police Reform for BiH's EU Integration
Bosnia and Herzegovina's politicians warned on Tuesday that the police force must restructure the country's path towards the EU.
He added that the other countries in the region will remain in the tension of other countries in which they do not do.
(Office of the High Representative -- 19 / 04 / 05 - 20 / 04 / 05; Fena, Fena, Local - 19 / 04 / 05)
"Police reform remains the last major obstacle to start talks on BiH's own Stabilisation and Association Agreement," High Representative Paddy Ashdown said. [OHR]
High Representative Paddy Ashdown on Tuesday (April 19th) urged politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) to reach a compromise on police reform, a critical condition for the country must meet its EU accession process.
"Police reform continues to stop BiH to start negotiations on its own Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA)," Ashdown said at a meeting with leaders of the Federation of BiH.
The meeting came a few days before the start of political talks on restructuring the country's police service was held on 24 April.
A consultant adviser to the European Commission (EC) will arrive in BiH in mid-May to assess BiH's progress in fulfilling the progress made in meeting 16 requirements.
A positive assessment will allow the start of the SAA talks, which is the first major step towards eventual EU membership.
According to Ashdown, the issue and most problems are resolved in the agenda, including "a constructive co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague".
He added, however, that the accord of the SAA talks could be arrested only after fulfilling all conditions.
The BiH leaders should "reach an official agreement on police reform", but it will be responsible for delayed delayed delays in BiH's EU bid, he said.
Among the conditions that Brussels has been taken over police reform, the police law and the budget is to be granted special authority to the state level, facilitating political intervention from the political intervention and protect the functioning criteria.
"If we are defined, these negotiations will bring BiH a mistakious business system that will win the fight against crime," Ashdown said. "If we are going to stay in BiH, we have always come to the European situation."
I'm going to be based on me, but we have to reach an agreement on unemployment. "
Citing a positive feasibility study for Serbia-Montenegro last week, British diplomat said that this is not a clear signal that BiH's EU membership is not in a clear signal of BiH's neighbours' neighbours' commitments.
"BiH's main political rounds -- both the ruling and the opposition -- now they have the opportunity to prove that country's citizens, reach this goal and to prove BiH to Europe," Ashdown said.
Police reform was among the issues discussed with EUPM Commissioner Kevin Carty's meeting with members of the Brcko Society Service head Milenko Milicevic and the head of the EUPM team in BiH on Tuesday.
"The reasons for police reform in BiH is not functioning," Carter said. "BiH's current security forces are not functioning and various political parties are undergoing."
If the country wants to begin its EU accession talks, the EUPM chief said. "There will be two options in BiH's politicians to restructuring the police service -- the police service will be closely closely to the police service or the police force."

Sanader, 50, a political scientist in Austria, is described as a bridge tolerance of five languages and one of the main supporters of US President George W. Bush's policies.
One of the challenges facing Sanader will be the international image that HDZ's nationalist policies in the past, as well as the reminder international image, which has been removed in the international image of human rights and economy during 2000.
The HDZ, which was founded by Franjo Tudjman, has prompted independence before the country.

Now, the party is preparing to discuss the issue as well as the presidency.

Turkey's presidential candidates began on Monday (April 16th) and will continue until 25 April.
As the head of the state, political analysts are waiting for parliament, Ahmet Necdet Sezer expects the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) to receive a candidate from the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP).
All observers are on Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Many will have to recognise the AKP's possible candidate, while it will have to leave the AKP as a potential to secure the parliamentary elections before the parliamentary elections.
The AKP was passed by the Islamic Registration Party in 1998, which was banned from Turkey's constitutional principles.
Sezer, who served as a judge at the constitution court, said his party is closely closely "to actions against secular republics".
In 2001, Erdogan founded the new party, saying it was described as a pro-conservative party in the Christian Democratic Party in Western Europe.
Since the AKP arrived in power, the AKP has been sparked to the launch of accession talks with the EU.
At the same time, Erdogan has been criticised by some of the steps taken by the state to undermine the victims of public employees -- such as example -- to remove the ban on the victims of public employees -- and to bring the person to justice.
Lawmakers argue that such movements are evident that the AKP is a proof of the former Islamic power.
The party is charged with political Islam to change Turkey's political culture, as well as to bring high-level management positions in the system.
"The dangerous threat is unchanged to change the state's basic character," Sezer said at the first day of the year's first day in Parliament. "The removal of the removal's conservative threat to the political level, removing the political level of threats and to enhance social tensions
These warns have become more important in this day, when the AKP is prepared to discuss both the government and the presidency.
Sezer told the Haris Open last week that the Turkish Republic has "not been facing a serious threat" so far ".
In addition to "democratic and secular structures, the state is" conservative and responsibility ", he said.
The head of the Turkish Army's staff, Yasar Algang, said the army would be ready to be ready if it is threatening Turkey's secular representations.
"Do you don't you have to reunite secular restructuring
How do they have the highest positions in the state
Do you think the basic principles of the Republic are threatening
If these questions do not reflect the questions, there is a radical Islamic threat in Turkey, and that is necessary to take any measures against the threat. "
At the weekend, hundreds of thousands of people in Ankara showed Erdogan's possibilities.
Erdogan rejected criticism.
During a visit to the United States last October, the prime minister said the threat against Turkish secularism is not the current and that the debate is impossible.
Erdogan urged authorities to avoid statements that would lead to unnecessary tensions in the country.
Parliament will begin the next president on 26 April or 3 May.
More than four rounds will be held.

The ethnic Albanians living in southern Serbia in the three municipalities in Presevo, Bujanovac and Medvedja organised a series of protests against discrimination, particularly in the past six years.
Riza Haljmann, the only Albanian lawyer in the Serbian parliament, said progress in the process of achieving the patience ended with the assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.
"We have been in a long time, so we live in a long time," Haljmann, head of the Democratic Action Party, told SETimes.
In the past weeks, two demonstrations were held on September 13th, a week later. About 1,500 people participated in the performance on 20 September.
The protests also asked the Albanian language in Albanian language, as well as that Serbia has recognised diplomatic recognition by the University of Pristina.
Serbian scientists don't be transferred to Albanians, and the use of universities from Pristina is to use.
As a result, around 12,000 students are in the main language.
Furthermore, it's still going to be held in Albania, where parts are being held.
"For example," a swimming city of Pristina, "Jonac Musliu, head of the Council of Europe, told SETimes, noting that" swimming city "," a swimming city "and the Turkish Ottoman Empire's atrocities for the Ot
Musliu, who has not made progress in this issue, resigned two months ago from the South Serbia Co-operation Council.
Serbia's Education and Science Minister Zarko Obradovic told SETimes that Albanians were done very difficult to boost education opportunities in Bujanovac, Presevo and Medvedja.
"The real reason for the protests of Albanians in South Serbia should not be in the real reason for education, education, education, political purposes," Obradovic told SETimes.
The ultranationalist opposition in Serbia has been sceptical.
"This is the same strategy with the same strategy with political political parties in Kosovo," Dragan Todorovic, deputy head of the Serbian Radical Party, told SETimes.
However, the Serbian government's Presevo, Bujanovac and Medvedja Code believes the protests are not impossible.
The three Albanian municipalities have invested in the development of the three Albanian municipalities, says Milan Markovic, head of the Council of Co-operation and Local Rights and Local Rights.
Markovic, however, added that the solution is serious problems and the education ministry is still in the education ministry.
"We will have to ensure the rights for other national minorities in Serbia for other national minorities, because we will be able to be able to integration into institutions," Markovic told SETimes. "This could become a major problem."
Our young people in Serbia seems to have little news about the problems of the south.
"I don't know that their bodies are in the language, but I think it should be Serbian, because our country is official language," Belgrade student Vladimir Spasic told SETimes.
Croatian Women's Crime Crime
The Croatian prosecutor's office has been demanding the sale of sale of the coastal assets and demanding the sale of sale.
By Mirjana Novak for Southeast European Times in Zagreb - 29 / 03 / 04
The sale has sparked the Croatian Prosecutor's Prosecutor's Office to open an emergency investigation. [www.com]
In late last month, the Croatian media reported that several Adriatic immigrants were sold to suspected conditions and millions of euros.
At that time, the prosecutors demanded the sale of coastal assets.
As a result, the new owners of Sokokoke Male and My Krkkas will not be the most valuable residents of the new owners, which are worth more than 2m euros.
The defendants are located near the villages of Sixha, Zadar and Troika.
My Krkljas's company, Valadria Krknjas, has acquired Mt Krknjas as.
The figures in the attack were sparked in public opinion, while demanding them to confirm their relations.
"If the official losses in Treaty, the coast can be a special state.
Therefore, we will demand the removal of the public medical owners in the dealing with the bureaucratic company.
"We will open an invitation to the sale of the sale of the sale of the sale chapters."
Valadria company has created a US firm in the Trenton Championships.
However, prosecutors say they don't think there is no identity within the job.
A controversial operation was defined.
He was selected in 2000 by his troops and Frattle, near the south of the Istria coastal coastal of the Adriatic.
The owners at the Miodrag Swarzic and Mikhail Pevevo, allegedly supported by Russian and Chinese investors, were planning to spend 16.5m euros to leave their service.
However, Mustafi, a judicial authority on the island, has decided to allow local residents to unacceptable to any city without ratification.
As for those who are not allowed to build construction on the island, it is not prepared for them.
Therefore, it is not certain to submit a economic potential for investors.
Therefore, the prosecutors are working in co-operation with the tax agency and police in order to find nothing that the businesses are selling.
The Co-operation Protection Agency has launched an investigation to learn the money used by Croatia to learn from legal ways used for the purchase.
Many expect the new owners to demand their new owners to demand software software in use of state control.
If such demands, the last remarks will be the last remarks.
The prosecutor, meanwhile, announced it would send a letter to the government and Croatia's Environmental Protection Ministry, demanding that the state would require more active to the use of interference and sea assets in the city.

Macedonian Culture Minister Elizabeta Kanevska [Klaudija Lutovska / SETimes]
Macedonian Culture Minister Elizabeta Kanevska says the countries in the region could find a common diaspora through culture, even if their governments are in different meetings.
In an interview with SETimes, Kaneva-Milevska assesses the importance of cultural importance of Macedonia's EU integration process, taking steps to support the government's culture and support the historic heritage ministry.
SETimes: What is the role of the culture
Elizabeta Kaneva-Milevska: Our cultural identity in Macedonia is something that we have a link to us different structures, as well as connection between the rest of Europe and the rest of the world.
For the first time since Macedonia's independence, the cultural state is in the centre of the development of cultural state, and it is becoming a functioning functioning.
This government considers the cultural culture of the past, example, for example, for example.
It is estimated about 65m euros of funding, and this is an important investment for Macedonia.
This increased tax, a new archaeological museum that will be exhibited in Skopje, has not built a new archaeological music complex, which will be completed in May 2011, and will build a new concert for the Macedonian Philharmonic Orchestra.
Over 20,000 archaeological site, including Stoakaa, Herakaa, Isar-Marvonski and Vardarski Ricarski Ricarski, over the past three years.
I don't think that Macedonia has a key part of the EU integration process.
A recent EC report released two weeks ago praised Macedonia for progress in the culture area.
SETimes: Do you think the importance of the culture's importance between Macedonia and other Balkan countries
Kanica-Milevska: I am satisfied with the lack of co-operation with countries in the region.
We have signed agreements in all countries in the region to boost inter-institutions and inter-state relations.
The government cannot find a common basis, while cultural institutions are in the process.
For example, prominent Macedonian film and theatre director Milco Mancevski and Slobodan Ungkovski are working with Greece -- or injuries.
In Croatia, we have a comprehensive project, including exhibitions at the 140 artists' Art Art Museum.
Macedonia has the basic relationship with EU member states such as Slovenia and Austria, such as cultural co-operation.
We signed an agreement with Estonia, such as Turkey in 2011, as we are in the European Culture Chairman.
The initiative has been made in several tenders that all sides have gained.
SETimes: What is Macedonia's culture policy
Kanica-Milevska: Macedonia has a strategy that can be defined to protect a clear cultural policy and preserve, offer and promotion.
We are involved in activities in all areas such as sports, gallers, theatre, theatre, theatre, theatre artists, film artists, international promotion and business development, as well as local cultural development.
The culture can be seen as a series of benefits for political and economic minister.
The culture board has an important economic deficit, which is not managed and management.
We are interested in developing cultural tourism.
SETimes: How do you face challenges like you
Kanica-Milevska: Relations about Macedonian cultural heritage are an important problem.
In an effort to emphasise this crime and prevent the laws, we are working closely with the interior ministry and continue to work closely with the interior ministry.
One of the most important archaeological archaeological networks is to be conducted through the traditional and systematic review of the system.
For example, the city of Stock has been transformed into a national institution, and now there is no service that protects it.
The culture is unable to be able to go to his own, because of a couple, active.
Both cultural event is to be able to feature a feature for us, as well as human success.
SETimes: Do you share a specific success that has created a difference
Kanica-Milevska: The status of the artists is changed.
We successfully successfully successfully in a better assessment of the artists' efforts to create art.
Earlier, the artists were reduced to the project.
"We have the highest level, and people in Macedonia are now working in full time.
It could be seen by others, as well as the protection of regional artists.

Draskovic warned that the door to EU and NATO membership would remain closely closely to The Hague.
Serbia's chances for joining the Partnership for Peace programme if its obligations are met, he said.
He also noted that war crimes suspects are blocking Serbia's attitude among European countries.

Analysts: Mladic's Assistant Assistant Against Srebrenica Academy
Analysts believe some of the close figures that have been transferred to Ratko Mladic in the Srebrenica massacre during the past few months could be able to hand some of the key questions about the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.
(Blic - 11 / 04 / 05; BBC Monitoring, Fena, Radio B92 - 10 / 04 / 05; AP - 09 / 04 / 05; Reuters, BBC, War and Peace Reporting Institute - 08 / 04 / 05)
The fugitive war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic could be hiding a military facility in northern Belgrade, according to the Sarajevo daily. [AFP]
Nearly ten years after the July 1995 massacre of more than 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were killed, at least two questions -- at least two questions -- were still unanswered -- and still unanswered.
Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic could help the end of the cases against several deputy victims of Srebrenica, the Institute for War and Peace Conference (IWPR) said on Friday (April 8th).
Former Bosnian Serb Army (VRS) chief Ljubisa Beara, was extradited to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in October 2004.
The six people indicted for war crimes committed against the Srebrenica massacre were transferred to The Hague: former VRS medical officers and the VRS's secret spokesman Milan Glado Goso and VRS's Zvornik Tugornik, Dragino and Milorad.
Two people -- the former VRS staff officer Radic Miletic and former military chief Ljubomir Borovdic -- are still in the ICTY.
The Serbian government announced on Friday that Vujadin Popovic, former security commander Vujadin Popovic, would surrender to The Hague this week.
Beara was accused of co-operation with genocide or genocide, genocide or genocide, which has been committed to other war crimes committed against him.
Borovina was charged with genocide.
As Ganso and Miletic, four are facing charges of crimes against humanity and violation of the laws or customs of war and traditions.
Beara and Goko have said they are opposed to all crimes committed against him, while UN judges used to delay the rights of 30 days of delay.
Dran Jan Willey, a professor at Kolley's Colley University in London, told the IWPR that Borovo and Beara may be important to The Hague.
"These are the key player that has been linked between the normal army units of the normal army units, which was linked between former Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic," Honie, a car writer of the book ".
Bosnia and Herzegovina's intelligence agency reported on Saturday that Mladic is currently a military facility in the north of Pancevo, Belgrade.
He said he was in recent time after Montenegro was hiding in the Niksic region.
Three people are protected by a military officer, including Mladic, according to the report.
According to the Ukraine, Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic's arrived in Pancevo last week, the Serbian intelligence service had developed Pancevo.
As a result, the Srebrenica massacre described as a delay in Europe's most delay since World War II, Serbia and BiH's entity, while the Republika Srpska entity's entity's entity, is under pressure on the arrest.

"After now, we should give a end to our people and we should reunite our country," Cypriot President Demetris Christofias told reporters after talks with President Demetris Christofias. [Getty Images]
Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat began on Wednesday (September 3rd) with a new round of peacekeeping talks to end a deal between the Mediterranean island's ethnic communities.
"After the championship in the region, we should have to end our people and reunify our country," Christofias said, who also headed UN Special Representative for Cyprus T-Bromar Zermououououououououououere as saying.
The talks were attended by former Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, who served as UN special envoy since July.
Talat's top deputy minister has been optimistic about the final outcome of talks.
"This historic day is a sovereign day," Reuters quoted Ozdir Nami as saying. "Both leaders will send a message that they want to reconciliate the people in the world."
The latest initiative to resolve the issue ended in April 2004 when Greek Cypriot voters rejected a reunification plan, which rejected a reunification plan with UN support.
The majority of Turkish Cypriots voted in the proposal, but only the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot part of the island joined the international area on 1 May.
The prospects for peaceful peace process were removed earlier this year after Christofias's presidential elections to win the second position and will not block any efforts to end the province's division.
He and Talat agreed to start preparations for preparations for new direct talks on 21 March.
According to the deal, six working groups and seven technical committees have been established in April to determine the details of a reunification agreement on the UN sponsored peacekeeping talks.
After several meetings aimed at assessing the progress made by the Committee, Christofias and Talat agreed on 3 September.
Christofias said Wednesday's opening ceremony that any solution should be based on the principles of the principles approved by Talat's previous meetings.
"We should be a single sovereignty, two sectors, political division, citizens and international persons, as well as the Security Council decisions of the Security Council decisions," the Cypriot leader said.
Christofias added that a deal would need to protect the authority of the process "to protect the authority to Cyprus and ensure a solution by the Greek Cypriots to ensure a solution to the Greek Cypriots" and to ensure a solution by the outcome, no judges or structures, "he added.
On Wednesday's meeting focused on the procedures, with real talks will begin on 11 September.
The talks will focus on reunification, including management, economic issues, health and environmental.
Security, property rights and territory are expected to be among the most popular issues.
A solution to the Cyprus issue would mean the end of the international isolation of the island's Turkish-run Turkish Cypriots, which has a five-year term.
While nothing has been made for the talks, Talat voiced hope that it would be reached by the end of this year.
Two leaders expected to meet at least a week before the talks, have decided to establish a safe phone line for direct connections to the process.
Downer praised the two sides' commitment to overcome problems over the past few months and a solution to a solution, warning potential challenges and unfortunately.
"The Cyprus issue is unable and we must reach a successful outcome of negotiations today," Downer said at a meeting Wednesday's meeting. "This process is a critical factor for us and the outcome of our leadership, which is a critical factor."

The crisis in northern Kosovo has been resolved for the time.
Experts, however, have proved that there is no strong signal about Belgrade and Pristina's prospects to reach an agreement.
In an interview with German media recently, the KFOR commander said the rule of law is a factor that contributes to the crisis in the north of Kosovo.

"The other radical intelligence is important for these structures.
"They have the right to really really really in the north today," he said. "They have the right to live the right to control the armed forces, checkpoints, checkpoints and barriers.
And in the north, the peaceful population in the north was shown. "
Representatives of Belgrade sent a deal with KFOR and KFOR that the removal of the barriers and the removal of free movement of free movement, but analysts say the deal is only a more interim measure.
"There can be able to bring the region to the region but no solution to the political problem in the north," political commentator Tomislav Sadiku told SETimes.

However, Belgrade and Pristina are selling efforts to replace the census on the future of northern Kosovo, which is in the north of the Serb population.
While the Kosovo government continues to detain the city's centre, Belgrade continues to support them in such a plan and recognise Kosovo as an independent state.
According to Ilazi, the long-term prospects for the north is offering the Ahtisaari Plan.
He says the plan proves that the plan has proved a sustainable solution.
"This plan was successful and successful in the development of the Serb community in the south and development of the Serb community, and the other municipalities that accepted in the development of the Gracanica, Gracanica and Strpce," he said.
Meanwhile, Sadiku is confident that the integration of the north "will be built in the region and the fight against crime and radical discrimination".
Both Serbia and Serbia are seeking for Kosovo's final EU membership, while Brussels tried to keep its long-term term term, urging both sides to return to the negotiating chapter.

This is a very important phase and that this phase has been said to have been said to be [the phase] phase in the phase of the phase, which has been conducted by former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari, "he said.
Jeremic, meanwhile, has warned any unilateral movement that independence could be declared as a single unilateral move if the international agreement is not reached.
"The amendment of any amendments to Kosovo's status and international status should be detained by the UN," the Serbian foreign minister said.
Kosovo's leaders, however, have said they think the negotiations process is likely to end.
President Fatmir Sejdiu reiterated that independence is unacceptable.
"We think that Ahtisaari will be implemented," Sejdiu said, noting that the former envoy's proposal earlier this year.

The situation in the province has improved, but the number of minority returns are very low, UN Secretary-General for Human Rights (IDP) said on Friday (June 24th) after a visit to Kosovo.
During a three-day visit to Kosovo, Walter Kalin said he was seen as a number of ethnic incidents.
However, the IDP and returns have said they are still worried about their own security.
One of the reasons for the demonstration is the lowest level.
Other major problems include restrictions of freedom of movement, unemployment opportunities and lack of resources, according to the UN representative.
"It is not clear that many IDP has not been removed to their lives in the campaign and in other parts," Kalin said in a statement issued by the UN Cenewal Environment (UNOG).
Voicing Kosovo's interim institutions and UNMIK to find a clear responsibility for the IDP, Kalin voiced concern about what many are "insufficient responsibility for the IDP", adding that "many are being violated in Kosovo's activities, particularly in particular, but in particular.
"This situation, especially with other Serb minority minorities, the Roma, Arab and Egyptian IDP, who feel in the two main ethnic communities in Kosovo," the UNOG said in a statement.
He also urged the international community to move forward to the Roma population, which has been removing in the campaign in northern Mitrovica.

Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel said on Wednesday (January 19th) that a Croatian joint committee could be formed by the establishment of bilateral relations.
He stressed that the ongoing disputes between Ljubljana and Zagreb should not slow relations between the two countries or Croatia's EU bid.
Slovenia and Croatia have been disagreements since the declaration of independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991.
The bridge on the Piran Kay in the Istrian district has caused some border incidents and continues to be one of the most critical points in bilateral relations.
A small career in southern Croatia with Croatia is a dispute.
The two countries signed an IT agreement in 2001, but Croatia has yet to ratify it.
The Krsko nuclear power plant and Ljubljanska Banka, which is in Slovenia, is being discussed in debts with the Croatian language, the Ljubljanska Banka Banka.
"We have a number of problems that Slovenia can solve only in the EU framework," Rupel said at a press conference in Zagreb on Wednesday. "Therefore I've been transferred to the EU."
Slovenia is the first former Yugoslav republic to join the bloc on 1 May 2004, together with other Central and Eastern European countries.
Croatia is expected to receive full membership talks in March, which is expected to begin in March.
The last phase of Croatian border police detained last year in September, citing a threat to a threat to Ljubljana's EU bid that Zagreb would block its EU bid.
Tehdad was then withdrawn.
EU security chief Javier Solana urged both countries to seek a solution through dialogue, saying that the EU doesn't open all Balkan countries.
"They have to leave the conflicts through dialogue and co-operation," Solana said.
Rupel said the proposal for establishing a joint expert committee to discuss bilateral relations was accepted by Zagreb.
According to the minister, Slovenian and Croatian prime ministers are scheduled to hold a separate meeting between Janez Jansa Jansa and Ivo Sanader.
Rupel, however, has not been detailed about the trial or time.
Zagreb has said he wants to leave the border issue if it fails to reach a solution through bilateral dialogue.

The obstacles in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) are facing various challenges as full recognition of the workers' needs.
Authorities have organised an unemployment work last month, calling for several strategy and projects.
However, even though, the event was held under a pension that people who used to be able to work.
"These cases are a symbolic example of the recommendation against politicians," FBiH's Association of FBiH's Secretary-General Eljlija Beslija told SETimes.
According to data, there are no official figures on obstacles -- including 100,000 Republika Srpska (RS), 250 people in the country, including 250 in the FBiH.
The unemployment rate between the data is around 85%.
The implementation of the FBiH parliament's Information Rehabilitation, Education and Information was five years ago.
The law was passed in early 2010 and parliament promised to establish a special fund for the law, which was held in April 2011.
The funding for both law was implemented in 2005.
Since then, there have been 1,500 obstacles.
However, such a law or funds are not the current.
The law was made as part of BiH's obligations that have a country signed by the UN Integration Rights.
The law envisions at least 39 employees working by all public institutions and companies by 2013, and will be an option of 16 after that time.
The average average salary of the average salary in FBiH, which is not in 2011, envisions the average salary of the average salary in the average salary of 423% in 2011.
The two entities that have created BiH have been allocated for the year to promote the employment stage of obstacles and proposes a five-year term for workers who are obstacles obstacles.
According to Beslija, however, these actions have yet been made.
"We need to create a long-term positive atmosphere for employment," he said.
Many organisations representing the index represents have decided to make measures with companies and make only measures with their own image.
The Libyan company, which was established by the Association of Sarajevo Studies and Communications, operated in 1996, is operating in the hotels.
The company gives only to obtain obstacles that are not only members.
"In the past few times, we have been sparked, but we have been in line with the help of foreign organisations and embassies," Libyan Director Jasenka Karahasanovic told SETimes.
"In time, the FBiH government has passed the law on obstruction of obstruction, there was six years ago, powerful, powerful and conservative.
However, until the law passed, we live with the authorities' good and foreign donations, "he added.
Mirza Jasarevic, a NGO at the Centre for Development and Support, says that the FBiH could be restructuring with funds in the country with funds that have been spent since the end of the armed conflict.
"The signals are the biggest interest category and a large part of the electoral book," Jasarevic told SETimes.
Serbia-Montenegro Disn't Disn't Disn
Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic suggested that the case was reduced by the International Court of Justice as a sign that the country wants to join NATO in the International Court of Justice.

Serbia-Montenegro's Euro-Atlantic integration has two key issues.
One is that the UN cannot co-operate fully with the UN war crimes tribunal -- particularly Bosnian Serb wartime leader Ratko Mladic -- is still at large.
The second is the case that the country has opened ten NATO countries due to its move in 1999.
The case opened by Slobodan Milosevic's regime in The Hague.
Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic said the Council of Ministers would propose the reduction of crimes.
European Commission Ambassador to Serbia-Montenegro Geender Barmirt said the reduction of crimes would boost the country's chances for joining the EU.
"It is necessary to disagree with the past to Europe," Barmt said.
Belgrade has proposed the case, while NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer's proposal was made during his visit to Serbia-Montenegro on 19 July.
Officials in Brussels are positive.
The proposal was supported by the Democratic Party (DS), led by Serbian President Boris Tadic.
The DS argues that everything possible to facilitate EU and NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme as soon as possible.
"If we don't mean this step back, we should be removed because our country will be a condition for the international community," the DS said in a statement.
However, the most effective party in the Serbian government -- led by Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) -- argues that Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia must be reduced.
"We think that all cases should be removed, because they are part of the same problem," a DSS official said.
As expected, the Serbian Radical Party and Milosevic's Socialists have criticised Milosevic's initiative.
Political analysts warn that the withdrawal of crimes is not the most important issue affecting Serbia-Montenegro's prospects for joining the PfP programme.
Experts noted that the international community demand Mladic's arrest and co-operation with the UN tribunal.
The attitude of the case will be a signal that NATO wants to join the Alliance.
Political analysts in the Serbian media say the charges will have to be reduced, or to open a system that has been trying to open a system.

Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski met with opposition leader Ali Ahmeti last week after the ongoing political crisis in almost two months.
The Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) leaved parliament in January with the request of the parliament's decision on the Badinter.
According to the declaration, the decisions concerning minority minorities are being taken, while at least two of the Macedonian minority members must be played.
The DUI's climate and political dialogue has created an exclusive environment and affected laws needed for EU and NATO membership.
Before the meeting, the United States and the EU encouraged their parties to discuss the problems.
The dialogue continued after a bridge shopping.
Gruevski discussed political issues during the six hours of Ahmeti and his team.
Ahmeti suggested that the government would be elected by Badinter's circumstances, including a constitutional amendment and laws aimed at finding laws aimed at finding the status and social problems.
Gruevski, however, has been removed to two proposals.
This means Macedonia will mean to change the state regulation, he said.
"There is no other example to form such a government," he said.
Gruevski has encouraged DUI to return to politics and asked the government to support the government in the issues related to projects related to the prosecutors, prosecutors and information society, parliament regulation and constitutional changes.
At the end of the talks, Badinter was unable to reach an agreement on preparing a list of laws.
A series of members of the two parties to submit a list will be created and will be part of parliament's parliamentary regulation.
Agron Buakaku, a member of the DUI delegation, said the move is not a model for dialogue.
He said that his mandate should discuss all issues, because the dialogue is unable to continue.
The meeting also attended Gruevski's beginning, but representatives of foreign ambassadors attended the meeting as a precondition for the DUI.
The US embassy issued a joint press release after the meeting of the EU, NATO and OSCE missions, saying it is very important step to build confidence among the parties.
"We urge all parties to continue to continue and work in a consensus.
This is a condition for the reform process, both parliament and state institutions, "he said.
However, DUI said he would expect "concrete results" before the Parliament.

Macedonia's 12 political parties signed an agreement last week by Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski and the ruling VMRO-DPMNE government to reunite a joint goal of restructuring the coalition.
"Our goal is to win the coalition led by the VMRO-DPMNE," coalition leader Branko Crvenkovski said in Skopje on 1 February.

The most party unanimous unit was given to Cephe, Crvenkovski's Social Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDSM).
The coalition, street, street, street and communism, is the current allies and former rivals.
The only target of parties is to replace the central coalition, which has been in power since the July 2006 parliamentary elections.
Observers cited surveys that the Gruevski government continues to continue to the polls, citing polls that Cephe will continue to reach this goal.
Gruevski criticised Gruevski's violence, but did not participate in Liberal Democrats, who have continued optimism for Crvenkovski.
The Democratic Party of Albanians, led by Menduh Tuzla, has rejected participation.
Ljube Boskovski, 49, is a former interior minister in the ruling government. In 2001, Boskovski is now in a strong position of torture and murder of war crimes against ethnic Albanians.
In a speech to the signing of the agreement, he said the Gruevski government has not fulfilled any name.
"We don't have invested, there is no money, here we don't have a friendly friendly."
Gruevski said he was not commented on the school shock, saying it is not only protecting the ruling.
Analysts pointed out that most of the parties participated in Cephe, which participated in a number of voter voters.
Professor John and Kekenovski said the impact of the united opposition is more psychological, while political expert Albert Musliu praised the government's level of commercial trade.

The two agreements have been welcomed by the two agreements on Kosovo's representation of the international forums -- and technical issues on Kosovo's international forums -- were welcomed by officials and the international community.
But many bloggers see them as harmful to Kosovo's interests.
The armed agreement envisions that Kosovo's international forums "Republic of Kosovo's" remarks "from the Republic of Kosovo's", and at the same time the UN Security Council Resolution Resolution 1244 and the ICJ "decision on independence.
At the same time, unsatisfactory dissatisfaction after the first challenges in implementation of the agreements.
Serbian and Kosovo delegations sparked regional forums because of Kosovo's representation.
Kosovo bloggers' bloggers' flexibility and Prime Minister Hashim Thaci condemned Serbia to the Kosovo island and accused the EU from Belgrade.
"The EU revealed the opinion of the 22 EU members in the past dialogue and the opinion of Kosovo's independence in the past dialogue, which recognises the opinion of 22 EU member states that recognise Kosovo," Belul Bekaj, a professor at the University of Pristina, told SETimes.
The EU has not delayed a response to the agreement on the representation and that it is very clear.
"For the use of the communities, it has been unable to decide to decide to decide whether it will be able to keep the score," EU spokesman Maja Kocijancic told SETimes.
"I don't know that some of them do not know the EU, but do you support our representatives from Serbia to help Serbia's candidate status?" Fund said.
But others do not participate.
According to Diell, all differences have created Serbia's candidate status because it allows to move forward towards EU membership.
"In five years, Serbia will enter the EU, and we will expect Kosovo to see what Kosovo will be."
Inga is completely the prime minister.
"Hashim Thaci has brought Kosovo into its own farmers, nor they want to do what they want to do, sell the constitution," he said.
"The EU was in Kosovo after the war, and we see what we are ready to have a state.
There is no single ministerial investigation in Kosovo, and many of the municipalities have claimed corruption allegations about most of the municipalities, and some have been sentenced to prison sentences.
Europe is increasing us, "he said.
"While acknowledging the credit rating, Kosovo has cited its rights to recognise itself as state," Shala says.
Certainly to the list, the government says it is obvious to negotiate the public without open approval.
"The rating is only one of the issues that Serbia has done with them and we are able to participate in negotiations with our own people," he said.
Some bloggers, such as Likept, argues that the agreements are likely to be held under current conditions.
"There is a better solution or a better plan for an agreement," he says.
"We were able to do so.
That is the government's "talks in the EU over 50 years.

Republika Srpska's (RS) parliament adopted a law Wednesday (10 February) that could prevent the way for a independence referendum on the international community, accepting the way for a declaration of independence referendum on the entity.
The amendments to the referendum law -- RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik's Alliance for Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) -- were adopted after a two-day debate in the 83-seat parliament.
The new law was adopted by 16 votes against 46.
Bosniak members of the RS parliament boycotted the vote, insisting that the bill violated both the Dayton Peace Accords and the BiH Constitution.
The law allows the Serb entity to hold a referendum on national issues, but only a few technical issues such as promotion procedures and the referendum.
The law does not think the referendum can be held or any questions.
Dodik has threatened to call for a referendum on RS's independence if the entity's autonomy is jeopardised.
While the prime minister has not been jeopardised in recent months, the RS parliament's High Representative Valentin Inzko's decision to exercise the referendum on the RS parliament's decision to exercise foreign judges and prosecutors in the Bosnian courts.
Dodik denied on Tuesday that the new Reference and the Civilian Rights were aimed at facilitating the entity's secular entity or violating the Dayton Agreement.
"We will take a law and then call for a referendum on the decisions of support and decisions that have been given to the Dayton Peace Accords," he said.
Dodik was unable to leave Inzko, the top international envoy in BiH, including the entire broad international envoy in BiH, which allows to take over laws under Dayton, and enjoy election officials.
The RS prime minister, currently under investigation by foreign prosecutors, insists that the country's legal system does not need international presence.
Dodik argues that the entity should decide on all issues.
The law was approved despite warnings that the international community's referendum on such issues could be more efficient.
"The referendum is a right mechanism in accordance with the right conditions, but there may be no disappointment and even disappointment," the US Embassy in Sarajevo said in a statement Tuesday. "Bosnia and Herzegovina will accept any referendum that the United States accepts the stability of sovereignty or territorial integrity."
Inzko's support for the law, warning the leaders of Bosnian Serb parties that the referendum would be more efficient than RS, European and world communities.

Macedonia's political engineering continues to change

Macedonia's political scene has been living in an unprecedented move.
All parties are chosen to hold strikes and choose new leaders.
In the past period, the ruling party VMRO-DPMNE has been expanding, while the Social Democrats were discovered in 2000 as the priority of the Social Democrats.
One of the reasons for this situation is a new evidence that represents the number of political parties to more than 1,000.
As a result of the amendment, many political groups have to enter the fall of the major groups.
Democracy Ligigi, the first political party in Macedonia after the end of the communist regime, attended the VMRO-DPMNE.
The head of the Agriculture Party, Marjan Gorcev, was the VMRO-DPMNE, and former Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski served as agriculture minister.
The DRUM party, founded by former VMRO-DPMNE, has returned to the move.
The eight parties, the VMRO-DPMNE, took part in the province.
The national parties are not satisfied with the amendments to this law on political parties.

Last month, the court launched a procedure on the justice ministry's failure to sign and complete registration operations within 45 days.
They voiced concern about the freedom of movement of the provisions would violate the constitutional principles.
Meanwhile, the opposition Social Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDSM) has some classes for the last elections.
The party's leader and former Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski, was extradited from the party due to the lack of confidence vote.
A concert was held after this exports was held to be removed.
Radmila Beerinska, former prime minister for European integration, was the new leader of the SDSM.
Belerinska's election has brought a new consensus, which is completely elected president.
Now the party is under way for the presidential elections, this move is seen as part of the efforts to ensure the party.
The ruling VMRO-DPMNE, the ruling party, selected Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski as president.
In terms of the public vote, the situation seems to be changed in the 2002 parliamentary elections.
Today, the ruling party has reflected a strong popular influence in 2002, while the opposition is facing the sake of low votes.
However, the ruling party has the ruling VMRO-DPMNE, which won 23 per cent of the people's confidence. In 2002, the party is the ruling Social Democrats, which is only 8 per cent of the voters.
Political analysts say the incident is normal.
"The votes in the election are very natural," said political analyst Mernjak Biljic. "The votes in the elections are very natural, with the party hope that economic problems will be resolved."

He says the government will lose a loan if it is not met during the election campaign.
Although the SDSM's reduction is the same time, the government did not fulfil the expectations of citizens' economic improvement and investments in 2002.
Beerinska's Social Democrats will show how much effectively will be affected on the path of political territory.
The latest development of the most recent developments has been reflected in the Union's coalition after the local elections in 2000.
Earlier, the victory won victory in 2002 and then backed Branko Crvenkovski, who was candidate for president in 2004.
Macedonia's second largest party party, Liberal Democrats, has passed the process of restructuring.
The party's leader and former Mayor Risto Penov resigned his post to Skopje's post.
After Penov's resignation, former Defence Minister Jovan Manaskovic was resigned.
Manaskovic, who dismissed the group after the Liberal Democrats, said his party faces the threat to the SDSM.
The Liberal Democrats are planning to enter the local elections in 2009.
Party: The Ethnic Affairs Reforms No Surrender in Serbia
The Alliance of Vojvodina Hungary, the most popular ethnic minority party in Serbia, urges the international community to pressure on discrimination.
The first part of two divisions.
By Dusan Kosanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 27 / 01 / 04
According to the recent census, ethnic minorities have created more than 30 per cent of Serbia's population, but none of the Serb spending communities will not be represented in the new parliament.
The House Code, which is the main two main ethnic minority parties in Serbia, has been creating 5 per cent threshold in the 28 December parliamentary elections.
The Serbian electoral law is considered insufficient unacceptable to all ethnic groups through "poor discrimination".
The pro-European parties in parliament have pledged to change the law, saying they are not only involved in the routes, not only Serbs.
However, the leader of the Vojvodina Hungarian Alliance (SVM), Jozatifa, claims that these lawmakers will not be seen as representative of the truth differences.
It is unemployment in the party's parties.
Some refused to attend the House Code to join the CoE, but also signed their forces "with Belgrade parties".
One is the Democratic Party, which has two lawmakers from Bosniaks in support.
According to Iza, the December elections were "three steps" with Belgrade's "three steps", as a result of the ultranationalist Radical Party's progress towards Europe.
He also voiced disappointment that the House Code was disappointed by the poor results in central Serbia and Belgrade.
In the northern town of Vojvodina, the party ranked second.
"For years, the tolerance of tolerance and the ideas will strengthen the ideas that will be affected in the region, which will be affected by nationalist ruling Vvodina Vojvodina," he said.
The SVM sent a letter to international organisations, warning that the new political situation could be a negative attitude towards minorities.
The Radical Party's election victory was enough to avoid a series of incidents in Vojvodina during the celebrations of the election victory, the SVM chief said.
The SVM urged the international community to implement amendments to the election law and to implement the proposed changes proposed by the Human Rights law.
The party believes the changes will create the conditions of a multiethnic society.
"If Serbia accepts us, we are unacceptable, we are unacceptable as Serbia's appointment," the letter said.

"There are two options: a parallel future and a comprehensive future," Ashdown said. "The only future for the EU will submit BiH in accordance, security and stability.
We can choose this option.
However, we have a broad option, but we can choose it. "
The EU is expected to allow BiH to decide on whether to allow talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement, which is considered the first step towards eventual membership in the Union.
Brussels will soon be able to negotiate negotiations if BiH politicians agree on a successful restructuring agreement on a restructuring restructuring of EU principles, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said.
The three principles have been taken by the European Commission (EC) are under state level: special police powers, but the operational efficiency of local level police areas are determined, according to operational efficiency, and the removal of political interference.
The main goal is to facilitate the police's fight against crime, Ashdown said.
"If these principles are a variety of ways to fulfil them, it is very good way to fulfil them," he said. "If the RS is going to win a broad consensus.
In RS, the concerns that police reform would be a step forward to the entity's secular step, Ashdown stressed that such a agenda is not a agenda.
"There is no plan to bring constitutional reform issues to the agenda," Ashdown said. "There is no attack on RS.
"There is no attempt to secure the entities," he said, adding that this does not mean the RS interior ministry.
The extradition, Ashdown said, will bring better equipment equipment for the fight against crime and the same job for the same job.
He said that only 79 per cent of respondents in RS want to join the EU, adding that 51 per cent of respondents want BiH to join the EU, while 51 per cent of respondents said it would support the establishment of a state-level police service that would bring the country into Europe.
"It is more effective than 59 per cent of RS citizens," he said, adding that "the participants should be more effective than the citizens of the police", 77 per cent ", according to Ashdown.
Speaking to reporters at the end, RS Prime Minister Pero Buhjlovic told reporters that a compromise solution is possible to find a compromise solution to police reform if RS and BiH constitution.

The 27-nation bloc's foreign ministers reiterated their support for Western Balkan countries' EU bid Monday (July 27th), promising Albania's membership application as soon as possible.
Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said that the EU hopes "to make a new momentum in the Western Balkans".
Bildt's remarks came after foreign ministers decided to send Iceland to the European Commission (EC) to accept the official application for the bloc's membership application.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Monday that about 300,000 people are a member of the European Economic Sahin population, which means that the country's laws are in charge of the EU law.
However, he also noted, the application of the application of the application of the application of Iceland would "tackle the rules".
Analysts believe that Brussels is likely to launch its accession talks next year if the EC has made a positive assessment on Iceland's application.
According to this year, the country can join the bloc in the second half of 2011.
Several EU foreign ministers, including France's Bernard Kouchner and Palestinian Alexander Alexander Stubu, cited Iceland's lack of dealing with economic pressure following last year.
"Iceland will be a political framework," Kouchner said at a press conference in Brussels.
Analysts warned that the new leading progress towards the bloc could lead to some EU prospects in the Balkans.
For example, Croatia's accession talks have been blocked since the end of this year due to the border dispute between Slovenia and Slovenia since December.
Macedonia is awaiting to receive a date for opening talks with Brussels since December 2005.
Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis said on Monday that Athens would continue to block Skopje's accession talks, resolving the long-standing name dispute between the two countries.
The stage of reforms has been blocking Bosnia and Herzegovina's progress towards European integration.
Serbia must hand over former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic to The Hague war crimes tribunal in order to make progress towards membership.
Montenegro submitted its official application for EU membership in December, and has been adopted to be drawn to the EC in April.
He submitted his country's official application during a visit to Pray.
The EU has warned that it would not accept it if the June 28th parliamentary elections in Albania are fair and free.

The ethnic minorities in Albania -- Macedonians, Greeks, Serbs, Serbs, Serbs, Ukrains, Roma and Egyptians -- announced last week that the Albanian Constitutional Court's decision to sovereignty "sovereignty" in Strasbourg will open the European Court in Strasbourg.
The court said there is no need to be "direct" to ensure the census of the Albanian population to recognise the population.
The dispute is particularly a dispute, including Greeks and Mala Prespa region, as well as the "direct" "of the immigration" in the southern Albania, including formal minorities.
The Albanian court's decision came after several local judges, as well as local judges, as well as the main factor in October's census and identity's census, the Citizens and Sabia Alliance.
"A part of the Greek minority will require special status, documentation, parliament or a government," said Albanian Deputy Justice Council Vice President Kreshnik Spahiu.
The Council is chairman of President Bamir Topi to monitor the judiciary.
The judges argue that the government has been discriminated with discrimination that citizens are discriminated from the constitution.
Some sent letters before the court's decision to reveal the court's decision in Strasbourg.
"The most recognised situation in the Mala Prespa region is now known for Macedonian minority.
"We are demanding Albanian authorities to allow the freedom of movement for all Macedonians in Mala Prespa, not only in Mala Prespa," he said.
"Greeks, who are recognised as minority in the southern part of the country, will no longer be satisfied as Greeks.
This is even more time for Serbs, Serbs and Montenegro, "he added.
"The situation is very concerned for us.
"Our politicians in all stages, minority media, intellectuals and our country should not allow the implementation of Tirana's plan to implement us," he said.
The court's decision came only a few weeks after Albanian politicians voiced protests about their failure to make the ethnic census in the census.
Vangel Dule, representative of the Human Rights Party representing the Greek minority, condemned the demands of representatives of the international community in Tirana to review dialogue and co-operation.
"The decision of the constitutional court's decision will continue in Strasbourg, because the Republic of Albania's constitutional constitution is disappointed," Dule said at a meeting of minority representatives in Korca.
At the meeting, minority representatives signed a joint declaration that they recognise the results of the October census.
The census is sparked and insufficient level, the representatives said.
"We have responded to the boycott of a minority member, and was not respected.
The census law is not aimed at reflecting the real number of minorities, but that shows that the mechanism's details continue to continue the details of the discrimination policy, "he said.
In the street, more than <unk> 1,000 fees for Albanian intellectuals are envisions if they do not enter.
Such actions, the Albanian state continues to show its policy as a multiethnic and multiethnic country, which has been ethnic, "he said.
The judges called for the government to launch a real dialogue and respect the rights of the rights based on international standards.
In early October, Albanian Foreign Minister Edmond Haxasto met with Macedonian counterpart Nikola Popovski, saying the census of the census will reflect the truth of the census, reflecting the truth of the population census and that all minorities will be allowed to reflect everything.
"The slow implementation of the census is important for the implementation of the process to ensure the international and European legal framework," Macedonian Foreign Ministry spokesman Borce Stamov told SETimes.
"What is necessary to meet international standards" is full and sustainable respect and not to be used ", Stamov said.

Nearly 22 years after the end of communism in Bulgaria, the country's parliament adopted a declaration last week that the country's parliament condemned its policy concerning ethnic Turks in the second half of 1980.
The statement, launched by Todor Jivkov's retail regime in 1984, ended in 1989, when more than 360 Turkish villages were forced to leave their homes to neighbouring Turkey.
As part of this policy, the communist authorities in the country tried to change the "traditional Bulgarian Muslims" with the ethnic Turkish-Arab emissions.
The declaration proposed by former Prime Minister Ivan Kostov's meeting was adopted by the Democrats for Bulgaria (DSB) for Bulgaria (DSB) on 11 January, with support of 115 lawmakers participated in the session.
"We are definitely condemned the process of the immunity process against Muslim minority in the Republic of Bulgaria," the document said. "We are definitely condemned that more than 360 Turkish citizens live in the Republic of Bulgaria."
The statement also called for the country's prosecutors and judicial authorities to ensure the results of the cases against the shooting of the campaign.
The perpetrators of crimes against ethnic Turks in one of Bulgaria's most complex history of the modern history of the modern history, the DSB also insisted.
The document's cabinet was welcomed by Turkish experts and government experts in Ankara, as well as an obstacle.
Welcoming Bulgaria's decision, the Turkish Foreign Ministry welcomed Sofia's "dealing with many people", urging Sofia to hand their responsibility for the campaign to justice and take steps "to bring the destruction of the border".
Muzel Kutlafi, an expert at the International Strategic Research Council (USAK) in Ankara, said the declaration was "an important step" that Bulgaria has made in the past and further boost relations with Turkey.
"Bulgaria has [created] an opportunity to create a true environment," he told SETimes. "Bulgaria has won a significant reflection by Turkey by a free intelligence."
Citing Bulgaria to "continue to continue this trend", Kutlam also believes the Balkan country's "need to take steps in education in Turkish-language language".
Science Simir, who serves as Turkey's ambassador to Tirana between 1985-1987 and 1987, reflected the importance of the declaration.
"The decision of the Bulgarian National Assembly has nothing in the bridge, because Bulgaria does not accept the" minority ", which is in line with international law and state institutions," he told SETimes.
"Bulgaria, nor time," will be able to recognise the minority rights "in the framework of the country, and then then, the decisions and free intelligence of these decisions from the Paris."
Bulgaria's Hellenki Committee President Krassimir Kanev told SETimes that the campaign in late 1980 "has been convinced", despite the call for the justice, the justice justice is facing ".
Bulgarian experts, however, see the parliament's move as a positive step.
Harlan Aleksandrov, a scientist at the University of Bulgaria, said that the parliament should create "equipment" on members of the ethnic Turkish community in the country.
"Some of these people are still reminded the violence, while others were discovered by what others," Aleksandrov told SETimes.
Aleksandar Aleksandrov told SETimes that Turks should now feel "less advantage against the manipulation of manipulation".
The Movement of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (HHR) has warned that Bulgarians could launch a second "second" Up Process against ethnic Turks.
The party was established in 1990 to represent the interests of ethnic Turkish minority.
The past 20 years was represented in all parliament, and three coalition governments have been among the three coalition government since 1992.
The former Vice President Dal Dal, who was sentenced to three years in prison in the 1980s, said he supports the declaration, but stressed that it should be acceptable "very soon before".
"Gecic is the power," Dal told SETimes Tuesday, adding that the campaign "should be done in the early 1990s," because of the campaign's imposes "to be removed from justice.

Albanians, who make up the majority of Kosovo's majority population, have different meetings about how Kosovo will be the final status.
Some are confident that Kosovo will be a sovereign state that is recognised in the international area, while others are determined to decide how to happen or time.
However, everyone agrees: the province will not remain under the Serb authority.
"I don't know that there will be no independence, but I am confident that Kosovo is in the right way," says Afrim Kabashi, an economist at the University of Pristina, adding that the union is very important.
"I don't say they are unacceptable, but they should be closely close to each other," he said.
Ard Matoshi, a student at the same school, urges Kosovo's people to be resolved while the status process is resolved.
"I think that the process has been delayed, but I think that we don't think that there is no reason for what progress has been made in Kosovo in recent years, and I think that we don't think that we have been made."
According to Zivadin Gashi, a journalist who worked at the daily daily Zeri, the current Contact Group members have been unlikely to stay and disagreements.
Gashi says the delays are "the main factor that has created" suspects and uncertainty ".
"The death of Kosovo is returning to the EU.
I believe that we will meet all criteria for joining the Union in the coming years, "he said.
Burim Ramadani, a University of Pristina, thinks that the status process will be only a result of the outcome.
"We have a long negotiating and transition process.
The status issue will be fully dependent on the political will of the public, and this is no doubt that everyone can know that Kosovo's independence, "he said.
Ramadani is confident that Kosovo will be a "partnership state" to represent the interests of minority communities and targets.
"The partnership partnership is to guarantee the majority of minorities, the constitutional draft system, the constitutional draft election system, the constitution election system, particularly Kosovo Serbs," he said.
However, the status quo will not be a chance of long-term problems that are expected to expect the province.
"The Serbs will face real problems," Ramadani said.
"Corruption and organised crime could be the most dangerous for the next phase of status," he said.
Bekim Ukaj, a lawyer of law student Bekim Ukaj, believes that a good justice system and economic growth is key to Kosovo.
"These are the money for a better functioning state," he said.
Some are particularly unemployment, especially unemployed about the future of the situation.
Since 1999, Ismail Sumi says he is confident that independence and economic development.
"The leaders have enough jobs and promised that the integration process will help us not work abroad, not only in Kosovo," he said.
He wants his family to work abroad and work abroad.
"There are five children, five children, and we don't find a lot of time," he said.
Kosovo has been a province, which has been southern Serbia, which has been run by the UN since 1999.
Serbia's ominal sovereignty is recognised by the international community, but the Serbian administration is not in the bridge.
The dialogue has been managed by UNMIK and the local Intelligence Board, while the security administration provides the KFOR Force of Kosovo (KFOR).

Greek authorities hope that the other national treasure and ancient treasures -- including the Parthenon's Elgin Merkel -- will be extradited.
A two-week ago, a UN General Assembly adopted a resolution on Greece's cultural architecture of cultural heritage or income.

"The same way to help the country return to the people of the ancient arms and trafficking."
The rhetoric and money is equally equal to a organised crime exercise. "

Kosovo analysts say 2012 is important for the high-level representation of Kosovo and neighbours in the first weeks, but concerns about the obstacles to the future in the future.
Although it has been approved on the patriarch with Macedonia, Montenegro has yet to do so.
Kosovo will prepare a border monitoring in 2012, and that it is confident that it would not reflect relations between Kosovo and Macedonia.
"I don't want Macedonia to see a example of example that both countries will be able to live the problem.
However, I fear that some groups in Montenegro can use the process of understanding political reasons, "he said.
He added that the process of the huge season in Montenegro is more difficult because of interethnic issues.
"We see the removal of the Montenegrin constitution and the judges of Albanians in Montenegro are in a process of a high-level management agenda," Hasani said.
"Macedonia must be taken into account for the example of the Macedonian example that the existing problems are in Montenegro, and not an obstacle to resolve the existing issues," he said.
Kosovo free movement commentator Niklum Sadiku, a Kosovo free commentator at the Farker newspapers, told SETimes that co-operation between Kosovo, Macedonia and Montenegro should be improved.
"The existing border crossings, which has been in decades due to economic and religious relations, should be a chance of three governments," he said.
Sadiku says practical issues that facilitate the daily life should be discussed.
"The establishment of free trade zone will attract more investments in the economy.
Many people living in the areas in the border are leaving their power for a better life because of the lack of business and economic development. "
Gashi said that the border co-operation should be used better than EU funds.
"The goal of such projects is to bring the same level of the countries in the EU to join the EU, but I think it is a long-term impact on the population of these projects in the border areas," Gashi said.

The Croatian Citizens Association warned that new taxes will be negative on the economy.
"The society is very important for us to reduce the amounts of tax and the state administration.
Therefore, we welcome any reforms, because we are the only way to do our economy, "he said.
In both areas, consumers think the austerity measures are going to go.
"The consumers and consumers are reflecting all the principles of tax changes," the 34-year-old retail worker Goran Masonicic told SETimes.
In Croatia, I do not think that there is no single worker who think that this year will live more worse than last year.
They are working on prices and taxes, and we know that all will pay. "
The government promised that the population will not be "none" in the revenues -- pensions and social aid -- will not be "none's tax on the basic food.

As the EU wants to end visa restrictions for Western Balkan countries, Greece has a special position in discussions.
The country is the only country that Slovenia has full membership in the Schengen Charter, which is improving its role in the region.
Government officials say they are committed to the process.
"Greece has come from the Western Balkan countries to liberalise the visa regime that can travel to European countries," Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis said after talks with Serbian counterpart Vuk Jeremic in May.
However, some worry about the benefits of open borders, while some are concerned about the economic immigration.
In recent years, Greece has been accepted by more than 2 million foreign workers.
These workers have become part of the economy, but changed the country's social and cultural heritage.
Greeks, who reminded the time they are more time, have already started to work with such changes.
Moreover, many are responsible for the increase in organised crime.
Critics argue that the reduction of border restrictions could be an obstacle to smuggling networks operating in the Balkans.
Although Greek-run visa obstacles are meant to remove restrictions under control of the economic movement.
For example, legal immigrants continue to remain foreign as a foreign exercise.
At the same time, authorities are taking steps to make visitors more difficult for visitors.
Last year, the country removed visa fee for Serbs and said it would submit other countries that have met with the provisions of the Schengen facility.
Greece currently envisions visas for Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey.
Bulgarian, Croatian and Romanian citizens can be visa-free to the country.
During his meeting with Jeremic, Bakoyannis described Serbia as a "part of the European family".
Greece is ready to accept a "very Serbian friendly tourists", he said.
Bakoyannis also backed Albania's efforts to meet the Schengen criteria.
"We support Albania's visa liberalisation process as a very important process for improving interethnic relations between the Western Balkan countries," he said.
Macedonia, meanwhile, is awaiting to see the name dispute between neighbouring countries to see a factor for decades.
The European Commission confirmed that Skopje has welcomed the requirements for visa-free travel.
In the past, Athens said his position on the visa regime would depend on the name issue.
However, Greek Ambassador to Greece Aleksandra Papadinou told A1 TV on 11 May that his country supports Macedonia's accession to the Schengen ".
Papadoniou did not propose a specific conditions.
According to Macedonian Deputy Prime Minister Ivica Bocevski, Greece has already threatened to block Macedonia's NATO membership and threatened to block Macedonia's EU membership.
Do you think a new momentum in Macedonia's name talks
At a OSCE meeting in Corfu, Greece and Macedonia will have an opportunity for a meeting among foreign ministers and UN envoy Matthew Nimetz says the time is time to boost progress.
However, serious obstacles remain.

UN mediator Matthew Nimetz will visit Skopje and Athens on July 9th, 6-9 July to find a solution to resolving the long-standing name dispute between Greece and the Republic of Macedonia.
The two sides remain in Ceneva this week after the talks on four months of immunity.
Nimetz said the debate is a preparation for talks in the coming months, and there is no new proposal.
However, he said, both countries are "willing to comment and find a solution". "It is a good time to improve the negotiating process."
Macedonian Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki said on Thursday (June 25th) that a new momentum is likely.
Speaking at a press conference with visiting Slovenian Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajcak, Milososki said the OSCE ministers could create an opportunity to launch dialogue.
The foreign minister said he was "a new dynamic and rural".
The country's prime minister, Nikola Gruevski, said that "workers" have been transferred to positive direction. "
Despite the optimism, however, the basic dispute remains.
Greece says an unacceptable name should be a geography of geography, such as "northern" and use of international areas.
He argues, however, that the countries have signalled their "Republic of Macedonia" and should continue to do so.
"The free constitutional name should not be based on countries that are not recognised by our countries, which are 120," said Macedonian negotiator Zoran Jolevski.
He added that any agreement should be disappointed in the Macedonian constitution if any national identity is honoured.
Milososki rejected the geographical idea as unnecessary.
A deal reached by the negotiating chapter should be held in the referendum, Gruevski said.
Meanwhile, Greece continues to continue charges of continuing to sustain its neighbourhood and to show full dependence on resolving the problem.
Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis said authorities in Skopje are waiting "a different political approach to a acceptable solution to both sides".
He confirmed that the Macedonian government has requested a meeting between Milososki and Milososki at the OSCE meeting in Corfu.

At a meeting of the Council of Europe (PACE) at the end of September, the Council of Europe (PACE) adopted a resolution urging BiH institutions to remove the constitutional changes to BiH's institutions, removing the entity level and strengthen state institutions.
The resolution also calls for the removal of all details in the country's constitution.
Another entity votes that BiH's two separate administrative entities -- the Federation of BiH and Republika Srpska -- passed the Dayton Peace Agreement with the 1992-1995 war in BiH.
Some observers say the vote is clear to prevent parliamentary decisions to block the parliament decisions.
The Dayton Agreement continues to become a constitution.
The decision was due to a report by the PACE's BiH report, Finnish Kimimmo Sassassi and Turkish Muslim Cavaoglu.
Sassi and Cavuoglu claimed that the entity's survival in BiH has been blocking the reforms, blocking the entity's reforms and undermining state institutions.
This report and the verdict were welcomed by the Bosnian Assembly -- Milica Markovic and Ivanic-Ivanic-Ivanic-Ivanic-.
Parliament requested the verdict of the verdict to the destruction of three parts: the RS National Assembly's decision to remove the right to the right of his own woman, and accused the people of the RS's decision to punish the state level institutions.
However, PACE lawmakers rejected the demands.
Earlier days before the CoE decision, Haris Silajdzic, a Bosnian Muslim member of the BiH presidency, held a speech at the PACE meeting in Strasbourg, France.
In his speech, Silajdzic criticised the vote, saying it is a major obstacle to the parliament's decision mechanism and blocked BiH's progress towards EU membership.
"The Dayton constitution is a major major reform" that could jeopardise peace and stability in BiH and the region.
RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said RS representatives will not accept the removal of a number of votes. "It would mean that" mean institutional mechanisms that removed the Dayton Peace Accords, which protects the experience in BiH. "
Although the CoE's decision depends on equal, the CoE must meet all obligations to end Bosnia and Herzegovina to end Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Although the country is a CoE member in 2002, it is not able to fulfil its conditions for membership in the history.

The delegations representing Belgrade and Pristina agreed on Monday (November 21st) to agree with university diplomats' recognition.
The EU confirmed that "the two sides agreed on July 2nd to accept a deal" on the European University of Europe's diplomats in both sides "to accept their diplomats from the universities" to be used by others of education and public employment.
Dukagjin Pupovci, director of the Kosovo Centre for Education, said Kosovo will not be able to get more benefit from this agreement, but that other Serb citizens who have learned in Presevo Vado and Kosovo will benefit the benefit.
"However, it is linked to the Serbian entity: how much serious is in this issue and will not accept diplomats after the European universities Union," he told SETimes.
At the agenda of talks in Brussels, the sides include other issues such as Pristina's representation of regional assembly, the population administration and the transition border management between Kosovo and Serbia.
These technical talks were suspended on September 27th after conflict between Serbs and KFOR troops in northern Kosovo.
Therefore, Belgrade and Kosovo Serbs have said it is unacceptable to the participation of the Kosovo customs officers in the north, saying it was unacceptable to protest protests.
Meanwhile, dialogue with Pristina was a condition for Belgrade on 9 December, when the EU Council decides that it will not be given to Belgrade's EU candidate status.
After talks in Brussels, Borislav Stefanovic, head of the Belgrade delegation's delegation in Brussels, said his delegation is doing everything to reach an agreement, but that does not know that Serbia is not able to capture EU candidacy.
"In all, there is a long time because of the candidacy or last application, but because these problems have long been resolved, and we have to solve everything in northern Kosovo and Metohija, and we have to do everything," Stefanovic said.
He added that Pristina insists on reflecting Kosovo's state situation, and Serbia has not reached another solution because it does not reflect it.
Edita Tahiri, head of the Kosovo delegation, told media that deeper differences between Pristina and Belgrade continue to continue.
"I can say that this tournament we can say that we have closed with a concrete agreement that should be made, and that we have not accepted any way to accept the state border with Pristina," Stefanovic said.
Predrag Simic, a professor of Political Sciences at the Faculty of Political Sciences, told SETimes that the problems in Kosovo are very complex and that it has brought to a short border.

"It is a risk of work to work with the battle, both negotiators and relations between Belgrade and Pristina," he said.
However, the opposition in Serbia is using negotiations, negotiations, European officials to condemn Kosovo's independence.
"If the status qualifications are sparked, it will not mean any meaning for the country's economic and other development.
He will not be able to do everything.
The final outcome of the talks is that Serbia has come from Kosovo and Metohu from Kosovo and Metohu, "he said.

The Kosovo Parliament's new Independent Media Commission sparked some challenges. [Reuters]
Kosovo's Independent Media Commission (ICC) has almost functioned since December 2010, because some Council members are removed.
The four members are not enough personnel to work because of their two-year mandate and not the Kosovo Parliament's failure to replace them.
"We will reflect a key part of the sector because of the displaced displaced displaced displaced challenges," UNC administrative director Nail Krasniqi told SETimes.
There are a long-term mandate to be expected.
The List also includes new demands and competitive operators to technical and operators.
The commission has to serve as well as to reinforce the national digital transition strategy.
Tomomomir Halilaj is managing the creation of "Interpol" in Drenas / Gllogovac.
The team has offered specific documents, but expects to demand the demand.
Meanwhile, the law risks penalty for illegal operations.
"I expect the prospects to be approved by the approval of the approval," Halilaj told SETimes. "I have warned that the municipality's documentaries have been put under official office.
Sonra say they do not accept the chance because the main board is in the Council. "
The European Commission's 2011 Progress Report pointed out that the Kosovo Parliament has yet to complete its appointment, saying it has yet to complete the problem.
In early 2011, the ICC submitted a list of eight candidates for the first 17 public candidates, for the first quarter of the polls.
A special committee, representing all political parties, has submitted the list to vote with four people.
In July, however, parliament rejected the proposed candidates on the steps.
The committee was chairman of the ruling Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK), Berat Bukana.
Bukancea says the group has completed the part of his mandate.
"It is clear that the responsibility is in parliament."
The Ben special committee has been replaced as president, and that was the next president.
But I am not acceptable. "
Another committee member Alim Lama, the opposition Vetevendosje party, says the responsibility is a part of the responsibility, while the problem is worse at the government level.
"There is a victory to ensure independent institutions.
This is the job of the funds and there is no choice of members of the new ECC Council, "he said.
The Kosovo Parliament's pension is not new.
According to Bytyci, the parliamentary Council has not chosen seven members since 2008, but this is a direct mandate.
"The delays in parliament began in 2007 after the mandate of two Council members ended," Bytyci said.
Officials of the ICC say the verdict is more complex in the media, and the Council has been living in a time when the obligations have been hiding.
In addition, it continues to be great uncertainty about the final outcome.
"We have a strategic strategy, including other stock stock stock, but there is risks against the final minutes," Krasniqi said, adding that the organisation's revised reflects.

However, it is still unable to leave the job.
The share of the monument was detained since he shares an archaeological share.
Alic says that the same idea is to be the same idea, but there is no more visible to attract the family because of the overall circumstances.
"The children are fugitiving me.
The production donors said they are not pushed, but only a huge car from the war, "he said.
Despite the end of the war 16 years ago, the post-war season's (PTSD) is a more difficult increase in the number of people, experts say.
Many former soldiers have been victims, but they have applied to professional aid from the fear of discrimination.
"Many people are seeking to help the professional pharmaceutical pharmaceutical pharmaceutical pharmaceutical," Dragan Sajic, head of the Jedinvo magazine, told SETimes.
According to the World Health Organisation, 10% of BiH's population is in the issue with 400,000 people.
However, the details who helped the PTSD problem have claimed that the right option is four times.
Doctors say the PTSD is a normal response to the circumstances.
"The former soldiers do not give themselves, they don't give themselves to them, and many major challenges and the post-war health problems are pushing them.
"They want to address the destruction and want to solve them through social immunity against them and similar people," he said.
"If the PTSD is a human difference or immunity, it can be held under the process, but if there is no materials, it can do so," Dzuf Kulenovic, a Tuzla association from Stecak, told SETimes.
The PTSD is not only affected by war food, but also by persons who were hiding during the war during the war.
Obrad Bubic, a representative of the Association of Republika Srpska's Community Campionship, said that about 200 former public prisoners have applied to professional assistance in Banja Luka over the past two years.
"The PTSD family and this is a result of the society, which does not know that people do not know if they are not in the society, such as sports.
Instead of a bureau, many lives in a fear that will be able to calm the future, "he said.
NGOs and government organisations in BiH are working on reducing the results of the war in the entire region, offering to work on reducing the war's health care.
As BiH public companies are not enough to deal with the problems, the problem continues to be sparked.
The PTSD's salaries will give up the society, but says the society's victims will give them from them.
"There is no way to find the patients of the BiH authorities to find the patients of the BiH authorities, so that people affect their own deaths and offered the churches that must be brought to the society.
We have no longer have to have experts in the institutions that will be serious, "he said.
"We don't think that we are aware of our weapons, but we have to make our benefits.
We are willing to help similar organisations in the other side, because we've come to the atrocities, "he said.

In Albania, the political parties pledged to act in accordance with genocide equality and equal political representation, have not been pushing for calls for women's candidates in local elections on 8 May.
The total number of 768 candidates are only 17 per cent.
Over three years ago, political parties promised that candidates will convince 30 per cent of the candidates' electoral law.
"Unfortunately, there is a deeper phase between the political parties to increase the presence of women's presence in politics in politics," President Bamir Topi said at a meeting with the OSCE earlier this month.
"The political parties have yet to be free as a cultural behaviour, gender equality and equal representation.
"Unfortunately, there is no political climate that the candidates do not give the programme and values and values, but there is still confidence in women," he said.
"The current circumstances of gender equality of gender equality in the country needs to be done, and that is also important for all national and international partners."
Women's judges have different discussions about the reasons for women's lack of representation in politics.
"This situation is defined by political leaders, young people and minority participation in politics.
They are responsible.
"They don't feel equal for the island and men."
Fiorla Sandzak, co-ordinator of the UN National Programme Programme, has been charged with the electoral law that does not guarantee the parties and men.
"Statistics, women and young people are the biggest obstacle to enter politics, the largest obstacle to enter politics.
Women in Albania are not nominated in the elections, because they see their support by politicians.
"They have to block the details of the refugees to obtain important and right information from the party to fight mechanisms."
He adds that equal representation in the decision needs to have a long-term fight, and that the intervention should be very happy.
However, observers are not the same idea.
Elsa Ballahi, head of the Albanian Human Rights Group for Human Rights, argues that women are the largest climate.
"The big losses are come from the name of women.
Women do not know what is important, and they don't know how women should be reflected, especially in politics.
"They do not change their persons and learn them," Ballahi said.
"They continue to continue with women in the men's Tanklore culture.
Kadin is seeking to serve their children as part of this role as part of the role, exploitation and transfer children, "he said.
Albania demonstrates economic crisis
Albania's economy is not good and has started charges.

As other important economic indicators, consumer spending has been reduced. [Reuters]
The government has also agreed to accept a number of economic performances in the Albanian economy in the first quarter of 2012 after a slowdown in economic growth over the past two years.
According to INAT, inflation has confirmed that inflation has reached 0.6% in February, as well as the most serious boundaries in demand of consumers.
Special and public investments have been reduced.
The biggest recession has received construction and industrial sectors.
According to INAT, the consumption of Albanian citizens in the first two years has been reduced by imports in a number of categories and exports dropped 21%.
Voicing remittances, one of the main sources of Albania's economy showed a 9% reduction last year.
The government should accept the crisis before the crisis, says Selzim Cani, former head of the Central Bank of Albania.
"The government has not taken any measures and we are now taking the results of the consequences of the competencies and reactions," he told SETimes.
He predicts that this year will be more difficult.
"The debt is very high, and now has been achieved in limited borders," he said, adding that the debt levels of 2013 will be more likely to increase.
The debt levels have reached at about 60% of GDP.
Gierre Pipipi, director of the Institute for Research, is worried about the situation.
"The government, the largest investor in consumers and the country, has spent less spending less than 2010 and 2011, and the data that the country's crisis in the first months of 2012," he told SETimes.
However, Serhin Sehu, a member of the ruling Democratic Party, is closely different.
"There is a reason to remove tensions in the revenue," Shai, a member of parliament's Economic and Financial Committee, told SETimes, adding that the bill is a technological response to international crisis.
"The crisis is not only the factors in Albania.
Albania is affected only in the crisis, unemployment, and there is no reduction in economic growth, "he stressed.
In order to boost consumer consumption of the Central Bank, Lek's interest rates has decreased to 4.25%, but markets have been very difficult.
"Paris policy could be more efficient.
The Central Bank can be more efficient in the interest rates of 1% in the three months, "he said.
Sehu suggests that the state sector partner is "a state partner" to boost investments and employment.
Cani says institutions, public administration, infrastructure, infrastructure, capital capital and good management, as well as support for small and medium enterprises and agricultural enterprises.
The structural problems must be resolved, he says.
However, the manager of the innovation "may be reflected and unfortunately, but the problem of them would be growth".
The IMF aims to raise an economic growth of 0.7% in the region, or 0.5% in the region this year.
The Albanian government's estimates are more optimistic than 4.3%.

Mladic was short after a short time after UN prosecutors issued his first indictment against war crimes committed during the 1992-1995 conflict in BiH.
Mladic's 43-month siege of Sarajevo and allegedly committed genocide during the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, which was killed by 8,000 Muslim men and boys.
The churches say Mladic is hiding in Serbia, while authorities announced that it would pay 1m euros for information that would provide information to the arrest of the fugitive in recent years.
In a statement Tuesday, EUFOR said any person could receive the US award for 3.9 million euros in award for years ago.
Instead of full co-operation with the ICTY, including the arrest of war crimes suspects, is a key condition that Balkan countries hoping to be accepted by the 27-nation bloc.
The RS interior ministry's continued co-operation in efforts to justice, EUFOR praised members "their commitment" to the closure of professional professionals and their commitment to the closure of this case.
Raffi Gresov, a senior representative in BiH, voiced support Tuesday for Mladic's joint operation and the future efforts to arrest Mladic's arrest.
The Greikian, who has not to leave Mladic's failure to hand over the number of Serbian authorities, said he would not be "a more unprecedented case" to leave him for a officer.
Other war crimes suspect in the Balkan conflicts are still at large, former Croatian Serb leader Goran Hadzic.

Kosovo questions about question
The Ahtisaari proposal, which envisions supervised independence in Kosovo, has serious concerns that any further delays would be disappointed by Kosovo leaders to declare independence.

Last week, the EU called for further delay in the decision on Kosovo's status issue.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn warned on Wednesday (July 4th) that any success in Kosovo's status issue could pay for Russia or the United States.
Rehn's call came after EU security chief Javier Solana announced on Tuesday that Brussels wants to reach a compromise on the Kosovo issue as soon as possible.
The bloc has taken a new resolution based on the UN Security Council's plan, based on former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari's call for supervised independence.
At this point, all government in Kosovo can do so to make this job in a good parallel parallel.
They are likely to be completed by the end of May and continued to be accepted by the end of the Ahtisaari plan.
Kosovo's leaders have warned that they will go to their own ways if the Security Council does not decide.
The international community does not know how much effective in this issue.
Last month, US envoy for Kosovo Frank Wisner reiterated Washington's support for Kosovo's independence and said the final goal should be sovereignty.
However, Wisner said, "It is important to prepare for recognition of independence and a UN Security Council resolution that would open the door to NATO and the EU".
Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica says Serbia wants to continue talks between Belgrade and Pristina to decide on the status issue. [Getty Images]
A number of unilateral independence should be dangerous for the reasons.
Every time ago, the EU and the region will harm the city for years to promote regional stability and integration.
The Balkan countries need to say they need to say they want European and the United States to see the Ahtisaari plan.
In remarks, Security Council / the United States will appoint a joint fair responsibility for the future of the United States.
Serbia's situation is a greater role in the situation, if the Security Council is not unanimous among the EU and the United States.
Albania will be one of the first countries to open in Pristina, while the rest of the region will have to be more active.
For example, Montenegro will not be one of the countries that must continue to continue good relations with Serbia.
Macedonia's loss less than the loss, and the Albanian minority cannot be able to invest to import.
Bulgaria and Romania are leaving to stay at the end of their definition, as well as Montenegro.
Bosnia cannot be a situation in a situation that would be able to recognise Kosovo, and if it will do its stable impact on the benefit of instability chapter, Croatia and Slovenia could not be able to leave it.
British President Nicolas Sarkozy's proposal to support the Ahtisaari plan, while French President Nicolas Sarkozy's proposal to continue talks between Albanians and Serbs were unacceptable in Kosovo.
Belgrade will continue to postpone a final solution on Russia's assistance and delayed a final solution on Kosovo, in a bid to convince the country that will be a dangerous international institutional.
As a result, Belgrade's diplomacy is also targeting problems with EU member states that could live with unilateral discrimination of the Security Council -- Slovakia, South Africa and English -- as a result of Kosovo's separation.
Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica has insisted that Belgrade will not demand the talks with Pristina, but would require that the negotiations should not have the consequences of borders or successful results.
Belgrade also called for a new international mediator.
Belgrade will also want to seek its position in Kosovo, particularly in the north of relations with Pristina.
The legal problem, however, is that only 130,000 Serbs remain in the north, where only 40,000 Serbs remain in the north of Kosovo, the rest of the Albanian population.
Serbia wants to do everything to invest in Kosovo and ensure a major presence in the province's institutions in the province, Minister for Kosovo and Metohija Slobodan Samardzic said.
If the foreign factors were discovered, the unilateral declaration of independence will not bring many benefits to Kosovo.
UNMIK will remain in the province, while the new EU mission will not begin.
The UN will not be able to win itself and will be divided within the EU.
The most important importance will face stability in the Balkans.

Now Turkish people are now seeking to elect the head of state, or decide whether it will decide on the parliament. The 70m population will not decide on the country's new president.
According to the law, members of parliament's electoral members must elect the president within 30 days.

The opposition Liberal Democrats, who backed the government's initiatives, won a single seat.
The DP can still have a majority in the Arandjelovac assembly if it has formed a coalition with the state level partners.
The bloc's parties, which has been created at the DP, can expect 21 seats, while the opposition could stop 20 seats.
"The election results in Arandjelovac voted in a pro-European government and shows that the parties that have support the ruling majority in the state level," the DP said.

"The most powerful political parties will be better for their talks with Arandjelac -- in Arandjelac -- and I think that the Serbian Progressive Party is in Serbia -- that is in Serbia.
They cannot't find ways to cover the way, "he said.
Nikolic said that the SNS will decide whether to negotiate with the ruling Democrats and not be able to negotiate with Arandjelac.
"We don't know that we have witnessed the actions, with the women," he said.
The Serbian Radical Party, a key parliament in the past, will not be represented in Arandjelovac's assembly.
Radicals hope that the removal in a polling station would allow them to allow 60% to 60% of the vote.
Dragan Todorovic, vice president of the party, told SETimes that the SNS is still a "blow and violation", which is still in charge of the law.
"Our leaders expect Vojislav Seselj to return to The Hague before the end of the year, this will strengthen the political position," Todorovic said.
The opposition has been signed to sign the public to call early elections since February.
Petar Stamatovic, a Belgrade pension, believes that the elections in Arandjelac is a chance of the reflection of the public's change in Serbia.
"The Progress Party is currently the strongest party in Serbia, and this should be proved by a general election," Stamatovic told SETimes.
Many people, such as Milica Zivkovic, do not participate.
"I believe that this government should be given a chance to complete its mandate until 2012.
I don't know that the elections will benefit from the reason. "
Tadic rejected all early elections.

Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia Says Bencies
Retired retirement salaries in Banja Luka are closely close to the reduction of pension salaries and obstruction. [AFP]
By Beth Kampschror for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 17 / 03 / 03
At the same time, I am not a foreign situation in Thessaloniki Trka, who is working with 83 US Districtions.
Trajka's mobile phone and electricity bills have been sufficient to buy money. The 72-year-old couple, the 72-year-old couple, is unable to buy money to buy the sale of this park, which is unable to buy the sale of the money, says Trka's couple.
"It's nothing that [everything] is not a magazine or five," said Trak, who was in Sarajevo's reaction at the Brezka court.
One of the stories' literature has been written and helped him him to sell him.
It is the main factor that is abroad.
"We are not only only in the event, but also all the pension and delegations in the north.
"There is no money for some of us to take place," he said.
Trajka's problems are not only in the court, but also in neighbouring Serbia-Montenegro and Croatia's pensions.
They expect Yugoslavia to reflect themselves.
But Yugoslavia has made part of a day.
The pensions have already been the citizens of the new countries who live with the population and challenges.
According to Zoran Anusic, a retired pension expert at the World Bank in Zagreb, the retired pension reform has been a better position since Croatia launched in 1995.
Croatia is now believed to be arrested "unprecedented" in the pension system, Anusic said, adding that this country could create a example of other states.
The pensions are 235 Dolar for months.
That is not too much.
The surprise rate is on the path to the reform -- by companies who do not pay the pension rate to <unk> 90 per cent.
The approach of Croatia's pension reform points to a detailed details with Serbia. The pension system of "unfortunately" in Serbia's pension system, Sonia Bucko, said.
"I don't have no law on the law, there is no judicial reform," he said.
The Serbs have to work in businesses, which are unemployment rate (40 per cent) in the country (40 per cent), unemployment rate, health or pension.
The average salary of pensions in Serbia was 110 Dolar on November 10th.
Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's retired retirement after the two years ago, but the ruling coalition government has been able to enter with many Milosevic's disagreements.
He says the situation has caused external elements to support Serbia's budget.
"This business [is] a job that the government is ready to do with the structure of this government."
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, there are two managers responsible for the retirement of the state, but for the retirement of the state.
The average average salaries in the Federation, which includes a better position in the Federation.
However, pensions in Republika Srpska (RS) can only get 66 Dolar.
Even though this summer amounts have been able to pay a time in time.
"The pension salaries [in Albania] were not low in Albania," the RS Association of Public Association President Rade Rade Rade Rade Rade Rasuli told Radio Free Europe in December.
Rakuli also noted that the average salaries in RS are only 35 per cent of the average salaries, but that is 50 per cent in Croatia and Serbia.
Bosnia and Herzegovina's Office of the High Representative, Kevin Sullivan, says the reduction of pension salaries in two managers in Bosnia and Herzegovina is due to reforms.
"No one is not allowed to get Ali from the Vest," Sullivan said. "The institutions have to establish more than half of the revenues of the IMF.
Sullivan also says the pension institutions are now to pay thousands of people who are unable to have no longer retired companies.
Nir industrial and mining companies have created a key part of Bosnia and Herzegovina's economy before the war between 1992 and 1995.
The companies, which are still under way, are selling their payments for pension funds.
At least 3.00 companies do not pay pension surprises, Federation Deputy Agriculture Minister Agim Mujic told Radio Radio B92.
It is the only protest that the pensions can be able to do for money abroad -- except for their families abroad abroad, which is now transformed in both administration units.
Jozo Lilisanic from the Federation Association, 70 per cent of the Federation's Association of Pensions, says the situation is unlikely to be negative.
"This situation is unrealistic because pensions are in a biological methods," Lilanic said, adding that "the pensions are not acceptable to the death of the pensions".
The situation with refugee returns is more complex.
Coko Klijkovic, who was discovered in the Reporter's Reporter, was retired after Serb officials from Sarajevo in 1992.
Federation officials returned to his house in 2001.
The pensions can be demanding the retirement of pension from other administration.
Indeed, the situation is a economic obstacle that will block the return of the situation.
The two are more young people can be able to leave the system or to go to other management area, because the pension of pension salaries in other management.
The International Crisis Group has created a proposal for the management of responsibility to resolve these issues to be resolved.
Therefore, pension pensions were aimed at retirement to their homes.
The responsibility for the removal of the state will be more efficient, more efficient, more efficient, and the surveys will be easily easily easily easily easily easily.
In more surprise, the salary could provide a few times more transformed to pensions such as Susce Trinka every month.
"Wood will be better.
However, there is no question or what will be good? "Tracka says.

Netat Special day, he did not go to many business travel to EU countries last year.
However, according to Ozana, this situation is not imposed to visa-free visas.

The 46-year-old project manager, who worked in the Black Sea firm, says he had to wait more than two months to wait for visa-free travel with European partners.
"The EU and Turkish governments need to leave the all political interests of all political interests.
"The citizens of Serbia, Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina can travel to Europe, while students who want to participate in fair rates or abroad, who want to join the fair rates or abroad to education abroad."
Turkish businessmen who are expected to wait for more than a decade in Europe's expectations.

According to Burgin, some groups such as students and researchers, such as students and researchers could be recognised and could be allowed to be allowed in the business.

Sejdiu reiterated the demands of independence and sovereignty.
"We believe that 2006 will be independence for Kosovo," Sejdiu said.

"The principles of the Contact Group should be resolved within 2006," he said.

Now Ahtisaari insists that the delay is not delayed, "Reuters quoted Ahtisaari as saying on Monday (9 October).
"The beginning point of our opponents with the Contact Group is resolved by the end of the year," Ahtisaari said.

Gordana Igriric, founder of the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN), says the needs to ensure the quality of independent journalism in the region will continue.
"We will live in BIRN," Igric told Southeast European Times.

We have been able to stay soon and we will repeat it, "he said.
Although the organisation has been working as a business business business, BIRN's work is being made by the sector that is supported by the public benefit of Roctors Brothers Fund and the Balkan Trade Democrats, such as Roctors Brothers Fund and Norway.
Igric said that there is no long-term support for the donors of the Balkan central NGO institutions, so that he and his colleagues are doing new barriers and money to get money.
One of the BIRN website is hoping to give up the bidders to be taken into a special division of genocide (genocide), and BIRN Regional hope that the team will be held by experts.
A survey published ten days of financing by 100% of donors, but Belgrade Insight Insight products are welcomed by 60% of the revenues.
Igric believes that the Belgrade daily "will be able to stay at the time when it comes to the economy".
A independent journalist in the Balkans is still in developing.
According to Freedom House, a "international organisation supported", Slovenia is the only country that is free in the region.
Other Balkan countries received a score of "free free free".

In 2008, he said, "all important optimism about press freedom in the Balkans is negative."
Igric insists that journalist quality's quality is not "innocent", but insists there is no complex.
"There are more serious players in the market.
Investors are coming from abroad, and they are offering better fee, "he said.

The men's singer Agon, who is the same idea.
"I don't have a better life in Kosovo.
As independence, the solution is not important, it is not very important for Albanians, "Ona says.

Herkes are not optimistic.
A other political scientific scientific scientific student Sami Kai concerns the international community's risk of a successful state that has not been implemented.

"The agreement envisions Croatia's agriculture sector that it will not be based on exports, but it will expand its market.
Therefore, Croatian producers are satisfied with the changes, "he said.

Prime Minister Lucas Papademos praised the second loan package of 130 billion euros from the EU-ECB Troika to complete the first bailout loan of 130 billion euros from the village of the EU-ECB Troika, but the second bailout package was more than the same austerity measures.
The unemployment rate is around 21% -- 48,000 young people -- and more than 111,000 jobs, while the short time is likely to be more bad.
Parliament has agreed to do more than 3.2 billion euros this year's budget by 3.2 billion euros, while pensions, health and defence spending will be spent to 400m euros.
These are the condition that the finance ministers of the Eurozone are trying to keep Greece on 21 February, saying they are trying to keep the 100-euro debt debt under a spokesperson for the region's fiscal bloc, which is supported by Special Secretary for Special Integration (PSI) agreement.
"The situation will be difficult and more difficult," Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said before the vote. "At the time, we need to work together with decisions on 21 February, we need to work together with a safe framework, reconciliation, work with a safe framework, reconciliation and banks."
"We have to do everything abroad.
We can build a new economic economy, but we can't have built the Greek territory, but if we don't have the Greek territory, "he said." After the 38 years of Turkish intervention, we have sent a letter to Cyprus, which is still divided in the divided island.

"I am confident that I am confident that we need to be able to do," Antoniou, who lives with a single piece in a single house, told SETimes.
He added that the former job has been able to stop the exercise. "I don't think how I don't think how I don't think it will be."
Papademos said that the money is a decision to do with the future of the money, but alternative is alternative and false.
Venizelos, who opposes Gelir and poverty taxes, said the deal would open the way for the PSI agreement and that it would provide benefits to the country in the long term.
"All measures abroad, unemployment, uncertainty and could lead to traffic situation," he said.
Nevertheless, Samaras said, "With this new loan agreement, I fear that the country's credibility to prevent the euro."
These operations were not affected, but the salaries of public sector products dropped by 30%.

However, the problem is considerable to think that the armed is in place.
Therefore this point, unemployment and salaries have been spent.
These are problems that will continue to meet, "he said.
Agrios Takakanos, director of the Economic and Industry Research Foundation in Athens, said that Greece is in the swimming of two churches, with a swimming bonds that have been sold by the process.
"This is a very exhibition that will deepen the crisis.
For these measures affect the revenue and salaries, GDP is estimated by 4.5%, as well as 4.5%, "he said.
However, "This is not a deal that must create a second loan, particularly positive impact on the debt," he added.
Papademos said the economy could be able to leave itself within 18 months, but the new growth ideas should not benefit.
Pantelis Kammas, a professor of economic professor at the Ioannina University, said Greece is a long way to overcome.
"The question of the bill is the recession of tax revenues," Kammas told SETimes, adding that consumers spending a 33m-euro drop in January to the figures in January of this year.
"It is the only way to promote reforms," Kammas said, as many Greek colleagues are unwilling to do in the structure of the government.
Ardex Afouououxheks, a British Institute for Political Studies in Athens, said the measures would be successful, and that the measures would lead to a high price of young people to see their salaries, especially if it comes to the minimum salaries, especially if it comes to the salaries of minimum salaries.

"All countries have been transferred: we will not be able to do so."

After Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia announced the conditions for joining a government coalition Wednesday, the chance of a pro-European government in Serbia was reflected by a pro-European government.

The ruling Democratic Party of Serbia continues to discuss the new government in Serbia, while the ruling Democratic Party of Serbia announced on Wednesday (January 31st) a series of conditions for Kosovo that would accept the country's next cabinet.
The DSS and New Serbia (NS) party sent a coalition partner in the January 21st parliamentary elections, insisting that the new government should respect the country's territorial integrity of the country's territorial integrity "must respect the country's territorial integrity".
The DSS presented the document Tuesday to President Boris Tadic, which is under consultations on establishing a new government coalition.
The DSS said two days after UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari's visit to Belgrade on Friday to submit a solution to the Kosovo status issue.
While the Ahtisaari plan has not been announced, it is widely expected to be part of the plan that would be part of a tender that would lead to the way for the state.
The fundamental proposal, which is still unchanged, is reportedly to recognise Kosovo as a sovereign state if they want to join key countries.
"Any country has decided to recognise Kosovo's independence (Kosovo) should not lead to serious results in relations with Serbia," Belgrade-based Beta news agency Beta quoted the DSS-NS plan as saying.
Ahtisaari's proposal reportedly will be allowed to apply for membership in Kosovo, such as the UN, the EU, the World Bank and the IMF.
"If any country or the international organisation accepts Kosovo and Metohija's independence, the Serbian government will condemn such a decision as a legal, disappointment, disappointment and unfair," the DSS-NS platform says.
NATO member states warn that this would lead to "serious diversification" between Serbia and the Alliance as an independent country, if any other country recognises Kosovo as an independent country.
Observers see this move by Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica's DSS party to reduce the chances of a pro-European coalition among democratic forces in the country.
The DSS-NS coalition won 47 seats, bringing third.
These results were the role in the formation of the new government.
The ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS), which is the largest voter votes, could unite the forces with Tadic's Democratic Party (DS).
The conditions that Kostunica's party is under way, are closing the SRS's position on Kosovo.
DS and former Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic's G17 Plus party said they are opposed against Kosovo's independence.
The only Serbian party, which has already backed Kosovo's independence, is the Liberal Democratic Party, led by former Deputy Prime Minister Cedomir Jovanovic.

Greece's banking institutions have been able to win a loan control control over private debt, while Greek houses are in the economic path.

According to official national statistics, 60 per cent of Greeks spend more than 30 per cent of their swimming, while loans and loans have been cited as a result of the incident. [AFP]
The outcome of Greek banks is unilateral, and loans remain at the number of credit care markets, despite increasing debt minister.
The banks are unfortunately unable to meet the necessary payments.
The statements that the total personal debt in Greece have made only a small story of GDP, but there is no clear figure about the number of banks in bankruptcy.
The private debt situation in Greece has reached the crisis.
The debts have been sold since 2000.
According to official national statistical statistics, only 10 per cent of Greek households are spending their revenues, while more than 30 per cent of the votes -- are slated by loans and loans.
Two loans of the ten loans have been rates, and only the amount of commercial payments.
About 15 per cent of the interest rates have been implemented for years.
Armed companies live the infrastructure.
The banks, who have been held to ensure that the debt has been held, are under pressure from banks to avoid their debt for their details.
If such peacekeepers do not end, the law is a right to take measures, such as the law, acceleration and co-operation with officers in the case of conflict.
There are 21 companies operating in this area, and the number are increasing.
The representation of the problem is in no information about banks' excessive debt situation.
The banks use the system of a joint Bazz and Kara List, which is only a quarter of all personal loan or credit cards, according to some estimates.
The List does not have information about the equipment of the equipment rates, which could lead to the highest concrete concrete interest rates.
Beysam List is only the new list of bridges and loans.
Therefore, one person who had a ID debt can receive a new loan from another banking.
Both cases are uneasy to be easy.
Teornesty, a Greek citizens could be able to receive loans or loans in each country.
It is unable to be almost here, but the average salary of the average citizens are facing a chance of the rise debt.

Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot communities will vote in separate referendum on the UN's reunification plan. [AFP]
Cyprus, which is described as a "homeless" in Mediterranean, will live on Saturday for the most critical agenda of the last 30 years.
The two-time referendum, which will be held in two parts of the divided island, will vote for a draft peace and reunification plan, as "Annan Plan", which is drafted by the UN.
The plan aims to resolve one of the most important international problems and ensure a united Cyprus's accession to the EU on 1 May.
The Annan Plan is still a 9,000 page document, which is still under discussion for several times.
Diplomatic diplomacy and international experts have not been able to reach a compromise on what the plan is in any side.
The EU plan presents uncertain uncertainty of legal framework.
For now, however, the only only problem will be concluded with the approval of the referendum.
The latest public polls suggest that the response of the north is possible.
A survey conducted by the Centre for Public Research and Education in northern Cyprus points out that 62 per cent of Turkish Cypriots are in the plan.
Meanwhile, a survey conducted from April 14th to 16 April, shows that the main objectives between Cyprus and the Greek Cypriots were less than every day.
Hayer votes were 71 per cent on April 14th, 62 per cent and 54 per cent on April 16th.
That trend, however, does not mean that the votes are increasing.
The number of Greek Cypriots supported Annan's plan on 14 April, 13 per cent, 13 per cent and 17 per cent, respectively.
At the same time, the number of unacceptable voters was living in a total of 17 per cent on April 14th.
Without the results, the referendum will affect international policy concerns.
The United States, the EU, Greece and Turkey are the best outcome of both sides.
That will become a member of both communities in Cyprus on 1 May.
This will remove a obstacle to Turkey's entry into the EU.
As the result of the referendum was confirmed, the Greek Cypriot side will be responsible for resolving the issue.
As a result, analysts say, only Turkey could lead to its embargo on the northern Cyprus issue, which is recognised as an independent state.
As the plan rejects the plan, the constituent referendum is expected to be removed after the two sides entered the EU on 1 May.
For Turkey, the worst scenario scenario plan would be acceptable by Greek Cypriots.
This could lead to both Turkey and northern Cyprus.

The privatisation process in Kosovo is based on the UNMIK administration, established by the Kosovo Trade Agency (KTC).
He continued with the Kosovo Privatisation Agency (KOD), established by lawmakers in 2008.
So far, 29 public companies have been privatised, including Ferrononistronistronistronistronistronistronistronistronistronistronistronistronistronistronistronistroneum in Glogovac.
"We believe that the privatisation process is the first step towards creating economic development, which means stable workers," KOD spokesman Yljoi Kaloi told SETimes.
Kaloi said that 578m euros in traffic funding from the KOD funding funds, while 5377m euros have come from social and public companies.
The remaining amount was given to sales through the management of goods.
Following privatisation, 20% stake in sale prices of the sale prices.
According to Kalohi, about 43.5m euros for workers were paid for workers, a total of 15m euros was discovered by the KTC, which was discovered by 28 million euros.

The most important question is the complex of the Trepce complex complex and the Brezovica tourist complex.
He noted that "political problems and the allegations of Serbia's claims have been reflected".
Rexhepi believes the government must sell a part of public companies to stop the state treasure for removing the state treasure, but to eliminate the state subsidies.
However, he said, sales must take steps to remove economic and social problems.
Kosovo's Institute for Integration, GAP, held a debate on the privatisation process in April, concluded that the legal climate of the legal climate and preparing new laws are an emergency issue.
However, participants stressed, the process should be transparent and not be transparent, such as laws in the Ahtisaari Paketwork.

"I think that such decisions will be very principal for the country, because of the three largest investors in the country, Philip Morris, BAT and Lukoil," he said.
Djelic and other economists say the proposed changes are operating through the government to attract foreign capital.
Experts say the reality of investors to attract investment in Serbia has changed, even if it is changed.

After several months of talks and discussions, Russian gas company Gazprom Industry Industry (NIS) received at least 500 million investments in Serbian firm to sell Serbia (NIS), at least 400m euros.
At the same day, Serbian President Boris Tadic and Russian counterpart Dmitry Medvedev signed political agreements on the reconstruction of the South Stream gas pipeline to Serbia and reconstruction of Serbia's Banja atski Dvor gas supply.
Although Serbia submitted the century agreement with Russia, the Serbian government has been divided over members of the Serbian government, due to a energy agreement with Russia.
Deputy Prime Minister and G17 Plus party leader Mladjan Dinkic said that Gazprom's oil company is closely closely under the real value of the oil company, saying the country can pay 800m euros.
Serbia's gas pipeline does not guarantee any secularism from its territory, Dinkic said, noting that his party is likely to withdraw from the government because of the disputes between the ruling coalition partners.
Tadic, however, said the decline in oil prices in the world has reduced the values of oil companies, including NIS.
He believes that the document signed with Russian counterpart, which is signed with Russian counterpart, is enough to ensure a natural gas pipeline that would change Serbia's economy.
Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said the South Stream gas pipeline "is very important for the two countries", as well as Serbia's strategic foreign investment point and that Serbia will turn into a centre in terms of regional gas supplies ".
According to the agreements, however, the natural gas pipeline will not be reached until September 2009.
Since the global economic crisis, some analysts are suspected that Russia could build the South Stream.
"It is very positive for the transition of the Middle gas pipeline will strengthen the country's sovereignty strategic position, but if Serbia will strengthen its debt to the oil sector," said French Ambassador to Belgrade Jean-Francois Terral.
Serbia expects gas prices to reduce Russia's South Stream pipeline if it is really really really really really really.
Belgrade is currently pushing significant amounts to the transport of gas from Hungary.
If the new pipeline passes from Serbia, the gas distributor could win money.

Observers claimed that the Turkish government wants to win the judicial process to win victory over the past staff.
After a week after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on armed forces in the armed forces, a compromise candidate would be appointed on Monday (August 9th), after a week after the weekend salary failed to reach an agreement on key issues.

According to military regulators, no officers who have been arrested on the arrest are not being detained.
At the same time, a second court dismissed the arrest of 102 officers, cancelled the detention of detention, and that move was seen as a constructive recommendation by many observers.
"These are manipulated," said Jusuf Klaf, a prominent political commentator.
"Do you think that a court is normal to arrest 102 people -- a military meeting -- and a military meeting -- the same day before the crisis is resolved," he told SETimes.
"I think this is a clear violation of judicial independence, and it is not acceptable," he said.
But Orhan Kemal Cengiz, a leading human rights lawyers, told SETimes that the meeting was a victory for the rule of law.
"All military officials have sent a message that if they are going to be involved in such plans, it would be a price.
It is very important that the defendants are not discovered, "he said.
Cengiz said he was not believed to believe the arrest on officers before the meeting was politically aimed at arrest.
However, he added, the demanders' requests are likely.
